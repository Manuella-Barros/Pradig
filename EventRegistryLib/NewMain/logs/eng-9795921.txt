Here's a breakdown of his National Guard record -- and of JD Vance's record as a Marine.\n\nKate Murphy\n\nUpdated August 9, 2024 at 2:38 AM\n\nRepublicans, including GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance, are scrutinizing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's military record now that he has been named Kamala Harris's running mate on the Democratic ticket.\n\nWalz, who served in the Army National Guard, and Vance, who served in the U.S. Marine Corps, are the first military veterans to be at the top of a major party ticket since John McCain in 2008.\n\nQuestions surrounding the timing of Walz's retirement before a possible deployment to Iraq were coupled with scrutiny of the characterization of his rank after retirement.\n\nWhat happened this week\n\nOn Wednesday, Vance resurfaced attacks made by a GOP gubernatorial opponent of Walz's in 2022 about Walz's decision to retire before his unit deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people he served with,\" Vance said.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign responded in a statement saying: \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nVance also laid into Walz for a comment he made, in an undated clip posted by the Harris-Walz campaign, about gun control when he said, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nWhile Walz was deployed during his time with the National Guard, he never served in combat, according to CNN.\n\n\"Well I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon you carried into war?\" Vance demanded, referring to the clip posted by the Harris-Walz campaign.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson replied, \"In [Walz's] 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nTim Walz's military service\n\nWalz served honorably in the National Guard for 24 years. He enlisted with the Nebraska National Guard on April 8, 1981 -- two days after his 17th birthday -- and served as an infantry senior sergeant and an administrative specialist, the Minnesota National Guard said in an email to Yahoo News.\n\nIn 1996, Walz transferred to serving in the Minnesota National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery. \"He held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant, and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion,\" Minnesota National Guard spokesperson Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9 told Yahoo News.\n\nOn Aug. 3, 2003, Walz deployed to Vicenza, Italy, to support Operation Enduring Freedom following the 9/11 attacks. \"The battalion supported security missions at various locations in Europe and Turkey,\" the Minnesota National Guard said. During that time, Walz did not engage in combat and returned to Minnesota in April 2004.\n\nIn January 2005, Walz filed to run for Congress, with paperwork indicating it was certified by the Federal Election Commission in February 2005.\n\nAccording to a March 2005 press release issued by Walz's office, the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced that month \"a possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard.\" Walz said at the time he was determined to stay in the congressional race despite a possible tour of duty in Iraq.\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,\" Walz is quoted as saying in the statement.\n\nThe impending 2005 Iraq deployment\n\nWalz retired from the Minnesota Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery on May 16, 2005. The Star Tribune said Walz left the guard in order to focus on his run for Congress.\n\nOn July 14, 2005, two months after Walz retired, his unit -- the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery -- was alerted that it would have to mobilize to Iraq, CBS News reported. The unit received an official mobilization order on Aug. 14 and the unit deployed to Iraq in October 2005.\n\nHowever, Walz has been accused of retiring from the National Guard in order to avoid being deployed to Iraq. When Walz ran for Minnesota governor in 2018, retired Command Sgt. Majs. Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr posted a letter on Facebook accusing Walz of having \"embellished\" his military career in the National Guard.\n\n\"Between the time the warning order was given and his 'retirement,' he told Brigade Command Sergeant Major not to worry, that he would be going on the mission. It appears that was a lie,\" the letter alleges. Fox News and the New York Post reported that Behrends replaced Walz as command sergeant major for the unit when it was deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\nBehrends and Herr also took issue with the way Walz was portraying himself as a retired command sergeant major, claiming he inflated his military credentials.\n\nWalz's retirement rank\n\nWhile Walz served as a command sergeant major, he reverted back to the rank of master sergeant when he retired.\n\n\"He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" the Minnesota National Guard told Yahoo News.\n\nPolitico reported that the Harris-Walz campaign had changed Walz's title from \"retired command sergeant major,\" which was inaccurate, to what now says he \"served as command sergeant major,\" which is accurate. Yahoo News reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign, which declined to comment.\n\nVance's military service\n\nThe Marine Corps confirmed to Yahoo News that Vance served for four years. Vance enlisted under \"James D. Hamel\" as a combat correspondent on Sept. 22, 2003, with his last date of service on Sept. 21, 2007.\n\nThe Corps also confirmed to Yahoo News that he was deployed to Iraq from August 2005 until February 2006.\n\nVance detailed his Iraq war deployment as a military journalist in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, describing how he would document marines and their work, escort the civilian press and do community outreach to meet with locals in \"unprotected Iraqi territory.\"\n\nVance told reporters at an event in Wisconsin on Wednesday, \"I served in a combat zone. I never said that I saw a firefight myself, but I've always told the truth about my Marine Corps service.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

Fox News and the New York Post reported that Behrends replaced Walz as command sergeant major for the unit when it was deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\nBehrends and Herr also took issue with the way Walz was portraying himself as a retired command sergeant major, claiming he inflated his military credentials.\n\nWalz's retirement rank\n\nWhile Walz served as a command sergeant major, he reverted back to the rank of master sergeant when he retired.\n\n\"He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" the Minnesota National Guard told Yahoo News.\n\nPolitico reported that the Harris-Walz campaign had changed Walz's title from \"retired command sergeant major,\" which was inaccurate, to what now says he \"served as command sergeant major,\" which is accurate. Yahoo News reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign, which declined to comment.\n\nVance's military service\n\nThe Marine Corps confirmed to Yahoo News that Vance served for four years. Vance enlisted under \"James D. Hamel\" as a combat correspondent on Sept. 22, 2003, with his last date of service on Sept. 21, 2007.\n\nThe Corps also confirmed to Yahoo News that he was deployed to Iraq from August 2005 until February 2006.\n\nVance detailed his Iraq war deployment as a military journalist in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, describing how he would document marines and their work, escort the civilian press and do community outreach to meet with locals in \"unprotected Iraqi territory.\"\n\nVance told reporters at an event in Wisconsin on Wednesday, \"I served in a combat zone. I never said that I saw a firefight myself, but I've always told the truth about my Marine Corps service.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kate_murphy@yahoo.com", "name": "Kate Murphy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

JD Vance and, at right, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are pictured.\n\nDonald Trump's running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance stepped up his attacks on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's portrayal of his military career, accusing him without evidence of ducking service in Iraq when he left the Army National Guard and ran for Congress in 2005.\n\nVance also accused Walz of falsely claiming he had served in a combat zone while the Democratic vice presidential nominee was in the Army National Guard.\n\nWhile Walz retired two months before his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq, the attacks on Walz's military record are part of the race from both parties to define the relatively unknown governor after he was tapped Tuesday as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate. Walz's 24-year military service is one of several facets of his background that appeal to voters that the Harris campaign is trying to reach with his selection - and that Republicans are trying to blunt by painting him as an out-of-touch liberal.\n\nWalz and Vance, the two VP candidates, are both military veterans, unlike their running mates.\n\nWalz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota's 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.\n\nAt a campaign stop in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance accused Walz of abandoning his unit before it deployed to Iraq in 2006.\n\n\"When the United State Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\" Vance said.\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Typically, service members need to submit papers several months before they can retire.\n\nA National Guard article on his unit's deployment states that it received alert orders to deploy to Iraq in July 2005, two months after Walz retired. The unit first mobilized in the fall of 2005 to Camp Shelby Mississippi to prepare for deployment, according to the unit's history, and then deployed in March 2006 for 22 months, which the Guard said was the longest continuous deployment of any military unit during US operations in Iraq.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005.\n\nIn his comments Wednesday, Vance also went after Walz for claiming he had served in combat, accusing the governor of being \"dishonest\" with his claims about his service.\n\n\"He said that we - and he was making a point about gun control - 'shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets,'\" Vance said of Walz.\n\nVance pointed to a video promoted by the Harris campaign on social media Tuesday, in which Walz is speaking about his decision to change his position and support an assault weapons ban after the Parkland shooting in 2018.\n\n\"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz said in the video.\n\nWalz deployed with the Minnesota National Guard in August 2003 to Vicenza, Italy, as part of support for the US war in Afghanistan, according to a Minnesota Guard spokesperson. He did not deploy to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service.\n\nIn a statement, a Harris campaign spokesperson said: \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nVance served four years in the Marine Corps as an enlisted combat correspondent, in public affairs, and deployed once to Iraq for roughly six months, according to his military record. He left service in September 2007 as a corporal.\n\nThis is not the first time there have been criticisms of Walz's military record. The Minnesota governor was criticized for his exit from the National Guard in 2022 by his Republican opponent, who held a press conference with veterans in the final stretch of the campaign, according to the Star Tribune.\n\nAt the time, Walz defended his service.\n\n\"We all do what we can. I'm proud I did 24 years,\" Walz told the Minnesota paper. \"I have an honorable record.\"\n\nThe criticisms of his military record from within the state during his gubernatorial campaigns also focused on his rank when he retired.\n\nWalz reached the rank of command master sergeant, but he officially retired as a master sergeant -- one rank below command sergeant major -- because \"he did not complete additional coursework at the US Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" according to the Guard.\n\nJoseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran who led the same battalion as Walz, told the Star Tribune in 2022 that Walz did nothing wrong when he left the Guard.\n\n\"He was a great soldier,\" Eustice said. \"When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\nCNN's Edward-Isaac Dovere and Natasha

Here's a breakdown of his National Guard record  --  and of JD Vance's record as a Marine.", "body": "Republicans, including GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance, are scrutinizing Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's military record now that he has been named Kamala Harris's running mate on the Democratic ticket.\n\nWalz, who served in the Army National Guard, and Vance, who served in the U.S. Marine Corps, are the first military veterans to be at the top of a major party ticket since John McCain in 2008.\n\nQuestions surrounding the timing of Walz's retirement before a possible deployment to Iraq were coupled with scrutiny of the characterization of his rank after retirement.\n\nOn Wednesday, Vance resurfaced attacks made by a GOP gubernatorial opponent of Walz's in 2022 about Walz's decision to retire before his unit deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people he served with,\" Vance said.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign responded in a statement saying: \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nVance also laid into Walz for a comment he made, in an undated clip posted by the Harris-Walz campaign, about gun control when he said, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nWhile Walz was deployed during his time with the National Guard, he never served in combat, according to CNN.\n\n\"Well I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon you carried into war?\" Vance demanded, referring to the clip posted by the Harris-Walz campaign.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson replied, \"In [Walz's] 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nWalz served honorably in the National Guard for 24 years. He enlisted with the Nebraska National Guard on April 8, 1981 -- two days after his 17th birthday -- and served as an infantry senior sergeant and an administrative specialist, the Minnesota National Guard said in an email to Yahoo News.\n\nIn 1996, Walz transferred to serving in the Minnesota National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery. \"He held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant, and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion,\" Minnesota National Guard spokesperson Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9 told Yahoo News.\n\nOn Aug. 3, 2003, Walz deployed to Vicenza, Italy, to support Operation Enduring Freedom following the 9/11 attacks. \"The battalion supported security missions at various locations in Europe and Turkey,\" the Minnesota National Guard said. During that time, Walz did not engage in combat and returned to Minnesota in April 2004.\n\nIn January 2005, Walz filed to run for Congress, with paperwork indicating it was certified by the Federal Election Commission in February 2005.\n\nAccording to a March 2005 press release issued by Walz's office, the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced that month \"a possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard.\" Walz said at the time he was determined to stay in the congressional race despite a possible tour of duty in Iraq.\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,\" Walz is quoted as saying in the statement.\n\nWalz retired from the Minnesota Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery on May 16, 2005. The Star Tribune said Walz left the guard in order to focus on his run for Congress.\n\nOn July 14, 2005, two months after Walz retired, his unit -- the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery -- was alerted that it would have to mobilize to Iraq, CBS News reported. The unit received an official mobilization order on Aug. 14 and the unit deployed to Iraq in October 2005.\n\nHowever, Walz has been accused of retiring from the National Guard in order to avoid being deployed to Iraq. When Walz ran for Minnesota governor in 2018, retired Command Sgt. Majs. Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr posted a letter on Facebook accusing Walz of having \"embellished\" his military career in the National Guard.\n\n\"Between the time the warning order was given and his 'retirement,' he told Brigade Command Sergeant Major not to worry, that he would be going on the mission. It appears that was a lie,\" the letter alleges. Fox News and the New York Post reported that Behrends replaced Walz as command sergeant major for the unit when it was deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\nBehrends and Herr also took issue with the way Walz was portraying himself as a retired command sergeant major, claiming he inflated his military credentials.\n\nWhile Walz served as a command sergeant major, he reverted back to the rank of master sergeant when he retired.\n\n\"He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" the Minnesota National Guard told Yahoo News.\n\nPolitico reported that the Harris-Walz campaign had changed Walz's title from \"retired command sergeant major,\" which was inaccurate, to what now says he \"served as command sergeant major,\" which is accurate. Yahoo News reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign, which declined to comment.\n\nThe Marine Corps confirmed to Yahoo News that Vance served for four years. Vance enlisted under \"James D. Hamel\" as a combat correspondent on Sept. 22, 2003, with his last date of service on Sept. 21, 2007.\n\nThe Corps also confirmed to Yahoo News that he was deployed to Iraq from August 2005 until February 2006.\n\nVance detailed his Iraq war deployment as a military journalist in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, describing how he would document marines and their work, escort the civilian press and do community outreach to meet with locals in \"unprotected Iraqi territory.\"\n\nVance told reporters at an event in Wisconsin on Wednesday, \"I served in a combat zone. I never said that I saw a firefight myself, but I've always told the truth about my Marine Corps service.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo!

JD Vance stepped up his attacks on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's portrayal of his military career, accusing him without evidence of ducking service in Iraq when he left the Army National Guard and ran for Congress in 2005.\n\nVance also accused Walz of falsely claiming he had served in a combat zone while the Democratic vice presidential nominee was in the Army National Guard.\n\nWhile Walz retired two months before his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq, the attacks on Walz's military record are part of the race from both parties to define the relatively unknown governor after he was tapped Tuesday as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate. Walz's 24-year military service is one of several facets of his background that appeal to voters that the Harris campaign is trying to reach with his selection - and that Republicans are trying to blunt by painting him as an out-of-touch liberal.\n\nWalz and Vance, the two VP candidates, are both military veterans, unlike their running mates.\n\nWalz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota's 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.\n\nAt a campaign stop in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance accused Walz of abandoning his unit before it deployed to Iraq in 2006.\n\n\"When the United State Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\" Vance said.\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Typically, service members need to submit papers several months before they can retire.\n\nA National Guard article on his unit's deployment states that it received alert orders to deploy to Iraq in July 2005, two months after Walz retired. The unit first mobilized in the fall of 2005 to Camp Shelby Mississippi to prepare for deployment, according to the unit's history, and then deployed in March 2006 for 22 months, which the Guard said was the longest continuous deployment of any military unit during US operations in Iraq.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005.\n\nIn his comments Wednesday, Vance also went after Walz for claiming he had served in combat, accusing the governor of being \"dishonest\" with his claims about his service.\n\n\"He said that we - and he was making a point about gun control - 'shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets,'\" Vance said of Walz.\n\nVance pointed to a video promoted by the Harris campaign on social media Tuesday, in which Walz is speaking about his decision to change his position and support an assault weapons ban after the Parkland shooting in 2018.\n\n\"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz said in the video.\n\nWalz deployed with the Minnesota National Guard in August 2003 to Vicenza, Italy, as part of support for the US war in Afghanistan, according to a Minnesota Guard spokesperson. He did not deploy to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service.\n\nIn a statement, a Harris campaign spokesperson said: \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nVance served four years in the Marine Corps as an enlisted combat correspondent, in public affairs, and deployed once to Iraq for roughly six months, according to his military record. He left service in September 2007 as a corporal.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed back against Vance's criticisms when asked about them Wednesday.\n\n\"This is someone who enlisted at 17 years old to serve his country. He was part of the Army National Guard for 24 years. This is someone who was a high school teacher, right?\" Jean-Pierre said. \"A high school coach as well, who grew up in a small town in the Midwest, and so I think his bio speaks for itself, who he is speaks for himself, his record speaks for itself, and I'm just not going to say anything beyond that.\"\n\nThis is not the first time there have been criticisms of Walz's military record. The Minnesota governor was criticized for his exit from the National Guard in 2022 by his Republican opponent, who held a press conference with veterans in the final stretch of the campaign, according to the Star Tribune.\n\nAt the time, Walz defended his service.\n\n\"We all do what we can. I'm proud I did 24 years,\" Walz told the Minnesota paper. \"I have an honorable record.\"\n\nThe criticisms of his military record from within the state during his gubernatorial campaigns also focused on his rank when he retired.\n\nWalz reached the rank of command master sergeant, but he officially retired as a master sergeant -- one rank below command sergeant major -- because \"he did not complete additional coursework at the US Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" according to the Guard.\n\nJoseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran who led the same battalion as Walz, told the Star Tribune in 2022 that Walz did nothing wrong when he left the Guard.\n\n\"He was a great soldier,\" Eustice said. \"When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Edward-Isaac Dovere and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\" Vance said.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005. The next month, after the guard announced a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz's campaign issued a statement saying he intended to stay in the race.\n\n\"I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment,\" Walz said in the March 2005 campaign release.\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,\" he continued, adding: \"I don't want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.\"\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Service members often submit their paperwork for retirement months before their retirement date. It's unclear when Walz submitted his papers for retirement.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond when asked about when Walz submitted his retirement paperwork.\n\nA National Guard article on his unit's deployment states that it received alert orders to deploy to Iraq in July 2005, two months after Walz retired. The unit first mobilized in the fall of 2005 to Camp Shelby Mississippi to prepare for deployment, according to the unit's history, and then deployed in March 2006 for 22 months, which the Guard said was the longest continuous deployment of any military unit during US operations in Iraq.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005.\n\nIn his comments Wednesday, Vance also went after Walz for claiming he had served in combat, accusing the governor of being \"dishonest\" with his claims about his service.\n\n\"He said that we - and he was making a point about gun control - 'shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets,'\" Vance said of Walz.\n\nVance pointed to a video promoted by the Harris campaign on social media Tuesday, in which Walz is speaking about his decision to change his position and support an assault weapons ban after the Parkland shooting in 2018.\n\n\"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz said in the video.\n\nWalz deployed with the Minnesota National Guard in August 2003 to Vicenza, Italy, as part of support for the US war in Afghanistan, according to a Minnesota Guard spokesperson. He did not deploy to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service.\n\nIn a statement, a Harris campaign spokesperson said: \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nVance served four years in the Marine Corps as an enlisted combat correspondent, in public affairs, and deployed once to Iraq for roughly six months, according to his military record. He left service in September 2007 as a corporal.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed back against Vance's criticisms when asked about them Wednesday.\n\n\"This is someone who enlisted at 17 years old to serve his country. He was part of the Army National Guard for 24 years. This is someone who was a high school teacher, right?\" Jean-Pierre said. \"A high school coach as well, who grew up in a small town in the Midwest, and so I think his bio speaks for itself, who he is speaks for himself, his record speaks for itself, and I'm just not going to say anything beyond that.\"\n\nThis is not the first time there have been criticisms of Walz's military record. The Minnesota governor was criticized for his exit from the National Guard in 2022 by his Republican opponent, who held a press conference with veterans in the final stretch of the campaign, according to the Star Tribune.\n\nAt the time, Walz defended his service.\n\n\"We all do what we can. I'm proud I did 24 years,\" Walz told the Minnesota paper. \"I have an honorable record.\"\n\nThe criticisms of his military record from within the state during his gubernatorial campaigns also focused on his rank when he retired.\n\nWalz reached the rank of command master sergeant, but he officially retired as a master sergeant -- one rank below command sergeant major -- because \"he did not complete additional coursework at the US Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" according to the Guard.\n\nJoseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran who led the same battalion as Walz, told the Star Tribune in 2022 that Walz did nothing wrong when he left the Guard.\n\n\"He was a great soldier,\" Eustice said. \"When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting on the timeline of Walz's service and information on his unit's possible deployment to Iraq.\n\nCNN's Edward-Isaac Dovere and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

JD Vance of Ohio, who is an Iraq War veteran, seized the opportunity to target his opponent's military record, resurfacing claims about his deployments and his retirement from the guard.\n\nWalz served honorably in both the Nebraska and Minnesota Army National Guards, earning medals and deploying in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. But his final days of service have been called into question, centering on his rank and if he retired to avoid a 2005 deployment to Iraq.\n\nA CBS News review of Walz's military record and statements from the Minnesota Army National Guard show Walz achieved the rank of command sergeant major but was reduced in rank to master sergeant after retirement since he had not completed coursework for the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nOn Iraq, records show Walz had retired before his battalion was mobilized and deployed to Iraq. A 2005 statement from his website indicates Walz was initially prepared to deploy to Iraq amid his bid for Congress. CBS News has asked Walz for comment on when he decided to retire.\n\nWalz retired from the Minnesota Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery in 2005 after more than 24 years in service, the Minnesota Army National Guard told CBS News.\n\nWalz first enlisted in the Nebraska Army National Guard in April 1981, serving as an infantry senior sergeant and administrative specialist. In 1996, Walz transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard, where he first worked as a cannon crewmember and field artillery senior sergeant.\n\nMinnesota National Guard spokesperson Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9 told CBS News that Walz \"held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant, and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion.\"\n\nWalz earned several Army commendation and achievement medals during his more than 24 years of service.\n\nWalz deployed in August 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The Minnesota National Guard told CBS News the battalion supported security missions at various locations in Europe and Turkey. Walz was stationed at Vicenza, Italy, at the time and returned to Minnesota in April 2004.\n\nOn Wednesday, Vance resurfaced claims that Walz retired from the National Guard to avoid deploying to Iraq.\n\n\"When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America, asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service,\" said Vance.\n\nHe added: \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people he served with.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign responded with a statement saying: \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nThe campaign also said, \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nThe claims raised by Vance first gained prominence when Walz ran for governor of Minnesota in 2018. At the time, retired Army veterans Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, who both served as command sergeant majors, posted on Facebook a lengthy letter accusing Walz of \"embellishing\" his military career and abandoning his Army National Guard battalion ahead of a 2005 deployment to Iraq.\n\nIn the letter, Behrends and Herr write that in early 2005, Walz's unit -- 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery -- was slated to deploy to Iraq. At the time, Walz was serving as the unit's command sergeant major.\n\nBehrends and Herr claimed that from the time the unit was told to prepare for an Iraq deployment and when Walz retired, he told other Army leaders he would be going to Iraq but later resigned his position before the deployment to avoid going to a combat zone.\n\nWalz has said he left the guard to run for Congress, according to the Star Tribune. In 2006, Walz won his election to Congress against a six-term Republican incumbent.\n\nRecords show Walz officially filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 10, 2005.\n\nIn March 2005, the National Guard announced a possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard, according to an archived press release from Tim Walz for U.S. Congress.\n\n\"I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on the specifics of the deployment,\" said Walz in the March 2005 statement.\n\nThe statement continued: \"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or Iraq,\" said Walz, who indicated at the time he had no plans to drop out of the race. \"I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic support and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.\"\n\nThe Minnesota Army National Guard told CBS News that Walz retired on May 16, 2005. CBS News has asked Walz to clarify when he submitted his retirement papers.\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard told CBS News that Walz's unit -- 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery -- received an alert order for mobilization to Iraq on July 14, 2005 - two months after Walz retired, according to Lt. Col. Ryan Rossman, who serves as the Minnesota National Guard's director of operations. The official mobilization order was received on August 14 of the same year, and the unit mobilized in October.\n\nCBS News reviewed the deployment history for the Minnesota Army National Guard which shows that in the fall of 2005, 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery was mobilized in preparation for a deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The battalion trained at Camp Shelby in Mississippi and deployed to Iraq as a motorized security task force.\n\nIn 2018, Tom Hagen, a military reservist who served in Iraq, wrote a letter to The Winona Daily News claiming Walz was not being candid about his service record and wanted people to know that the future Minnesota governor did not serve in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nWalz responded in the same newspaper and criticized Hagan as dishonoring a fellow veteran, according to MPR News. Walz wrote: \"There's a code of honor among those who've served, and normally this type of partisan political attack only comes from one who's never worn a uniform.\"\n\nJoseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the guard who also led Walz's battalion, told the Star Tribune in Oct. 2022 that the governor fulfilled his duty.\n\n\"He was a great soldier. When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave,\" said Eustice.\n\nOfficial biographies on the Minnesota government website and Vice President Kamala Harris' website describe Walz as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\" However, documents reviewed by CBS News show this is not accurate; while Walz served at one point as a command sergeant major, he retired at a lower rank.\n\nArmy veteran Anthony Anderson, who routinely obtains military records from the Defense Department using the Freedom of Information Act and has worked with CBS News on similar stories, provided Walz's records for review. CBS News has also requested the documents from the National Guard.\n\nOne of the documents shows Walz reverted back to master sergeant from command sergeant major when he retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005.\n\nArmy soldiers promoted to the rank of sergeant major or command sergeant major are required to attend the Sergeants Major Course, or what was formerly known as the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nLt. Col. Aug\u00e9, the Minnesota National Guard spokesperson, told CBS News that Walz retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for \"benefit purposes\" because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nWhile Walz can say he served as a command sergeant major in the Minnesota Army National Guard, his official biographies are incorrect in referring to him as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tim Walz, Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate, was demoted and did not retire as a command sergeant major like he has claimed for years, including on his official gubernatorial biography.\n\nWhile Walz temporarily held the title of command sergeant major he \"retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, the Minnesota National Guard's State Public Affairs Officer, told Just the News.\n\nThe statement reignited a controversy that began during his 2018 election for governor in which National Guardsman claimed on social media and in a paid ad that Walz declined to deploy to Iraq for combat duty in 2005 and forfeited his title of command sergeant major. Walz chose to run for Congress that year.\n\nThe governor's biography, published on the state's official website, says that \"Command Sergeant Major Walz\" retired from the Minnesota National Guard in 2005. At the time he was serving as one of the highest ranking members of the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion.\n\n...\n\nMinnesota Governor Walz was selected in 2004 to serve as the Command Sergeant Major of the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and by September of that year Walz was conditionally promoted to the rank.\n\nBut, by early 2005, Walz's battalion was ordered to mobilize for an active duty deployment to Iraq.\n\nShortly after, in May 2005, Walz \"quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" according to the two Command Sergeants Major.\n\n\"When your country calls, you are supposed to run into battle -- not the other way,\" Behrends told the New York Post Tuesday. He ran away. It's sad.\"\n\n\"He had the opportunity to serve his country, and said 'Screw you' to the United States. That's not who I would pick to run for vice president,\" he added.\n\nJD Vance, who signed up to go to Iraq and then fought in Iraq, isn't having this chickenhawk steal valor from actual warriors.\n\nVance accuses Walz of \"shameful\" conduct for abandoning military unit before Iraq\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, accused his Democrat counterpart, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz of \"lying\" about his military service and engaging in \"stolen valor garbage\" during a campaign rally in Detroit Wednesday. Vance's comments came in response to Walz's criticism of his Ivy League education.\n\nKey Details:\n\nVance responded to Walz's critique, saying, \"I came from a family where nobody in my family had ever gone to law school. I grew up in a poor family. The fact that Tim Walz wants to turn it into a bad thing, that I actually worked myself through college, through law school and made something myself -- to me, that's the American dream. And if Tim Walz wants to insult it, I think that's frankly pretty bizarre.\"\n\nVance accused Walz of abandoning his unit before they deployed to Iraq, stating, \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.\"\n\nVance also criticized Walz's gun control stance, questioning, \"He said, 'We shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets.' Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone?\"\n\n...\n\nVance then launched into a critique of Walz's military service: \"As a marine who served his country in uniform when the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with. I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go.\"\n\nVance further criticized Walz's comments on gun control, saying, \"He said, 'We shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets.' Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage.\"\n\nAncient slag, Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) said this to Jim Acosta on CNN:\n\n\"Well, here is Tim Walz, who enlisted when he was 17 years old,\" she said of Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate. \"He served in the National Guard for 24 years, and I'm not aware of any military service that J.D. Vance has ever served, so let's just make the comparison there.\"\n\nAcosta did correct her but I'm sure it killed him to do it.", "source": {"uri": "acecomments.mu.nu", "dataType": "news", "title": "acecomments.mu.nu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2018 United States House of Representatives elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant colonel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

It's against federal law to lie about military service to try to defraud people.\n\nWhile there's no evidence that Walz is guilty of such a crime, there are questions about how Walz has talked about his service, including claims that he carried a gun \"in war,\" when he never saw active combat.\n\nWalz issued a statement saying that \"in his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard as the crisis in Iraq was growing to run for political office.\n\nBy 2005, Tim Walz had logged 24 years with the Army National Guard and earned the rank of command sergeant major -- the highest enlisted rank for his unit and one with considerable responsibility.\n\nMORE: Despite new criticism, Trump told Walz in 2020 he was 'very happy' with his handling of George Floyd protests\n\nIt was possible his unit would be sent to war, as Pentagon officials hoped the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq would protect the new coalition government and prevent a civil war.\n\nWalz, a vocal critic of the Bush administration's war policies and father of a 4-year-old girl at the time, opted to file his retirement papers that May and run for public office instead.\n\nWalz won, successfully flipping a Minnesota House seat from red to blue for the first time in years and becoming the highest-ranked enlisted veteran to serve in Congress.\n\nAccording to records by the National Guard, the 1st Battalion of the 125th Field Artillery received an alert order on July 14, 2005, - two months after Walz retired. The mobilization order came in August and the unit mobilized in October.\n\nJoseph Eustice, another retired command sergeant major who served with Walz, tells ABC News that while there was speculation of a deployment around that time there was no firm indication that Walz's unit would be sent to Iraq until that July alert order.\n\nEustice says he remembers Walz struggling with the timing of wanting to serve as a lawmaker but also avoiding asking for a deferment so he could do so.\n\n\"He had a window of time. He had to decide. And in his deciding, we were not on notice to be deployed. There were rumors. There were lots of rumors, and we didn't know where we were going until it was later that, early summer, I believe,\" Eustice told ABC News.\n\nVance said Walz as a command sergeant major at the time shouldn't have allowed his unit to deploy without him.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare [a] unit to go to Iraq to make a promise that you're going to follow through and then to drop out right before you actually have to go. I also think it's dishonest,\" Vance said.\n\nMORE: Tim Walz was the safe VP pick\n\nWalz and Harris campaign officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre said his record as someone who enlisted at age 17 and spent more than two decades in the Army National Guard \"speaks for itself.\"\n\nWalz served as command sergeant major but didn't stay in that role long enough to keep it in retirement.\n\nThere's no evidence Walz broke any rules by retiring when he did. After more than 20 years of service with the National Guard, a person can retire at any point, regardless of where they are in their contract, according to the National Guard.\n\nWalz had joined the Nebraska National Guard at age 17, later transferring to the Minnesota National Guard, spending a total of 24 years.\n\nAccording to experts, Walz's retirement would have to have been approved by his commander. Officials say retirement requests can be denied if a Guard unit is mobilized, though the ultimate decision is up to the unit commander.\n\nWhat is noteworthy is that Walz still uses the rank of command sergeant major on his website.\n\nWalz indeed achieved that rank in service in September 2004. But he would have had to serve in that particular role for three years to retire as one officially, according to the National Guard.\n\n\"After 24 years in the Army National Guard, Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005,\" according to the governor's website.\n\nWalz said he carried a gun \"in war,\" but he also has acknowledged he was never in direct combat.\n\nIn a video clip tweeted out by the Harris campaign on Tuesday, Walz tells an audience that he carried guns \"in war\" while trying to make the case for restrictions on gun access.\n\n\"We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" Walz said.\n\nWalz would have carried a gun during his service when the U.S. was at war following the 9/11 terror attacks, including a deployment to Italy in 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nBut there is no evidence that Walz was ever engaged in active combat, and he has acknowledged as much, according to a 2018 interview with Minnesota Public Radio.\n\n\"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,\" Walz said. \"I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nStill, Vance insists Walz's comment about carrying a gun \"in war\" and not \"during war\" is tantamount to stolen valor.\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" he said.\n\nVance is a retired Marine who served in Iraq but wrote in his memoir that he was \"lucky to escape any real fighting.\"\n\n\"I served in a combat zone. I never said that I saw a firefight myself, but I've always told the truth about my Marine Corps service. That's the difference,\" Vance said Wednesday.\n\nABC News' Isabella Murray and Alex Presha contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enlisted rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

JD Vance stepped up his attacks on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's portrayal of his military career, accusing him of ducking service in Iraq when he left the Army National Guard and ran for Congress in 2005.\n\nVance also accused Walz of falsely claiming he had served in a combat zone while the Democratic vice presidential nominee was in the Army National Guard.\n\nWhile Walz retired two months before his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq, the attacks on Walz's military record are part of the race from both parties to define the relatively unknown governor after he was tapped Tuesday as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate. Walz's 24-year military service is one of several facets of his background that appeal to voters that the Harris campaign is trying to reach with his selection - and that Republicans are trying to blunt by painting him as an out-of-touch liberal.\n\nWalz and Vance, the two VP candidates, are both military veterans, unlike their running mates.\n\nWalz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years before retiring in 2005. He launched a campaign for Congress in Minnesota's 1st Congressional District that year and was elected in November 2006.\n\nAt a campaign stop in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance accused Walz of abandoning his unit before it deployed to Iraq in 2006.\n\n\"When the United State Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\" Vance said.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission as a candidate for Congress on February 10, 2005. The next month, after the guard announced a possible deployment to Iraq within two years, Walz's campaign issued a statement saying he intended to stay in the race.\n\n\"I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment,\" Walz said in the March 2005 campaign release.\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,\" he continued, adding: \"I don't want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.\"\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. In a 2009 interview for the Library of Congress, Walz said he left the guard to focus full time on running for Congress, citing concerns about trying to serve at the same time and the Hatch Act, which limits political activities for federal employees.\n\nService members often submit their paperwork for retirement months before their retirement date. It's unclear when Walz submitted his papers for retirement.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond when asked about when Walz submitted his retirement paperwork.\n\nA National Guard article on his unit's deployment states that it received alert orders to deploy to Iraq in July 2005, two months after Walz retired. The unit first mobilized in the fall of 2005 to Camp Shelby Mississippi to prepare for deployment, according to the unit's history, and then deployed in March 2006 for 22 months, which the Guard said was the longest continuous deployment of any military unit during US operations in Iraq.\n\nIn his comments Wednesday, Vance also went after Walz for claiming he had served in combat, accusing the governor of being \"dishonest\" with his claims about his service.\n\n\"He said that we - and he was making a point about gun control - 'shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets,'\" Vance said of Walz.\n\nVance pointed to a video promoted by the Harris campaign on social media Tuesday, in which Walz is speaking about his decision to change his position and support an assault weapons ban after the Parkland shooting in 2018.\n\n\"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz said in the video.\n\nWalz deployed with the Minnesota National Guard in August 2003 to Vicenza, Italy, as part of support for the US war in Afghanistan, according to a Minnesota Guard spokesperson. He did not deploy to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service.\n\nIn a statement, a Harris campaign spokesperson said: \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nVance served four years in the Marine Corps as an enlisted combat correspondent, in public affairs, and deployed once to Iraq for roughly six months, according to his military record. He left service in September 2007 as a corporal.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pushed back against Vance's criticisms when asked about them Wednesday.\n\n\"This is someone who enlisted at 17 years old to serve his country. He was part of the Army National Guard for 24 years. This is someone who was a high school teacher, right?\" Jean-Pierre said. \"A high school coach as well, who grew up in a small town in the Midwest, and so I think his bio speaks for itself, who he is speaks for himself, his record speaks for itself, and I'm just not going to say anything beyond that.\"\n\nThis is not the first time there have been criticisms of Walz's military record. The Minnesota governor was criticized for his exit from the National Guard in 2022 by his Republican opponent, who held a press conference with veterans in the final stretch of the campaign, according to the Star Tribune.\n\nAt the time, Walz defended his service.\n\n\"We all do what we can. I'm proud I did 24 years,\" Walz told the Minnesota paper. \"I have an honorable record.\"\n\nThe criticisms of his military record from within the state during his gubernatorial campaigns also focused on his rank when he retired.\n\nWalz reached the rank of command master sergeant, but he officially retired as a master sergeant -- one rank below command sergeant major -- because \"he did not complete additional coursework at the US Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" according to the Guard.\n\nJoseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran who led the same battalion as Walz, told the Star Tribune in 2022 that Walz did nothing wrong when he left the Guard.\n\n\"He was a great soldier,\" Eustice said. \"When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting on the timeline of Walz's service and information on his unit's possible deployment to Iraq.\n\nCNN's Edward-Isaac Dovere and Natasha Bertrand contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Tim Walz's military record has come under renewed scrutiny following Vice President Kamala Harris' announcement of Walz as her running mate on the Democratic ticket.\n\nOn Wednesday, former President Donald Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, who is an Iraq War veteran, seized the opportunity to target his opponent's military record, resurfacing claims about his deployments and his retirement from the guard.\n\nWalz served honorably in both the Nebraska and Minnesota Army National Guards, earning medals and deploying in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. But his final days of service have been called into question, centering on his rank and if he retired to avoid a 2005 deployment to Iraq.\n\nA CBS News review of Walz's military record and statements from the Minnesota Army National Guard show Walz achieved the rank of command sergeant major but was reduced in rank to master sergeant after retirement since he had not completed coursework for the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nOn Iraq, records show Walz had retired before his battalion was mobilized and deployed to Iraq. A 2005 statement from his website indicates Walz was initially prepared to deploy to Iraq amid his bid for Congress. CBS News has asked Walz for comment on when he decided to retire.\n\nA snapshot of Walz in the military\n\nWalz retired from the Minnesota Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery in 2005 after more than 24 years in service, the Minnesota Army National Guard told CBS News.\n\nWalz first enlisted in the Nebraska Army National Guard in April 1981, serving as an infantry senior sergeant and administrative specialist. In 1996, Walz transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard, where he first worked as a cannon crewmember and field artillery senior sergeant.\n\nMinnesota National Guard spokesperson Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9 told CBS News that Walz \"held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant, and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion.\"\n\nWalz earned several Army commendation and achievement medals during his more than 24 years of service.\n\nWalz deployed in August 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The Minnesota National Guard told CBS News the battalion supported security missions at various locations in Europe and Turkey. Walz was stationed at Vicenza, Italy, at the time and returned to Minnesota in April 2004.\n\nControversy over a 2005 Iraq deployment\n\nOn Wednesday, Vance resurfaced claims that Walz retired from the National Guard to avoid deploying to Iraq.\n\n\"When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America, asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service,\" said Vance.\n\nHe added: \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people he served with.\"\n\nThe claims first gained prominence when Walz ran for governor of Minnesota in 2018. At the time, retired Army veterans Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, who both served as command sergeant majors, posted on Facebook a lengthy letter accusing Walz of \"embellishing\" his military career and abandoning his Army National Guard battalion ahead of a 2005 deployment to Iraq.\n\nIn the letter, Behrends and Herr write that in early 2005, Walz's unit -- 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery -- was slated to deploy to Iraq. At the time, Walz was serving as the unit's command sergeant major.\n\nBehrends and Herr claimed that from the time the unit was told to prepare for an Iraq deployment and when Walz retired, he told other Army leaders he would be going to Iraq but later resigned his position before the deployment to avoid going to a combat zone.\n\nWalz has said he left the guard to run for Congress, according to the Star Tribune. In 2006, Walz won his election to Congress against a six-term Republican incumbent.\n\nRecords show Walz officially filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 10, 2005.\n\nIn March 2005, the National Guard announced a possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard, according to an archived press release from Tim Walz for U.S. Congress.\n\n\"I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on the specifics of the deployment,\" said Walz in the March 2005 statement.\n\nThe statement continued: \"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or Iraq,\" said Walz, who indicated at the time he had no plans to drop out of the race. \"I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic support and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.\"\n\nThe Minnesota Army National Guard told CBS News that Walz retired on May 16, 2005. CBS News has asked Walz to clarify when he submitted his retirement papers.\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard told CBS News that Walz's unit -- 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery -- received an alert order for mobilization to Iraq on July 14, 2005 - two months after Walz retired, according to Lt. Col. Ryan Rossman, who serves as the Minnesota National Guard's director of operations. The official mobilization order was received on August 14 of the same year, and the unit mobilized in October.\n\nCBS News reviewed the deployment history for the Minnesota Army National Guard which shows that in the fall of 2005, 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery was mobilized in preparation for a deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The battalion trained at Camp Shelby in Mississippi and deployed to Iraq as a motorized security task force.\n\nIn 2018, Tom Hagen, a military reservist who served in Iraq, wrote a letter to The Winona Daily News claiming Walz was not being candid about his service record and wanted people to know that the future Minnesota governor did not serve in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nWalz responded in the same newspaper and criticized Hagan as dishonoring a fellow veteran, according to MPR News. Walz wrote: \"There's a code of honor among those who've served, and normally this type of partisan political attack only comes from one who's never worn a uniform.\"\n\nJoseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the guard who also led Walz's battalion, told the Star Tribune in Oct. 2022 that the governor fulfilled his duty.\n\n\"He was a great soldier. When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave,\" said Eustice.\n\nWalz's rank as a command sergeant major\n\nOfficial biographies on the Minnesota government website and Vice President Kamala Harris' website describe Walz as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\" However, documents reviewed by CBS News show this is not accurate; while Walz served at one point as a command sergeant major, he retired at a lower rank.\n\nArmy veteran Anthony Anderson, who routinely obtains military records from the Defense Department using the Freedom of Information Act and has worked with CBS News on similar stories, provided Walz's records for review. CBS News has also requested the documents from the National Guard.\n\nOne of the documents shows Walz reverted back to master sergeant from command sergeant major when he retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005.\n\nArmy soldiers promoted to the rank of sergeant major or command sergeant major are required to attend the Sergeants Major Course, or what was formerly known as the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nLt. Col. Aug\u00e9, the Minnesota National Guard spokesperson, told CBS News that Walz retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for \"benefit purposes\" because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nWhile Walz can say he served as a command sergeant major in the Minnesota Army National Guard, his official biographies are incorrect in referring to him as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's against federal law to lie about military service to try to defraud people.\n\nWhile there's no evidence that Walz is guilty of such a crime, there are questions about how Walz has talked about his service, including claims that he carried a gun \"in war,\" when he never saw active combat.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign issued a statement saying that \"in his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard as the crisis in Iraq was growing to run for political office.\n\nBy 2005, Tim Walz had logged 24 years with the Army National Guard and earned the rank of command sergeant major -- the highest enlisted rank for his unit and one with considerable responsibility.\n\nMORE: Despite new criticism, Trump told Walz in 2020 he was 'very happy' with his handling of George Floyd protests\n\nIt was possible his unit would be sent to war, as Pentagon officials hoped the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq would protect the new coalition government and prevent a civil war.\n\nWalz, a vocal critic of the Bush administration's war policies and father of a 4-year-old girl at the time, opted to file his retirement papers that May and run for public office instead.\n\nWalz won, successfully flipping a Minnesota House seat from red to blue for the first time in years and becoming the highest-ranked enlisted veteran to serve in Congress.\n\nAccording to records by the National Guard, the 1st Battalion of the 125th Field Artillery received an alert order on July 14, 2005, - two months after Walz retired. The mobilization order came in August and the unit mobilized in October.\n\nJoseph Eustice, another retired command sergeant major who served with Walz, tells ABC News that while there was speculation of a deployment around that time there was no firm indication that Walz's unit would be sent to Iraq until that July alert order.\n\nEustice says he remembers Walz struggling with the timing of wanting to serve as a lawmaker but also avoiding asking for a deferment so he could do so.\n\n\"He had a window of time. He had to decide. And in his deciding, we were not on notice to be deployed. There were rumors. There were lots of rumors, and we didn't know where we were going until it was later that, early summer, I believe,\" Eustice told ABC News.\n\nVance said Walz as a command sergeant major at the time shouldn't have allowed his unit to deploy without him.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare [a] unit to go to Iraq to make a promise that you're going to follow through and then to drop out right before you actually have to go. I also think it's dishonest,\" Vance said.\n\nMORE: Tim Walz was the safe VP pick\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre said his record as someone who enlisted at age 17 and spent more than two decades in the Army National Guard \"speaks for itself.\"\n\nWalz served as command sergeant major but didn't stay in that role long enough to keep it in retirement.\n\nThere's no evidence Walz broke any rules by retiring when he did. After more than 20 years of service with the National Guard, a person can retire at any point, regardless of where they are in their contract, according to the National Guard.\n\nWalz had joined the Nebraska National Guard at age 17, later transferring to the Minnesota National Guard, spending a total of 24 years in the service.\n\nAccording to experts, Walz's retirement would have to have been approved by his commander. Officials say retirement requests can be denied if a Guard unit is mobilized, though the ultimate decision is up to the unit commander.\n\nWhat is noteworthy is that Walz still uses the rank of command sergeant major on his website.\n\nWalz indeed achieved that rank in service in September 2004. But he would have had to serve in that particular role for three years to retire as one officially, according to the National Guard.\n\n\"After 24 years in the Army National Guard, Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005,\" according to the governor's website.\n\nWalz said he carried a gun \"in war,\" but he also has acknowledged he was never in direct combat.\n\nIn a video clip tweeted out by the Harris campaign on Tuesday, Walz tells an audience that he carried guns \"in war\" while trying to make the case for restrictions on gun access.\n\n\"We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" Walz said.\n\nWalz would have carried a gun during his service when the U.S. was at war following the 9/11 terror attacks, including a deployment to Italy in 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nBut there is no evidence that Walz was ever engaged in active combat, and he has acknowledged as much, according to a 2018 interview with Minnesota Public Radio.\n\n\"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,\" Walz said. \"I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nStill, Vance insists Walz's comment about carrying a gun \"in war\" and not \"during war\" is tantamount to stolen valor.\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" he said.\n\nVance is a former Marine who served in Iraq but wrote in his memoir that he was \"lucky to escape any real fighting.\"\n\n\"I served in a combat zone. I never said that I saw a firefight myself, but I've always told the truth about my Marine Corps service. That's the difference,\" Vance said Wednesday.\n\nABC News' Isabella Murray and Alex Presha contributed to this report.\n\nWhat to know about Walz's military record and Vance's accusations of 'stolen valor' originally appeared on abcnews.go.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "luis_martinez@aol.com", "name": "Luis Martinez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enlisted rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Press_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Press Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

It's against federal law to lie about military service to try to defraud people.\n\nWhile there's no evidence that Walz is guilty of such a crime, there are questions about how Walz has talked about his service, including claims that he carried a gun \"in war,\" when he never saw active combat.\n\nWalz issued a statement saying that \"in his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nHere's what to know:\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard as the crisis in Iraq was growing to run for political office.\n\nBy 2005, Tim Walz had logged 24 years with the Army National Guard and earned the rank of command sergeant major -- the highest enlisted rank for his unit and one with considerable responsibility.\n\nIt was possible his unit would be sent to war, as Pentagon officials hoped the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq would protect the new coalition government and prevent a civil war.\n\nWalz, a vocal critic of the Bush administration's war policies and father of a 4-year-old girl at the time, opted to file his retirement papers that May and run for public office instead.\n\nWalz won, successfully flipping a Minnesota House seat from red to blue for the first time in years and becoming the highest-ranked enlisted veteran to serve in Congress.\n\nAccording to records by the National Guard, the 1st Battalion of the 125th Field Artillery received an alert order on July 14, 2005, - two months after Walz retired. The mobilization order came in August and the unit mobilized in October.\n\nJoseph Eustice, another retired command sergeant major who served with Walz, tells ABC News that while there was speculation of a deployment around that time there was no firm indication that Walz's unit would be sent to Iraq until that July alert order.\n\nEustice says he remembers Walz struggling with the timing of wanting to serve as a lawmaker but also avoiding asking for a deferment so he could do so.\n\n\"He had a window of time. He had to decide. And in his deciding, we were not on notice to be deployed. There were rumors. There were lots of rumors, and we didn't know where we were going until it was later that, early summer, I believe,\" Eustice told ABC News.\n\nVance said Walz as a command sergeant major at the time shouldn't have allowed his unit to deploy without him.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare [a] unit to go to Iraq to make a promise that you're going to follow through and then to drop out right before you actually have to go. I also think it's dishonest,\" Vance said.\n\nWalz and Harris campaign officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre said his record as someone who enlisted at age 17 and spent more than two decades in the Army National Guard \"speaks for itself.\"\n\nWalz served as command sergeant major but didn't stay in that role long enough to keep it in retirement.\n\nThere's no evidence Walz broke any rules by retiring when he did. After more than 20 years of service with the National Guard, a person can retire at any point, regardless of where they are in their contract, according to the National Guard.\n\nWalz had joined the Nebraska National Guard at age 17, later transferring to the Minnesota National Guard, spending a total of 24 years.\n\nAccording to experts, Walz's retirement would have to have been approved by his commander. Officials say retirement requests can be denied if a Guard unit is mobilized, though the ultimate decision is up to the unit commander.\n\nWhat is noteworthy is that Walz still uses the rank of command sergeant major on his website.\n\nWalz indeed achieved that rank in service in September 2004. But he would have had to serve in that particular role for three years to retire as one officially, according to the National Guard.\n\n\"After 24 years in the Army National Guard, Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005,\" according to the governor's website.\n\nWalz said he carried a gun \"in war,\" but he also has acknowledged he was never in direct combat.\n\nIn a video clip tweeted out by the Harris campaign on Tuesday, Walz tells an audience that he carried guns \"in war\" while trying to make the case for restrictions on gun access.\n\n\"We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" Walz said.\n\nWalz would have carried a gun during his service when the U.S. was at war following the 9/11 terror attacks, including a deployment to Italy in 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nBut there is no evidence that Walz was ever engaged in active combat, and he has acknowledged as much, according to a 2018 interview with Minnesota Public Radio.\n\n\"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,\" Walz said. \"I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nStill, Vance insists Walz's comment about carrying a gun \"in war\" and not \"during war\" is tantamount to stolen valor.\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" he said.\n\nVance is a retired Marine who served in Iraq but wrote in his memoir that he was \"lucky to escape any real fighting.\"\n\n\"I served in a combat zone. I never said that I saw a firefight myself, but I've always told the truth about my Marine Corps service.

Tim Walz's military service targeted by Trump campaign", "body": "Democratice Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz campaigned with Kamala Harris on Tuesday -- and said he's looking forward to debating JD Vance.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz's Army National Guard service has become an immediate target of Republican Donald Trump's campaign, with running-mate JD Vance, also a veteran, attacking Walz's retirement from the military prior to his battalion's deployment to Iraq.\n\nWalz, the governor of Minnesota and a former congressman, joined the National Guard out of high school at 17 years old on April 8, 1981 and served until May 16, 2005. Walz has said he retired from the guard to run for Congress, which he did successfully in 2006.\n\nThe alert order for Walz's unit to mobilize for Iraq was received on July 14, 2005 - almost two months after Walz had retired - and the unit mobilized Oct. 12, 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard.\n\nMore: Why Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz over Josh Shapiro as her running mate\n\nVance raised Walz's departure from the military Wednesday while campaigning in Shelby Township, Michigan, comparing their military records. Vance joined the Marines in 2003 and served as a combat correspondent - or military journalist - until 2007. Vance was deployed to Iraq for six months in late 2005 to serve in public affairs.\n\n\"When the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably, and I'm very proud of that service,\" Vance said. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nVance added: \"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the 'stolen valor' garbage. Do not to pretend to be something you're not.\"\n\nVice President Kamala named Walz her running-mate Tuesday, with the campaign highlighting his Midwest, working-class biography and military service.\n\nVance's attacks have drawn comparisons to the unsubstantiated \"Swift Boat\" claims against Democrat John Kerry in the 2004 presidential race against President George W. Bush. The group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth challenged Kerry's decorated Vietnam War record. Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, led the Swift Boat campaign attacking Kerry in 2004.\n\nVance seized on past remarks from Walz in support of gun control shared Tuesday on social media by the Harris campaign in which the governor said, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\n\"I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance said Wednesday. \"What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq?\"\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Harris campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa reiterated that Walz retired in 2005 to run for Congress, where he later chaired the House Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\nMore: Tim Walz's military record: What to know about potential VP's National Guard service\n\nMore: Tim Walz debuts as Kamala Harris' VP pick at raucous Philly rally: Recap\n\nIn response to Vance saying Walz never carried a weapon into war, Moussa said: \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nFormer Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois - a Trump critic, Harris supporter and veteran of the Air National Guard - also pushed back at Vance's criticism.\n\n\"JD served honorably, but he wasn't kicking down doors. He was in public affairs. Which again, is fine and honorable. Tim, after he was eligible for retirement, retired. People do that,\" Kinzinger wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"If it was a real problem he would have been 'stop lossed' and prevented from retiring.\"\n\nA stop-loss refers to the involuntary extension of an individual's activity duty service enforced by the Defense Department.\n\n\"If JD Vance is going to go after Tim Walz, I would suggest he take from his own military training, his own military experience,\" said Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Harris surrogate and also a military veteran. \"Do not start with trying to attack that someone raised their hand to serve this country.\"\n\nAlthough promoted as command sergeant major, Walz retired as a master sergeant for benefit purposes in 2005 because he did not complete additional course work at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\n\"You get to sergeant major because you have a track record of taking care of your people,\" Moore said.\n\nWalz mobilized with the Minnesota National Guard Aug. 3, 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, whose primary mission was the war in Afghanistan but also had counterterrorism roles in other regions.\n\nHis 1st Battalion of the 125th Field Artillery supported security missions in Europe and Turkey, according to a statement from Lt. Col. Kristen Auge, a spokesperson for the Minnesota National Guard.\n\nWalz was stationed at Vicenza, Italy during his deployment and returned to Minnesota in April 2004, Auge said.Walz started his service in the Nebraska National Guard and finished at the Minnesota National Guard.\n\nMore: 'Resurrected from the dead': Harris pick of Walz caps complete shake-up of 2024 race\n\nWalz's Republican opponents in Minnesota have criticized his exit from the military in the past, including during his 2018 and 2022 runs for governor.\n\nIn an open letter in 2018, Minnesota National Guard veteran Thomas Behrends accused Walz of pushing \"embellished and selectively omitted facts\" about his military service. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported that Behrends was passed over for the promotion to command sergeant major that went to Walz and described him as a \"longtime critic of the governor.\"\n\nRetired Maj. Gen. Randy Manner, who held top positions with the National Guard Bureau, called the controversy manufactured. Walz would have filed his papers for retirement long before his unit received notice that they were being mobilized for deployment. The retirement papers Walz filed take five to nine months to process, said Manner, who said he does not know Walz but plans to vote for the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"The idea that a man who served his country honorably for 24 years somehow 'cut and run' because he retired from the Guard in his 40s to pursue his next phase of life is an insult to him and everyone else who also served their nation so honorably,\" Manner said.\n\nThat same year, Walz acknowledged he never saw combat in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio.\n\n\"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,\" Walz said in 2018. \"I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Vets_and_POWs_for_Truth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swift Vets and POWs for Truth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_correspondent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War correspondent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2004 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kinzinger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Kinzinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Tim Walz's military service targeted by Trump campaign", "body": "WASHINGTON -- Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz's Army National Guard service has become an immediate target of Republican Donald Trump's campaign, with running-mate JD Vance, also a veteran, attacking Walz's retirement from the military prior to his battalion's deployment to Iraq.\n\nWalz, the governor of Minnesota and a former congressman, joined the National Guard out of high school at 17 years old on April 8, 1981 and served until May 16, 2005. Walz has said he retired from the guard to run for Congress, which he did successfully in 2006.\n\nThe alert order for Walz's unit to mobilize for Iraq was received on July 14, 2005 - almost two months after Walz had retired - and the unit mobilized Oct. 12, 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard.\n\nMore:Why Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz over Josh Shapiro as her running mate\n\nVance raised Walz's departure from the military Wednesday while campaigning in Shelby Township, Michigan, comparing their military records. Vance joined the Marines in 2003 and served as a combat correspondent - or military journalist - until 2007. Vance was deployed to Iraq for six months in late 2005 to serve in public affairs.\n\n\"When the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably, and I'm very proud of that service,\" Vance said. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nVance added: \"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the 'stolen valor' garbage. Do not to pretend to be something you're not.\"\n\nVice President Kamala named Walz her running-mate Tuesday, with the campaign highlighting his Midwest, working-class biography and military service.\n\nVance's attacks have drawn comparisons to the unsubstantiated \"Swift Boat\" claims against Democrat John Kerry in the 2004 presidential race against President George W. Bush. The group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth challenged Kerry's decorated Vietnam War record. Chris LaCivita, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, led the Swift Boat campaign attacking Kerry in 2004.\n\nVance seized on past remarks from Walz in support of gun control shared Tuesday on social media by the Harris campaign in which the governor said, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\n\"I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance said Wednesday. \"What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq?\"\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Harris campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa reiterated that Walz retired in 2005 to run for Congress, where he later chaired the House Veterans Affairs Committee.\n\nMore:Tim Walz's military record: What to know about potential VP's National Guard service\n\nMore:Tim Walz debuts as Kamala Harris' VP pick at raucous Philly rally: Recap\n\nIn response to Vance saying Walz never carried a weapon into war, Moussa said: \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nFormer Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois - a Trump critic, Harris supporter and veteran of the Air National Guard - also pushed back at Vance's criticism.\n\n\"JD served honorably, but he wasn't kicking down doors. He was in public affairs. Which again, is fine and honorable. Tim, after he was eligible for retirement, retired. People do that,\" Kinzinger wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"If it was a real problem he would have been 'stop lossed' and prevented from retiring.\"\n\nA stop-loss refers to the involuntary extension of an individual's activity duty service enforced by the Defense Department.\n\n\"If JD Vance is going to go after Tim Walz, I would suggest he take from his own military training, his own military experience,\" said Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Harris surrogate and also a military veteran. \"Do not start with trying to attack that someone raised their hand to serve this country.\"\n\nAlthough promoted as command sergeant major, Walz retired as a master sergeant for benefit purposes in 2005 because he did not complete additional course work at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\n\"You get to sergeant major because you have a track record of taking care of your people,\" Moore said.\n\nWalz mobilized with the Minnesota National Guard Aug. 3, 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, whose primary mission was the war in Afghanistan but also had counterterrorism roles in other regions.\n\nHis 1st Battalion of the 125th Field Artillery supported security missions in Europe and Turkey, according to a statement from Lt. Col. Kristen Auge, a spokesperson for the Minnesota National Guard.\n\nWalz was stationed at Vicenza, Italy during his deployment and returned to Minnesota in April 2004, Auge said.Walz started his service in the Nebraska National Guard and finished at the Minnesota National Guard.\n\nMore:'Resurrected from the dead': Harris pick of Walz caps complete shake-up of 2024 race\n\nWalz's Republican opponents in Minnesota have criticized his exit from the military in the past, including during his 2018 and 2022 runs for governor.\n\nIn an open letter in 2018, Minnesota National Guard veteran Thomas Behrends accused Walz of pushing \"embellished and selectively omitted facts\" about his military service. The Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported that Behrends was passed over for the promotion to command sergeant major that went to Walz and described him as a \"longtime critic of the governor.\"\n\nRetired Maj. Gen. Randy Manner, who held top positions with the National Guard Bureau, called the controversy manufactured. Walz would have filed his papers for retirement long before his unit received notice that they were being mobilized for deployment. The retirement papers Walz filed take five to nine months to process, said Manner, who said he does not know Walz but plans to vote for the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"The idea that a man who served his country honorably for 24 years somehow 'cut and run' because he retired from the Guard in his 40s to pursue his next phase of life is an insult to him and everyone else who also served their nation so honorably,\" Manner said.\n\nThat same year, Walz acknowledged he never saw combat in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio.\n\n\"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,\" Walz said in 2018. \"I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Vets_and_POWs_for_Truth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swift Vets and POWs for Truth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_correspondent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War correspondent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2004 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kinzinger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Kinzinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Tim Walz, of \"stolen valor,\" charging that Vice President Kamala Harris' newly-anointed running mate \"lied\" about his military service and \"abandoned\" his unit before they were deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\nVance, a U.S. Marine veteran and the Republican Party's nominee for vice president, referenced years-old and long-disputed criticisms of Walz, who served in the National Guard for 24 years, by some soldiers who served alongside him that the then 41-year-old left the service months before their battalion was deployed to Iraq. Walz has said he left the service to pursue a run for Congress in 2006, winning his first of six terms in the House.\n\n\"What really bothers me about Tim Walz, as a Marine who served his country in uniform, when the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq, to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance said at a press conference in Shelby Township, Mich. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.\"\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through and then to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" Vance added.\n\nWalz, whose official biographies have long said he retired as a command sergeant major and billed him as \"the highest-ranking enlisted service member ever to serve in Congress,\" enlisted in the Nebraska National Guard at 17 and served in the Minnesota National Guard in the 1990s and early 2000s. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Walz was deployed to Italy as part of Operation Enduring Freedom from Aug. 2003 to April 2004.\n\nHe served as a high-ranking, non-commissioned officer in a field artillery regiment -- damaging his ear and hearing to the point of necessitating surgery, according to medical records obtained by Minnesota Public Radio -- and reached the rank of command sergeant major. However, he retired one rank lower as a master sergeant \"for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, a spokesperson for the Minnesota National Guard, told Spectrum News in a statement.\n\nIn 2018, a spokesperson for the Minnesota National Guard told MPR that it was legitimate for Walz to say he served as a command sergeant major even if he retired at a lower rank.\n\n\"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,\" Walz told MPR in 2018. \"I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nSeveral of Walz's fellow soldiers have come forward with accusations that he left the service after finding out his battalion would be deployed to Iraq. Retired Command Sgt. Maj. Tom Behrends, who served with Walz, has publicized the accusations since at least 2018, calling the governor \"a traitor\" in an interview with the New York Post on Tuesday. Behrends campaigned with and donated $2,500 to Walz's Republican opponent in 2022.\n\n\"I don't know if Tom just disagrees with my politics or whatever, but my record speaks for itself and my accomplishments in uniform speak for itself, and there's many people in this crowd, too, that I served with,\" Walz told the Minneapolis' Star Tribune in 2022. \"It's just unfortunate.\"\n\nOther soldiers who served with Walz have argued there was nothing to suggest Walz's departure from the service warrants suspicion. Retired Command Sgt. Maj. Joseph Eustice told the Star Tribune in 2022 that Walz \"was a great soldier\" and that \"when he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\" He speculated that soldiers who claimed otherwise were misinformed or even harbored grudges for being passed over for promotions.\n\nOn Wednesday, Eustice shared a Facebook post attacking Walz's tenure as governor. When asked in the comments why he was criticizing the man he once defended, Eustice responded \"he was a good soldier\" even if he now thinks Walz \"is not a good politician.\"\n\nAnother soldier who served with Walz, told MPR in 2018 that Walz had spoken at length about leaving the service to pursue a career in politics.\n\n\"Would the soldier look down on him because he didn't go with us? Would the common soldier say, 'Hey, he didn't go with us, he's trying to skip out on a deployment?' And he wasn't,\" Bonnifield said. \"He talked with us for quite a while on that subject. He weighed that decision to run for Congress very heavy. He loved the military, he loved the guard, he loved the soldiers he worked with.\"\n\nBonnifield did deploy to Iraq and returned with mental health issues that he said Walz helped connect struggling Guard members with help and worked to cut red tape as a member of Congress.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the Harris campaign said in a statement.\n\nFor his part, Vance served in the Marines for four years out of high school, the majority spent as a combat correspondent -- or \"public affairs marine,\" as he described it in his 2016 memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" In his memoir, Vance describes his time in the service as \"largely uneventful\" and writes he \"was lucky to escape any real fighting\" during a six month deployment to Iraq.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Vance said he was bothered by Walz's \"stolen valor garbage.\" He responded specifically to Walz's comments, shared by the Harris campaign on Tuesday, calling for gun control measures because \"weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place those weapons are out.\"\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone,\" Vance said. \"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\"\n\n\"I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did,\" Vance added.\n\nNotably, Vance's running mate, former President Donald Trump, never served in the military despite coming of age when the draft was still in place amid the height of the Vietnam War. In 1968, as he graduated from college, Trump was diagnosed with bone spurs and received a medical deferment from the draft.\n\n\"I had a doctor that gave me a letter -- a very strong letter on the heels,\" Mr. Trump said in 2016.\n\nIn 2018, the New York Times interviewed the daughters of a podiatrist who they claim gave Trump the diagnosis as \"a favor\" for Trump's influential real estate magnate father. The doctor rented office space from Trump's father and his partner lived in apartments owned by Trump's father, moving into the first one the same year Trump received his exemption from the draft, according to the Times.\n\n\"It's amazing, I can't even believe it. I've been so lucky in terms of that whole world, it is a dangerous world out there. It's like Vietnam, sort of,\" Trump told Howard Stern in 1997 as the pair discussed sexually transmitted diseases. \"It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier.\"", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

What to know about Walz's military record", "body": "Left: Republican Vice Presidential Candidate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, delivers remarks during a campaign rally on August 6 in Philadelphia. Right: Democratic vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks during a campaign rally on August 6 in Philadelphia. Drew Hallowell/Getty Images; Andrew Harnik/Getty Images hide caption\n\nLate Tuesday afternoon, the Harris campaign released a video of Tim Walz talking about gun control. Walz, whom Kamala Harris recently announced as her running mate, talks about banning assault rifles as part of what he calls \"common sense\" proposals.\n\n\"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz said in the video.\n\nThat was all Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance needed.\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this?\" Vance said.\n\nThe vice presidential candidate is supposed to be an attack dog, sometimes landing the lower blows that might seem unpresidential. But Vance and Walz are also both veterans, with another thing in common: neither one of them saw combat. Their service shored up each ticket, adding a military credential beside two presidential candidates that never served. It didn't seem like an issue. But in this compressed campaign season, Walz's phrasing opened up a line of attack -- and the Trump campaign took it, accusing the Minnesota governor of one of the most grievous charges possible in military circles.\n\nWalz joined the National Guard at age 17 and served 24 years, first in Nebraska then Minnesota. During that time he got called up to national disasters and a deployment to the Arctic Circle in Norway. He completed his 20 years required for retirement in 2001, but then reenlisted after the attacks on Sept. 11. His only wartime deployment was to Italy in 2003, backfilling troops that were deploying to Afghanistan. So Vance, and many veterans on social media, took issue with Walz saying he'd carried weapons \"in war.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign said in a statement: \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nBut Vance went a lot further, with an attack that the Trump campaign probably had prepared.\n\n\"What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,\" Vance said.\n\nSince Walz first ran for Congress and then governor, he's faced attacks around the timing of his retirement. Vance's accusation echoes one made by two fellow high-ranking sergeants from the Minnesota Guard who publicly attacked Walz in 2018, in a paid endorsement letter to the editor of the West Central Tribune. They slammed Walz for \"conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq.\"\n\nAccording to the Minnesota National Guard, Walz retired in May 2005, two months before his unit, the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery received an alert order for mobilization to Iraq in July 2005. It's likely that Walz put in for retirement months before that May. It's also clear that guardsmen anticipated deployment to Iraq months before July.\n\nAccording to several of his contemporaries in the guard Walz talked about it as a hard decision: that if he deployed he'd miss his best chance to run for Congress.\n\n\"He weighed that decision to run for Congress very, very heavy,\" Allan Bonnifield, who served with Walz, told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018. \"He loved the military, he loved the Guard, he loved the soldiers that he worked with, and making that decision was very tough for him. Especially knowing that we were going on another deployment to Iraq. He didn't take that decision lightly at all.\"\n\nThe unit didn't go to Iraq until March 2006, 10 months after Walz retired, where it stayed for a grueling 22-month extended deployment. The charge has dogged Walz, and in his last run for governor in 2022, it was even leveled by a political opponent who never served at all.\n\nThe latest round of attacks on Walz stirred up another confusing point about his rank. Walz served as a command sergeant major, the highest enlisted rank. But his retirement papers put him one step lower - a master sergeant. The Minnesota National Guard told NPR that Walz retired before completing academic requirements to keep the higher rank.\n\n\"He held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion. He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" said Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, the Minnesota National Guard's state public affairs officer.\n\nSo while Walz can say he served as a command sergeant major, which also made him the highest enlisted member serving in Congress, and he can even get away with saying he retired as a command sergeant major, he cannot say he is a \"retired command sergeant major.\" On Thursday the Harris campaign changed Walz's official bio on their website to reflect that.\n\nAttacking an opponent's military service has a short history in presidential campaigns - the verb \"swiftboat\" dates back only 20 years, when George W. Bush's campaign attacked combat-decorated John Kerry's military service in Vietnam, which might have seemed risky since Bush avoided serving there. Donald Trump, who also avoided going to Vietnam, took the tactic to another level, attacking his GOP critic John McCain's storied status as a POW. Now, Harris supporters are claiming that Vance is trying to \"swiftboat\" Walz, and even pointing to a member of the Bush-era campaign who is now working for Trump.\n\nVeterans groups are generally keeping out of the fray; many veterans service organizations are on record praising the choice of two enlisted military veterans as vice-presidential nominees.\n\n\"This means that regardless of the outcome in November, the next vice president of the United States will be a former enlisted service member. I am pleased to see both major parties recognize that military service is once again a valued experience in choosing the candidate for the second highest position in the country,\" Veterans of Foreign Wars National Commander Al Lipphardt said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "quil_lawrence@npr.org", "name": "Quil Lawrence",

What to know about Walz's military record", "body": "Late Tuesday afternoon, the Harris campaign released a video of Tim Walz talking about gun control. Walz, whom Kamala Harris recently announced as her running mate, talks about banning assault rifles as part of what he calls \"common sense\" proposals.\n\n\"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz said in the video.\n\nThat was all Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance needed.\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this?\" Vance said.\n\nThe vice presidential candidate is supposed to be an attack dog, sometimes landing the lower blows that might seem unpresidential. But Vance and Walz are also both veterans, with another thing in common: neither one of them saw combat. Their service shored up each ticket, adding a military credential beside two presidential candidates that never served. It didn't seem like an issue. But in this compressed campaign season, Walz's phrasing opened up a line of attack -- and the Trump campaign took it, accusing the Minnesota governor of one of the most grievous charges possible in military circles.\n\nWalz joined the National Guard at age 17 and served 24 years, first in Nebraska then Minnesota. During that time he got called up to national disasters and a deployment to the Arctic Circle in Norway. He completed his 20 years required for retirement in 2001, but then reenlisted after the attacks on Sept. 11. His only wartime deployment was to Italy in 2003, backfilling troops that were deploying to Afghanistan. So Vance, and many veterans on social media, took issue with Walz saying he'd carried weapons \"in war.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign said in a statement: \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nBut Vance went a lot further, with an attack that the Trump campaign probably had prepared.\n\n\"What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,\" Vance said.\n\nSince Walz first ran for Congress and then governor, he's faced attacks around the timing of his retirement. Vance's accusation echoes one made by two fellow high-ranking sergeants from the Minnesota Guard who publicly attacked Walz in 2018, in a paid endorsement letter to the editor of the West Central Tribune. They slammed Walz for \"conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq.\"\n\nAccording to the Minnesota National Guard, Walz retired in May 2005, two months before his unit, the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery received an alert order for mobilization to Iraq in July 2005. It's likely that Walz put in for retirement months before that May. It's also clear that guardsmen anticipated deployment to Iraq months before July.\n\nAccording to several of his contemporaries in the guard Walz talked about it as a hard decision: that if he deployed he'd miss his best chance to run for Congress.\n\n\"He weighed that decision to run for Congress very, very heavy,\" Allan Bonnifield, who served with Walz, told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018. \"He loved the military, he loved the Guard, he loved the soldiers that he worked with, and making that decision was very tough for him. Especially knowing that we were going on another deployment to Iraq. He didn't take that decision lightly at all.\"\n\nThe unit didn't go to Iraq until March 2006, 10 months after Walz retired, where it stayed for a grueling 22-month extended deployment. The charge has dogged Walz, and in his last run for governor in 2022, it was even leveled by a political opponent who never served at all.\n\nThe latest round of attacks on Walz stirred up another confusing point about his rank. Walz served as a command sergeant major, the highest enlisted rank. But his retirement papers put him one step lower - a master sergeant. The Minnesota National Guard told NPR that Walz retired before completing academic requirements to keep the higher rank.\n\n\"He held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion. He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" said Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, the Minnesota National Guard's state public affairs officer.\n\nSo while Walz can say he served as a command sergeant major, which also made him the highest enlisted member serving in Congress, and he can even get away with saying he retired as a command sergeant major, he cannot say he is a \"retired command sergeant major.\" On Thursday the Harris campaign changed Walz's official bio on their website to reflect that.\n\nAttacking an opponent's military service has a short history in presidential campaigns - the verb \"swiftboat\" dates back only 20 years, when George W. Bush's campaign attacked combat-decorated John Kerry's military service in Vietnam, which might have seemed risky since Bush avoided serving there. Donald Trump, who also avoided going to Vietnam, took the tactic to another level, attacking his GOP critic John McCain's storied status as a POW. Now, Harris supporters are claiming that Vance is trying to \"swiftboat\" Walz, and even pointing to a member of the Bush-era campaign who is now working for Trump.\n\nVeterans groups are generally keeping out of the fray; many veterans service organizations are on record praising the choice of two enlisted military veterans as vice-presidential nominees.\n\n\"This means that regardless of the outcome in November, the next vice president of the United States will be a former enlisted service member. I am pleased to see both major parties recognize that military service is once again a valued experience in choosing the candidate for the second highest position in the country,\" Veterans of Foreign Wars National Commander Al Lipphardt said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "weku.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "weku.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Circle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arctic Circle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assault rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enlisted rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Public_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Public Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

Tim Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for 24 years, did not.\n\n\"You know what really bothers me about Tim Walz, as a Marine who served his country in uniform? When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance said. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nWalz faced the same criticism in 2018 when he ran for governor of Minnesota, and again when he sought reelection four years later. In an open letter posted on Facebook in 2018, Thomas Behrends, a retired command sergeant major from the Minnesota National Guard, claimed Walz retired after his unit received a warning order \"in early 2005\" that it would deploy to Iraq.\n\n\"His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for Congress,\" the letter said.\n\nA public affairs officer for the Minnesota National Guard said Wednesday, however, that the unit \"received an alert order for mobilization to Iraq on July 14, 2005.\" Walz had retired two months earlier, in May.\n\nIt's not clear, however, if Walz has ever disputed Behrends' timeline of his departure. A spokesperson for the Democratic presidential campaign did not immediately do so on Wednesday. It's possible the unit had received an unofficial warning prior to the alert order.\n\nBehrends also said Walz exaggerated his rank when he served in Congress, saying he should not have identified himself as a retired command sergeant major. The Minneapolis National Guard said Walz attained that rank before he retired in May 2005, but reverted to master sergeant because he didn't finish coursework needed to maintain the rank in retirement.\n\nOthers who served with Walz have said the criticism of his departure is off-target.\n\n\"He was a great soldier,\" Joseph Eustice, another National Guard veteran, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 2022. \"When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\nBut Vance went further than just criticizing Walz's departure from the Army. He also pointed to a video clip recently posted by Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign in which Walz talks about gun control and banning assault weapons.\n\n\"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are out,\" Walz said in the clip.\n\n\"What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq?\" Vance said. \"What bothers me about Tim Waltz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\"\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign did not directly address Vance's comments.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nOther Harris allies, however, suggested Walz's record stacked up favorably compared to Vance's.", "source": {"uri":

A 2005 statement from his website indicates Walz was initially prepared to deploy to Iraq amid his bid for Congress. CBS News has asked Walz for comment on when he decided to retire.\n\nWalz retired from the Minnesota Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery in 2005 after more than 24 years in service, the Minnesota Army National Guard told CBS News.\n\nWalz first enlisted in the Nebraska Army National Guard in April 1981, serving as an infantry senior sergeant and administrative specialist. In 1996, Walz transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard, where he first worked as a cannon crewmember and field artillery senior sergeant.\n\nMinnesota National Guard spokesperson Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9 told CBS News that Walz \"held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant, and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion.\"\n\nWalz earned several Army commendation and achievement medals during his more than 24 years of service.\n\nWalz deployed in August 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. The Minnesota National Guard told CBS News the battalion supported security missions at various locations in Europe and Turkey. Walz was stationed at Vicenza, Italy, at the time and returned to Minnesota in April 2004.\n\nOn Wednesday, Vance resurfaced claims that Walz retired from the National Guard to avoid deploying to Iraq.\n\n\"When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America, asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service,\" said Vance.\n\nHe added: \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people he served with.\"\n\nThe claims first gained prominence when Walz ran for governor of Minnesota in 2018. At the time, retired Army veterans Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, who both served as command sergeant majors, posted on Facebook a lengthy letter accusing Walz of \"embellishing\" his military career and abandoning his Army National Guard battalion ahead of a 2005 deployment to Iraq.\n\nIn the letter, Behrends and Herr write that in early 2005, Walz's unit -- 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery -- was slated to deploy to Iraq. At the time, Walz was serving as the unit's command sergeant major.\n\nBehrends and Herr claimed that from the time the unit was told to prepare for an Iraq deployment and when Walz retired, he told other Army leaders he would be going to Iraq but later resigned his position before the deployment to avoid going to a combat zone.\n\nWalz has said he left the guard to run for Congress, according to the Star Tribune. In 2006, Walz won his election to Congress against a six-term Republican incumbent.\n\nRecords show Walz officially filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 10, 2005.\n\nIn March 2005, the National Guard announced a possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard, according to an archived press release from Tim Walz for U.S. Congress.\n\n\"I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on the specifics of the deployment,\" said Walz in the March 2005 statement.\n\nThe statement continued: \"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or Iraq,\" said Walz, who indicated at the time he had no plans to drop out of the race. \"I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic support and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.\"\n\nThe Minnesota Army National Guard told CBS News that Walz retired on May 16, 2005. CBS News has asked Walz to clarify when he submitted his retirement papers.\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard told CBS News that Walz's unit -- 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery -- received an alert order for mobilization to Iraq on July 14, 2005 - two months after Walz retired, according to Lt. Col. Ryan Rossman, who serves as the Minnesota National Guard's director of operations. The official mobilization order was received on August 14 of the same year, and the unit mobilized in October.\n\nCBS News reviewed the deployment history for the Minnesota Army National Guard which shows that in the fall of 2005, 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery was mobilized in preparation for a deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The battalion trained at Camp Shelby in Mississippi and deployed to Iraq as a motorized security task force.\n\nIn 2018, Tom Hagen, a military reservist who served in Iraq, wrote a letter to The Winona Daily News claiming Walz was not being candid about his service record and wanted people to know that the future Minnesota governor did not serve in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nWalz responded in the same newspaper and criticized Hagan as dishonoring a fellow veteran, according to MPR News. Walz wrote: \"There's a code of honor among those who've served, and normally this type of partisan political attack only comes from one who's never worn a uniform.\"\n\nJoseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the guard who also led Walz's battalion, told the Star Tribune in Oct. 2022 that the governor fulfilled his duty.\n\n\"He was a great soldier. When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave,\" said Eustice.\n\nOfficial biographies on the Minnesota government website and Vice President Kamala Harris' website describe Walz as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\" However, documents reviewed by CBS News show this is not accurate; while Walz served at one point as a command sergeant major, he retired at a lower rank.\n\nArmy veteran Anthony Anderson, who routinely obtains military records from the Defense Department using the Freedom of Information Act and has worked with CBS News on similar stories, provided Walz's records for review. CBS News has also requested the documents from the National Guard.\n\nOne of the documents shows Walz reverted back to master sergeant from command sergeant major when he retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005.\n\nArmy soldiers promoted to the rank of sergeant major or command sergeant major are required to attend the Sergeants Major Course, or what was formerly known as the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nLt. Col. Aug\u00e9, the Minnesota National Guard spokesperson, told CBS News that Walz retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for \"benefit purposes\" because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nWhile Walz can say he served as a command sergeant major in the Minnesota Army National Guard, his official biographies are incorrect in referring to him as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tim Walz.\n\nThey removed reference to Walz as a 'retired command sergeant major' and now say he once served at the command sergeant rank.\n\nWalz retired from 24 years in the National Guard in 2005 to run for Congress. He did serve as a command sergeant major, but was reverted back to master sergeant as he left the military because he had not completed the coursework for the higher rank.\n\n'The son of an Army veteran and a retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard himself, Walz was the ranking member on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, where he passed legislation to help stem veterans' suicides,' the campaign website read as of Wednesday.\n\nNow, that line begins with: 'The son of an Army veteran who served as a command sergeant major....'\n\nWalz retired from the Guard just two months before his unit deployed to Iraq - a fact his Republican detractors have seized on.\n\nThe current Walz biography on Harris' website\n\nThe original bio, as of Wednesday\n\nThey've also accused him of inflating his credentials by calling himself a 'retired command sergeant major.'\n\nIt's not the first time the matter has come up. During his 2018 race for governor, two retired command sergeant majors wrote a paid letter to the editor accusing Walz of misrepresenting his rank on the campaign trail.\n\n'Walz attained the rank of command sergeant major and served in that role but retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes due to not completing additional coursework,' Army public affairs officer Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9 said in a past statement to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.\n\nIn 2003, Walz deployed to Italy in a support position of active military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan but not to a combat zone himself.\n\nHarris picked Walz to be her running mate on Wednesday\n\nTim Walz from his younger years in the National Guard\n\nAmid his congressional bid in March 2005, the Walz campaign put out a statement signaling he still planned to stay in the race despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nShortly after Harris announced Walz as her VP pick, a 2018 clip of Walz advocating for gun control resurfaced.\n\n'We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,' Walz said at the time. Donald Trump's running mate J.D. Vance said he felt Walz's implication that he had served in combat was 'stolen valor garbage.'\n\nReports quickly resurfaced of anger among his former brothers in arms who accused him of 'betraying' his country just as they were preparing for deployment.\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends of the Minnesota National Guard accused Walz of having 'embellished' his record and of having abandoned his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress.\n\n'In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq,' he wrote on Facebook in 2018.\n\nRead MoreEXCLUSIVE My son, 19, was killed in Iraq serving in the military unit Tim Walz 'abandoned': I'll never trust Kamala Harris' VP pick who took the 'coward's way out'\n\n'On May 16th, 2005, he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.'\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 as a Naval intelligence officer, said the criticism was 'strategic' because the Trump campaign 'needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.'\n\nRep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., a former Marine Corps infantry officer who deployed to Afghanistan, told NBC News: 'If I were Donald Trump, with five deferments from Vietnam ... I would be very cautious about opening the door to attacks on those who served honorably.'\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris served in the military. Trump received a series of deferments in the Vietnam War, including one with a physician's letter stating that he suffered bone spurs in his feet.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Veterans Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant colonel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Auchincloss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Auchincloss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Democrats have defended Walz, but even those remarks have resulted in pushback.\n\nResponding to an X post from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg that said, \"Walz served honorably and well\" and accused the GOP ticket of attacking Walz to avoid discussing policy issues, Meghan McCain said Thursday, \"Respectfully, there are a lot of veterans and active military people in my life who are far from Trump supporters who are very upset about what Walz has misrepresented.\n\n\"This isn't strategic, it's at best confusing and at worst stolen valor,\" she wrote.\n\nSome veterans, however, have sided with Walz, slamming Vance for trying to discredit Walz's service by questioning his resume and suggesting that he intentionally left before his unit's Iraq deployment.\n\n\"It's unbecoming and unprofessional for anyone -- especially veterans -- to openly disparage anyone who has served in uniform,\" Retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, a former commander of American ground forces in Europe, tweeted. \"I'm personally very thankful for all who have worn the cloth of our country -- for any amount of time -- and who have served in our professional force.\"\n\n\"Let's be clear, you served honorably, including 6 months in combat in a public affairs unit. Walz retired after 24 years and achieved the rank of command Sergeant Major. I do not think you want to compare service records,\" Alexander Vindman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, added.\n\nBoth Walz and Vance are veterans, although neither served in combat. Here's how their records stack up against one another:\n\nWalz served 24 years with the Minnesota National Guard between 1981 and 2005, transferring from the Nebraska National Guard. He reached the rank of command sergeant major, a leadership position within his battalion.\n\nHe was also deployed to the Arctic Circle and Italy throughout his time with the National Guard. The deployment to Europe was to support Operation Enduring Freedom, which was centered in Afghanistan as part of the War on Terror. Walz himself was never deployed to Afghanistan.\n\nHis battalion would later be deployed to Iraq, but he retired two months before the directive was issued. He filed his paperwork to run for office in February 2005, the order would come to his unit in August and they would be mobilized in October.\n\nSome have questioned the timing of his departure, but some of those who served with him, like Retired Command Sergeant Major Joseph Eustice, who told ABC News that he left to run for Congress months before reports emerged about a possible deployment. Al Bonnifield, who also served with Walz, also said his colleague weighed the decision \"for a long time.\"\n\n\"He was trying to decide where he could do better for soldiers, for veterans, for the country,\" Bonnifield said.\n\nWalz has acknowledged that he's never served in active combat, but a video clip tweeted by the Harris campaign also shows the governor telling an audience that he carried guns \"in war\" while advocating for gun reform.\n\n\"We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" he said.\n\nThose comments have come under scrutiny from Vance, who has accused Walz of \"pretend[ing[ to be something that [he's] not.\"\n\nThere have also been speculations about the rank at which Walz retired and whether they align with his official biography.\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard said Wednesday that Walz did not retire as a command sergeant major \"because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\" Walz would have had to serve that particular role for three years to retire under that rank officially, but he did not achieve that rank until September 2004, five months before his retirement.\n\nVance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating from high school in 2003 and would go on to serve for a total of four years. In 2005, he spent six months in Iraq as a military journalist.\n\nHe wrote in his memoir that he was \"lucky to escape any real fighting,\" but on Wednesday, he stressed that he still \"served in a combat zone.\"\n\n\"I never said that I saw a firefight myself, but I've always told the truth about my Marine Corps service. That's the difference,\" Vance said.\n\nHe left the Marine Corps in 2007 as a corporal to attend Ohio State University.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"},

Tim Walz.\n\nThey removed reference to Walz as a 'retired command sergeant major' and now say he once served at the command sergeant rank.\n\nWalz retired from 24 years in the National Guard in 2005 to run for Congress. He did serve as a command sergeant major, but was reverted back to master sergeant as he left the military because he had not completed the coursework for the higher rank.\n\n'The son of an Army veteran and a retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard himself, Walz was the ranking member on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, where he passed legislation to help stem veterans' suicides,' the campaign website read as of Wednesday.\n\nNow, that line begins with: 'The son of an Army veteran who served as a command sergeant major....'\n\nWalz retired from the Guard just two months before his unit deployed to Iraq - a fact his Republican detractors have seized on.\n\nThe current Walz biography on Harris' website\n\nThe original bio, as of Wednesday\n\nThey've also accused him of inflating his credentials by calling himself a 'retired command sergeant major.'\n\nIt's not the first time the matter has come up. During his 2018 race for governor, two retired command sergeant majors wrote a paid letter to the editor accusing Walz of misrepresenting his rank on the campaign trail.\n\n'Walz attained the rank of command sergeant major and served in that role but retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes due to not completing additional coursework,' Army public affairs officer Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9 said in a past statement to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.\n\nThe Harris campaign also released a statement saying that Walz 'chaired' the Veterans' Affairs Committee. He did not - he served as the ranking member. The campaign later said the statement had been made in error.\n\nIn 2003, Walz deployed to Italy in a support position of active military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan but not to a combat zone himself.\n\nHarris picked Walz to be her running mate on Wednesday\n\nTim Walz from his younger years in the National Guard\n\nAmid his congressional bid in March 2005, the Walz campaign put out a statement signaling he still planned to stay in the race despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nShortly after Harris announced Walz as her VP pick, a 2018 clip of Walz advocating for gun control resurfaced.\n\n'We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,' Walz said at the time. Donald Trump's running mate J.D. Vance said he felt Walz's implication that he had served in combat was 'stolen valor garbage.'\n\nReports quickly resurfaced of anger among his former brothers in arms who accused him of 'betraying' his country just as they were preparing for deployment.\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends of the Minnesota National Guard accused Walz of having 'embellished' his record and of having abandoned his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress.\n\n'In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq,' he wrote on Facebook in 2018.\n\n'On May 16th, 2005, he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.'\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 as a Naval intelligence officer, said the criticism was 'strategic' because the Trump campaign 'needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.'\n\nRep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., a former Marine Corps infantry officer who deployed to Afghanistan, told NBC News: 'If I were Donald Trump, with five deferments from Vietnam ... I would be very cautious about opening the door to attacks on those who served honorably.'\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris served in the military. Trump received a series of deferments in the Vietnam War, including one with a physician's letter stating that he suffered bone spurs in his feet.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Veterans'_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_member", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ranking member"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant colonel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Auchincloss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Auchincloss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz, Republicans are mounting attacks on his military record. The charges, which a closer look suggests are misleading or exaggerated, are a notable escalation against the Democratic ticket by the Trump campaign.\n\nThe attacks began in earnest on August 7, when Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, President Donald Trump's running mate, sought to tout his own military experience compared to Walz's. Prior to running for Congress, Walz served for 24 years in the Army National Guard, while Vance served for four years in the Marine Corps. Neither has seen combat.\n\n\"When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America, asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service,\" Vance said. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nBut Vance's sweeping statement contains some key omissions. For instance, Walz retired in 2005, two months before his unit received formal notice it would be sent to Iraq. Another Republican attack on Walz's service -- that he misrepresented himself as a retired command sergeant major -- is also more complicated: While he held that rank at one point, his rank was changed after retirement because he did not complete the required coursework.\n\nYet another claim by Republicans is that Walz misrepresented his service by implying in a past statement that he once served in a combat zone. In that case, the language he used appears to have been imprecise.\n\nThere is precedent for these types of attacks: Republicans appear to be resorting to the same \"swift-boating\" tactics that they once levied against former Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. A reference to the small speedboats used in the Vietnam War where Kerry served, the campaign sought to impugn his character by casting doubt on his account of military service in Vietnam.\n\nNotably, the architect of that campaign against Kerry was Chris LaCivita -- now a prominent staffer on former President Donald Trump's 2024 campaign.\n\nWalz has faced questions about his military service before, including when he ran for Minnesota governor in 2018. And in that instance -- and this one -- he's had several veterans defend him as well. Joseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the National Guard, told the Minnesota Star Tribune in 2022, \"He was a great soldier. When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign for its part has responded by stressing Walz's tenure and policy record. \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform,\" the Harris campaign told Vox in a statement. The campaign also pointed to Walz's time as a ranking member on the House Veteran Affairs Committee and his support for funding and mental health resources for the military.\n\nThe claims that Republicans have made about Walz focus on three issues: his decision to retire from the Army National Guard in 2005, his rank upon retirement, and a comment he made about carrying weapons \"in war.\" Here's what we know about each of them.\n\nWhat we know: Notably, Walz retired in May 2005, two months prior to his unit receiving an official deployment order to Iraq. He stated in 2009 that his reasons for retiring were to pursue a run for the House of Representatives, which he won the following year, and to avoid conflicts under the Hatch Act, which bars federal employees from engaging in certain political activities.\n\nWalz filed for his run for office before the National Guard had notified his unit of the possibility of a deployment to Iraq. It's unclear if, at the time, he already knew that a deployment could be a possibility.\n\nBelow is a more detailed timeline of how this all unfolded.\n\nFebruary 10, 2005: Walz files paperwork with the Federal Election Commission declaring his candidacy for the House seat in Minnesota's First Congressional District.\n\nMarch 17, 2005: The National Guard informs members of the possibility of deployment to Iraq within the next two years. The public affairs office notes that 2,000 members could be sent from the Minnesota National Guard, which could include part of, or the entirety of, Walz's battalion.\n\nMarch 20, 2005: Walz issues a statement responding to the National Guard notice, saying he intends to continue to serve, and to continue his run for Congress.\n\n\"I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment,\" he said. \"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq.\"\n\nMay 16, 2005: Walz retires from the National Guard, according to a comment the Minnesota Army National Guard provided CBS News.\n\nOn the Harris campaign website and a Minnesota government website, Walz had been listed as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major,\" according to CBS News.\n\nRepublicans have argued that this is an inaccurate description of his title. That phrase has now been changed on the Harris campaign website to note that this title was the highest rank he earned.\n\nWhat we know: Walz did, in fact, attain the position of Command Sergeant Major. However, after he retired, his title was changed to Master Sergeant, because he did not finish the coursework required to retire under the promoted title.\n\nAs a result, it's accurate to say that he was once a Command Sergeant Major, but not that he was a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\"\n\n\"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz said in remarks about an assault weapons ban in 2018.\n\nVance argues that Walz's statements imply that he was in combat when he wasn't.\n\nWhat we know: Walz was deployed as part of the National Guard to Vicenza, Italy, in August 2003 as part of Operation Enduring Freedom but was not in a combat zone.\n\nThe phrasing of the statement in his gun control remarks, suggesting that he carried the weapons \"in war,\" was imprecise. While technically correct given the operation he was part of, it appears to suggest an experience he didn't have. Walz has openly acknowledged in other interviews that he hadn't seen combat while deployed.\n\nThe Harris campaign has stressed Walz's training with firearms in response. \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" the Harris campaign told Vox in a statement. \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

It is illegal under federal law to falsely claim military service with the intent to deceive others.\n\nWhile there is no proof that Walz is guilty of such deception, there are doubts about how Walz has discussed his service, such as his assertions that he carried a weapon \"in war,\" despite never engaging in active combat.\n\nWalz released a statement asserting that during his 24 years of service, he handled, fired, and trained others in using military weapons countless times. He emphasized that he would never diminish or disrespect anyone's service to the country and expressed gratitude towards Senator Vance for his service. He described this as the American way.\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard as tensions in Iraq were escalating in order to pursue a career in politics.\n\nBy 2005, Tim Walz had completed 24 years in the Army National Guard and had reached the rank of command sergeant major, the highest enlisted rank in his unit with significant responsibilities.\n\nThere was a possibility that Walz's unit would be deployed to a war zone, as Pentagon officials aimed to safeguard the new coalition government in Iraq and prevent a civil war.\n\nWalz, a vocal critic of the Bush administration's military strategies, with a young daughter at the time, chose to submit his retirement papers in May and run for public office.\n\nWalz succeeded in flipping a Minnesota House seat from Republican to Democrat, becoming the highest-ranking enlisted veteran to serve in Congress.\n\nAccording to National Guard records, the 1st Battalion of the 125th Field Artillery received an alert order on July 14, 2005, two months after Walz's retirement. The unit was mobilized in October after receiving a mobilization order in August.\n\nRetired command sergeant major Joseph Eustice, who served alongside Walz, revealed that while there were speculations of deployment at the time, it was only in July that there was a clear indication of Walz's unit potentially being sent to Iraq.\n\nEustice recalled how Walz grappled with the dilemma of serving as a legislator while hesitating to request a deferment to do so.\n\n\"He had a limited timeframe to make a decision. At the time of his decision-making, we had not received deployment orders. There were only rumors.\" There were numerous speculations, and the destination remained unknown until later on, around early summer, I believe,\" Eustice shared with ABC News.\n\nVance expressed that Walz, in his capacity as a command sergeant major at that time, should not have permitted his unit to deploy without him.\n\n\"I find it disgraceful to ready [a] unit for deployment to Iraq, make a commitment to follow through, and then withdraw right before the actual deployment. I also consider it to be deceitful,\" Vance stated.\n\nWalz and Harris campaign officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean Pierre emphasized his track record as an individual who enlisted at age 17 and spent over two decades in the Army National Guard \"speaks for itself.\"\n\nWalz held the position of command sergeant major but did not retain the role long enough to maintain it upon retirement.\n\nThere is no proof that Walz violated any regulations by retiring when he did. According to the National Guard, after more than 20 years of service with the National Guard, an individual can retire at any point, regardless of their contract status.\n\nWalz enlisted in the Nebraska National Guard at the age of 17, later transferring to the Minnesota National Guard, accumulating a total of 24 years of service.\n\nAccording to experts, Walz's retirement would have needed approval from his commanding officer. Officials mention that retirement requests can be declined if a Guard unit is mobilized, although the final decision rests with the unit commander.\n\nIt is worth noting that Walz still maintains the title of command sergeant major on his website.\n\nIndeed, Walz attained that rank in September 2004 through his service. However, he would need to fulfill that specific position for three years in order to officially retire as one, as stated by the National Guard.\n\n\"Following a span of 24 years in the Army National Guard, Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005,\" as reported on the governor's website.\n\nWalz confirmed that he bore a firearm \"in conflict,\" although he has also admitted he never engaged in direct combat.\n\nIn a video clip shared by the Harris campaign on Tuesday, Walz informs an audience that he wielded firearms \"in conflict\" while advocating for restrictions on gun accessibility.\n\n\"We have the ability to study the repercussions of gun violence. We can ensure that those weapons used in conflict, which I carried in conflict, are exclusively used in conflict,\" Walz expressed.\n\nDuring his service, Walz would have carried a firearm when the U.S. was involved in warfare post the 9/11 attacks, including a mission to Italy in 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nYet, there is no proof that Walz ever partook in active combat, and he has acknowledged this in a 2018 interview with Minnesota Public Radio.\n\n\"I am aware that there are definitely individuals who did more than I did. I acknowledge that,\" Walz stated. \"I am willing to admit that I gained more from my military experience than what I contributed, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities and beyond.\"\n\nNevertheless, Vance argues that Walz's reference to carrying a firearm \"in conflict\" rather than \"during conflict\" constitutes stolen valor.\n\n\"What irks me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor nonsense. Do not pretend to be something you are not,\" he remarked.\n\nVance, a former Marine who served in Iraq, mentioned in his memoir that he was \"fortunate to evade any real combat.\"\n\n\"I served in a combat area. I never claimed to have witnessed a firefight firsthand, but I have always been truthful about my service in the Marine Corps. That is the distinction,\" Vance stated on Wednesday.\n\nABC News' Isabella Murray and Alex Presha contributed to this report.\n\nRewrite and substitute words with different synonyms while altering the structure of the sentence.", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pehal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enlisted rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

Vance nailed Democratic Governor Tim Walz yesterday for Walz's bailing out of a deployment to Iraq so he could run for Congress.\n\nA former U.S. Marine who served in Iraq, Vance also accused Walz of \"stolen valor\" -- perhaps referring to the 2013 Stolen Valor Act, which made it illegal to profit from fraudulent military service -- because Walz suggested that he served in combat.\n\nThe comments came after the controversy about Walz's service, and what rank he actually held when he retired after more than two decades in the National Guard, went viral on social media. The controversy erupted almost immediately after Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris picked Walz as her running mate for the November election.\n\nThe Harris presidential campaign defended Walz, but can't explain away either his past or his words.\n\nVance was speaking in Michigan when he directly attacked Walz's integrity and military record.\n\n\"When the United State Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance said:\n\nI did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.\n\nVance said it was \"shameful\" that Walz, as a command sergeant major, didn't join his unit.\n\nHe also noted that Walz lied about his military record in a statement on gun control.\n\nVance explained that Walz \"said we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets.\" He noted that Harris' campaign likely regrets publicizing the remarks.\n\nThe Harris campaign released just such a statement from Walz. \"I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt,\" he said:\n\nI've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\n\nVance zeroed Walz in a brutal rejoinder.\n\nHe asked, \"I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\":\n\nWhen was this ... what was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq? And he has not spent a day in a combat zone. What bothers me about Tim Walz is the \"stolen valor\" garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not. ... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\n\nVance isn't the only GOP veteran who questions Walz's service.\n\nRepresentative Mike Waltz of Florida, a former Green Beret, said the same thing. He added that Walz did not retire from the military as a command sergeant major, as The New American reported yesterday.\n\n\"I've seen the reports on Tim Walz's military record and he has some explaining to do,\" Waltz said over a video in which he explains the problem with Walz's record.\n\n\"A lot of discussion out there in the veterans community about Governor Tim Walz's military record. And I think it boils down to two issues,\" Waltz said:\n\nOne is the fact that he's described himself over his political career as a sergeant major, as the highest enlisted rank in the Army. He was promoted to sergeant major; but then in order to stay in that rank, you have to complete certain training.\n\nWalz did not complete training at the sergeant major's academy, as two command sergeant majors explained six years ago in a paid letter to the West Central Tribune. Walz was demoted to master sergeant before he retired. But Waltz said the bigger issue is \"walking away from his soldiers after they had been called to go to Iraq.\"\n\nContinued Waltz:\n\nIt's kind of like the quarterback of a big team walking away from their team right before they go to the Super Bowl. I've never heard anything like it, especially the fact that he was a command sergeant major. I've never heard of the commander, a sergeant major stepping away from their unit before they go down range. The media needs to do their job and ask these tough questions. And Walz needs to answer them. The veterans community, for one, is demanding an explanation of why he didn't fulfill his duty as a command sergeant major and go into harm's way with the men and women he was leading.\n\nWalz's \"stolen valor\" aside, the Harris campaign says that he rose through the ranks to command sergeant major and \"retired as the highest-ranking enlisted National Guard soldier in southern Minnesota.\"\n\nThat's only true if Master Sergeant Walz was, indeed, \"the highest-ranking enlisted National Guard soldier in southern Minnesota\" when he retired.\n\nWalz did not retire as a command sergeant major, according to the above-noted letter in the West Central Tribune.\n\nWalz retired from the Guard to run for Congress in May 2005, just before his unit was deployed to Iraq. \"On September 10th, 2005 conditionally promoted Command Sergeant Major Walz was reduced to Master Sergeant,\" the letter says.\n\nLike the Harris campaign, Walz's biography at his governor's webpage strongly suggests that he retired as a command sergeant major.", "source": {"uri": "thenewamerican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New American"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_cort_kirkwood@thenewamerican.com", "name": "R.

Tim Walz's military record after Vice President Kamala Harris named him as her running mate this week.\n\nHere's a look at the issue:\n\nHe retired before his unit's deployment to Iraq\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard. But it's his retirement in 2005 that's prompting criticism from some Republicans who are suggesting he abandoned his team to pursue a campaign for Congress.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nThere is no evidence that Walz timed his departure with the intent of avoiding deployment. But the fact remains that he left ahead of his unit's departure. In a statement, the Harris campaign pushed back on GOP characterizations of Walz's service, and also noted that he advocated for veterans once he was elected to the US House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nBefore leaving Detroit, where she and Walz played up their support for organized labor, Harris on Thursday responded to a question about the criticism of her running mate's record.\n\n\"Listen, I praise anyone who has presented themselves to serve our country,\" she said. \"And I think that we all should.\"\n\nWalz didn't serve in a combat zone\n\nEarlier this week Harris' campaign circulated on X a 2018 clip of Walz speaking out against gun violence, and saying, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\" That comment suggests that Walz portrayed himself as someone who spent time in a combat zone.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard. In 2003, he deployed to Italy in a support position of active military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he was not in a combat zone himself.\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Wednesday as he campaigned in Michigan. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nVance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, serving four years as a combat correspondent, a type of military journalist, and deploying to Iraq in that capacity in 2005.\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris has served in the US military. Trump received a series of deferments during Vietnam, including one attained with a physician's letter stating that he suffered from bone spurs in his feet.\n\nThe Harris campaign statement said Walz \"would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country\" and \"thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nWhat about his rank?\n\nHarris' campaign has referred to Walz as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major,\" one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. He did in fact achieve that rank, but personnel files show he was reduced in rank months after retiring. That left him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes.\n\nMinnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the US Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@arab.news", "name": "Associated

Tim Walz at a campaign event in Philadelphia on Tuesday, his first with Vice President Kamala Harris since being announced as her running mate earlier in the day. Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post\n\nTim Walz was weighing a life-altering decision when he stepped into a supply room at the National Guard Armory in New Ulm, Minn., nearly two decades ago. He closed the door behind him, recalled a colleague, Al Bonnifield, and confided he was considering whether to leave their unit even though it was preparing to go to war so he could run for Congress.\n\n\"It was a very long conversation behind closed doors,\" said Bonnifield. \"He was trying to decide where he could do better for soldiers, for veterans, for the country. He weighed that for a long time.\"\n\nWalz, 60, ultimately chose to leave the Guard in 2005 and went on to win a House seat the following year, unseating a Republican incumbent as a populist wave of opposition to the Iraq War lifted Democrats to a majority of both chambers of Congress. That jump-started a political career that saw him elected governor of Minnesota in 2018 and, this week, selected as Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in a heated race for the White House.\n\nBut while Walz and his political allies have cited his 24 years of military experience as an asset, the circumstances of his departure from the National Guard and his characterization of his service already have come under attack. At least three former Guard colleagues have publicly voiced bitterness at Walz's decision to leave their unit at such a consequential moment. It's not clear how widespread that feeling was, but the Trump campaign has moved quickly to capitalize on the issue.\n\n\"Nobody wants to go to war. I didn't want to go, but I went,\" Doug Julin, a retired National Guard soldier who worked with Walz, said in an interview. \"The big frustration was that he let his troops down.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign did not address criticisms from fellow soldiers that he retired to avoid going to war. Instead, the campaign said that while in Congress he was a \"tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform.\" As vice president, the campaign said in a statement to The Washington Post, \"he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalz, a native of West Point, Neb., enlisted in the Nebraska Army National Guard at age 17. His father served during the Korean War era, and urged both him and his sister to enlist, Walz said during a 2009 interview for an oral history project by the Library of Congress. Walz shifted to the Minnesota Army National Guard in 1996 after relocating with his wife, Gwen. He was activated for a variety of missions, including responses to forest fires, tornadoes and flooding.\n\nOn Wednesday, Walz also came under scrutiny for saying during a gubernatorial campaign event in 2018 that \"we can make sure those weapons of war that I carried in war\" are not on America's streets. Walz did not serve in combat, according to the Minnesota Army National Guard, and his Republican counterpart jumped on those comments.\n\n\"He said we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets,\" JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, said during a campaign event in Michigan. \"Well, I wonder. Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\"\n\nThe Harris campaign, in response to those comments, said in its statement to The Post that Walz carried, fired and trained others how to use \"weapons of war innumerable times.\" It declined to address why Walz claimed incorrectly to have done so in war.\n\n\"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country,\" the statement said. Vance, a Marine Corps veteran, served in Iraq in a noncombat role for six months beginning in fall 2005.\n\nWalz and his political allies also have inaccurately described him as a retired command sergeant major, one rank higher than he holds in retirement. Walz himself did so in a video clip from 2006 that was surfaced by C-SPAN on Tuesday and in a 2018 clip posted on his own YouTube account.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I'm a retired sergeant major in the Army and the Army National Guard,\" he told a group of voters in the latter video.\n\nThough Walz did achieve the rank of command sergeant major, it was a provisional rank until he completed required coursework for senior leaders, National Guard officials said. He did not do so by the time he departed the military and his retirement rank reverted to master sergeant on May 15, 2005, officials said. Walz retired the next day.\n\nThe Harris campaign declined to address why Walz has inaccurately said he retired as one. He has sometimes called himself a \"former command sergeant major,\" which is accurate.\n\nWalz, asked by the oral-history interviewer where his combat experience occurred, said initially that his unit - the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery - had served \"throughout the European theater with Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the name the Pentagon used to describe the war in Afghanistan and other counterterrorism assignments.\n\nWalz clarified later in the interview that he and his fellow Guard members initially thought they would fire artillery, but later learned they would be assigned in Europe to backfill other U.S. troops who were going to war.\n\n\"I think in the beginning, many of my troops were disappointed,\" Walz said, recalling how he was assigned in Vicenza, Italy. \"I think they felt a little guilty, many of them, that they weren't enough in the fight up front as this was happening.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Thomas Behrends, a retired command sergeant major who also was on that deployment, said it was very clear that their unit was not going to war.\n\n\"He's sugarcoating it to make it more than it was,\" Behrends said. After 9/11, he added, the Air Force realized it needed to better safeguard its airfields and requested the National Guard to assist.\n\n\"That was the mission from the get-go,\" Behrends said. \"There was nothing ever said about going to combat.\"\n\nBehrends has been a vocal critic of Walz's since at least 2018, when he and another Guard member, Paul Herr, placed a scathing letter to the editor in a local newspaper, the West Central Tribune, that accused Walz of exaggerating his military career for years as he ran for governor.\n\n\"He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers,\" Behrends and Herr wrote. \"And he failed to lead by example. Shameful.\"\n\nBehrends, who replaced Walz as the unit's command sergeant major, has donated to Republican political causes in the past. In 2022, he promoted a petition on his Facebook page demanding that Walz resign as governor, posting a photo of a grain silo - Behrends is a farmer - festooned with the phrase \"Walz is a traitor!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe also stood next to Walz's gubernatorial opponent, Republican Scott Jensen, at a campaign event that year and donated $2,500 to Jensen's campaign, records show. He acknowledged in an interview Wednesday that he has made political donations in the past and said they were not about politics. He went on to call Walz \"as far left as they come,\" and said he can't speak to whether other candidates are lying, but does know \"for a fact that Tim Walz is lying about his record.\"\n\n\"I always thought he was somebody that talked too much,\" he said of their time serving together. \"It was like, 'God, could he just sit down and shut up?' But he liked to hear himself talk, the same as he does now.\"\n\nJoe Eustice, who served in the National Guard with Walz for at least a decade, said he vehemently disagrees with Walz's politics but described him as a good soldier. In an interview, he rejected assertions that Walz avoided combat duty. In late spring 2005, when Walz said he wanted to pursue politics and decided to retire, there was only speculation of a combat deployment on the horizon, Eustice said.\n\n\"Other than having a rumor, we were not notified that we were going to be deployed,\" Eustice said.\n\nThe unit received an official alert order two months after Walz had retired, the Minnesota National Guard said, which helped the unit prepare for mobilization later in the fall.\n\nWalz, when asked by the Library of Congress historian about his retirement, said that he did so to run for Congress, adding that he was concerned about trying to serve in the military and run for office simultaneously. He also cited worries about the Hatch Act, which restricts partisan political activity by federal employees.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJulin, who oversaw Walz as a more senior command sergeant major, said that Walz approached him in 2005 and said he was prepared to go on their upcoming deployment to Iraq, but also was interested in running for Congress. Julin said he thought \"no big deal\" because other members of Congress had deployed.\n\nBut a couple of months later, Julin learned from another member of the Guard that Walz had retired. Julin was frustrated, he said, because Walz had arranged his retirement with two officers who outranked Julin.\n\n\"I would have analyzed it and challenged him,\" Julin said. \"It would have been a different discussion, but he went to the higher ranks. He knew I would have told him, 'Suck it up, we're going.'\"\n\nBonnifield, who listened as Walz pondered his future nearly 20 years ago, said the future politician appeared then to have no fear about the possibility of danger.\n\n\"He was not that kind of man,\" said Bonnifield. \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nThe deployment to Iraq turned out to be grueling for their unit, which was deployed to Camp Scania, a way station between Baghdad and Kuwait constantly targeted by insurgents with rockets and other long-range fire, Bonnifield said. On the day their deployment was supposed to end, he said, it was extended an extra six months. The soldiers were away from home for a total of 22 months, he said, and multiple people died.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBonnifield, who described himself as a Democrat willing to vote across party lines, said he thought Walz made the right career decision. He later voted for Walz, whom he said he has spoken to only once since, during a chance encounter at a political event.\n\n\"If I had the same choices, I probably would have done the same thing,\" he said.\n\nPatrick Murphy, the first Iraq War veteran elected to Congress, met Walz on Capitol Hill in 2006 during their orientation as freshman lawmakers, Murphy said in an interview. They quickly bonded while rooming together in a modest apartment on Capitol Hill, he said.\n\nBoth felt the Iraq War was a disaster, and Walz said he believed he could do more as a policymaker to avoid such conflicts rather than deploy again, Murphy recalled. While Walz did not see combat, his service in Italy still meant leaving his family behind.\n\n\"We have yanked these citizen-soldiers around for the last two decades,\" Murphy said. \"The Pentagon, the Army, they pick where you go. You don't get the chance to go where you want.\"\n\nWalz served on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and pushed for the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the Pentagon's policy at the time that prevented gay service members from being open about their sexuality. He also supported in 2008 the Post-9/11 GI Bill, legislation that provided far more generous education support than the previous benefit.\n\nVance has credited the expanded benefits for his ability to attend Yale Law School. Vance should thank Walz for that, Murphy said, \"instead of criticizing him for his military record.\"\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Harris' pick of Walz amps up excitement in Midwestern

Tim Walz (D-Minn.) and Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) tout distinguished military records. But clashes over the specifics of their years in the armed forces were quickly ignited between their camps this week after the vice presidential matchup was set.\n\nVance, who served in the Marines, took the opening shot on Wednesday at Walz, who served 24 years in the National Guard. The Republican presidential nominee accused his Democratic rival of \"stolen valor\" for leaving service before a deployment to Iraq and claiming he served in a war.\n\n\"I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance said at a campaign stop in Michigan. \"He has not spent a day in a combat zone. ... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nVance appeared to be referring to a clip of Walz, which the Harris campaign shared on social media, in which the governor says while speaking about gun control, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nWalz has not served in combat. The Hill has reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign for comment. Supporters of Walz have pointed out that Vance admitted in his memoir that he never saw real combat either, and that Walz has never misrepresented his rank.\n\nJacob Thomas, communications director and a spokesperson for the progressive veterans' group Common Defense, said it was \"weird and desperate\" to attack a fellow veterans' military record.\n\n\"That just doesn't seem like a winning message,\" he said. \"We don't need to spend this time hitting each other on things that don't matter. We all served. And like I said, frankly, it just reeks of desperation.\"\n\nWalz and Vance stand out as veterans on national tickets; the first since the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) ran for president in 2008. Former President Trump famously avoided the draft during the Vietnam war after being diagnosed with bone spurs, and Vice President Harris did not serve in the military.\n\nEither man will be the first veteran to serve as president or vice president since President George W. Bush, a former lieutenant in the Texas Air National Guard.\n\nFor Harris and Trump, choosing a veteran with a notable military record was likely a factor in selecting their vice-presidential candidates, said Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs of the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way.\n\n\"I think it was a factor, but not the factor,\" Bennett said. \"I don't think either Harris or Trump said, 'We've got to have a veteran.' I think they said, 'Oh, the fact he's a veteran is definitely a positive.'\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in Nebraska, enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17 to help pay for college after he graduated from high school in 1982. During his years of service, he deployed to Italy in support of U.S. operations against terrorism in Afghanistan. He also responded to natural disasters such as floods and tornadoes on American soil.\n\nWalz retired after 24 years at the rank of command sergeant major and later became the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to have ever served in Congress when he won his first election in 2006. He would go on to become the top Democrat on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\"He is more well-versed on our community than a lot of elected leaders, period, and has a record of fighting on behalf of his fellow veterans,\" Allison Jaslow, the CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said of Walz's time in Congress.\n\n\"He's somebody who I know from working on the Hill as well,\" she added. \"Our organization has a long relationship with Gov. Walz. He was there fighting side-by-side with us for the post 9/11 GI Bill.\"\n\nJaslow also told The Hill that Walz's time in the National Guard gives him \"a unique eye towards that component of our overall force in a way that many other elected leaders aren't,\" which she said could be valuable given the Guard's increased responsibility at the southern border.\n\nBut less than a day after the announcement that Walz would join Harris on the Democratic ticket, the attacks from the right came fast and furious.\n\nCritics have grabbed onto the fact that Walz left the military ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, suggesting he retired to avoid serving in a warzone.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did?\" Vance said at the Michigan campaign event. \"He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nAnd Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) likened Walz's departure from the National Guard to \"the quarterback of a big team walking away from their team right before they go to the Super Bowl.\"\n\n\"I've never heard of a commander or a sergeant major stepping away from their unit before they go down range,\" he said in a video posted to the social platform X.\n\nKevin Poindexter, a GOP political strategist based in Minnesota, said he had \"a lot of questions\" about what he called a dodge of deployment.\n\n\"It's going to seriously have the folks in the veteran community taking a second look at what's going on there,\" he said. \"They all fulfilled their orders and served the country rather than [Walz who] headed up to D.C. and left his troops high and dry in the process.\"\n\nSupporters of Walz, who served in an artillery unit, which damaged his hearing, say he was preparing for a run for Congress when he retired honorably from the military ahead of his unit's deployment.\n\nMark Mellman, a national Democratic strategist, said the attacks don't \"make any sense.\"\n\n\"Are they sending people in their mid-forties to Iraq? I don't think so,\" he said. \"The man served in the National Guard for [24] years, I don't think anybody can reasonably say, 'Well you really had to be in for 28.'\"\n\nIn an infographic circulated online by Vote Vets, the liberal veterans' political group, the organization pushed back on the GOP accusations, saying Walz submitted his retirement request months before his unit's deployment, which was fully staffed.\n\nCritics have also hit Walz over his rank, which he has described over his political career as a sergeant major. While Walz was promoted to command sergeant major while in the service, he was dropped back down to master sergeant after retirement, since he did not complete certain training to retain that rank. However, the National Guard has approved the higher rank in retirement because he served under it.\n\nBut the barbs thrown at Walz over his service may be blunted by the fact Vance himself has never seen combat, and the heavy criticism Trump has taken for avoiding the military entirely.\n\nVance, who served in the Marines from 2003 to 2007 and deployed to Iraq, has said in his memoir that he never saw real combat and that he worked in the public affairs department while on deployment.\n\n\"Let's be clear, you served honorably, including 6 months in combat in a public affairs unit,\" said Alexander Vindman, the Trump whistleblower and retired Army lieutenant colonel, wrote on X Wednesday.\n\n\"Walz retired after 24 years and achieved the rank of command Sergeant Major. I do not think you want to compare service records.\"\n\nTrump received four deferments during the war for education, and then a medical waiver for bone spurs, a diagnosis that New York Times reporting suggests was \"a favor.\"\n\n\"He has no understanding of service because he's too busy servicing himself,\" Walz said of Trump at a campaign stop on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement to The Hill, the Harris campaign defended Walz's record.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ellen_mitchell@thehill.com", "name": "Ellen Mitchell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "brad_dress@thehill.com", "name": "Brad Dress", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Republican_(Springfield,_Massachusetts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Republican (Springfield, Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_and_Afghanistan_Veterans_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Veterans'_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Air_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Air National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Way", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third Way"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Tim Walz's military record that that his GOP opponent wielded against him during the 2022 gubernatorial campaign.\n\nVance accused Walz of \"stolen valor\" for retiring from the military before his regiment deployed to Iraq.\n\nThe Ohio senator pitted his service against the governor's on Wednesday in Michigan, saying that he had served honorably in Iraq with the U.S. Marine Corps. Vance, former President Donald Trump's running mate, was deployed in public affairs as a correspondent. Neither Vance nor Walz saw combat.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people he served. I think it's shameful,\" said Vance, who was on active duty from 2003 to 2007, including deployment to Iraq in 2005 and 2006.\n\nThe second-term Minnesota governor and running mate to Vice President Kamala Harris retired from the Army National Guard as a command sergeant major in May 2005 to run for Congress in the First District in southeastern Minnesota. In November 2006, Walz defeated GOP incumbent Rep. Gil Gutknecht.\n\nWhen Walz retired\n\nThe timeline is clear: Walz submitted his Guard retirement papers in May 2005. The unit's first call-up notice came in July 2005 and the regiment deployed in March 2006.\n\nWalz's Guard service began when he enlisted in 1981, the day after he turned 17, military records show. The governor recently retold the story of driving with his dad, a Korean War-era veteran, to sign up in his native Nebraska. Like his father, Walz said he expected to go to college on the G.I. Bill and that's what he eventually did.\n\nWalz re-upped in the Guard multiple times, including signing on for another six-year stint in 2001.\n\nIn the years after the Sept. 11, 2001, attack, Walz was a senior enlisted member and a master sergeant, according to military records. He lived in Mankato and served with the southern Minnesota-based First Battalion, 125th Field Artillery. The battalion was deployed to Italy in 2003 to protect against potential threats in Europe while active military forces were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, according to Walz.\n\nAfter the units returned to Minnesota in early 2004, Walz was promoted to command sergeant major.\n\nWalz's critics also say the governor inflated his credentials because he retired as a master sergeant, not at the higher rank of command sergeant major. Walz served at the higher rank, but left before completing all the extra training necessary for the rank.\n\nMilitary records\n\nIn response to a Star Tribune request, his 2022 campaign provided a two-page military record confirming the dates and his ranks. The Minnesota National Guard also confirmed the outlines of his tenure, saying that Walz served from April 8, 1981, until May 16, 2005.\n\n\"Walz attained the rank of command sergeant major and served in that role but retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes due to not completing additional coursework,\" according to the statement from Army public affairs officer Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9.\n\nWalz critics\n\nIn the 2022 gubernatorial race, Walz's Republican opponent, former state Sen. Scott Jensen, stood with a few veterans to accuse Walz of leaving the Guard shortly before the battalion he led was deployed to Iraq.\n\nJensen, a physician who narrowly avoided the Vietnam-era draft, said in 2022 that Walz's departure from the Guard fits a pattern and \"is just one of a long line of instances ... where Tim Walz failed to lead and ran from his duty.\"\n\nDuring the gubernatorial campaign, Walz made no apologies for the timing of his departure, saying his life has been about public service, including his time in military. \"We all do what we can. I'm proud I did 24 years,\" Walz said. \"I have an honorable record.\"\n\nIn his Minnesota campaigns and during his tenure as governor, Walz does not spend much time talking about his time in the National Guard, more often touting his background as a high school teacher and football coach.\n\nJoseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the Guard who led the same battalion as Walz, said the governor fulfilled his duty.\n\n\"He was a great soldier,\" Eustice said. \"When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\nEustice said claims to the contrary are ill-informed and possibly sour grapes by a soldier who was passed over for the promotion to command sergeant major that went to Walz.\n\nThat man, Thomas Behrends, was among those standing with Jensen to criticize the governor. Jensen and Behrends, a longtime critic of the governor, argue that Walz bailed on his troops when the going was about to get tough.\n\nWalz defenders\n\nEustice, an Ortonville teacher who describes himself as nonpartisan, said he unequivocally supports the governor's version of events.\n\nEustice said he recalled talking to Walz in 2005 when they were at Camp Ripley. He said Walz told him he was thinking about resigning the Guard and running for Congress.\n\n\"The man did nothing wrong with when he chose to leave the service; he didn't break any rules,\" he said.\n\nLike Walz, Eustice said that he also left in the middle of a six-year re-enrollment because members are free to leave at any time after their initial six-year stint.\n\n\"If you choose to re-up, you can walk in any day and be done,\" Eustice said.\n\nJumping to Walz's defense in light of the Vance criticism was U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, a Navy combat veteran. He asked Vance if he'd forgotten what the Marines taught about respect. \"Tim Walz spent DECADES in uniform. You both deserve to be thanked for your service. Don't become Donald Trump. He calls veterans suckers and losers and that is beneath those of us who have actually served,\" Kelly wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on Wednesday.\n\nFormer U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill. and an Air National Guard pilot, also defended Walz, saying the GOP is trying to \"swiftboat\" Walz. Swiftboat is a reference to the attacks questioning the combat service of Sen. John Kerry during the Vietnam War.\n\n\"Tim Walz joined the Army Guard and served honorably for 24 years, achieving the highest enlisted rank offered. That is quite an accomplishment. The nation should be proud, and JD Vance should be respectful of his fellow warrior,\" Kinziger wrote on his substack.\n\nIn 2022, Walz responded to the criticism from Jensen and Behrends at a Medal of Honor Memorial dedication on the Capitol grounds, saying he was proud of his tenure in the Guard.\n\n\"I don't know if Tom just disagrees with my politics or whatever, but my record speaks for itself and my accomplishments in uniform speak for itself, and there's many people in this crowd, too, that I served with,\" Walz said. \"It's just unfortunate.\"", "source": {"uri":

He closed the door behind him, recalled a colleague, Al Bonnifield, and confided he was considering whether to leave their unit even though it was preparing to go to war so he could run for Congress.\n\n\"It was a very long conversation behind closed doors,\" said Bonnifield. \"He was trying to decide where he could do better for soldiers, for veterans, for the country. He weighed that for a long time.\"\n\nWalz, 60, ultimately chose to leave the Guard in 2005 and went on to win a House seat the following year, unseating a Republican incumbent as a populist wave of opposition to the Iraq War lifted Democrats to a majority of both chambers of Congress. That jump-started a political career that saw him elected governor of Minnesota in 2018 and, this week, selected as Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in a heated race for the White House.\n\nBut while Walz and his political allies have cited his 24 years of military experience as an asset, the circumstances of his departure from the National Guard and his characterization of his service already have come under attack. At least three former Guard colleagues have publicly voiced bitterness at Walz's decision to leave their unit at such a consequential moment. It's not clear how widespread that feeling was, but the Trump campaign has moved quickly to capitalize on the issue.\n\n\"Nobody wants to go to war. I didn't want to go, but I went,\" Doug Julin, a retired National Guard soldier who worked with Walz, said in an interview. \"The big frustration was that he let his troops down.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign did not address criticisms from fellow soldiers that he retired to avoid going to war. Instead, the campaign said that while in Congress he was a \"tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform.\" As vice president, the campaign said in a statement to The Washington Post, \"he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nWalz, a native of West Point, Neb., enlisted in the Nebraska Army National Guard at age 17. His father served during the Korean War era, and urged both him and his sister to enlist, Walz said during a 2009 interview for an oral history project by the Library of Congress. Walz shifted to the Minnesota Army National Guard in 1996 after relocating with his wife, Gwen. He was activated for a variety of missions, including responses to forest fires, tornadoes and flooding.\n\nOn Wednesday, Walz also came under scrutiny for saying during a gubernatorial campaign event in 2018 that \"we can make sure those weapons of war that I carried in war\" are not on America's streets. Walz did not serve in combat, according to the Minnesota Army National Guard, and his Republican counterpart jumped on those comments.\n\n\"He said we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets,\" JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, said during a campaign event in Michigan. \"Well, I wonder. Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\"\n\n[With Walz now on the Democratic ticket, JD Vance previews expected GOP attack lines]\n\nThe Harris campaign, in response to those comments, said in its statement to The Post that Walz carried, fired and trained others how to use \"weapons of war innumerable times.\" It declined to address why Walz claimed incorrectly to have done so in war.\n\n\"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country,\" the statement said. Vance, a Marine Corps veteran, served in Iraq in a noncombat role for six months beginning in fall 2005.\n\nWalz and his political allies also have inaccurately described him as a retired command sergeant major, one rank higher than he holds in retirement. Walz himself did so in a video clip from 2006 that was surfaced by C-SPAN on Tuesday and in a 2018 clip posted on his own YouTube account.\n\n\"I'm a retired sergeant major in the Army and the Army National Guard,\" he told a group of voters in the latter video.\n\nThough Walz did achieve the rank of command sergeant major, it was a provisional rank until he completed required coursework for senior leaders, National Guard officials said. He did not do so by the time he departed the military and his retirement rank reverted to master sergeant on May 15, 2005, officials said. Walz retired the next day.\n\nThe Harris campaign declined to address why Walz has inaccurately said he retired as one. He has sometimes called himself a \"former command sergeant major,\" which is accurate.\n\nWalz, asked by the oral-history interviewer where his combat experience occurred, said initially that his unit - the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery -- had served \"throughout the European theater with Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the name the Pentagon used to describe the war in Afghanistan and other counterterrorism assignments.\n\nWalz clarified later in the interview that he and his fellow Guard members initially thought they would fire artillery, but later learned they would be assigned in Europe to backfill other U.S. troops who were going to war.\n\n\"I think in the beginning, many of my troops were disappointed,\" Walz said, recalling how he was assigned in Vicenza, Italy. \"I think they felt a little guilty, many of them, that they weren't enough in the fight up front as this was happening.\"\n\nBut Thomas Behrends, a retired command sergeant major who also was on that deployment, said it was very clear that their unit was not going to war.\n\n\"He's sugarcoating it to make it more than it was,\" Behrends said. After 9/11, he added, the Air Force realized it needed to better safeguard its airfields and requested the National Guard to assist.\n\n\"That was the mission from the get-go,\" Behrends said. \"There was nothing ever said about going to combat.\"\n\nBehrends has been a vocal critic of Walz's since at least 2018, when he and another Guard member, Paul Herr, placed a scathing letter to the editor in a local newspaper, the West Central Tribune, that accused Walz of exaggerating his military career for years as he ran for governor.\n\n\"He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers,\" Behrends and Herr wrote. \"And he failed to lead by example. Shameful.\"\n\nBehrends, who replaced Walz as the unit's command sergeant major, has donated to Republican political causes in the past. In 2022, he promoted a petition on his Facebook page demanding that Walz resign as governor, posting a photo of a grain silo -- Behrends is a farmer -- festooned with the phrase \"Walz is a traitor!\"\n\nHe also stood next to Walz's gubernatorial opponent, Republican Scott Jensen, at a campaign event that year and donated $2,500 to Jensen's campaign, records show. He acknowledged in an interview Wednesday that he has made political donations in the past and said they were not about politics. He went on to call Walz \"as far left as they come,\" and said he can't speak to whether other candidates are lying, but does know \"for a fact that Tim Walz is lying about his record.\"\n\n\"I always thought he was somebody that talked too much,\" he said of their time serving together. \"It was like, 'God, could he just sit down and shut up?' But he liked to hear himself talk, the same as he does now.\"\n\nJoe Eustice, who served in the National Guard with Walz for at least a decade, said he vehemently disagrees with Walz's politics but described him as a good soldier. In an interview, he rejected assertions that Walz avoided combat duty. In late spring 2005, when Walz said he wanted to pursue politics and decided to retire, there was only speculation of a combat deployment on the horizon, Eustice said.\n\n\"Other than having a rumor, we were not notified that we were going to be deployed,\" Eustice said.\n\nThe unit received an official alert order two months after Walz had retired, the Minnesota National Guard said, which helped the unit prepare for mobilization later in the fall.\n\nWalz, when asked by the Library of Congress historian about his retirement, said that he did so to run for Congress, adding that he was concerned about trying to serve in the military and run for office simultaneously. He also cited worries about the Hatch Act, which restricts partisan political activity by federal employees.\n\nJulin, who oversaw Walz as a more senior command sergeant major, said that Walz approached him in 2005 and said he was prepared to go on their upcoming deployment to Iraq, but also was interested in running for Congress. Julin said he thought \"no big deal\" because other members of Congress had deployed.\n\nBut a couple of months later, Julin learned from another member of the Guard that Walz had retired. Julin was frustrated, he said, because Walz had arranged his retirement with two officers who outranked Julin.\n\n\"I would have analyzed it and challenged him,\" Julin said. \"It would have been a different discussion, but he went to the higher ranks. He knew I would have told him, 'Suck it up, we're going.'\"\n\nBonnifield, who listened as Walz pondered his future nearly 20 years ago, said the future politician appeared then to have no fear about the possibility of danger.\n\n\"He was not that kind of man,\" said Bonnifield. \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nThe deployment to Iraq turned out to be grueling for their unit, which was deployed to Camp Scania, a way station between Baghdad and Kuwait constantly targeted by insurgents with rockets and other long-range fire, Bonnifield said. On the day their deployment was supposed to end, he said, it was extended an extra six months. The soldiers were away from home for a total of 22 months, he said, and multiple people died.\n\nBonnifield, who described himself as a Democrat willing to vote across party lines, said he thought Walz made the right career decision. He later voted for Walz, whom he said he has spoken to only once since, during a chance encounter at a political event.\n\n\"If I had the same choices, I probably would have done the same thing,\" he said.\n\nPatrick Murphy, the first Iraq War veteran elected to Congress, met Walz on Capitol Hill in 2006 during their orientation as freshman lawmakers, Murphy said in an interview. They quickly bonded while rooming together in a modest apartment on Capitol Hill, he said.\n\nBoth felt the Iraq War was a disaster, and Walz said he believed he could do more as a policymaker to avoid such conflicts rather than deploy again, Murphy recalled. While Walz did not see combat, his service in Italy still meant leaving his family behind.\n\n\"We have yanked these citizen-soldiers around for the last two decades,\" Murphy said. \"The Pentagon, the Army, they pick where you go. You don't get the chance to go where you want.\"\n\nWalz served on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and pushed for the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the Pentagon's policy at the time that prevented gay service members from being open about their sexuality. He also supported in 2008 the Post-9/11 GI Bill, legislation that provided far more generous education support than the previous benefit.\n\nVance has credited the expanded benefits for his ability to attend Yale Law School. Vance should thank Walz for that, Murphy said, \"instead of criticizing him for his military record.\"\n\n- - -", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anchorage Daily News"},

Tim Walz (D) and Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) tout distinguished military records. But clashes over the specifics of their years in the armed forces were quickly ignited between their camps this week after the vice presidential match-up was set.\n\nVance, who served in the Marines, took the opening shot Wednesday at Walz, who served 24 years in the National Guard. The Republican presidential nominee accused his Democratic rival of \"stolen valor\" for leaving service before a deployment to Iraq and claiming he served in a war.\n\n\"I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance said at a campaign stop in Michigan. \"He has not spent a day in a combat zone ... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nVance appeared to be referring to a clip of Walz, which the Harris campaign shared on social media, in which the governor says while speaking about gun control, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nWalz has not served in combat. The Hill has reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign for comment. Supporters of Walz have pointed out that Vance admitted in his memoir that he never saw real combat either, and that Walz has never misrepresented his rank.\n\nJacob Thomas, communications director and a spokesperson for the progressive veterans' group Common Defense, said it was \"weird and desperate\" to attack a fellow veteran's military record.\n\n\"That just doesn't seem like a winning message,\" he said. \"We don't need to spend this time hitting each other on things that don't matter. We all served. And like I said, frankly, it just reeks of desperation.\"\n\nWalz and Vance stand out as veterans on national tickets, the first since the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) ran for president in 2008. Former President Trump famously avoided the draft during the Vietnam War after being diagnosed with bone spurs, and Vice President Harris did not serve in the military.\n\nEither man would be the first veteran to serve as president or vice president since President George W. Bush, a former lieutenant in the Texas Air National Guard.\n\nFor Harris and Trump, choosing a veteran with a notable military record was likely a factor in selecting their vice presidential candidates, said Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs of the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way.\n\n\"I think it was a factor, but not the factor,\" Bennett said. \"I don't think either Harris or Trump said, 'We've got to have a veteran.' I think they said, 'Oh, the fact he's a veteran is definitely a positive.'\"\n\nWalz, who grew up in Nebraska, enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17 to help pay for college after he graduated from high school in 1982. During his years of service, he deployed to Italy in support of U.S. operations against terrorism in Afghanistan. He also responded to natural disasters such as floods and tornadoes on American soil.\n\nWalz retired after 24 years, achieving the rank of command sergeant major. He later became the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to have ever served in Congress when he won his first election in 2006. He would go on to become the top Democrat on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\"He is more well-versed on our community than a lot of elected leaders, period, and has a record of fighting on behalf of his fellow veterans,\" Allison Jaslow, the CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said of Walz's time in Congress.\n\n\"He's somebody who I know from working on the Hill as well,\" she added. \"Our organization has a long relationship with Gov. Walz. He was there fighting side by side with us for the post-9/11 GI Bill.\"\n\nJaslow also told The Hill that Walz's time in the National Guard gives him \"a unique eye towards that component of our overall force in a way that many other elected leaders\" don't have, which she said could be valuable given the National Guard's increased responsibility at the southern border.\n\nBut less than a day after the announcement that Walz would join Harris on the Democratic ticket, the attacks from the right came fast and furious.\n\nCritics have latched onto the fact that Walz left the military ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, suggesting he retired to avoid serving in a war zone.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did?\" Vance said at the Michigan campaign event. \"He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nAnd Rep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.) likened Walz's departure from the National Guard to \"the quarterback of a big team walking away from their team right before they go to the Super Bowl.\"\n\n\"I've never heard of a commander or a sergeant major stepping away from their unit before they go down range,\" he said in a video posted to the social platform X.\n\nKevin Poindexter, a GOP political strategist based in Minnesota, said he had \"a lot of questions\" about what he called a dodge of deployment.\n\n\"It's going to seriously have the folks in the veteran community taking a second look at what's going on there,\" he said. \"They all fulfilled their orders and served the country rather than [Walz who] headed up to D.C. and left his troops high and dry in the process.\"\n\nSupporters of Walz, who served in an artillery unit, which damaged his hearing, say he was preparing for a run for Congress when he retired honorably from the military ahead of his unit's deployment.\n\nMark Mellman, a national Democratic strategist, said the attacks don't \"make any sense.\"\n\n\"Are they sending people in their mid-40s to Iraq? I don't think so,\" he said. \"The man served in the National Guard for [24] years, I don't think anybody can reasonably say, 'Well you really had to be in for 28.'\"\n\nIn an infographic circulated online by Vote Vets, a liberal veterans' political group, the organization pushed back on the GOP accusations, saying Walz submitted his retirement request months before his unit's deployment, which was fully staffed.\n\nCritics have also hit Walz over his rank, which he has described over his political career as a sergeant major. \"I'm a retired sergeant major in the Army and the Army National Guard,\" he told a group of voters in 2018.\n\nWhile Walz was promoted to command sergeant major while in the service, he was dropped back down to master sergeant before retirement, since he did not complete certain training to retain that rank.\n\n\"[Walz] held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion,\" Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, a public affairs officer with the Minnesota National Guard, told Minnesota Public Radio.\n\n\"He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\"\n\nThe barbs thrown at Walz over his service may be blunted by the fact Vance himself has never seen combat, and the heavy criticism Trump has taken for avoiding the military entirely.\n\nVance, who served in the Marines from 2003 to 2007 and deployed to Iraq, has said in his memoir that he never saw real combat and that he worked in the public affairs department while on deployment.\n\n\"Let's be clear, you served honorably, including 6 months in combat in a public affairs unit,\" said Alexander Vindman, the Trump whistleblower and retired Army lieutenant colonel, wrote Wednesday on X.\n\n\"Walz retired after 24 years and achieved the rank of command Sergeant Major. I do not think you want to compare service records.\"\n\nTrump received four deferments during the war for education, and then a medical waiver for bone spurs, a diagnosis that New York Times reporting suggests was \"a favor.\"\n\n\"He has no understanding of service because he's too busy servicing himself,\" Walz said of Trump at a campaign stop Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement to The Hill, the Harris campaign defended Walz's record.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.", "source":

He left the Guard in 2005, months before the battalion he led was notified that they were to be deployed to Iraq. Walz previously said his decision to retire was due to him deciding to run for Congress.\n\nVance served in the Marine Corps for four years, although he never saw combat. He served as combat correspondent in Iraq between August 2005 and February 2006.\n\nThe attack against Walz appears to be in reference to remarks Walz made at a campaign rally that the Harris campaign shared on social media. The governor says while speaking about gun control: \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\n\"Well, I wonder Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone,\" Vance said.\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Waltz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\n\n\"And if you want to criticize me for getting an Ivy League education, I'm proud of the fact that my men all supported me, that I was able to make something of myself. I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nA number of military veterans have since condemned Vance for attacking Walz for his military record.\n\nRetired lieutenant general Mark Hertling, a former commander of American ground forces in Europe, posted on X: \"It's unbecoming and unprofessional for anyone -- especially veterans -- to openly disparage anyone who has served in uniform.\n\n\"I'm personally very thankful for all who have worn the cloth of our country -- for any amount of time -- and who have served in our professional force.\"\n\nArizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy combat pilot and astronaut who was on the shortlist to be named Harris' running mate, posted: \"Hey JD Vance, did you forget what the USMC taught you about respect?\n\n\"Tim Walz spent DECADES in uniform. You both deserve to be thanked for your service. Don't become Donald Trump. He calls veterans suckers and losers and that is beneath those of us who have actually served.\"\n\nBrandon Friedman, a former Obama administration official who was deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq, wrote: \"No veteran who supports Walz believes he abandoned his unit. No veteran who opposes Walz believes he abandoned his unit.\n\n\"It's a dishonest political attack meant to influence people who don't know about the military. The guy simply retired after 24 years before his unit deployed.\"\n\nAlexander Vindman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, added: \"Let's be clear, you served honorably, including 6 months in combat in a public affairs unit. Walz retired after 24 years and achieved the rank of command Sergeant Major. I do not think you want to compare service records.\"\n\nVance's office and the Harris-Walz campaign team have been contacted for comment via email.\n\nWalz was previously criticized by his political opponents for retiring from the National Guard before it was deployed to Iraq during his campaign for Minnesota governor in 2018.\n\nJoseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the guard who led the same battalion as Walz, defended Walz at the time.\n\n\"He was a great soldier,\" Eustice told the Star Tribune. \"When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\nIn a 2018 interview with MPR News, Walz acknowledged he never saw combat during his time in the National Guard.\n\n\"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,\" Walz said. \"I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"", "source": {"uri":

Tim Walz, has been embellishing his military record.\n\nCNN's Tom Foreman said on Wednesday Walz, a National Guard veteran, on more than one occasion \"has used language that has suggested that he carried weapons in a fighting situation.\"\n\n\"There is a difference between being in a combat area, being involved at a time of war, and actually being in a position where people are shooting at you,\" he continued.\n\n\"There is no evidence at any time Gov. Walz was in a position of being shot at, and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest that he was, so that is absolutely false when he said that about gun rights out there,\" Foreman concluded.\n\nOne clip the CNN reporter was likely referring to was shared by Harris' campaign account Tuesday on social media platform X. In it, Walz can be heard telling an audience, \"I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt.\n\n\"I've been voting for common-sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can do CDC research. ... We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are [allowed].\"\n\nHe was in the National Guard during a time of war, having enlisted in 1981 and retired in 2005.\n\n\"Walz deployed with the Minnesota National Guard in August 2003 to Vicenza, Italy, as part of support for the US war in Afghanistan, according to a Minnesota Guard spokesperson. He did not deploy to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service,\" CNN said.\n\nBy contrast, Vance did deploy to Iraq with the U.S. Marines in 2005 and 2006, and therefore is a combat veteran.\n\nBoth CNN and The New York Times seemed to want to downplay this experience.\n\nThe outlets both pointed out Vance's occupation was listed as a combat correspondent and that he did not fight as a frontline combatant.\n\nOf course, the future senator still likely was very much in harm's way, given over 75 percent of injuries sustained by American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan were caused by improvised explosive devices commonly placed along roadsides, according to a 2010 study published by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nHarris made Walz's military service front and center at their first rally together in Philadelphia on Tuesday, saying, \"To his fellow veterans, he is Sgt. Maj. Walz.\"\n\nHowever, retired Minnesota Guard Command Sgt. Maj. Thomas Behrends told Alpha News in 2022, as Walz was seeking re-election, that the governor left military service in 2005 after receiving a warning order that his unit, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, was to be deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"He abandoned us. ... As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way, hung his hat up and quit,\" Behrends recalled.\n\nThe veteran explained that he was next in line behind Walz in the unit to take the command sergeant major's slot. Behrends stepped up and deployed to Iraq for nearly two years in Walz's absence.\n\nVance responded to Walz's decision to leave the military, saying at a campaign event in Michigan, \"You know what really bothers me about Tim Walz as a Marine who served his country in uniform? When the United States Marine Corps, when the United State of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did it when they asked me to do it, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\" Vance noted.\n\nThe senator also highlighted Walz's stolen valor.\n\n\"He said we shouldn't allow weapons 'that I used in war' to be [used] on America's streets,\" Vance said. \"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone?\"\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,\" he concluded. \"I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign responded to the controversy, saying, \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nThe campaign didn't address Walz's false claim that he carried these weapons into war.\n\nCNN should be given credit for highlighting the issue.", "source": {"uri":

Vance's 'Stolen Valor' Claim Against Tim Walz Is Total B.S.", "body": "There's very little the two men running to be the nation's next vice president have in common, but the one thing they do share is a history of military service.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who as of Tuesday is running alongside Vice President Kamala Harris, served for 24 years as a member of the Army National Guard after voluntarily enlisting at the age of 17. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), former President Donald Trump's running mate, served for four years as a member of the Marines.\n\nOn Wednesday, Vance took a swing at Walz over his military record, repeating viral claims that Walz had \"dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him\" to Iraq. Vance described Walz's military record as \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\nAs a member of the Army National Guard, Walz helped respond to major natural disasters, worked in firearm and artillery training, received commendations as a prolific sharpshooter, and was sent to Italy to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2005, Walz ended his military career to pursue a successful run for Congress, he retired honorably with a slew of awards and medals and the rank of master sergeant -- an administrative downgrade from command sergeant major, which he had been promoted to earlier in the year but had not completed training for.\n\nVance also accused Walz of feigning a record in active combat: \"[Walz] said -- and he was making a point about gun control -- he said, 'we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war, to be on America's streets.' Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when you ever in war?\"\n\nThe senator actually misquoted Walz in his screed. In the clip Vance was referencing, Walz says that he \"carried\" weapons in war, not \"used.\" Given that Operation Enduring Freedom was a part of the post-9/11 War on Terror, and that Walz was deployed to Italy under it -- and likely had a service weapon -- the claim that he is engaging in \"stolen valor\" holds little water.\n\nVance spoke on Wednesday as if he served more honorably than Walz, noting that he went to Iraq \"I did it, I did what they asked me to do and I did it honorably,\" he said The senator was deployed for six months in Iraq as a combat correspondent in 2005 as part of the Marines' Public Affairs office. He -- like Walz -- never engaged in active combat and has stated that he was \"lucky to escape any real fighting,\" during his deployment.\n\nWalz has spoken at length about his service in the past, and it's not the first time his political opponents have attempted to diminish his service. The claim that Walz abandoned his unit to avoid fighting in Iraq was leveled against him in 2018 and 2022, during his campaigns for the governorship and reelection, largely by former state Sen. Scott Jensen and Thomas Behrends -- a former National Guardsman who was deployed to Iraq after Walz's retirement.\n\nIn 2022, former battalion commander Joseph Eustice, who served with Walz, told the Star Tribune that the accusations against Walz stemmed from ill-informed or \"sour-grapes\" soldiers who were passed over for promotions. \"He was a great soldier,\" Eustice told the Tribune. \"When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave ... The man did nothing wrong when he chose to leave the service; he didn't break any rules.\"\n\nIn 2018, Al Bonnifield, who served under Walz in the Guard, told MPR News that Walz \"talked with us for quite a while on that subject [of retiring]. He weighed that decision to run for Congress very heavy. He loved the military, he loved the Guard, he loved the soldiers he worked with.\"\n\nWalz told the outlet that \"once you're in, it's hard to retire. Of my 40 years or 41 years, I had been in the military 24 of them. It was just what you did ... So that transition period was just a challenge.\"\n\n\"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,\" Walz added. \"I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nTwenty-four years of service is nothing to sneeze at, and Vance is running alongside a known draft dodger who has repeatedly disparaged veterans and Gold Star families. If Vance wants to critique a man's honor, he should start with his running mate.", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_mccann_ramirez@rollingstone.com", "name": "Nikki McCann Ramirez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

(Demetrius Freeman/The Washington Post)\n\nTim Walz was weighing a life-altering decision when he stepped into a supply room at the National Guard Armory in New Ulm, Minnesota, nearly two decades ago. He closed the door behind him, recalled a colleague, Al Bonnifield, and confided he was considering whether to leave their unit even though it was preparing to go to war so he could run for Congress.\n\n\"It was a very long conversation behind closed doors,\" said Bonnifield. \"He was trying to decide where he could do better for soldiers, for veterans, for the country. He weighed that for a long time.\"\n\nWalz, 60, ultimately chose to leave the Guard in 2005 and went on to win a House seat the following year, unseating a Republican incumbent as a populist wave of opposition to the Iraq War lifted Democrats to a majority of both chambers of Congress. That jump-started a political career that saw him elected governor of Minnesota in 2018 and, this week, selected as Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in a heated race for the White House.\n\nBut while Walz and his political allies have cited his 24 years of military experience as an asset, the circumstances of his departure from the National Guard and his characterization of his service already have come under attack. At least three former Guard colleagues have publicly voiced bitterness at Walz's decision to leave their unit at such a consequential moment. It's not clear how widespread that feeling was, but Donald Trump's campaign has moved quickly to capitalize on the issue.\n\n\"Nobody wants to go to war. I didn't want to go, but I went,\" Doug Julin, a retired National Guard soldier who worked with Walz, said in an interview. \"The big frustration was that he let his troops down.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign did not address criticisms from fellow soldiers that he retired to avoid going to war. Instead, the campaign said that while in Congress he was a \"tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform.\" As vice president, the campaign said in a statement to The Washington Post, \"he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nWalz, a native of West Point, Nebraska, enlisted in the Nebraska Army National Guard at age 17. His father served during the Korean War era and urged both him and his sister to enlist, Walz said during a 2009 interview for an oral history project by the Library of Congress. Walz shifted to the Minnesota Army National Guard in 1996 after relocating with his wife, Gwen. He was activated for a variety of missions, including responses to forest fires, tornadoes and flooding.\n\nOn Wednesday, Walz also came under scrutiny for saying during a gubernatorial campaign event in 2018 that \"we can make sure those weapons of war that I carried in war\" are not on America's streets. Walz did not serve in combat, according to the Minnesota Army National Guard, and his Republican counterpart jumped on those comments.\n\n\"He said we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets,\" JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, said during a campaign event in Michigan. \"Well, I wonder. Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\"\n\nThe Harris campaign, in response to those comments, said in its statement to The Post that Walz carried, fired and trained others how to use \"weapons of war innumerable times.\" It declined to address why Walz claimed incorrectly to have done so in war.\n\n\"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country,\" the statement said. Vance, a Marine Corps veteran, served in Iraq in a noncombat role for six months beginning in fall 2005.\n\nWalz and his political allies also have inaccurately described him as a retired command sergeant major, one rank higher than he holds in retirement. Walz himself did so in a video clip from 2006 that was surfaced by C-SPAN on Tuesday and in a 2018 clip posted on his own YouTube account.\n\n\"I'm a retired sergeant major in the Army and the Army National Guard,\" he told a group of voters in the latter video.\n\nThough Walz did achieve the rank of command sergeant major, it was a provisional rank until he completed required coursework for senior leaders, National Guard officials said. He did not do so by the time he departed the military, and his retirement rank reverted to master sergeant on May 15, 2005, officials said. Walz retired the next day.\n\nThe Harris campaign declined to address why Walz has inaccurately said he retired as one. He has sometimes called himself a \"former command sergeant major,\" which is accurate.\n\nWalz, asked by the oral history interviewer where his combat experience occurred, said initially that his unit -- the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery -- had served \"throughout the European theater with Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the name the Pentagon used to describe the war in Afghanistan and other counterterrorism assignments.\n\nWalz clarified later in the interview that he and his fellow Guard members initially thought they would fire artillery, but later learned they would be assigned in Europe to backfill other U.S. troops who were going to war.\n\n\"I think in the beginning, many of my troops were disappointed,\" Walz said, recalling how he was assigned in Vicenza, Italy. \"I think they felt a little guilty, many of them, that they weren't enough in the fight up front as this was happening.\"\n\nBut Thomas Behrends, a retired command sergeant major who also was on that deployment, said it was very clear that their unit was not going to war.\n\n\"He's sugarcoating it to make it more than it was,\" Behrends said. After 9/11, he added, the Air Force realized it needed to better safeguard its airfields and requested the National Guard to assist.\n\n\"That was the mission from the get-go,\" Behrends said. \"There was nothing ever said about going to combat.\"\n\nBehrends has been a vocal critic of Walz's since at least 2018, when he and another Guard member, Paul Herr, placed a scathing letter to the editor in a local newspaper, the West Central Tribune, that accused Walz of exaggerating his military career for years as he ran for governor.\n\n\"He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers,\" Behrends and Herr wrote. \"And he failed to lead by example. Shameful.\"\n\nBehrends, who replaced Walz as the unit's command sergeant major, has donated to Republican political causes in the past. In 2022, he promoted a petition on his Facebook page demanding that Walz resign as governor, posting a photo of a grain silo -- Behrends is a farmer -- festooned with the phrase \"Walz is a traitor!\"\n\nHe also stood next to Walz's gubernatorial opponent, Republican Scott Jensen, at a campaign event that year and donated $2,500 to Jensen's campaign, records show. He acknowledged in an interview Wednesday that he has made political donations in the past and said they were not about politics. He went on to call Walz \"as far left as they come,\" and said he can't speak to whether other candidates are lying, but does know \"for a fact that Tim Walz is lying about his record.\"\n\n\"I always thought he was somebody that talked too much,\" he said of their time serving together. \"It was like, 'God, could he just sit down and shut up?' But he liked to hear himself talk, the same as he does now.\"\n\nJoe Eustice, who served in the National Guard with Walz for at least a decade, said he vehemently disagrees with Walz's politics but described him as a good soldier. In an interview, he rejected assertions that Walz avoided combat duty. In late spring 2005, when Walz said he wanted to pursue politics and decided to retire, there was only speculation of a combat deployment on the horizon, Eustice said.\n\n\"Other than having a rumor, we were not notified that we were going to be deployed,\" Eustice said.\n\nThe unit received an official alert order two months after Walz had retired, the Minnesota National Guard said, which helped the unit prepare for mobilization later in the fall.\n\nWalz, when asked by the Library of Congress historian about his retirement, said that he did so to run for Congress, adding that he was concerned about trying to serve in the military and run for office simultaneously. He also cited worries about the Hatch Act, which restricts partisan political activity by federal employees.\n\nJulin, who oversaw Walz as a more senior command sergeant major, said that Walz approached him in 2005 and said he was prepared to go on their upcoming deployment to Iraq, but also was interested in running for Congress. Julin said he thought \"no big deal\" because other members of Congress had deployed.\n\nBut a couple of months later, Julin learned from another member of the Guard that Walz had retired. Julin was frustrated, he said, because Walz had arranged his retirement with two officers who outranked Julin.\n\n\"I would have analyzed it and challenged him,\" Julin said. \"It would have been a different discussion, but he went to the higher ranks. He knew I would have told him, 'Suck it up, we're going.' \"\n\nBonnifield, who listened as Walz pondered his future nearly 20 years ago, said the future politician appeared then to have no fear about the possibility of danger.\n\n\"He was not that kind of man,\" said Bonnifield. \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nThe deployment to Iraq turned out to be grueling for their unit, which was deployed to Camp Scania, a way station between Baghdad and Kuwait constantly targeted by insurgents with rockets and other long-range fire, Bonnifield said. On the day their deployment was supposed to end, he said, it was extended an extra six months. The soldiers were away from home for a total of 22 months, he said, and multiple people died.\n\nBonnifield, who described himself as a Democrat willing to vote across party lines, said he thought Walz made the right career decision. He later voted for Walz, whom he said he has spoken to only once since, during a chance encounter at a political event.\n\n\"If I had the same choices, I probably would have done the same thing,\" he said.\n\nPatrick Murphy, the first Iraq War veteran elected to Congress, met Walz on Capitol Hill in 2006 during their orientation as freshman lawmakers, Murphy said in an interview. They quickly bonded while rooming together in a modest apartment on Capitol Hill, he said.\n\nBoth felt the Iraq War was a disaster, and Walz said he believed he could do more as a policymaker to avoid such conflicts rather than deploy again, Murphy recalled. While Walz did not see combat, his service in Italy still meant leaving his family behind.\n\n\"We have yanked these citizen-soldiers around for the last two decades,\" Murphy said. \"The Pentagon, the Army, they pick where you go. You don't get the chance to go where you want.\"\n\nWalz served on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and pushed for the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the Pentagon's policy at the time that prevented gay service members from being open about their sexuality. He also supported in 2008 the Post-9/11 GI Bill, legislation that provided far more generous education support than the previous benefit.\n\nVance has credited the expanded benefits for his ability to attend Yale Law School. Vance should thank Walz for that, Murphy said, \"instead of criticizing him for his military record.\"", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors":

Tim Walz's military record after Vice President Kamala Harris named him as her running mate this week.Here's a look at the issue: Walz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard. But it's his retirement in 2005 that's prompting criticism from some Republicans who are suggesting he abandoned his team to pursue a campaign for Congress.As he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year. In August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006. Related video above: \"Get the Facts\" about Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's military recordIt's unclear why Walz timed his departure as he did. But the fact remains that he left ahead of his unit's departure. In a statement, the Harris campaign pushed back on GOP characterizations of Walz's service, and also noted that he advocated for veterans once he was elected to the U.S. House. \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said. Earlier this week Harris' campaign circulated on X a 2018 clip of Walz speaking out against gun violence, and saying, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\" That comment suggests that Walz portrayed himself as someone who spent time in a combat zone.According to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.While attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.In 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard. In 2003, he deployed to Italy in a support position of active military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he was not in a combat zone himself.\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Wednesday as he campaigned in Michigan. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"Vance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, serving four years as a combat correspondent, a type of military journalist, and deploying to Iraq in that capacity in 2005.Neither Trump nor Harris has served in the U.S. military. Trump received a series of deferments during Vietnam, including one attained with a physician's letter stating that he suffered from bone spurs in his feet.The Harris campaign statement said Walz \"would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country\" and \"thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country.

That left him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes.\n\nMinnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Trenton Daniel and Richard Lardner contributed to this report.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at

Speaking about gun control, Walz said: \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance said.\n\n\"What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone.\"\n\nWalz has acknowledged that he never saw combat in the National Guard. Speaking to MPR News in 2018, he said: \"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that.\n\n\"I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nWalz's military record states he served with the Minnesota National Guard from 1981 to 2005 at Fort Benning, Georgia, and New Ulm, Minnesota, obtaining the rank of Command Sergeant Major.\n\nHe was also part of European Security Forces in Vicenza, Italy, in 2003, during the War on Terrorism. However, according to his account and his military record, Walz did not serve in open combat, as the statement Vance made appears to suggest.\n\nVance also claimed that Walz had \"abandoned\" his troops before they went to Iraq \"or wherever,\" calling the decision \"absolutely shameful.\"\n\n'I mean, your job as a senior enlisted guy in a unit is to keep your people safe. That's not a job you can switch out of on a moment's notice,\" Vance told DailyMail.com.\n\nThis seems to be a matter of judgment rather than fact.\n\nWalz indeed left the National Guard in 2005, a decision that was criticized by other members of the National Guard.\n\nIn a letter published in the West Central Tribune, retired Command Sergeants Major of the Minnesota National Guard Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr said that in early 2005, a warning order had been issued to Walz's Batallion to prepare for mobilization to Iraq.\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005 he quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" they wrote.\n\nIn a news conference in 2022, responding to Behrends, Walz said: \"I don't know if Tom just disagrees with my politics or whatever, but my record speaks for itself, and my accomplishments in uniform speak for itself, and there's many people in this crowd, too, that I served with. It's just unfortunate.\"\n\nOthers have defended Walz. National Guard veteran Sergeant Major Joseph Eustice, who served under Walz, told NewsNation that Walz had \"fulfilled his duty,\" had \"every right to leave,\" and that the Minnesota governor was not aware of a deployment order as he planned for retirement.\n\n\"As far as I know, he did not know,\" Eustice said.\n\n\"At that time, there were all kinds of rumors about us deploying. In May, when he decided to retire...we had no 'Notice of Deployment,'\" he said.\n\n\"That didn't come until July.\"\n\nEustice, who described himself to the Star Tribune in 2002 as nonpartisan and that he didn't \"care much\" for Walz as a politician, added that Walz had been speaking for months about becoming a congressman.\n\nHowever, the notion that he \"abandoned\" his troops before Iraq is a subjective assessment of Vance's, as there is no evidence that Walz's retirement was improper.\n\nNewsweek reached out to a media representative for JD Vance for comment.\n\nVance served in the Marine Corps for four years, although he never saw combat. He served as a combat correspondent in Iraq between August 2005 and February 2006.\n\nA number of military veterans have condemned Vance for attacking Walz for his military record. Retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, a former commander of American ground forces in Europe, posted on X: \"It's unbecoming and unprofessional for anyone -- especially veterans -- to openly disparage anyone who has served in uniform.\n\n\"I'm personally very thankful for all who have worn the cloth of our country -- for any amount of time -- and who have served in our professional force.\"\n\nArizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy combat pilot and astronaut who was on the shortlist to be named Harris' running mate, posted: \"Hey JD Vance, did you forget what the USMC taught you about respect?\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_norton@newsweek.com", "name": "Tom Norton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War on terror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Moore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fort Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Public_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Public Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "G.I.

Tim Walz of \"stolen valor.\"\n\nVance, a former Marine, tore into Walz during a presser in Detriot on Wednesday morning, saying, \"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone?\"\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not. And if he wants to criticize me for getting an Ivy League education, I'm proud of the fact that my mama supported me. That I was able to make something of myself. I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did,\" said Vance.\n\nThe Harris campaign defended its vice presidential candidate in a statement, saying:\n\nAfter 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\n\nWalz enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17 and served for 24 years, specializing in \"heavy artillery and had ribbons for proficiency in sharpshooting and hand grenades,\" according to local media in Minnesota. Walz retired from the National Guard to run for Congress and eventually became the chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee in the House. Walz was deployed on active duty during Operation Enduring Freedom, but served in Italy on a support mission. CNN noted that Vance was calling out Walz for saying in a 2018 video clip he carried a weapon in war:\n\nVance pointed to a video promoted by the Harris campaign on social media Tuesday, in which Walz is speaking about his decision to change his position and support an assault weapons ban after the Parkland shooting in 2018.\n\n\"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz said in the video.\n\nCNN also detailed the timeline of Walz's retirement from the military, \"A National Guard article on his unit's deployment states that it received alert orders to deploy to Iraq in July 2005, two months after Walz retired. The unit first mobilized in the fall of 2005 to Camp Shelby Mississippi to prepare for deployment, according to the unit's history, and then deployed in March 2006 for 22 months, which the Guard said was the longest continuous deployment of any military unit during US operations in Iraq.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Veterans Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grenade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Shelby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Camp Shelby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Active duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkland,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parkland, Florida"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AP24219569854582-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-07-", "textStart": 2543, "textEnd": 2552}, {"amb": false, "date": "2006-03-", "textStart": 2738, "textEnd": 2748}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

JD Vance slammed the timing of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's retirement from a more than two decades long military career as a means of avoiding a deployment to Iraq on Wednesday, calling it \"stolen valor garbage\" and testing a new line of attack on the newly minted Democratic vice presidential contender.\n\nThere is no evidence that Walz retired to avoid a wartime deployment, and it's a move that may not work -- Walz has faced similar attacks from opponents before during successful races for Congress and governor, in which he explained his Army record in detail but did not make it a central part of his campaign.\n\nThe attacks are reminiscent of the 2004 campaign to discredit the distinguished war record of Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry, who served in Vietnam and later criticized the war -- an effort led by Chris LaCivita, now a senior adviser to the Trump campaign.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is if the tactic will be as successful 20 years later, when the Republican presidential nominee evaded military service, and Vance, despite his deployment to Iraq, has no combat experience either.\n\n\"He has not spent a day in a combat zone,\" Vance, who deployed to Iraq as a combat correspondent in the Marines but did not experience combat, told reporters at a campaign event in Michigan on Wednesday. \"Do not pretend to be something that you're not ... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nThe broadside, quickly repeated by other Republicans, suggests the campaign may see Walz's military record as a vulnerability for Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate -- one which Vance, his Republican counterpart, could be uniquely positioned to exploit as a fellow former enlistee. While Walz has lambasted Vance's Midwestern bona fides, he has not criticized his opponent's military service.\n\nRep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), a former Green Beret, characterized the timing of Walz's retirement from the Army National Guard with a football analogy in a video posted on X: \"It is kind of like the quarterback of a big team walking away from their team right before they go to the Super Bowl. I've never heard anything like it.\"\n\nIn fact, Walz filed paperwork for his congressional run in February 2005, about a month before reports emerged that the Minnesota National Guard might be deployed. Walz then announced his run in May of that year, two months before the Minnesota National Guard's directive was officially issued.\n\nSome Republicans, including former Vice President Mike Pence's former chief of staff, Marc Short, were less excited about pinning Walz down based on his Army background. \"A policy attack, I think, would be more effective, perhaps, than some of the personal attacks that have been transpiring.\" Short said on MSNBC on Wednesday.\n\nVance also suggested that Walz lied about serving in a combat zone in a comment circulated by the Harris campaign, where he called for politicians to \"make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\" The Minnesota governor specialized in heavy artillery and was recognized for his sharpshooting skills during his time in the Army, while also being deployed to respond to emergencies such as floods and tornadoes.\n\n\"Tim Walz is a fraud who wants to ban firearms like the ones he claimed to carry in war -- except Tim Walz never deployed to a combat zone and lied about his record of service in the National Guard,\" said Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nVance invoked the term \"stolen valor,\" which describes a person who has lied about or misrepresented their military service, though Walz has never claimed he was a combat veteran. The attack the Trump campaign is deploying describes Walz's retirement before his unit was called up to serve a deployment in Iraq as \"stolen valor\" -- not the typical use of the term.\n\nBut the Trump campaign and Republican allies insist the term applies.\n\n\"The two biggest sins in the military are claiming credit for decorations you don't have or claiming combat action that you did not participate in, those are the two biggest sins. And this much is certain: He's guilty of at least one of them,\" LaCivita told POLITICO. \"Nothing regarding his lies has been weaponized in a political sense, that's about to change.\"\n\nAt issue is not so much Walz's tenure in the Army National Guard, but his departure from it in 2005, when the now-Minnesota governor retired to run for Congress. Vance and other Republicans have accused Walz of abandoning his unit, the 1st Battalion of the 125th Field Artillery Regiment in the Minnesota National Guard, which was preparing for deployment to Iraq in the fall of 2005.\n\nWalz enlisted in the Army National Guard in Nebraska at 17, completing 20 years of service in 2001 and then reenlisting for four more years after the Sept. 11 attacks that year. Between 2003 and 2004, he deployed to Italy on active duty to support base security as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the first stage of the United States' war on terror. The governor has openly acknowledged never facing combat during his 24 years of service.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" Harris campaign spokesperson James Singer wrote in a statement.\n\nThe Harris campaign describes Walz as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\" As for his exit from the military to seek office, a Department of Defense military directive in 2004, which was in effect at the time Walz retired, largely prohibited enlisted members of the army from campaigning or holding elected office.\n\nAnd it's not the first time his rank at retirement has been disputed; a 2018 paid letter to the editor written by two retired command sergeant majors alleged that Walz inflated his rank during his race for governor. He went on to win that race.\n\nThe fight over Walz's military record could signal how the first presidential campaign with two post-Sept. 11 veterans on the ticket might play out. While Vance has sought to portray Walz as dishonest about his service, targeting a part of Walz's biography that Democrats have quickly embraced, the Minnesota governor has painted Vance as antithetical to the \"regular people\" he claims to represent.\n\n\"Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community,\" Walz said at the Philadelphia rally on Tuesday where Harris introduced him as her running mate. \"Come on. That's not what Middle America is.\"\n\nTop Democrats contend that continued attacks by Vance on Walz's military background may come back to hurt Republicans. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, who served in Afghanistan as an Army officer, sprang to Walz's defense Wednesday following Vance's \"stolen valor\" comments.\n\n\"Anybody who is willing to raise their hand, to put on a uniform of this country -- especially when you consider a small percentage of our population has ever done that -- they deserve our most respect. That includes JD Vance, Corporal JD Vance, and that includes Sergeant Major Tim Walz,\" Moore said on MSNBC, referring to the vice presidential candidates by their respective military ranks. \"And I think JD Vance knows as being a corporal that you don't get to sergeant major just because. You get to sergeant major because you've served the country.\"\n\n\"I just don't know if that's necessarily the hill JD Vance wants to climb,\" Moore said of Vance's newfound focus on Walz's 24-year military record.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign",

Walz spent over two decades in the Army National Guard, eventually serving in the role, but the title was rescinded because Walz failed to complete the necessary coursework required by the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy to achieve the higher rank.\n\nWalz consequently retired a step lower, under the rank of master sergeant, according to an Army spokeswoman.\n\n\"Walz attained the rank of command sergeant major and served in that role but retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes due to not completing additional coursework,\" Army public affairs officer Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9 said in a statement to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.\n\nThis isn't the first time Walz has faced criticism over misrepresenting his military credentials. During his 2018 race for governor in the North Star State, two retired command sergeant majors complained that Walz was misleading voters with his army titles.\n\nAs the 2024 presidential race heats up, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), himself a Marine veteran, has led GOP attacks on Walz's representation of his military record.\n\nAfter Walz said he had carried weapons \"in war\" in a Harris campaign video, former President Donald Trump's running mate was quick to note that his Minnesotan rival had never \"spent a day in a combat zone.\"\n\nWhile Walz completed a wartime deployment to Italy in 2003, backfilling troops that were deploying to Afghanistan, he did not serve in combat. The Minnesota governor retired in 2005, just months before his unit deployed to Iraq.\n\nDuring a campaign stop in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance blasted Walz for \"stolen valor garbage,\" saying he should be \"ashamed\" for allegedly lying about his military service. The senator portrayed Walz's retirement in an unfavorable light, insinuating that he had conveniently retired just before his unit went to war.\n\n\"I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance questioned. \"He has not spent a day in a combat zone. ... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\n\"What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone,\" Vance continued.\n\nAllan Bonnifield, who served with Walz, told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018 that the governor agonized over his decision to leave the military in order to make a run for Congress.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"He weighed that decision to run for Congress very, very heavy,\" Bonnifield said of Walz. \"He loved the military, he loved the Guard, he loved the soldiers that he worked with, and making that decision was very tough for him. Especially knowing that we were going on another deployment to Iraq.

Tim Walz.\n\nThey removed reference to Walz as a 'retired command sergeant major' and now say he once served at the command sergeant rank.\n\nWalz retired from 24 years in the National Guard in 2005 to run for Congress. He did serve as a command sergeant major, but was reverted back to master sergeant as he left the military because he had not completed the coursework for the higher rank.\n\n'The son of an Army veteran and a retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard himself, Walz was the ranking member on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, where he passed legislation to help stem veterans' suicides,' the campaign website read as of Wednesday.\n\nNow, that line begins with: 'The son of an Army veteran who served as a command sergeant major....'\n\nWalz retired from the Guard just two months before his unit deployed to Iraq - a fact his Republican detractors have seized on.\n\nThey've also accused him of inflating his credentials by calling himself a 'retired command sergeant major.'\n\nIt's not the first time the matter has come up. During his 2018 race for governor, two retired command sergeant majors wrote a paid letter to the editor accusing Walz of misrepresenting his rank on the campaign trail.\n\n'Walz attained the rank of command sergeant major and served in that role but retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes due to not completing additional coursework,' Army public affairs officer Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9 said in a past statement to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.\n\nThe Harris campaign also released a statement saying that Walz 'chaired' the Veterans' Affairs Committee. He did not - he served as the ranking member. The campaign later said the statement had been made in error.\n\nIn 2003, Walz deployed to Italy in a support position of active military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan but not to a combat zone himself.\n\nAmid his congressional bid in March 2005, the Walz campaign put out a statement signaling he still planned to stay in the race despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nShortly after Harris announced Walz as her VP pick, a 2018 clip of Walz advocating for gun control resurfaced.\n\n'We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,' Walz said at the time. Donald Trump's running mate J.D. Vance said he felt Walz's implication that he had served in combat was 'stolen valor garbage.'\n\nReports quickly resurfaced of anger among his former brothers in arms who accused him of 'betraying' his country just as they were preparing for deployment.\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends of the Minnesota National Guard accused Walz of having 'embellished' his record and of having abandoned his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress.\n\n'In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq,' he wrote on Facebook in 2018.\n\n'On May 16th, 2005, he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.'\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 as a Naval intelligence officer, said the criticism was 'strategic' because the Trump campaign 'needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.'\n\nRep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., a former Marine Corps infantry officer who deployed to Afghanistan, told NBC News: 'If I were Donald Trump, with five deferments from Vietnam ... I would be very cautious about opening the door to attacks on those who served honorably.'\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris served in the military. Trump received a series of deferments in the Vietnam War, including one with a physician's letter stating that he suffered bone spurs in his feet.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Veterans'_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_member", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ranking member"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant colonel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Auchincloss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Auchincloss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

He left the Guard in 2005, months before the battalion he led was notified that they were to be deployed to Iraq. Walz previously said his decision to retire was due to him deciding to run for Congress.\n\nVance served in the Marine Corps for four years, although he never saw combat. He served as combat correspondent in Iraq between August 2005 and February 2006.\n\nThe attack against Walz appears to be in reference to remarks Walz made at a campaign rally that the Harris campaign shared on social media. The governor says while speaking about gun control: \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\n\"Well, I wonder Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone,\" Vance said.\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Waltz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\n\n\"And if you want to criticize me for getting an Ivy League education, I'm proud of the fact that my men all supported me, that I was able to make something of myself. I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nA number of military veterans have since condemned Vance for attacking Walz for his military record.\n\nRetired lieutenant general Mark Hertling, a former commander of American ground forces in Europe, posted on X: \"It's unbecoming and unprofessional for anyone -- especially veterans -- to openly disparage anyone who has served in uniform.\n\n\"I'm personally very thankful for all who have worn the cloth of our country -- for any amount of time -- and who have served in our professional force.\"\n\nArizona Senator Mark Kelly, a former Navy combat pilot and astronaut who was on the shortlist to be named Harris' running mate, posted: \"Hey JD Vance, did you forget what the USMC taught you about respect?\n\n\"Tim Walz spent DECADES in uniform. You both deserve to be thanked for your service. Don't become Donald Trump. He calls veterans suckers and losers and that is beneath those of us who have actually served.\"\n\nBrandon Friedman, a former Obama administration official who was deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq, wrote: \"No veteran who supports Walz believes he abandoned his unit. No veteran who opposes Walz believes he abandoned his unit.\n\n\"It's a dishonest political attack meant to influence people who don't know about the military. The guy simply retired after 24 years before his unit deployed.\"\n\nAlexander Vindman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, added: \"Let's be clear, you served honorably, including 6 months in combat in a public affairs unit. Walz retired after 24 years and achieved the rank of command Sergeant Major. I do not think you want to compare service records.\"\n\nVance's office and the Harris-Walz campaign team have been contacted for comment via email.\n\nWalz was previously criticized by his political opponents for retiring from the National Guard before it was deployed to Iraq during his campaign for Minnesota governor in 2018.\n\nJoseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the guard who led the same battalion as Walz, defended Walz at the time.\n\n\"He was a great soldier,\" Eustice told the Star Tribune. \"When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\nIn a 2018 interview with MPR News, Walz acknowledged he never saw combat during his time in the National Guard.\n\n\"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,\" Walz said. \"I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"", "source": {"uri":

When he ran for Congress the first time in 2005, he held the rank of command sergeant major in the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery.\n\nOn March 17 of that year, the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced a possible mobilization of part or all of Walz's battalion to serve in Iraq over the following two years.\n\nAt that time, Walz said he was determined to stay in the race.\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,\" Walz said in a campaign news release. \"I don't want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race.\"\n\nAlmost exactly two months later, May 16, Walz retired honorably from military service without having seen combat. He won the congressional election in 2006, and won re-election five times before running for Minnesota governor. Walz has served as the state's governor since 2018.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign responded to Vance's accusations with praise for the governor's record, stating \"he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "center_square@ccenterdispatch.com", "name": "Center Square", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "therese_boudreaux@ccenterdispatch.com", "name": "Therese Boudreaux", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Center_Square", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Center Square"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz by honing in on previous claims he made implying he engaged in battle during his service in the Army National Guard.\n\nMr. Walz, who was selected to be Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate earlier this week, ended his 24-year military career to run for Congress in 2005, right before his battalion deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,\" Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, the GOP vice presidential nominee and a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, said Wednesday to reporters in Michigan.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" Mr. Vance said.\n\nIn a post on X Tuesday that showed Mr. Walz's hunting and military background, the Harris campaign released an undated video of him talking about gun control.\n\n\"We can do CDC research. We can make sure we don't have reciprocal carry among states,\" he said in the clip. \"And we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carry in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\nThe Harris camp on Thursday, though, appeared to clean up Mr. Walz's past remarks about being \"in war.\"\n\n\"In his 24 years of service, the governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American service to this country,\" the campaign said.\n\nOn their website, the Harris campaign eliminated the reference to Mr. Walz as a \"retired command sergeant major.\" It now says that he once served at the command sergeant major rank.\n\nHe retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, himself a veteran, said Mr. Walz \"served honorably and well\" and that the GOP criticisms are \"strategic.\"\n\n\"Team Trump needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion,\" he posted on X.\n\nBut allegations of stolen valor by men who served with Mr. Walz in the National Guard go back to when he first ran for Congress and later governor. They claim he embellished his military service to benefit his political career.\n\nThomas Behrends, a retired command sergeant major of the Minnesota National Guard, said to Alpha News during Mr. Walz's first run for governor in 2018 that \"Tim Walz has embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances of his military career for years.\"\n\nA press release from 2005 shows Mr. Walz's battalion received a warning order to ready themselves to be moved out for a deployment to Iraq in early 2005.\n\nAccording to Mr. Behrends, on May 16, 2005, Mr. Walz retired, leaving his battalion without a key leader as they prepared to go into combat.\n\nUltimately, Mr. Behrends replaced Mr. Walz in his post after his departure, and the battalion was deployed to Iraq for more than 22 months between 2006 and 2007.\n\nMr. Walz would have been issued and trained on an M-16 rifle during his tenure in the National Guard, but according to his service record, saying he carried it in war is inaccurate.\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard confirms Mr. Walz's battalion deployed in 2003 to support Operation Enduring Freedom, but that he was stationed in Vicenza, Italy and never saw combat. He returned to Minnesota in April, 2004.\n\nIn a recently unearthed video from 2009, Iraq war veteran David Thul, who was also a sergeant in the Minnesota National Guard, confronted a then-aide of Mr. Walz at his congressional district office in Mankato, Minnesota. He asked why Mr. Walz was misleading the public about his military service during \"Operation Enduring Freedom.\"\n\n\"Operation Enduring Freedom is limited to Afghanistan and the airspace directly above,\" Mr. Thul told the staffer.\" Congressman Walz is clearly claiming ... to be an Enduring Freedom veteran.\"\n\nAfter Mr. Walz retired from the military in 2005, his artillery unit was deployed to Iraq and faced heavy combat. Some of those he served with say Mr. Walz abandoned his men by retiring when there was talk they could be deployed.\n\n\"People are mad because we all did what we were supposed to do. We did the right thing, and it's dishonorable,\" Tom Schilling, a retired Minnesota National Guardsman who served with Mr. Walz, told Fox News. \"What he did was he left somebody else to take over his spot.

Tim Walz is facing GOP criticism for his military record.\n\nSpecifically, former President Donald Trump's pick for vice president, Sen. JD Vance, is questioning Walz's timing for his departure from service.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him - a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,\" Vance, a Marine Corps veteran who served in a noncombat role for six months in Iraq, said Wednesday.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" Vance added.\n\nWalz served in both the Nebraska and Minnesota Army National Guards, reaching the rank of command sergeant major. He officially retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005 as he ramped up for a congressional bid. He filed campaign paperwork with the Federal Election Commission in February 2005, five months before his unit was notified about a deployment to Iraq in July, according to CBS News.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that Walz's unit was deployed in 2003 to positions in Europe to support the Afghanistan War. It was unclear whether there was an expectation the unit might see combat at that time.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign has defended Walz's time in the military from the GOP attacks, saying he left the service to run for Congress.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said in a statement.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris also defended Walz on Thursday, telling reporters: \"Listen, I praise anyone who has presented themselves to serve our country. And I think that we all should.\"\n\nRepublicans in their multipronged attack are also accusing Walz of lying about his record for saying publicly that he retired as a command sergeant major - a provisional rank that he attained but did not retire with.\n\nVance additionally took issue with a 2018 clip of Walz shared by the Harris-Walz campaign this week in which the governor spoke out against gun violence.\n\n\"We can make sure those weapons of war - that I carried in war - are only carried in war,\" Walz said.\n\nVance said the statement implied that Walz had served in combat.\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nTrump signaled support for Vance's attacks on social media, posting that Walz is a \"DISGRACE TO OUR COUNTRY.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign said that in his years of service, \"the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nVance, for his part, enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school. He served four years as a combat correspondent, which is a type of military journalist. He deployed to Iraq in that capacity in 2005.\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris served in the U.S. military.\n\nIt's not the first time Walz has faced this line of criticism. During his reelection campaign in 2022, his Republican opponent said he \"ran from his duty\" by leaving the guard before the battalion he led was deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"We all do what we can. I'm proud I did 24 years,\" Walz said at the time. \"I have an honorable record.\"\n\nThe GOP's strategy may sound familiar to those who remember the 2004 election when Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry saw criticism for his record as a Navy officer in Vietnam.\n\nKerry, who lost to President George W. Bush, was accused of lying about his service on 50-foot aluminum crafts that ran missions in the Mekong Delta waterways of South Vietnam. The allegations were never substantiated, but they were enough to cast a shadow over the Democrat and effectively prevent him from running on his military service record. The architect of those attacks, Chris LaCivita, is now a senior campaign adviser for Trump.\n\nBut it's unclear if the same strategy that seemingly worked in 2004 will work today, especially considering Trump himself has faced accusations about dodging the draft during the Vietnam War.", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Veterans Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2004 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_LaCivita", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris LaCivita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Vietnam"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_correspondent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War correspondent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekong_Delta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mekong Delta"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Tim Walz's military record after Vice President Kamala Harris named him as her running mate this week.\n\nHere's a look at the issue:\n\nHe retired before his unit's deployment to Iraq\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard. But it's his retirement in 2005 that's prompting criticism from some Republicans who are suggesting he abandoned his team to pursue a campaign for Congress.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nIt's unclear why Walz timed his departure as he did. But the fact remains that he left ahead of his unit's departure. In a statement, the Harris campaign pushed back on GOP characterizations of Walz's service, and also noted that he advocated for veterans once he was elected to the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nBefore leaving Detroit, where she and Walz played up their support for organized labor, Harris on Thursday responded to a question about the criticism of her running mate's record.\n\n\"Listen, I praise anyone who has presented themselves to serve our country,\" she said. \"And I think that we all should.\"\n\nWalz didn't serve in a combat zone\n\nEarlier this week Harris' campaign circulated on X a 2018 clip of Walz speaking out against gun violence, and saying, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\" That comment suggests that Walz portrayed himself as someone who spent time in a combat zone.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard. In 2003, he deployed to Italy in a support position of active military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he was not in a combat zone himself.\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Wednesday as he campaigned in Michigan. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nVance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, serving four years as a combat correspondent, a type of military journalist, and deploying to Iraq in that capacity in 2005.\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris has served in the U.S. military. Trump received a series of deferments during Vietnam, including one attained with a physician's letter stating that he suffered from bone spurs in his feet.\n\nThe Harris campaign statement said Walz \"would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country\" and \"thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nWhat about his rank?\n\nHarris' campaign has referred to Walz as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major,\" one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. He did in fact achieve that rank, but personnel files show he was reduced in rank months after retiring. That left him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes.\n\nMinnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nAssociated Press writers Darlene Superville, Trenton Daniel and Richard Lardner contributed to this report.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at

Tim Walz's (D-MN) online biography after Republicans slammed its representation of her running mate's military record.\n\nAfter Harris picked Walz to be her No. 2 on Tuesday, her campaign website called the Minnesota Democrat \"the son of an Army veteran and a retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard himself.\"\n\nTwo days later, Walz's online biography has been changed to label him as \"the son of an Army veteran who served as a command sergeant major.\"\n\nThe seemingly minor update comes after intense scrutiny of Walz revealed that the Minnesotan did not retire as a command sergeant major. Walz spent over two decades in the Army National Guard, eventually serving in the role, but the title was rescinded because Walz failed to complete the necessary coursework required by the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy to achieve the higher rank.\n\nWalz consequently retired a step lower, under the rank of master sergeant, according to an Army spokeswoman.\n\n\"Walz attained the rank of command sergeant major and served in that role but retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes due to not completing additional coursework,\" Army public affairs officer Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9 said in a statement to the Minneapolis Star Tribune.\n\nThis isn't the first time Walz has faced criticism over misrepresenting his military credentials. During his 2018 race for governor in the North Star State, two retired command sergeant majors complained that Walz was misleading voters with his army titles.\n\nAs the 2024 presidential race heats up, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), himself a Marine veteran, has led GOP attacks on Walz's representation of his military record.\n\nAfter Walz said he had carried weapons \"in war\" in a Harris campaign video, former President Donald Trump's running mate was quick to note that his Minnesotan rival had never \"spent a day in a combat zone.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nWhile Walz completed a wartime deployment to Italy in 2003, backfilling troops that were deploying to Afghanistan, he did not serve in combat. The Minnesota governor retired in 2005, just months before his unit deployed to Iraq.\n\nDuring a campaign stop in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance blasted Walz for \"stolen valor garbage,\" saying he should be \"ashamed\" for allegedly lying about his military service. The senator portrayed Walz's retirement in an unfavorable light, insinuating that he had conveniently retired just before his unit went to war.\n\n\"I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance questioned. \"He has not spent a day in a combat zone. ... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\n\"What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone,\" Vance continued.\n\nAllan Bonnifield, who served with Walz, told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018 that the governor agonized over his decision to leave the military in order to make a run for Congress.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"He weighed that decision to run for Congress very, very heavy,\" Bonnifield said of Walz. \"He loved the military, he loved the Guard, he loved the soldiers that he worked with, and making that decision was very tough for him. Especially knowing that we were going on another deployment to Iraq.

Please try again later.\n\nTim Walz was weighing a life-altering decision when he stepped into a supply room at the National Guard Armory in New Ulm, Minn., nearly two decades ago. He closed the door behind him, recalled a colleague, Al Bonnifield, and confided he was considering whether to leave their unit even though it was preparing to go to war so he could run for Congress.\n\n\"It was a very long conversation behind closed doors,\" said Bonnifield. \"He was trying to decide where he could do better for soldiers, for veterans, for the country. He weighed that for a long time.\"\n\nWalz, 60, ultimately chose to leave the Guard in 2005 and went on to win a House seat the following year, unseating a Republican incumbent as a populist wave of opposition to the Iraq War lifted Democrats to a majority of both chambers of Congress. That jump-started a political career that saw him elected governor of Minnesota in 2018 and, this week, selected as Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in a heated race for the White House.\n\nBut while Walz and his political allies have cited his 24 years of military experience as an asset, the circumstances of his departure from the National Guard and his characterization of his service already have come under attack. At least three former Guard colleagues have publicly voiced bitterness at Walz's decision to leave their unit at such a consequential moment. It's not clear how widespread that feeling was, but the Trump campaign has moved quickly to capitalize on the issue.\n\n\"Nobody wants to go to war. I didn't want to go, but I went,\" Doug Julin, a retired National Guard soldier who worked with Walz, said in an interview. \"The big frustration was that he let his troops down.\"\n\nSkip to end of carousel\n\n2024 presidential election\n\narrow leftarrow right\n\nFollow live updates on the 2024 election and Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump from our reporters on the campaign trail and in Washington.\n\nTrump and Harris have officially secured their party's presidential nominations.

Tim Walz.\n\n(The Washington Post)\n\nCheck out how Harris and Trump stack up according to The Washington Post's presidential polling averages of seven battleground states.\n\nSign up for The Campaign Moment, reporter Aaron Blake's guide to what you really need to know about the 2024 election.\n\n1/4\n\nEnd of carousel\n\nThe Harris campaign did not address criticisms from fellow soldiers that he retired to avoid going to war. Instead, the campaign said that while in Congress he was a \"tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform.\" As vice president, the campaign said in a statement to The Washington Post, \"he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nWalz, a native of West Point, Neb., enlisted in the Nebraska Army National Guard at age 17. His father served during the Korean War era, and urged both him and his sister to enlist, Walz said during a 2009 interview for an oral history project by the Library of Congress. Walz shifted to the Minnesota Army National Guard in 1996 after relocating with his wife, Gwen. He was activated for a variety of missions, including responses to forest fires, tornadoes and flooding.\n\nOn Wednesday, Walz also came under scrutiny for saying during a gubernatorial campaign event in 2018 that \"we can make sure those weapons of war that I carried in war\" are not on America's streets. Walz did not serve in combat, according to the Minnesota Army National Guard, and his Republican counterpart jumped on those comments.\n\n\"He said we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets,\" JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, said during a campaign event in Michigan. \"Well, I wonder. Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\"\n\nThe Harris campaign, in response to those comments, said in its statement to The Post that Walz carried, fired and trained others how to use \"weapons of war innumerable times.\" It declined to address why Walz claimed incorrectly to have done so in war.\n\n\"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country,\" the statement said. Vance, a Marine Corps veteran, served in Iraq in a noncombat role for six months beginning in fall 2005.\n\nWalz and his political allies also have inaccurately described him as a retired command sergeant major, one rank higher than he holds in retirement. Walz himself did so in a video clip from 2006 that was surfaced by C-SPAN on Tuesday and in a 2018 clip posted on his own YouTube account.\n\n\"I'm a retired sergeant major in the Army and the Army National Guard,\" he told a group of voters in the latter video.\n\nThough Walz did achieve the rank of command sergeant major, it was a provisional rank until he completed required coursework for senior leaders, National Guard officials said. He did not do so by the time he departed the military and his retirement rank reverted to master sergeant on May 15, 2005, officials said. Walz retired the next day.\n\nThe Harris campaign declined to address why Walz has inaccurately said he retired as one. He has sometimes called himself a \"former command sergeant major,\" which is accurate.\n\nWalz, asked by the oral-history interviewer where his combat experience occurred, said initially that his unit -- the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery -- had served \"throughout the European theater with Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the name the Pentagon used to describe the war in Afghanistan and other counterterrorism assignments.\n\nWalz clarified later in the interview that he and his fellow Guard members initially thought they would fire artillery, but later learned they would be assigned in Europe to backfill other U.S. troops who were going to war.\n\n\"I think in the beginning, many of my troops were disappointed,\" Walz said, recalling how he was assigned in Vicenza, Italy. \"I think they felt a little guilty, many of them, that they weren't enough in the fight up front as this was happening.\"\n\nBut Thomas Behrends, a retired command sergeant major who also was on that deployment, said it was very clear that their unit was not going to war.\n\n\"He's sugarcoating it to make it more than it was,\" Behrends said. After 9/11, he added, the Air Force realized it needed to better safeguard its airfields and requested the National Guard to assist.\n\n\"That was the mission from the get-go,\" Behrends said. \"There was nothing ever said about going to combat.\"\n\nBehrends has been a vocal critic of Walz's since at least 2018, when he and another Guard member, Paul Herr, placed a scathing letter to the editor in a local newspaper, the West Central Tribune, that accused Walz of exaggerating his military career for years as he ran for governor.\n\n\"He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers,\" Behrends and Herr wrote. \"And he failed to lead by example. Shameful.\"\n\nBehrends, who replaced Walz as the unit's command sergeant major, has donated to Republican political causes in the past. In 2022, he promoted a petition on his Facebook page demanding that Walz resign as governor, posting a photo of a grain silo -- Behrends is a farmer -- festooned with the phrase \"Walz is a traitor!\"\n\nHe also stood next to Walz's gubernatorial opponent, Republican Scott Jensen, at a campaign event that year and donated $2,500 to Jensen's campaign, records show. He acknowledged in an interview Wednesday that he has made political donations in the past and said they were not about politics. He went on to call Walz \"as far left as they come,\" and said he can't speak to whether other candidates are lying, but does know \"for a fact that Tim Walz is lying about his record.\"\n\n\"I always thought he was somebody that talked too much,\" he said of their time serving together. \"It was like, 'God, could he just sit down and shut up?' But he liked to hear himself talk, the same as he does now.\"\n\nJoe Eustice, who served in the National Guard with Walz for at least a decade, said he vehemently disagrees with Walz's politics but described him as a good soldier. In an interview, he rejected assertions that Walz avoided combat duty. In late spring 2005, when Walz said he wanted to pursue politics and decided to retire, there was only speculation of a combat deployment on the horizon, Eustice said.\n\n\"Other than having a rumor, we were not notified that we were going to be deployed,\" Eustice said.\n\nThe unit received an official alert order two months after Walz had retired, the Minnesota National Guard said, which helped the unit prepare for mobilization later in the fall.\n\nWalz, when asked by the Library of Congress historian about his retirement, said that he did so to run for Congress, adding that he was concerned about trying to serve in the military and run for office simultaneously. He also cited worries about the Hatch Act, which restricts partisan political activity by federal employees.\n\nJulin, who oversaw Walz as a more senior command sergeant major, said that Walz approached him in 2005 and said he was prepared to go on their upcoming deployment to Iraq, but also was interested in running for Congress. Julin said he thought \"no big deal\" because other members of Congress had deployed.\n\nBut a couple of months later, Julin learned from another member of the Guard that Walz had retired. Julin was frustrated, he said, because Walz had arranged his retirement with two officers who outranked Julin.\n\n\"I would have analyzed it and challenged him,\" Julin said. \"It would have been a different discussion, but he went to the higher ranks. He knew I would have told him, 'Suck it up, we're going.'\"\n\nBonnifield, who listened as Walz pondered his future nearly 20 years ago, said the future politician appeared then to have no fear about the possibility of danger.\n\n\"He was not that kind of man,\" said Bonnifield. \"Absolutely not.\"\n\nThe deployment to Iraq turned out to be grueling for their unit, which was deployed to Camp Scania, a way station between Baghdad and Kuwait constantly targeted by insurgents with rockets and other long-range fire, Bonnifield said. On the day their deployment was supposed to end, he said, it was extended an extra six months. The soldiers were away from home for a total of 22 months, he said, and multiple people died.\n\nBonnifield, who described himself as a Democrat willing to vote across party lines, said he thought Walz made the right career decision. He later voted for Walz, whom he said he has spoken to only once since, during a chance encounter at a political event.\n\n\"If I had the same choices, I probably would have done the same thing,\" he said.\n\nPatrick Murphy, the first Iraq War veteran elected to Congress, met Walz on Capitol Hill in 2006 during their orientation as freshman lawmakers, Murphy said in an interview. They quickly bonded while rooming together in a modest apartment on Capitol Hill, he said.\n\nBoth felt the Iraq War was a disaster, and Walz said he believed he could do more as a policymaker to avoid such conflicts rather than deploy again, Murphy recalled. While Walz did not see combat, his service in Italy still meant leaving his family behind.\n\n\"We have yanked these citizen-soldiers around for the last two decades,\" Murphy said. \"The Pentagon, the Army, they pick where you go. You don't get the chance to go where you want.\"\n\nWalz served on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and pushed for the repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, the Pentagon's policy at the time that prevented gay service members from being open about their sexuality. He also supported in 2008 the Post-9/11 GI Bill, legislation that provided far more generous education support than the previous benefit.\n\nVance has credited the expanded benefits for his ability to attend Yale Law School. Vance should thank Walz for that, Murphy said, \"instead of criticizing him for his military record.\"\n\nNicole Markus in Detroit, Aaron Schaffer and Glenn Kessler contributed to this report.",

Tim Walz on its campaign website, making a change to a reference to his military service amid ongoing scrutiny of the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee's military credentials.\n\nWalz's biography initially said he was a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\"\n\nIt has since been updated to say that he \"served as a command sergeant major.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris announced Walz as her running mate Tuesday, setting off a series of attacks over Walz's background as Minnesota governor, a lawmaker and a member of the National Guard for nearly 25 years.\n\nVETERAN WHO SERVED IN TIM WALZ'S BATTALION ADDRESSES STOLEN VALOR ACCUSATIONS: 'FAR DARKER THAN PEOPLE THINK'\n\nWhen Walz left the Guard, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, but he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant. National Guard officials have said that he retired before fulfilling requirements for the position, including coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy. The subsequent lower rank was due to benefit requirements and a technicality.\n\nHowever, Republicans have accused Walz of engaging in \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Sen. JD Vance, former President Trump's running mate, said this week. Vance is a Marine Corps veteran.\n\n\"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did,\" he said.\n\nVance accused Walz of having dropped out of the National Guard to avoid serving in the Iraq War.\n\nJD VANCE ACCUSES TIM WALZ OF 'LYING' ABOUT MILITARY SERVICE: 'STOLEN VALOR GARBAGE'\n\n\"As a Marine who served his country in uniform when the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably,\" he said. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.\"\n\nHowever, the Minnesota National Guard told Fox News Walz's unit was not given deployment orders to Iraq until July, and he had submitted retirement papers five to seven months prior to his retirement in May 2005.\n\nArmy Lt. Col. Ryan Rossman, the Minnesota National Guard's director of operations, also explained Walz's rank at the time of his retirement in a statement to Fox News.\n\n\"He was technically a command sergeant major when he deployed to Europe with his battalion but to retire as a CSM you have to go through a final course, which he had not completed. So, from a benefits perspective, the Army retired him as a master sergeant (lower enlisted rank.) But, according to National Guard records, he was a command seargeant major technically when deployed. The lower rank was as a result of benefit requirements and a technicality.\"\n\nVance noted comments from Walz on gun control, saying the governor had used his military history in an attempt to push gun restrictions.\n\n\"He said, 'We shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets.' Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq? And he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,\" Vance said.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform. And as vice president of the United States, he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said this week.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com",

Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, with Republicans questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nHere's a look at Walz's record and how it's become a campaign issue:\n\nArmy National Guard service\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's that retirement that Republicans have criticized in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard. In 2003, he deployed to Italy in a support position of active military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan but not to a combat zone himself.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nRepublican criticism\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nEarlier this week Harris' campaign circulated on X a 2018 clip of Walz speaking out against gun violence, and saying, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance said he felt Walz's implication that he had served in combat was \"stolen valor garbage,\" decrying his opponent's characterization of his military service.\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nVance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, serving four years as a combat correspondent, a type of military journalist, and deploying to Iraq in that capacity in 2005.\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris has served in the U.S. military. Trump received a series of deferments during Vietnam, including one attained with a physician's letter stating that he suffered from bone spurs in his feet.\n\nDemocratic response\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nAs for Vance's characterization of Walz's weapons comment, Harris' campaign said Walz \"would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country\" and \"thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 -- said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic,\" arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenationalherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Tim Walz's military record", "body": "EAU CLAIRE, Wis -- Attacks on Governor Tim Walz's military record are resurfacing as he runs for Vice President. The attacks include claims Walz retired because he found out his unit was going to Iraq and that he inflated his service record.\n\nKARE 11 looked into each claim and asked the Minnesota National Guard for answers.\n\nClaims that Walz retired to avoid serving in Iraq have followed Walz since he first ran for governor.\n\nThey were re-ignited Wednesday when Republican Vice Presidential Candidate JD Vance took aim at Walz over a video posted by the Kamala Harris campaign in which Walz explains his support for restrictions on assault rifles.\n\n\"And we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war are the only place those weapons are at,\" Walz says in the video.\n\nWalz never served in a combat area.\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,\" Vance said referencing the Walz quote.\n\nThe Harris campaign responded with a statement saying, \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nVance then brought up accusations by some former Minnesota National Guard members that Walz retired to avoid deployment.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\" Vance said at a rally in Michigan.\n\nKARE 11 asked the Minnesota National Guard for the records.\n\nIn an email they confirmed Walz retired in May 2005 - two months before his unit, the 1-125 field artillery battalion received an alert order on July 14, 2005. The unit's mobilization order came on August 14, 2005.\n\nThe issue has come up before as Walz has run for office in Minnesota.\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Tom Behrens first leveled that claim in 2018 and again at a 2022 news conference saying they knew as early as March 2005 the unit would be deployed and that's why Walz retired.\n\n\"He knew damn well what was going to be going on and that's why in May he was gone,\" Behrens said.\n\nWalz responded by defending his service.\n\n\"We all do what we can. I'm proud I did 24 years. I have an honorable record. I served with literally thousands of people,\" Walz said at the time.\n\nHe said he retired in May 2005 after 24 years to run for Congress.\n\n\"I simply moved on to try to serve something else,\" he said.\n\nOthers who served with Walz have defended him.\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Joseph Eustice served 32 years in the Minnesota National Guard. He told KARE 11 Wednesday that he served with Walz and spoke with him about his retirement ahead of time. Walz told him he planned to run for office.\n\nEustice said there were rumors the unit would deploy to Iraq but nothing had been determined.\n\n\"I don't know anyone who said he just did it to get our of a deployment,\" Eustice said.\n\nHe says he doesn't agree with Walz politically but Walz \"did his duty.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't vote for him, but this isn't about voting for him, this is about being honest about his service and he did his service as well as anyone did,\" Eustice said.", "source": {"uri": "whas11.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "whas11.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KARE_(TV)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "KARE (TV)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eau_Claire,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eau Claire, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eau Claire, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://media.whas11.com/assets/KARE/images/2871847a-7a17-4f1e-bd59-06ac44599f89/20240807T222450/2871847a-7a17-4f1e-bd59-06ac44599f89_1140x641.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eau Claire, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-07-14", "textStart": 1805, "textEnd": 1818}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-08-14", "textStart": 1858, "textEnd": 1873}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-", "textStart": 1703, "textEnd": 1711, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-03-", "textStart": 2088, "textEnd": 2098}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nThe broadside, quickly repeated by other Republicans, suggests the campaign may see Walz's military record as a vulnerability for Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate -- one which Vance, his Republican counterpart, could be uniquely positioned to exploit as a fellow former enlistee. While Walz has lambasted Vance's Midwestern bona fides, he has not criticized his opponent's military service.\n\nRep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), a former Green Beret, characterized the timing of Walz's retirement from the Army National Guard with a football analogy in a video posted on X: \"It is kind of like the quarterback of a big team walking away from their team right before they go to the Super Bowl. I've never heard anything like it.\"\n\nIn fact, Walz filed paperwork for his congressional run in February 2005, about a month before reports emerged that the Minnesota National Guard might be deployed. Walz then announced his run in May of that year, two months before the Minnesota National Guard's directive was officially issued.\n\nSome Republicans, including former Vice President Mike Pence's former chief of staff, Marc Short, were less excited about pinning Walz down based on his Army background. \"A policy attack, I think, would be more effective, perhaps, than some of the personal attacks that have been transpiring.\" Short said on MSNBC on Wednesday.\n\nVance also suggested that Walz lied about serving in a combat zone in a comment circulated by the Harris campaign, where he called for politicians to \"make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\" The Minnesota governor specialized in heavy artillery and was recognized for his sharpshooting skills during his time in the Army, while also being deployed to respond to emergencies such as floods and tornadoes.\n\n\"Tim Walz is a fraud who wants to ban firearms like the ones he claimed to carry in war -- except Tim Walz never deployed to a combat zone and lied about his record of service in the National Guard,\" said Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nVance invoked the term \"stolen valor,\" which describes a person who has lied about or misrepresented their military service, though Walz has never claimed he was a combat veteran. The attack the Trump campaign is deploying describes Walz's retirement before his unit was called up to serve a deployment in Iraq as \"stolen valor\" -- not the typical use of the term.\n\nBut the Trump campaign and Republican allies insist the term applies.\n\n\"The two biggest sins in the military are claiming credit for decorations you don't have or claiming combat action that you did not participate in, those are the two biggest sins. And this much is certain: He's guilty of at least one of them,\" LaCivita told POLITICO. \"Nothing regarding his lies has been weaponized in a political sense, that's about to change.\"\n\nAt issue is not so much Walz's tenure in the Army National Guard, but his departure from it in 2005, when the now-Minnesota governor retired to run for Congress. Vance and other Republicans have accused Walz of abandoning his unit, the 1st Battalion of the 125th Field Artillery Regiment in the Minnesota National Guard, which was preparing for deployment to Iraq in the fall of 2005.\n\nWalz enlisted in the Army National Guard in Nebraska at 17, completing 20 years of service in 2001 and then reenlisting for four more years after the Sept. 11 attacks that year. Between 2003 and 2004, he deployed to Italy on active duty to support base security as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the first stage of the United States' war on terror. The governor has openly acknowledged never facing combat during his 24 years of service.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" Harris campaign spokesperson James Singer wrote in a statement.\n\nThe Harris campaign describes Walz as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\" As for his exit from the military to seek office, a Department of Defense military directive in 2004, which was in effect at the time Walz retired, largely prohibited enlisted members of the army from campaigning or holding elected office.\n\nAnd it's not the first time his rank at retirement has been disputed; a 2018 paid letter to the editor written by two retired command sergeant majors alleged that Walz inflated his rank during his race for governor. He went on to win that race.\n\nThe fight over Walz's military record could signal how the first presidential campaign with two post-Sept. 11 veterans on the ticket might play out. While Vance has sought to portray Walz as dishonest about his service, targeting a part of Walz's biography that Democrats have quickly embraced, the Minnesota governor has painted Vance as antithetical to the \"regular people\" he claims to represent.\n\n\"Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community,\" Walz said at the Philadelphia rally on Tuesday where Harris introduced him as her running mate. \"Come on. That's not what Middle America is.\"\n\nTop Democrats contend that continued attacks by Vance on Walz's military background may come back to hurt Republicans. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, who served in Afghanistan as an Army officer, sprang to Walz's defense Wednesday following Vance's \"stolen valor\" comments.\n\n\"Anybody who is willing to raise their hand, to put on a uniform of this country -- especially when you consider a small percentage of our population has ever done that -- they deserve our most respect. That includes JD Vance, Corporal JD Vance, and that includes Sergeant Major Tim Walz,\" Moore said on MSNBC, referring to the vice presidential candidates by their respective military ranks. \"And I think JD Vance knows as being a corporal that you don't get to sergeant major just because. You get to sergeant major because you've served the country.\"\n\n\"I just don't know if that's necessarily the hill JD Vance wants to climb,\" Moore said of Vance's newfound focus on Walz's 24-year military record.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki",

Throughout his life, he also served as a high school geography teacher and football coach before being elected to the US House of Representatives in 2006.\n\nIn 2018, Walz became Minnesota's governor.

Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, the Minnesota Guard's public affairs officer.\n\n\"When the US Marine Corps asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance said during a rally this week. \"When Timz Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that's shameful.\"\n\nAt a campaign rally this week for Walz and Harris, Walz referred to Vance as \"creepy\" and \"weird\".\n\nVance wasn't the only person this week to dispute Walz's military service record. The Minnesota National Guard told Just The News that Walz did not hold the rank of command sergeant major when he retired.\n\nA section of the Minnesota governor's website still states he retired command sergeant major.\n\nAccording to Army records, Walz's nearly two and a half decades in the Minnesota Guard began at age 17 and ended with him holding the rank of Command Sergeant Major, the highest possible rank for an enlisted soldier.\n\nLike most National Guard soldiers, he was frequently deployed in response to national disasters, but he also was sent overseas to Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the US mission to Afghanistan that toppled the Taliban in the wake of the September 11 attacks.\n\nAccording to military records, Walz officially retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005, two months before his unit received word that it would be deployed, four months before deployment preparations began and ten months before the unit deployed.", "source":

In the clip, Walz spoke to a crowded room about gun violence, declaring, \"We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nHowever, Walz's critics quickly pointed out that, despite serving in the National Guard until his retirement in 2005, he never participated in combat.\n\n\"Walz did make a comment speaking to a group, he's done it a couple of times, where he has used language that has suggested that he carried weapons in a fighting situation,\" said CNN's Jake Foreman.\n\n\"Coming from a military family, I know there's a difference between being in a combat zone, being involved during wartime, and actually being in a situation where people are shooting at you,\" he continued.\n\n\"There is no evidence that at any time Governor Walz was in a position of being shot at, and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest he was, so that is absolutely false.\"\n\nAt a campaign event in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance, the Republican vice presidential candidate, accused Walz of exploiting \"stolen valor.\"\n\n\"He said we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets,\" Vance remarked. \"Well, I wonder. Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\"\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" added Vance, who served in the Marine Corps.\n\nIn response, the Harris campaign told the Washington Post that Walz had carried, fired, and trained others on \"weapons of war innumerable times.\"\n\n\"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country,\" the statement read.\n\nAlthough Vance spent six months in Iraq in 2005, his role was noncombat.\n\nWalz enlisted in the Nebraska National Guard at age 17, later transferring to the Minnesota National Guard in 1996, where he served until retiring as a master sergeant in 2005.\n\nAl Bonnifield, a former colleague, recalled that Walz struggled with the decision to leave his unit to run for Congress.\n\n\"It was a very long conversation behind closed doors. He was trying to decide where he could do better for soldiers, for veterans, for the country. He weighed that for a long time,\" Bonnifield told the Washington Post.\n\nWalz retired in May 2005, and a year later, he successfully unseated a Republican incumbent in the House of Representatives.\n\nSome of Walz's former National Guard colleagues expressed frustration over his decision to leave just as their unit was on the brink of deployment.\n\n\"Nobody wants to go to war. I didn't want to go, but I went,\" Doug Julin, a retired National Guard soldier who served with Walz, told the Washington Post.\n\n\"The big frustration was that he let his troops down.\"\n\nIn an oral history interview with the Library of Congress, Walz mentioned that his unit, the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery, was deployed to the \"European theater\" during the Afghanistan war.\n\nA record of Walz's battalion confirms that the unit was deployed in 2003 to Great Britain, Italy, Turkey, and Belgium in support of the war effort.\n\nWalz stated that some of his soldiers were \"disappointed\" that they wouldn't see combat, though another retired Guard member who participated in the deployment disagreed.\n\n\"He's sugarcoating it to make it more than it was,\" said Thomas Behrends, who has been a vocal critic of Walz since 2018.\n\n\"That was the mission from the get-go,\" Behrends said of the European deployment. \"There was nothing ever said about going to combat.\"", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score":

Tim Walz's military record after Vice President Kamala Harris named him as her running mate this week.\n\nHere's a look at the issue:\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard. But it's his retirement in 2005 that's prompting criticism from some Republicans who are suggesting he abandoned his team to pursue a campaign for Congress.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nIt's unclear why Walz timed his departure as he did. But the fact remains that he left ahead of his unit's departure. In a statement, the Harris campaign pushed back on GOP characterizations of Walz's service, and also noted that he advocated for veterans once he was elected to the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nEarlier this week Harris' campaign circulated on X a 2018 clip of Walz speaking out against gun violence, and saying, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\" That comment suggests that Walz portrayed himself as someone who spent time in a combat zone.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard. In 2003, he deployed to Italy in a support position of active military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he was not in a combat zone himself.\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Wednesday as he campaigned in Michigan. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nVance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, serving four years as a combat correspondent, a type of military journalist, and deploying to Iraq in that capacity in 2005.\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris has served in the U.S. military. Trump received a series of deferments during Vietnam, including one attained with a physician's letter stating that he suffered from bone spurs in his feet.\n\nThe Harris campaign statement said Walz \"would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country\" and \"thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nHarris' campaign has referred to Walz as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major,\" one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. He did in fact achieve that rank, but personnel files show he was reduced in rank months after retiring. That left him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes.\n\nMinnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Trenton Daniel and Richard Lardner contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "mcall.com", "dataType":

Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, with Republicans questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's that retirement that Republicans have criticized in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard. In 2003, he deployed to Italy in a support position of active military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan but not to a combat zone himself.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nEarlier this week Harris' campaign circulated on X a 2018 clip of Walz speaking out against gun violence, and saying, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance said he felt Walz's implication that he had served in combat was \"stolen valor garbage,\" decrying his opponent's characterization of his military service.\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nVance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, serving four years as a combat correspondent, a type of military journalist, and deploying to Iraq in that capacity in 2005.\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris has served in the U.S. military. Trump received a series of deferments during Vietnam, including one attained with a physician's letter stating that he suffered from bone spurs in his feet.\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nAs for Vance's characterization of Walz's weapons comment, Harris' campaign said Walz \"would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country\" and \"thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"", "source": {"uri": "wwaytv3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WWAY TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wwaytv3.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author",

He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nSeveral former National Guard colleagues have previously publicly voiced frustrations at Mr Walz's decision to leave their unit before deployment to Iraq - but others have rejected assertions that he retired to avoid combat duty.\n\nMr Walz served for 24 years in the Army National Guard, a military force which is usually deployed within the US to respond to events such as natural disasters, but is also part of the US Army's reserve.\n\nIn February 2005, while he was still in the National Guard, Mr Walz filed an application to run to be elected as a member of Congress from Minnesota.\n\nThe following month it was announced that there would be \"a possible partial mobilisation of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard\" to Iraq within the next two years, according to a 2005 press release from Mr Walz's congressional campaign.\n\nIn the statement, Mr Walz said: \"I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilisation.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race.\"\n\nMr Walz then retired from the National Guard in May 2005, which he later said was so he could focus fully on running for Congress.\n\nIt's unclear exactly when he submitted his resignation notice. We've asked both the National Guard and the Harris campaign when this was.\n\nHis National Guard unit received orders to mobilise for Iraq in July 2005, and was sent there in March 2006, according to the battalion's history page.\n\nMr Vance also says Mr Walz made \"dishonest\" claims about serving in combat in a video promoted by the Harris campaign.\n\nDuring a clip in which he is talking about gun control in the US, he appears to say he carried weapons in war himself, according to the transcription from the campaign.\n\nBut what he actually meant is not entirely clear.\n\nMr Walz went to Italy with the National Guard in 2003 as part of support for the US war in Afghanistan - but he was never deployed to an active war zone.\n\nResponding to this claim about Mr Walz, a Harris campaign spokesperson said: \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign says Mr Walz \"continues telling the lie that he retired as a Command Sergeant Major\".\n\nHis official biography on the Minnesota state website says \"Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005.\"\n\nHe did reach the rank of command sergeant major near the end of his service, but he officially retired one rank below as a master sergeant.\n\nA national guard spokesperson told the BBC that \"his rank reverted to master sergeant on May 15th, 2005, for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the US Army Sergeants Major Academy. He retired the following day.\"\n\nMr Vance served for four years in the US Marine Corps.\n\nHe was deployed to Iraq for about six months in 2005 as a military journalist, although he didn't

We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign scrubbed another contested claim about the governor's service record from his official biography on its website on Thursday -- that Walz had retired as a command sergeant major.\n\nWalz had not completed the required coursework to reach the rank of command sergeant major and thus retired as a master sergeant.\n\nPresident Biden also expressed admiration for Walz Thursday, telling his former campaign staffers in Wilmington, Del., that \"When you get to know him, he's the real deal,\" according to CNN.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Gutknecht", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gil Gutknecht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington,_Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wilmington, Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-5gntmun8q-1723178375450.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1723164070&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-", "textStart": 353, "textEnd": 361}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, with Republicans questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nHere's a look at Walz's record and how it's become a campaign issue:\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's that retirement that Republicans have criticized in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard. In 2003, he deployed to Italy in a support position of active military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan but not to a combat zone himself.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nEarlier this week Harris' campaign circulated on X a 2018 clip of Walz speaking out against gun violence, and saying, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance said he felt Walz's implication that he had served in combat was \"stolen valor garbage,\" decrying his opponent's characterization of his military service.\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nVance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, serving four years as a combat correspondent, a type of military journalist, and deploying to Iraq in that capacity in 2005.\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris has served in the U.S. military. Trump received a series of deferments during Vietnam, including one attained with a physician's letter stating that he suffered from bone spurs in his feet.\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nAs for Vance's characterization of Walz's weapons comment, Harris' campaign said Walz \"would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country\" and \"thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 -- said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic,\" arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Trenton Daniel and Richard Lardner contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

Now, however, GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance and the Trump campaign are attacking Walz on his military record, accusing the Minnesota governor of \"stolen valor.\"\n\nWe'll sort through the facts surrounding the three main attacks on Walz's military record and let readers decide their merit. The claims include:\n\nA native of West Point, Nebraska, Walz joined the Nebraska Army National Guard in April 1981, two days after his 17th birthday. When Walz and his wife moved to Minnesota in 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota National Guard, where he served in 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery.\n\n\"While serving in Minnesota, his military occupational specialties were 13B - a cannon crewmember who operates and maintains cannons and 13Z -field artillery senior sergeant,\" according to a statement released by Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, the Minnesota National Guard's state public affairs officer.\n\nAccording to MPR News, Walz suffered some hearing impairment related to exposure to cannon booms during training over the years, and he underwent some corrective surgery to address it.\n\nOn Aug. 3, 2003, \"Walz mobilized with the Minnesota National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery ... to support Operation Enduring Freedom. The battalion supported security missions at various locations in Europe and Turkey. Governor Walz was stationed at Vicenza, Italy, during his deployment.\" Aug\u00e9 stated. The deployment lasted about eight months.\n\n\"For 24 years I proudly wore the uniform of this nation,\" Walz said at a rally in Philadelphia where he was announced as Harris' running mate on Aug. 6. \"The National Guard gave me purpose. It gave me the strength of a shared commitment to something greater than ourselves.\"\n\nIn recent years, however, several of his fellow guard members have taken issue with the timing of Walz's retirement from the National Guard in May 2005, claiming he left to avoid a deployment to Iraq.\n\nVance, who served a four-year active duty enlistment in the Marine Corps as a combat correspondent, serving in Iraq for six months in 2005, advanced that argument at a campaign event on Aug. 7.\n\n\"When the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance said. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with. I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through and then to drop out right before you actually have to go.\"\n\nIn early 2005, Walz, then a high school geography teacher and football coach at Mankato West High School, decided to run for public office. In a 2009 interview Walz provided as part of the Library of Congress' veterans oral history project, Waltz said he made the decision to retire from the National Guard to \"focus full time\" on a run for the U.S. House of Representatives for Minnesota's 1st Congressional District (which he ultimately won in 2006). Walz said he was \"really concerned\" about trying to seek public office and serve in the National Guard at the same time without running afoul of the Hatch Act, which limits political speech by federal employees, including members of the National Guard.\n\nFederal Election Commission records show that Walz filed to run for Congress on Feb. 10, 2005.\n\nOn March 20, 2005, Walz's campaign put out a press release titled \"Walz Still Planning to Run for Congress Despite Possible Call to Duty in Iraq.\"\n\nThree days prior, the release said, \"the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced a possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard. ... The announcement from the National Guard PAO specified that all or a portion of Walz's battalion could be mobilized to serve in Iraq within the next two years.\"\n\nAccording to the release, \"When asked about his possible deployment to Iraq Walz said, 'I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment.' Although his tour of duty in Iraq might coincide with his campaign for Minnesota's 1st Congressional seat, Walz is determined to stay in the race. 'As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq.'\"\n\nOn March 23, 2005, the Pipestone County Star reported, \"Detachments of the Minnesota National Guard have been 'alerted' of possible deployment to Iraq in mid-to-late 2006.\"\n\n\"Major Kevin Olson of the Minnesota National Guard said a brigade-sized contingent of soldiers could be expected to be called to Iraq, but he was not, at this time, aware of which batteries would be called,\" the story said. \"All soldiers in the First Brigade combat team of the 34th Division, Minnesota National Guard, could be eligible for call-up. 'We don't know yet what the force is like' he said. 'It's too early to speculate, if the (soldiers) do go.'\n\n\"He added: 'We will have a major announcement if and when the alert order moves ahead.'\"\n\nABC News spoke to Joseph Eustice, a retired command sergeant major who served with Walz, and he told the news organization this week that \"he remembers Walz struggling with the timing of wanting to serve as a lawmaker but also avoiding asking for a deferment so he could do so.\"\n\n\"He had a window of time,\" Eustice told ABC News. \"He had to decide. And in his deciding, we were not on notice to be deployed. There were rumors. There were lots of rumors, and we didn't know where we were going until it was later that, early summer, I believe.\"\n\nAl Bonnifield, who served under Walz, also recalled Walz agonizing over the decision.\n\n\"It was a very long conversation behind closed doors,\" Bonnifield told the Washington Post this week. \"He was trying to decide where he could do better for soldiers, for veterans, for the country. He weighed that for a long time.\"\n\nIn 2018, Bonnifield told MPR News that Walz worried in early 2005, \"Would the soldier look down on him because he didn't go with us? Would the common soldier say, 'Hey, he didn't go with us, he's trying to skip out on a deployment?' And he wasn't. He talked with us for quite a while on that subject. He weighed that decision to run for Congress very heavy. He loved the military, he loved the guard, he loved the soldiers he worked with.\"\n\nBut not all of Walz's fellow Guard members felt that way.\n\nIn a paid letter to the West Central Tribune in Minnesota in November 2018, Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr -- both retired command sergeants major in the Minnesota National Guard -- wrote, \"On May 16th, 2005 he [Walz] quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war. His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for congress. Which is false, according to a Department of Defense Directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have.\"\n\n\"For Tim Walz to abandon his fellow soldiers and quit when they needed experienced leadership most is disheartening,\" they wrote. \"When the nation called, he quit.\"\n\nWalz retired on May 16, 2005. Walz's brigade received alert orders for mobilization on July 14, 2005, according to the National Guard and MPR News. The official mobilization report came the following month, and the unit mobilized and trained through the fall. It was finally deployed to Iraq in the spring of 2006.\n\nThe unit was originally scheduled to return in February 2007, but its tour was extended four months as part of President Barack Obama's \"surge\" strategy, the National Guard reported. In all, the soldiers were mobilized for 22 months.\n\nResponding to Vance's claim that Walz retired to avoid deploying to Iraq, the Harris-Walz campaign released a statement saying, \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nVance also called Walz \"dishonest\" for a claim that Walz made in 2018 while speaking to a group about gun control.\n\n\"He made this interesting comment that the Kamala Harris campaign put out there,\" Vance said, referring to a video of Walz that the Harris campaign posted to X on Aug. 6. \"He said, 'We shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets.' Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone.\"\n\nIn the video, Walz, who was campaigning for governor at the time, talked about pushing back on the National Rifle Association and said: \"I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt. ... I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can do [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] research. We can make sure we don't have reciprocal carry among states. And we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\nBut, as Vance indicated, there is no evidence that Walz carried a weapon \"in war.\"\n\nAs we said, Aug\u00e9, in her statement, said Walz's battalion deployed \"to support Operation Enduring Freedom\" on Aug. 3, 2003, and \"supported security missions at various locations in Europe and Turkey.\" During his deployment, Walz was stationed in Vicenza, Italy, and he returned to Minnesota in April 2004, Aug\u00e9 said. There was no mention of Walz serving in Afghanistan, Iraq or another combat zone.\n\nIn the 2009 interview for the veterans history project, Walz said he and members of his battalion initially thought they would \"shoot artillery in Afghanistan,\" as they had trained to do. That didn't happen, he said, explaining that his group ended up helping with security and training while stationed at an Army base in Vicenza.\n\n\"I think in the beginning, many of my troops were disappointed,\" Walz said in the interview. \"I think they felt a little guilty, many of them, that they weren't in the fight up front as this was happening.\"\n\nIn a statement addressing his claim about carrying weapons \"in war,\" the Harris campaign noted that Walz, whose military occupational specialties included field artillery senior sergeant, \"fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times\" in his 24 years of service.\n\nThe Republican National Committee has criticized Walz for saying \"in campaign materials that he is a former 'Command Sergeant Major' in the Army National Guard despite not completing the requirements to hold the rank into retirement.\"\n\nWalz's biography on the Harris campaign website correctly says that the governor \"served for 24 years\" in the National Guard, \"rising to the rank of Command Sergeant Major.\"\n\nWalz's official biography on the Minnesota state website goes further, referring to the governor as \"Command Sergeant Major Walz.\"\n\n\"After 24 years in the Army National Guard, Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005,\" the state website says.\n\nWalz did serve as command sergeant major, but Walz did not complete the requirements to retire with the rank of command sergeant, Aug\u00e9 told us in an email.\n\n\"He held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant, and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion,\" Aug\u00e9 said. \"He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time that Walz's National Guard rank has come up in a campaign.\n\nIn their 2018 paid letter to the West Central Tribune, when Walz was running for governor, the two Minnesota National Guard retired command sergeants major who criticized Walz for retiring before the Iraq deployment also wrote: \"Yes, he served at that rank, but was never qualified at that rank, and will receive retirement benefits at one rank below. You be the judge.\"", "source": {"uri": "factcheck.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "FactCheck.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "d_angelo_gore@factcheck.org", "name": "D'Angelo Gore", "type": "author",

Tim Walz (D-MN) spent more than two decades in the Army National Guard, but his departure has become a line of criticism in the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nWalz, who was announced as the vice presidential running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday, served from April 8, 1981, to May 16, 2005, in the Minnesota National Guard and then the Nebraska National Guard, according to a Minnesota National Guard spokesperson.\n\nHe deployed to Vicenza, Italy, with the Minnesota National Guard in August 2003 as part of support for the Afghanistan War, according to the spokesperson. He did not deploy to Afghanistan, Iraq, or a combat zone, though his battalion \"supported security missions at various locations in Europe and Turkey,\" the spokesperson said. He returned to Minnesota in April 2004.\n\nWhen Walz retired in May 2005, he was the command sergeant major for the battalion, but he retired as a master sergeant because he did not complete the additional coursework required at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nAbout two months after Walz retired, his unit received its orders to deploy to Iraq, according to a National Guard article. The unit mobilized in September of that year to train and finally deployed in July 2006. The unit's 22-month deployment was the longest continuous deployment of any military unit during Operation Iraqi Freedom at the time it returned.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run as a candidate for Minnesota's 1st Congressional District on Feb. 10, 2005, prior to his separation. He won the election and was sworn into office on Jan. 3, 2007.\n\nWalz, as a member of the House of Representatives, authored a concurrent resolution that passed on Oct. 1, 2007, commending the unit on the completion of its record deployment.\n\n\"I served alongside these soldiers for many years and I could not be more proud of them,\" he said at the time. \"They endured their extended deployment with patience and determination and their distinguished service record in Iraq speaks for itself. Today, every Minnesotan should be proud to call the Red Bulls our neighbors and friends.\"\n\nHe served on the House Veterans Affairs Committee during his 12 years in Congress, including spending the final two as the ranking member, before he ran and won Minnesota's governorship in 2018 and again in 2022.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), former President Donald Trump's vice presidential running mate, accused Walz of abandoning his troops on Wednesday.\n\n\"When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance said. \"I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nVance, who served in Iraq, also pointed to a video promoted by the Harris campaign on social media Tuesday from 2018 in which he said after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" and accused him of misrepresenting his service.\n\nVance's attack on Walz's departure from the National Guard has been repeated several times in GOP circles.\n\n\"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way,\" a Harris campaign spokesperson said, according to CNN.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre also defended Walz's 24 years in the Guard during Wednesday's press briefing.\n\n\"This is someone who enlisted at 17 years old to serve his country. He was part of the Army National Guard for 24 years. This is someone who was a high school teacher -- right? -- a high school coach, as well, who grew up in a -- in a small town in the Midwest,\" she said. \"And so, I think his bio speaks for itself. Who he is speaks for hisself. His record speaks for itself. And I'm just not going to say ... anything beyond that.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nVance spent four years in the Marines as an enlisted combat correspondent in public affairs. He deployed to Iraq for about six months and left the service in 2007 as a corporal.\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris served in the military, with the former president receiving a medical deferment to avoid the Vietnam War for bone spurs. During Trump's presidency, he said he \"would not have minded\" serving in the military during the war.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_brest@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Mike Brest", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicenza", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vicenza"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vicenza"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota's_1st_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota's 1st congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Veterans'_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz is getting pummeled over the fact that he avoided military service and misled the country about his veteran status, and it's likely not something that's going away.\n\nTrump's running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio), was one of those who called Walz out about it after a reporter asked him about Walz's portrayal of Vance as an elitist with an Ivy League education.\n\n\"I came from a family where nobody in my family had ever gone to law school. I grew up in a poor family. The fact that Tim Walz wants to turn it into a bad thing, that I actually worked myself through college, through law school and made something myself -- to me, that's the American dream. And if Tim Walz wants to insult it, I think that's frankly pretty bizarre,\" Vance said. \"As a Marine who served his country in uniform when the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.\"\n\nHe added, \"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go.\"\n\nHowever, the problem for the Harris-Walz ticket isn't that J.D. Vance destroyed Walz's stolen valor. It's the fact that the liberal media is calling him out for it, too.\n\nFor instance, Newsweek reported on Wednesday that the Minnesota National Guard is disputing Governor Tim Walz's military biography. They reported that despite the governor's assertions, Walz did not retire with the rank of command sergeant major.\n\nArmy Lieutenant Colonel Kristen Aug\u00e9, the state public affairs officer for Minnesota National Guard, told Just the News on Wednesday that the governor did not retire as \"Command Sergeant Major Walz\" in 2005, as stated on Minnesota's official website, but as master sergeant \"because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\" A soldier who does not complete the requisite coursework is automatically demoted, according to Army regulations.\n\n[...]\n\nIt is not the first time that Walz has faced scrutiny over his military background.\n\nWhen he first ran for governor in 2018, two retired senior officials with the Minnesota National Guard wrote an open letter criticizing Walz for retiring shortly before his battalion was to set for an active-duty deployment in Iraq, quitting months after they were ordered to mobilize and \"leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging.\"\n\n\"He had the opportunity to serve his country, and said 'Screw you' to the United States. That's not who I would pick to run for vice president,\" Thomas Behrends, one of the retired officials who signed the letter, told the New York Post on Tuesday.\n\nEven CNN called out Walz. CNN correspondent Tom Foreman fact-checked the governor on the air on Wednesday.\n\n\"Walz did make a comment speaking to a group, he's done it a couple of times, where he has used language that has suggested that he carried weapons in a fighting situation,\" Foreman began. \"As you know, with your contact with the military, I know from coming from a military family, there is a difference between being in a combat area, being involved at a time of war and actually being in a position where people are shooting at you. There is no evidence that at any time Governor Walz was in a position of being shot at, and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest that he was.\"\n\nRecommended: MSNBC Data Guru Has Bad News for Democrats About Walz\n\nForeman continued, \"So that is absolutely false when he said that about gun rights out there. The campaign has essentially come forward to say, 'Look, he had a long career, he would never want to purposely mislead people about this.' It's what campaigns tend to say. And I'm sure we haven't heard the end of this, but it's an interesting argument that brings to mind past conflicts we've had in politics where military people start going at each other. Then you start saying, 'Well, what is the basis from this, how much of it is true and what are we to draw from that as voters.'\"\n\nIf the liberal media is willing to call out Walz over this, the Harris-Walz campaign is in big trouble.", "source": {"uri": "pjmedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PJ Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_margolis@pjmedia.com", "name": "Matt Margolis", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Did you know that Tim Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for 24 years, is actually a low-down dirty VALOR THIEF who stole all the valor and also chickened out / retired from the National Guard in 2005 just for the trivial excuse that he was running for Congress, when he was morally obligated to stay in the Guard forever, or at least long enough for his unit to be ordered to Iraq several months after he resigned?\n\nHey, it's what the supporters of Cadet Bone Spurs have, and they are going to milk it for all they're worth, because unlike Donald Trump, Walz never pretended that being sent to military school made him a veteran, and never had a personal Vietnam that consisted of worrying about getting herpes from sleeping with women he'd picked up at discos. Heck, Tim Walz has never even proudly shown everyone a Purple Heart medal that somebody gave him so he could claim he had a Purple Heart medal.\n\nNow, here's the background you need: Tim Walz served in the Army National Guard starting the day after he turned 17, until 2005 when he decided to resign and go into politics, a move he had been considering for quite a while and discussed with other Guard members. Walz eventually reached the rank of commander sergeant major, but retired at the lower grade of master sergeant because he hadn't served in the higher rank long enough to qualify for its retirement benefits.\n\nWhen Walz ran for reelection as governor in 2022, his Republican opponent, former state Sen. Scott Jensen, accused Walz of leaving the National Guard to avoid his unit's being deployed to Iraq in George Bush's Great Democratizing the Middle East initiative. Predictably, Jensen never served in any branch of the military, which means he's best-qualified to accuse Walz of shirking his duty after 24 years of service.\n\nThe Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported at the time that others who served with Walz spoke highly of him and said that he'd more than put in his time by the time he left the Guard for politics.\n\nJoseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the guard who led the same battalion as Walz, said the governor fulfilled his duty.\n\n\"He was a great soldier,\" Eustice said. \"When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\nEustice said claims to the contrary are ill-informed and possibly sour grapes by a soldier who was passed over for the promotion to command sergeant major that went to Walz.\n\nThat alleged sour graper, Thomas Behrends, is back in the news this week insisting to anyone who'll listen that Walz is a great big chicken, a traitor, and worst of all, a Democrat.\n\nAfter Behrends and Walz's opponent Jensen accused Walz of betraying his unit, Walz said, at a state Capitol dedication ceremony for Medal of Honor recipients from Minnesota, that it was really too bad that Behrends felt that way.\n\n\"I don't know if Tom just disagrees with my politics or whatever, but my record speaks for itself and my accomplishments in uniform speak for itself, and there's many people in this crowd, too, that I served with,\" Walz said. \"It's just unfortunate.\"\n\nEustice, also a teacher, told the Star-Tribune, \"I love [Walz] as a soldier; I don't care much for him as a politician,\" and that he simply wanted to make clear he agrees with Walz's version of events.\n\nFinally, the notion that Walz bailed to avoid deployment simply doesn't fit with reality, as CNN points out:\n\nWalz retired from the Army National Guard in May 2005, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Typically, service members need to submit papers several months before they can retire.\n\nA National Guard article on his unit's deployment states that it received alert orders to deploy to Iraq in July 2005, two months after Walz retired.\n\nWhat's more, CNN notes that Walz filed his paperwork to run for Congress on February 10, 2005; presumably, he submitted his retirement paperwork around the same time in order to retire by May.\n\nClearly, Walz is psychic and saw that his unit would be deployed five months later, so he chickened out and ran. It only stands to reason that Republicans would fear an opponent who can see the future.\n\nOK but what's all this \"stolen valor\" nonsense, then? Well that one is a little bit more on Walz, because he said something that is genuinely not true in unscripted remarks about gun control. In an undated video from the Harris campaign, Walz said that he'd sent campaign contributions from the NRA back to them, citing his own gun bona fides as he did so:\n\nI spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt ... I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can research the impacts of gun violence. [...] We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\n\nThing is, while he was in the Guard all those years, he never saw combat, so he did not in fact carry weapons \"in war.\" But he carried them during war. Meh, whatever.\n\nYes, that's his stolen valor, as far as anyone can tell. He should have said \"those weapons of war that I carried in the Army,\" but he said \"in war,\" which is exactly the same as falsely claiming to have stormed an enemy position at Tarawa (he'd be a little young for that). Is it disqualifying? It has to be, for supporters of the guy who said American soldiers who died in battle were \"losers\" and \"suckers.\"\n\nHere's JD Vance calling Walz a fakey fake valor stealer and coward at a rally in Michigan Tuesday:\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not. [...] I'd be ashamed if I was him. And I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nYou do have to at least acknowledge the chutzpah of a tech investor backed by a billionaire, who markets himself as just a good ol' boy from simple folk, telling Tim Walz not to pretend to be something he isn't.\n\nNot everyone is buying the bullshit. Here's Never-Trumper A.J. Delgado saying that damn right, Walz served his time before entering politics:\n\nAlso, as the New Republic and many others have pointed out, Vance himself wrote in his memoir Hillbilly Elegy that he was \"lucky to escape any real fighting.\"\n\nBut that's OK, because if you're a Republican, you can get away with it, the end.\n\nYr Wonkette is funded entirely by reader donations.

National Guards members who served with Walz praised him and supported his decision to retire to run for Congress, where he helped veterans\n\nRight-wing media are reviving old smears pushed by political rivals of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz about his retirement from the military, accusing him of \"stolen valor\" and misleading their audience about the reality of his 24-year service record with the National Guard. Specifically, right-wing media are claiming that Walz resigned and \"abandoned\" his National Guard unit and resigned after the unit received deployment orders to go to Iraq when in reality, Walz resigned two months before the unit received orders, and Walz likely submitted his retirement papers even earlier.\n\nAccording to a copy of his service record obtained by Military.com, Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard in 1981 and reached the rank of command sergeant major before retiring in 2005, following a reenlistment after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. Walz retired honorably as a master sergeant -- a lower rank than command sergeant major -- since he did not complete all of the necessary coursework for the higher rank before his service ended. Walz went on to successfully campaign for Congress, where he served for multiple terms, helping veterans exposed to toxins during their military service, sponsoring a veterans suicide prevention bill, and advocating for more GI Bill benefits.\n\nDuring Walz's 2018 gubernatorial campaign, retired Command Sgts. Maj. Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr wrote a \"paid endorsement letter\" just days before the election accusing Walz of \"abandon[ing]\" his unit in order to run for Congress. Specifically, they claimed that he retired in mid-2005 to dodge a unit deployment to Iraq the following year. This smear was repeated by Walz's gubernatorial opponent in October 2022.\n\nGOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance, who wrote that he \"was lucky to escape any real fighting\" during his four-year stint in the Marine Corps, joined in on this smear today during a campaign event in Michigan. Vance said Walz \"dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\" Vance added: \"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go.\" Later, Vance said Walz \"abandon[ed his] unit right before they went to Iraq.\"\n\nCNN correspondent Tom Foreman later debunked this smear after Vance repeated it. On CNN News Central, Foreman explained that Walz retired from his National Guard unit two months before it received orders to deploy to Iraq.\n\nread more: https://www.mediamatters.org/tim-walz/right-wing-media-push-old-debunked-smear-walzs-military-record-despite-his-24-years", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military.com", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "G.I.

Tim Walz (MN) has a major problem on his hands due to his penchant for embellishing his record of service at the Army National Guard. The networks who so warmly welcomed him into the race are now doing their level best to spin this problem away.\n\nWatch as ABC's Selina Wang tries to wave the whole thing away by noting that Vance didn't engage in any hostilities while in Iraq, echoing the Harris campaign and making up a Walz counterattack that never happened:\n\nSELINA WANG: New rivals Vance and Walz, both veterans. Vance, who deployed to Iraq in the Marines and did not see any active fighting, going after Walz's military background, accusing him of leaving his unit before it deployed to Iraq, and lying about his service. Seizing on this moment:\n\nTIM WALZ: And we can make sure those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\n\nJD VANCE: He has not spent a day in a combat zone. What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\n\nWANG: Reporter: Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years and has never claimed to have seen active combat, despite those comments that he carried a gun in war. He retired honorably in 2005 to run for congress as the crisis in Iraq was growing. The Harris campaign saying in a statement, the Governor carried, fired, and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to his country. In fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way. Walz hitting right back.\n\nWALZ: Donald Trump, he sees the world differently than we see it. He has no understanding of service.\n\n\"Hitting right back\", says Wang without evidence of Walz directly addressing the claims presented by multiple parties going back to the 2000s.\n\nCBS's Nancy Cordes didn't do much better, closing out her live hit from the Harris rally with this weak offering:\n\nNANCY CORDES: The Vance campaign has also been going after Walz all day for retiring from the Army National Guard a few months before his battalion being called up to Iraq. Onstage today, Walz said he proudly wore the uniform for 24 years and retired in order to run for Congress. Major.\n\nThere's a pattern there- the deflection to Walz's 24 years of service in the Guard. In contrast, NBC's Gabe Gutierrez simply aired what everyone else said, with no \"seasoning\" of his own:\n\nGABE GUTIERREZ: Vance also slamming Walz for these past comments calling for gun control, saying he carried weapons during war.\n\nWALZ: And we can make sure those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\n\nGUTIERREZ: Walz served in the National Guard but never in combat.\n\nVANCE: Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this -- what was this weapon that you carried into war?\n\nGUTIERREZ: Today the Harris campaign said Walz carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American service to this country.\n\nThe \"24 years\" stuff is misdirection and \"How Dare You\" bait that attempts to deflect from the substance of the accusations against Walz, to wit: that he dropped out of Sergeant Major school, completion of which was a condition of his promotion to Command Sergeant Major of his artillery battalion, upon learning that the unit would deploy to Iraq.\n\nThis story is rapidly moving, with new and shocking details continuously emerging. As Joe Simonson of The Washington Free Beacon reports, Walz KNEW.\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz knew his National Guard battalion was being eyed for a likely deployment to Iraq when he decided to retire, the Washington Free Beacon has learned.\n\nWalz said he had a \"responsibility\" to \"serve if called on,\" shortly before he dropped out of the Guard, an archived campaign statement shows. That statement eliminates any doubt over whether Walz knew an Iraq deployment was on the table when he decided to leave the service. A source who served in the Minnesota National Guard at the time previously told the Free Beacon that the timing of Walz's retirement \"left a bad taste in a lot of peoples' mouths.\"\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major, I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on,\" Walz said in a campaign statement on March 20, 2005. Just three days prior, the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced that at least part of his battalion could be shipped overseas to the Middle East in the next two years.\n\nWalz left the National Guard that May. Two months later, his battalion was put on notice that they would be deploying to Iraq.\n\nThis is in addition to emerging photographic and video evidence of Walz's embellishments and false claims of being a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom, which would've entailed deployment to Afghanistan.\n\nAt a bare minimum, the press should put as much effort into this story as it did into unearthing Senator JD Vance's past statements after his selection as Trump's running mate. There is a lot that Walz must answer for in the coming days. Unfortunately, the press seems more interested in making this all go away than in getting answers and drilling down.\n\nClick \"expand\" to view the full transcripts of the aforementioned reports as aired on their respective network newscasts on Wednesday, August 7th, 2024:\n\nABC WORLD NEWS TONIGHT\n\nABC WORLD NEWS TONIGHT\n\n8/7/24\n\n6:36 PM\n\nLINDSEY DAVIS: We move on now to the race for The White House. The newly formed Democratic ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz, barnstorming the Upper Midwest in this their first full day of campaigning together. One day after debuting the ticket in Philadelphia, Vice President Harris and Governor Walz spoke to crowds in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and just outside Detroit. Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance is shadowing their moves. Vance also in Eau Claire trying to cross paths with Harris and Walz on the tarmac. The Democratic running mates continue their blitz through the battlegrounds in the coming days, with Vance not far behind. ABC's Selina Wang checks in from Michigan.\n\nSELINA WANG: Tonight, the race for The White House is in full swing, with both campaigns battling to win the Midwest. Air force Two and JD Vance's campaign plane meeting on the tarmac.\n\nJD VANCE: I just wanted to check out my future plane.\n\nWANG: Holding dueling rallies in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nVANCE: How great it is to be here in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: Good afternoon, Wisconsin.\n\nWANG: Vice President Kamala Harris and her new running mate Minnesota Governor Tim Walz on the trail for their first full day of campaigning, drawing another huge crowd.\n\nHARRIS: So, in the next 90 days, we need you to use your power. We need you to knock on doors. We need you to register folks to vote. We need you to energize, and organize, and mobilize and make your voices heard.\n\nWANG: The campaign saying they've raised $36 million in the 24 hours since Walz has been on the ticket. A new poll out today shows Harris and Donald Trump effectively tied among likely Wisconsin voters. Harris hoping Walz, from bordering Minnesota, will help them take the state. New rivals Vance and Walz, both veterans. Vance, who deployed to Iraq in the Marines and did not see any active fighting, going after Walz's military background, accusing him of leaving his unit before it deployed to Iraq, and lying about his service. Seizing on this moment:\n\nWALZ: And we can make sure those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\n\nVANCE: He has not spent a day in a combat zone. What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\n\nWANG: Reporter: Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years and has never claimed to have seen active combat, despite those comments that he carried a gun in war. He retired honorably in 2005 to run for congress as the crisis in Iraq was growing. The Harris campaign saying in a statement, the Governor carried, fired, and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to his country. In fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way. Walz hitting right back.\n\nWALZ: Donald Trump, he sees the world differently than we see it. He has no understanding of service, because he's too busy servicing himself again and again and again. Again and again and again. This guy weakens our country to strengthen his hand.\n\nDAVIS: Let's get right to Selina Wang, live outside Detroit. And Selina, both campaigns in Michigan tonight. There is a keen awareness of just how important both these battleground states are.\n\nWANG: That's right, Linsey. Harris and Walz, they are racing to win over voters in these critical battleground states, well aware that this election is only 90 days away. And they've had massive crowds at their rallies, and they've been energized and fired up including here in Michigan. JD Vance, on the other hand, he's been following Harris in every state that she's been visiting, but opting to hold smaller campaign events instead of rallies. Linsey?\n\nDAVIS: Selina for us, thanks so much.\n\nCBS EVENING NEWS\n\nCBS EVENING NEWS\n\n8/7/24\n\n6:34 PM\n\nMAJOR GARRETT: Meanwhile, Kamala Harris and her new running mate Tim Walz held a rally in battleground Wisconsin today, at the same time, in the same city as Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance. This split screen moment comes as we're learning tonight that a 2020 phone call from Donald Trump may undercut his own campaign's attack line against Walz. Here is CBS's Nancy Cordes.\n\nNANCY CORDES: It's the first full day of their partnership, and the second day that the lines to see Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz stretched out of sight.\n\nTIM WALZ: You had to walk 2 miles. I had nothing to do with that, by the way. Nothing.\n\nCORDES: It happened here in Detroit, and in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, population 70,000.\n\nWALZ: Donald Trump is not for you or your family. And Trump's running mate shares those same dangerous and backward beliefs.\n\nCORDES: It is here in the Midwest where the campaign is hoping Walz will do the most to attract new voters.\n\nVOTER: We could relate to him. He was real. Um- and we need that. We- we need someone that is real.\n\nCORDES: The Republican VP nominee, Ohio Senator JD Vance, has been counterprogramming, holding events nearby. Today, he even walked from his plane over to Vice President Harris' plane on the tarmac in Wisconsin.\n\nVANCE: I just wanted to check out my future plane, but I also wanted to go say hello to the Vice President and ask her why Kamala Harris refuses -- why does she refuse to answer questions from the media?\n\nCORDES: Vance and Trump have been going after Governor Walz for his handling of the unrest in Minneapolis after George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.\n\nVANCE: I think Governor Walz has to answer when it comes to his record. This is a guy who says that he stands for public safety, but actively encouraged the rioters who burned down Minneapolis.\n\nCORDES: But at the time, Trump was full of praise for Walz, according to this audio recording of a phone call with governors.\n\nDONALD TRUMP: Tim is on the phone now. Tim Walz. Again, I was very happy with the last couple of days, Tim. You called up big numbers and the big numbers knocked them out so fast it was like bowling pins.\n\nCORDES: The Vance campaign has also been going after Walz all day for retiring from the Army National Guard a few months before his battalion being called up to Iraq. Onstage today, Walz said he proudly wore the uniform for 24 years and retired in order to run for Congress. Major.\n\nGARRETT: Competing with the campaign noise in Detroit and doing so admirably. Nancy Cordes, thank you.\n\nNBC NIGHTLY NEWS", "source": {"uri": "newsbusters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://newsbusters.org/"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Throughout his life, he also served as a high school geography teacher and football coach before being elected to the US House of Representatives in 2006.\n\nIn 2018, Walz became Minnesota's governor. He was reelected in 2022.\n\nRepublican opponent JD Vance has claimed that Walz lied about his military record by referring to himself as a \"retired command sergeant major\" and accused him of \"stolen valor.\"\n\nWalz served as a command sergeant major but retired as a master sergeant for benefits purposes because he hadn't completed the required coursework, according to said Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, the Minnesota Guard's public affairs officer.\n\n\"When the US Marine Corps asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance said during a rally this week. \"When Timz Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that's shameful.\"\n\nAt a campaign rally this week for Walz and Harris, Walz referred to Vance as \"creepy\" and \"weird\".\n\nVance wasn't the only person this week to dispute Walz's military service record. The Minnesota National Guard told Just The News that Walz did not hold the rank of command sergeant major when he retired.\n\nA section of the Minnesota governor's website still states he retired command sergeant major.\n\nAccording to Army records, Walz's nearly two and a half decades in the Minnesota Guard began at age 17 and ended with him holding the rank of Command Sergeant Major, the highest possible rank for an enlisted soldier.\n\nLike most National Guard soldiers, he was frequently deployed in response to national disasters, but he also was sent overseas to Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the US mission to Afghanistan that toppled the Taliban in the wake of the September 11 attacks.\n\nAccording to military records, Walz officially retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005, two months before his unit received word that it would be deployed, four months before deployment preparations began and ten months before the unit deployed.", "source":

Specifically, it has to do with the timing of when he left, the way in which his rank changed, and even a comment he later made about his experience in the military.\n\nWalz, who retired from the Army National Guard in 2005 after 24 years, told the Library of Congress in 2009 for its Veterans History Project that his decision to retire came down to wanting to focus on a political career, which he said would've been hard to do thanks to the Hatch Act (i.e., an act that limits some political activities of federal workers).\n\n\"I left in April of 2005 -- and this was, for me, just short of 25 years -- and it was to run for this office,\" he said in the video interview, referring to his running for the House of Representatives for Minnesota's 1st congressional district.\n\n\"We were really concerned that were going to try and do both; there's always the Hatch Act and some of the things you have to be very careful of,\" he said, later adding: \"I decided to retire and focus full-time on running for this office and of course in November 2006 won.\"\n\nBut in a letter posted to Facebook in 2018 (via the New York Post), two former command sergeant majors named Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr criticized Walz's decision to retire two months before he would have been deployed to Iraq, and said that Walz was well aware that he could have sought permission from the Pentagon to run for office while remaining on active duty.\n\nThey also alleged that Walz had assured his battalion that he would be joining them in Iraq, only to leave them \"hanging\" as he \"slithered out the door,\" and that Walz didn't even complete the necessary paperwork needed to transition out of the military.\n\nDuring his 24 years in the Army National Guard, Walz climbed the ranks to command sergeant major before he retired in 2005. However, because he didn't finish all of his training requirements, he instead retired as a master sergeant (a reduced rank) for benefits purposes, per Military.com.\n\nIn August 2024, Vance told rally-goers at a campaign event in Michigan that \"what bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\"\n\nIn this case, Vance was referring to a comment that Walz -- who never saw combat during his service -- made in 2018 after the Parkland high school shooting, in which Walz said, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\nBecause of these comments, Vance -- who served four years in the Marines (including six months in Iraq) but also never saw combat -- accused Walz of using \"stolen valor.\"\n\nHowever, Walz responded with a statement, explaining that \"in his 24 years of service, the governor carried, fired, and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"", "source": {"uri": "distractify.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Distractify"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamie_lee@distractify.com", "name": "Jamie Lee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hatch Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Library of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota's_1st_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota's 1st congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Active duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkland_high_school_shooting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parkland high school shooting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military.com", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://media.distractify.com/brand-img/byv7cpy2H/1200x628/why-did-tim-walz-leave-the-military-2-1723142360281.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2006-11-", "textStart": 1240, "textEnd": 1253}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Walz didn't see combat.\n\nWalz left the Army National Guard for a congressional bid, according to the Star Tribune.\n\nVance also hit Walz over a past video shared by the Harris campaign in which Walz said he carried weapons during war. The Ohio GOP senator questioned whether Walz had ever been in war or carried a weapon in war.\n\nVance worked as a combat correspondent and spent some time in Iraq, according to the Army Times.\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,\" Vance said. \"Do not pretend to be something that you're not, and if he wants to criticize me for getting an Ivy League education, I'm proud of the fact that my mamaw supported me, that I was able to make something of myself.\"\n\n\"I'd be ashamed, if I was him, and I lied about my military service, like he did,\" he added.\n\nWalz was formally selected as Harris's running mate on Tuesday. The two held their first campaign event together later that day in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Harris campaign defended Walz in a statement to The Hill\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz

JD Vance, R-Ohio, accused Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Wednesday of quitting the Army National Guard two decades ago to avoid being deployed to Iraq and of exaggerating his service record to claim falsely that he had served in combat.\n\nBoth provocative charges amounted to some of the sharpest Republican attacks yet on the Minnesota governor, and appeared aimed at disrupting what has been a run of positive news coverage of the Democratic ticket since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the party's nominee.\n\nThe accusations by Vance, who served a four-year active duty enlistment in the Marine Corps, about Walz, whose career in the national guard spanned 24 years, also served to pit the military records of the two major party's vice-presidential candidates against each other.\n\nSpeaking at the police department in Shelby Township, Michigan, on Wednesday morning, Vance said Walz had effectively deserted his fellow soldiers to avoid serving in Iraq because he retired from the National Guard in May 2005, several months before his artillery unit received orders to deploy there.\n\n\"You abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq,\" Vance said.\n\nVance based his accusations on a Facebook post from 2018, and a paid letter to the editor to the West Central Tribune that same year in which the writers, Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, both retired command sergeant majors in the Minnesota National Guard, accused Walz of \"conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq.\"\n\nThe criticisms were first leveled by Behrends and Herr during Walz's first campaign for governor.\n\nBut Joseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the national guard who led the same battalion as Walz and served under him, said in an interview Wednesday that the governor was a dependable soldier and that the attacks by his fellow comrades were unfounded.\n\n\"He was as good a soldier as you'd find, and to have two former sergeant majors say that he wasn't, it's just not true,\" Eustice said, adding that he disagreed with Walz's politics and most likely would not vote for him in November even though they were friends.\n\nEustice recalled that Walz's decision to run for Congress came months before the battalion received any official notice of deployment, though he said there had been rumors that it might be deployed.\n\nThe two men were exercising in early 2005, when Walz, who was then a command sergeant major, turned to Eustice, who was then a first sergeant, and said: \"I got to ask you something. I'm thinking about running for Congress,\" Eustice recalled.\n\n\"I said, 'What the hell's wrong?'\" he added. \"I mean, why would you want to do such a thing?\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign did not provide any new details about the timeline of Walz's decision to retire. Instead, it pointed to other past comments from fellow guardsmen who said that Walz had been considering running for office for some time and that the decision to retire from the military had weighed heavily on him.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Gov. Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform,\" said Ammar Moussa, a campaign spokesperson, \"and as vice president of the United States, he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Vance also seized on a remark by Walz in a video clip that the Harris campaign had promoted on social media Tuesday, in which the governor told a crowd about support for gun control, saying that \"we can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nWalz never served in combat, however, which prompted Vance to accuse him of \"stolen valor.\"\n\n\"I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did,\" Vance said.\n\nWalz was deployed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, but not in a combat zone.\n\n\"The governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" Moussa said. \"Gov. Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Sen. Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nVance assailed Walz over his military record in response to a reporter's question about Walz's suggestion, in his debut speech alongside Harris the previous night, that Vance had misrepresented himself as a voice of the working class.\n\n\"Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires and wrote a bestseller trashing that community,\" Walz had said. \"Come on. That is not what Middle America is.\"\n\nBut Vance's comments were also reminiscent of the \"Swift boat\" attacks in 2004 that effectively cast doubt on the military exploits of Sen. John Kerry, then the Democratic presidential nominee. A key strategist behind those attacks, which helped doom Kerry's bid for the White House, was Chris LaCivita, who is a senior strategist for the Trump campaign.\n\nWalz's long years in uniform began when he enlisted as an infantryman in the Nebraska Army National Guard in 1981, a few days after his 17th birthday. When he transferred to the Minnesota National Guard in the 1990s, his job changed to artillery.\n\nHe retired in 2005 as a master sergeant but had served earlier as a command sergeant major, one of the Army's highest enlisted ranks.\n\nThe accusation also recalled similar criticisms that former President Donald Trump has faced about avoiding military service. The three-time Republican presidential nominee sidestepped the war in Vietnam thanks to a deferment related to bone spurs in his heel, a medical assessment that was made as a favor for Trump's father, the doctor's daughter told The New York Times in 2018.\n\nPatrick Murphy, a former U.S. Army captain who was a roommate of Walz's when both served in the U.S. House, said he was dismayed by the attacks on Walz's military record.\n\n\"Anyone who tries to criticize his record but looks the other way at Donald Trump's six deferments to Vietnam is beyond the pale,\" said Murphy, a Pennsylvania Democrat.\n\nVance was on active duty with the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007 during the Iraq war.\n\nVance, who then went by the name James D. Hamel, was assigned to the Second Marine Aircraft Wing, one of the Marine Corps' largest subordinate commands that oversees aircraft such as fighter jets and helicopters. He was deployed to Iraq in 2005 and 2006 with the aircraft wing but did not serve as a front-line combatant.\n\nHis official military occupation, known as a combat correspondent, meant he was tasked with basic communication roles such as writing articles about the happenings in his unit.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Tim Walz on its campaign website, making a change to a reference to his military service amid ongoing scrutiny of the 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee's military credentials.\n\nWalz's biography initially said he was a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\"\n\nIt has since been updated to say that he \"served as a command sergeant major.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris announced Walz as her running mate on Tuesday, setting off a series of attacks over his background as Minnesota's governor, a lawmaker and a member of the National Guard for nearly 25 years.\n\nVETERAN WHO SERVED IN TIM WALZ'S BATTALION ADDRESSES STOLEN VALOR ACCUSATIONS: 'FAR DARKER THAN PEOPLE THINK'\n\nWhen Walz left the Guard, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, but he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant. National Guard officials have said that he retired before fulfilling requirements for the position, including coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy. The subsequent lower rank was due to benefit requirements and a technicality.\n\nHowever, Republicans have accused Walz of engaging in \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and former President Trump's running mate, said this week. Vance is a Marine Corps veteran.\n\n\"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did,\" he said.\n\nVance accused Walz of having dropped out of the National Guard to avoid serving in the Iraq War.\n\nJD VANCE ACCUSES TIM WALZ OF 'LYING' ABOUT MILITARY SERVICE: 'STOLEN VALOR GARBAGE'\n\n\"As a Marine who served his country in uniform when the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably,\" he said. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.\"\n\nHowever, the Minnesota National Guard told Fox News that Walz's unit was not given deployment orders to Iraq until July, and he had submitted retirement papers five to seven months prior to his retirement in May 2005.\n\nArmy Lt. Col. Ryan Rossman, the Minnesota National Guard's director of operations, also explained Walz's rank at the time of his retirement in a statement to Fox News.\n\n\"He was technically a command sergeant major when he deployed to Europe with his battalion but to retire as a CSM you have to go through a final course, which he had not completed. So, from a benefits perspective, the Army retired him as a master sergeant (lower enlisted rank). But, according to National Guard records, he was a command sergeant major technically when deployed. The lower rank was as a result of benefit requirements and a technicality.\"\n\nVance noted comments from Walz on gun control, saying the governor had used his military history in an attempt to push gun restrictions.\n\n\"He said, 'We shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets.' Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq? And he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,\" Vance said.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform. And as vice president of the United States, he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said this week.\n\nFox News' Jennifer Griffin, Jeffrey

In no way were the units or Soldiers of the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion replacing any units or military forces so they could deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to Retired Command Sergeant Majors Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, an order was issued to Walz's artillery battalion in early 2005, warning the unit to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq.\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005 he quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" Behrends and Herr wrote in a paid letter to the Western Central Tribune. \"His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for congress. Which is false, according to a Department of Defense Directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have.\"\n\nBehrends and Herr continued: \"On September 10th, 2005 conditionally promoted Command Sergeant Major Walz was reduced to Master Sergeant. It took a while for the system to catch up to him as it was uncharted territory, literally no one quits in the position he was in, or drops out of the academy. Except him.\"\n\nAccording to investigative journalist Jordan Schachtel, Walz's \"stolen valor\" goes beyond questions about his rank.\n\n\"Walz sold himself to the public and the media as a combat veteran of the Global War on Terror, masking the reality that he quit the military to run for office and avoid being deployed to Iraq,\" Schachtel reported on his Substack, the Dossier. \"Just months after leaving his battalion to go to Iraq without him, he announced a run for Congress, and the dissembling about his service record began immediately,\" Schachtel wrote.\n\nBloomberg's Joshua Green, then employed at The Atlantic, was the first major reporter to profile Walz. In an interview with the then-congressional candidate, Green writes that in 2004, Walz left his hometown in Minnesota \"to serve overseas in Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nIt's unclear if this is Green, a veteran reporter, omitting major facts, or if Walz, the interviewee, is selling Green on a particular narrative. Nonetheless, the assertion is incredibly misleading, as it leaves the reader under the impression that Walz served as boots on the ground in the Global War on Terror, when in reality, he merely deployed to Italy in 2003 for a six month stint.\n\nIt gets much worse.\n\nGreen discusses a 2004 visit from former President George W. Bush to Gov. Walz's hometown, in which a protesting Walz (who was still serving in the military) told the reporter about him supposedly demanding to speak to the then commander in chief.\n\n\"Walz thought for a moment and asked the Bush staffers if they really wanted to arrest a command sergeant major who'd just returned from fighting the war on terrorism,\" Green writes.\n\nWhile the first instance can be written off as an issue of unclear reportage, the second example cannot be explained away. Walz was not just serving in a support role for the war effort (from Italy), he had been \"fighting the war on terrorism.\"\n\nAccording to the article, Walz was picked out of relative obscurity by Democrat operatives due to his military service. These operatives went out and recruited \"veterans from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,\" Green writes\n\nWalz to this day, continues to mischaracterize his military service, recently telling an audience while delivering remarks on gun control: \"We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"", "source": {"uri": "amgreatness.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Greatness"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That statement eliminates any doubt over whether Walz knew an Iraq deployment was on the table when he decided to leave the service. A source who served in the Minnesota National Guard at the time previously told the Free Beacon that the timing of Walz's retirement \"left a bad taste in a lot of peoples' mouths.\"\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major, I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on,\" Walz said in a campaign statement on March 20, 2005. Just three days prior, the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced that at least part of his battalion could be shipped overseas to the Middle East in the next two years.\n\nWalz left the National Guard that May. Two months later, his battalion was put on notice that they would be deploying to Iraq.\n\nCNN reported on Wednesday that Walz's National Guard unit only received notice of the deployment in July, two months after he retired. But the campaign statement shows that Walz knew that an Iraq deployment was at least on the table. The two reporters who wrote that piece, Haley Britzky and Jeremy Herb, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe revelation that Walz knew of his potential deployment when he decided to retire is just the most recent controversy surrounding his representation of his military career. Walz has previously faced accusations of \"stolen valor\" from combat veterans for how he described his time in the National Guard.\n\nWalz presented himself as a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom both at a 2004 rally and during his 2006 congressional campaign launch, the Free Beacon reported Wednesday. Those misrepresentations spurred a local Iraq war veteran to confront Walz's staff about Walz's claims, a resurfaced video from 2009 shows. Walz's staff then said they would follow up with the veteran. A subsequent meeting never occurred, a source familiar with the situation told the Free Beacon.\n\nHarris's presidential campaign released a video on Tuesday featuring Walz calling for gun control. In that video, Walz says, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is [sic] the only place that those weapons are at.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign did not return a request for comment.\n\nWalz served in the Nebraska National Guard from 1981 to 1996 and the Minnesota National Guard from 1996 to 2005. His deployments only took him as far as military bases in Europe and he never saw any combat.\n\nSen. J.D. Vance (R., Ohio), the Republican vice presidential nominee, attacked Walz for his military record on Thursday. At a press conference, Vance, a Marine who served in Iraq, said, \"I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably, and I'm very proud of that service.\"\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "freebeacon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Free Beacon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_simonson@freebeacon.com", "name": "Joseph Simonson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

And in that time, it's already become clear how Walz has enjoyed such a successful political career in Minnesota. It's not because he's achieved anything notable for people living in the state, aside from making major cities far more dangerous. It's not because he's particularly charismatic or intelligent or compelling to listen to. Walz is none of those things.\n\nTim Walz is the governor of Minnesota because the local media, under orders from the state's political machine, protected him for nearly two decades. They created a false persona -- Tim Walz the war hero-turned-folksy teacher -- and shut down any attempt to scrutinize his background. Specifically, the media buried evidence that Walz is a fraudster who has repeatedly and openly lied about his military service -- maybe the one moral infraction Americans still universally condemn, regardless of party.\n\nBut Walz is on the national stage now, which means he's receiving a lot more scrutiny from people who actually care about the truth. And it doesn't appear that Walz's allies -- or Kamala Harris' campaign -- were remotely ready for this scrutiny, because with each passing day, they're inadvertently providing even more evidence that Walz is guilty of stolen valor.\n\nFor instance, this is a video that Kamala Harris' official campaign account uploaded on social media the other day. It shows Walz speaking about his opposition to gun rights:\n\nThe fact that this video was uploaded by Kamala Harris' team tells you the extent of their \"vetting\" and their competence. They just uploaded footage of their VP lying about his military service, apparently without even realizing it.\n\nIn that clip Walz says he carried \"weapons of war\" while he was serving \"in war.\" But Walz never gets around to saying what war he was serving in, because there wasn't one. He deployed to Italy with the Minnesota National Guard. And this was long after World War II ended, so Italy wasn't a combat zone at the time he was there. There was no war in Italy. Therefore he never carried a weapon of war \"in war.\" He's lying -- pretty flagrantly -- about his military service.\n\nWalz's defenders will try to parse what he said very carefully, and suggest he was really referring to the Global War on Terror. And they'll suggest Walz carried rifles as part of that effort -- maybe in training, or maybe while he was at some guard post at an airfield somewhere -- so therefore, his statement is technically accurate. This is obviously a very strained attempt to change the clear meaning and implication of what Walz said. There is no reasonable person who would say he was carrying a weapon \"in war\" if he was sitting around in a non-combat post in Italy.\n\nWalz and his defenders have specifically gone to great lengths to associate him with Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, in a way that's as misleading as possible. Alpha News reports that on his gubernatorial campaign website in 2018, Walz's biography stated: \"He joined his battalion overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\" That's somewhat close to the truth, but it's deliberately misleading because it doesn't clarify exactly where exactly Walz was stationed.\n\nEven more egregious, the Washington Free Beacon reports that in 2006, Walz's campaign announcement described himself as a \"Veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom.\" And during the 2004 presidential race, Walz also held a sign that read, \"Operation Enduring Freedom Veterans for Kerry.\" It was purposefully misleading. It was all clearly designed to create the impression Walz had served in a combat role in Afghanistan.\n\nBut Walz kept saying it. Also in 2004, as Jordan Schachtel reported yesterday on his Substack, the Bloomberg reporter Joshua Green -- who was then employed by The Atlantic -- repeated the lie. Green wrote that Walz had left his hometown, \"to serve overseas in Operation Enduring Freedom.\"\n\nAt points, the implication was even more explicit. In The Atlantic profile, Green states that Walz was a \"command sergeant major who'd just returned from fighting the war on terrorism.\" This alleged service, Green says, is why Walz was chosen by Democrat Party elites for a career in politics. Green writes that these operatives were looking for, \"veterans from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,\" when they stumbled on Walz.\n\nIt's obvious that Walz fed lies to this reporter and to the public, going back two decades, in order to portray himself as a war hero. But he was no war hero. He was a coward who abandoned his own National Guard unit. The moment he learned his battalion was going to Iraq, while his congressional run was underway, Walz quit.\n\nIn a March 2005 press release, Walz claimed: \"I don't want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race.\" He said his wife will be a major part of his campaign \"whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.\" Walz's press release concluded: \"If called to duty, Walz would leave behind his wife Gwen and four year old daughter Hope.\"\n\nBut Walz avoided that situation by quitting. Walz was a Command Sergeant Major at the time he quit. That's a rank he accepted, knowing it came with responsibilities. But Walz didn't meet those responsibilities, so he was demoted after he left the military. But Walz kept on referring to himself as a command sergeant major anyway, which is yet another instance of stolen valor. It's like someone who wears a Ranger tab because they were selected for Ranger school and then failed. It's a lie.\n\nAs Just the News reports:\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard confirmed Wednesday that Gov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris' vice presidential running mate, was demoted and did not retire as a command sergeant major like he has claimed for years, including on his official gubernatorial biography. While Walz temporarily held the title of command sergeant major he 'retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,' Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, the Minnesota National Guard's State Public Affairs Officer, told Just the News.\n\nSeparately, Alpha News spoke to Tom Behrends, the actual retired command sergeant major who replaced Walz. Here's his assessment of Walz' cowardice and deception:\n\nThere are a lot of people who served in Walz's same National Guard unit who feel the same way. JR Salzman for example tweeted this picture, along with the caption: \"Here I am on our Iraq deployment with the Minnesota Army National Guard, the very same deployment @Tim_Walz bailed on.\"\n\nSalzman added: \"I served in the Minnesota National Guard with him. He literally abandoned us when we were about to be deployed to Iraq. He's a coward and should be treated as such.\"\n\nWhat's remarkable about Walz's lies is that he does it so often that his own allies are the ones outing him, albeit inadvertently. For example, New Jersey governor Phil Murphy just uploaded this photo of Walz and Josh Shapiro.\n\nThe intent was to show that they get along. But Walz's hat stuck out to a lot of veterans because it shows the Special Forces crest. It's a hat that Walz wears a lot, even though he was never in the special forces:\n\nBy itself, you might argue this isn't a big deal. But if you put it together with all of the lies Walz has told about his military record, it starts to paint a picture of a narcissist who enjoys portraying himself as an accomplished veteran, when he's really a coward who's hated by the people he served with and later abandoned.\n\nAt this point you have to wonder whether Americans will tolerate this for much longer. It's truly a test of how low the bar is in the Democrat Party, if they keep Tim Walz on as their nominee. And from what we're hearing, this is just the beginning. More and more examples of Walz's stolen valor will come out. And it's pretty ironic given that, when he was in Congress, Walz voted \"yes\" on the Stolen Valor Act, which makes it illegal to falsely claim military service to obtain some benefit. In other words Tim Walz may have violated the very law he passed against stolen valor.\n\nIn 2009, an Iraq War veteran named David Thul confronted Tim Walz's staff about this. He brought the photo of Walz identifying as a \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" veteran. And the staffer admits that Walz had tricked some people into thinking he served in Afghanistan. Watch:\n\nThe staffer acknowledges that people were being misled about Walz's biography, but apparently no one in Walz's office changed it. And according to the Free Beacon, the staff took no action to correct Walz's bio after this confrontation. It's an incredible video.\n\nAt the moment there appears to be some creeping realization in the Harris campaign about how bad all of this is. Yesterday Walz was asked about his military record and he quickly ran away:\n\nSo Walz's strategy is the same as Harris' -- he'll just avoid answering any questions. He'll count on the media to cover for him, as they did for 20 years in Minnesota. But there are signs that strategy may not work anymore. Even CNN is now pointing out Walz's history of fraud. Watch:\n\nThere was some opposition research on Josh Shapiro that surfaced over the past week or so. He may have covered up a homicide by ruling it a suicide in order to help a friend. That was one allegation. Oh, and he may have swept a sexual harassment claim under the rug too. That was another one.\n\nThe truth is that, in the modern political landscape, none of those alleged sins is really disqualifying. Josh Shapiro could have survived them. But there are very real questions about whether Tim Walz can survive this. Stolen valor is the one moral infraction that no one tolerates. It repulses all reasonable people at a fundamental level. And somehow, Tim Walz survived Kamala Harris' supposedly rigorous vetting process despite lying repeatedly about his military record.\n\nAs damning as this is for Tim Walz, it's also a massive indictment of Kamala Harris. Picking Tim Walz to be her vice president was the first major decision that Kamala Harris has made since stealing the nomination. And, left to her own devices, she immediately flopped on her face. For all of her campaign's contrived attacks on Donald Trump for supposedly malingering the military, Kamala Harris has managed to pick a running mate who, by his own actions, demonstrated very clearly that he thinks military service members are suckers. He'll leave them behind in an instant, and then he'll lie about it for decades.\n\nIf nothing else, the selection of Tim Walz is a pretty clear preview of the level of absolute incompetence a Kamala Harris administration would entail. She could have chosen the governor of Pennsylvania but instead, she went with a Leftist who abandoned his own National Guard unit and then repeatedly lied about it. No matter how many celebrities line up behind Kamala Harris, and no matter how long she hides from the press, the truth about Tim Walz will be impossible to deny. He will continue to drag her campaign down even further with each new revelation of his stolen valor. And by Election Day, millions more people will have come to a basic and obvious realization -- which is that a woman who can't even manage her campaign is not capable of running the country.",

J.D. Vance as his 2024 running mate was on full display Wednesday.\n\nThe former president could never have known when he tapped the Marine Corps combat veteran back in mid-July that prior military service would become such an important issue.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris announced that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is her running mate, and a significant element of his resume is that he is a National Guard veteran. So, in theory, he should have the ability to draw patriotic swing voters to the ticket.\n\nHarris placed Walz's military service front and center at their first rally together in Philadelphia on Tuesday, saying, \"To his fellow veterans, he is Sgt. Maj. Walz.\"\n\nHowever, retired Minnesota Guard Command Sgt. Maj. Thomas Behrends told Alpha News in 2022, as Walz was seeking re-election, that the governor left military service in 2005 after receiving a warning order that his unit, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, was to be deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"He abandoned us. ... As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way, hung his hat up and quit,\" Behrends recalled.\n\nThe veteran explained that he was next in line behind Walz in the unit to take the command sergeant major's slot. Behrends stepped up and deployed to Iraq for nearly two years in Walz's absence.\n\nVance responded to Walz's decision to leave the military, saying at a campaign event in Michigan, \"You know what really bothers me about Tim Walz as a Marine who served his country in uniform? When the United States Marine Corps, when the United State of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did it when they asked me to do it, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked to go to Iraq by his country, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\" Vance noted.\n\nThe senator also highlighted Walz's stolen valor.\n\n\"He said we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be [used] on America's streets,\" Vance said. \"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone?\"\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,\" he concluded. \"I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nFlorida GOP Congressman Michael Waltz, a combat veteran who served in the U.S. Army Special Forces, also said he believes Walz's conduct was shameful.\n\n\"It's kind of like the quarterback of a big team walking away from their team right before they go to the Super Bowl. I've never heard anything like it, especially the fact that he was a command sergeant major. I've never heard of a commander or a sergeant major stepping away from their unit before they go down range,\" he said.\n\nWalz responded to the Iraq deployment controversy when it first arose in 2006 as he was running for Congress, writing in a letter, \"After completing 20 years of service in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for an additional four years following Sept. 11 and retired the year before my battalion was deployed to Iraq in order to run for Congress.\n\n\"I'm proud of the 24 years I served our country in the Army National Guard. There's a code of honor among those who've served, and normally this type of partisan political attack comes only from one who's never worn a uniform,\" he added.\n\nBut Behrends and fellow retired Command Sgt. Maj. Paul Herr argued in a 2018 joint paid letter in the West Central Tribune, when Walz was first running for governor, that he was not being truthful about his military service.\n\n\"According to his official Report of Separation and Record of Service, he re-enlisted for six years on September 18th, 2001. However, in his response he says that he re-enlisted for four years, conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq,\" they wrote.\n\nFurther, if he had in fact re-enlisted for four years, that would have made his retirement date Sept. 18, 2005, rather than when he did retire on May 16, 2005.\n\n\"And he makes it sound like he 'retired' a year before his battalion deployed to Iraq; when in reality he knew when he 'retired' that the battalion would be deployed to Iraq,\" Behrends and Herr pointed out.\n\nVance, who did serve in combat, is the perfect messenger to highlight Walz's tarnished military record.\n\nInstead of the governor's prior service being an asset to the Democratic ticket, it will quickly become a liability.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "randy_desoto@westernjournal.com", "name": "Randy DeSoto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Since Walz was introduced as Kamala Harris's running mate, his military background has attracted attention, particularly due to claims made by his opponent, Vance.\n\nControversy Surrounding Tim Walz's Military Record\n\nTim Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, faces allegations regarding his military service, particularly concerning his departure from the Army National Guard. JD Vance, the Republican candidate who has military experience himself, has intensified scrutiny by suggesting that Walz deliberately evaded combat during the Iraq War.\n\nVance stated, \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him.\" While several veterans have expressed dissatisfaction with Walz's decision to leave his unit prior to deployment, others refute claims that he resigned to avoid combat.\n\nWalz served for 24 years in the Army National Guard, which primarily supports domestic operations but can be mobilized for combat. In February 2005, as he was seeking election to Congress, he noted possible mobilization of troops from his unit to Iraq within two years. He stated, \"I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilisation.\" Walz eventually retired from the National Guard in May 2005, citing his intention to focus on his congressional campaign.\n\nDeployment Timeline\n\nWalz's National Guard unit received orders for deployment to Iraq in July 2005 and was deployed in March 2006. Specific details about when Walz submitted his resignation have not been confirmed publicly.\n\nDid Walz See Combat?\n\nVance has also accused Walz of being misleading regarding his combat claims. In a video, Walz appeared to suggest personal involvement in gun-related duties during wartime. However, it remains unclear what his exact experiences entail.\n\nWhile Walz was deployed to Italy in 2003 to assist with operations related to the Afghanistan War, he never served in a combat zone. A spokesperson for the Harris campaign defended Walz's military experience, stating, \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times.\"\n\nAllegations of Rank Misrepresentation\n\nThe Trump campaign has criticized Walz for allegedly misrepresenting his military rank at retirement.

JD Vance, accused his newly minted Democratic counterpart Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz of leaving the National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq -- raising a years-old allegation that Walz and some of his fellow guardsmen have long disputed, arguing instead he retired after 24 years to run for Congress.\n\n\"When the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance, a former Marine who was deployed to Iraq, said Wednesday. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq ... he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the Harris-Walz campaign said in statement.\n\nIn a New York Post interview published Sunday, Behrends also suggested Walz falsely inflated his military rank by calling himself a command sergeant major throughout his political career, despite his rank being reduced to master sergeant since he retired before completing the terms of his promotion. Harris referred to Walz as \"Sgt. Maj. Walz\" while praising his background during their first campaign event together Tuesday, hours after she announced him as her running mate. Minnesota National Guard spokesperson Capt. Holly Rockow told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018 it's fair to say Walz served as sergeant major since that was his rank at the time of his retirement in 2005, though it was retroactively reverted back to master sergeant because he retired before completing requirements associated with his promotion, the Harris campaign notes.\n\nWalz -- a Nebraska native who later moved to Minnesota -- joined the Nebraska Army National Guard in 1981 and retired in 2005 as a master sergeant, according to Military.com, citing his military records and a statement from the Minnesota Guard. Walz responded to natural disasters and was deployed to Italy to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan during his tenure, and he received several awards, including Nebraska Citizen Soldier of the Year in 1989. Walz simultaneously worked as a high school teacher and football coach during his time as a guardsman prior to his run for Congress in 2005.\n\nHarris tapped Walz as her running mate Tuesday and the two appeared for the first time together at a campaign rally in Philadelphia later that night, ahead of a multi-day swing state tour. Democrats hope Walz can appeal to midwestern voters in the crucial swing states of Wisconsin and Michigan. The GOP has aimed to cast Walz as a \"far-left lunatic,\" as the Republican National Committee described him in a statement Tuesday, while the Trump campaign called the Democratic ticket \"weak, failed\" and \"dangerously liberal.\" Walz developed a reputation as a centrist in Congress while representing a deep-red district for 12 years, bucking his party to vote to hold former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress and to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, though he signed legislation often championed by progressives during his second term as governor.\n\nKamala Harris

Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, with Republicans questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nHere's a look at Walz's record and how it's become a campaign issue:\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's that retirement that Republicans have criticized in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 - just two days after his 17th birthday - and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\nFILE - Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, is pictured at a campaign rally in Philadelphia, Aug. 6, 2024. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz\u00b4s campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance questioned whether Walz's departure from service months ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, calling it \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 - said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic,\" arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.\"\n\nAssociated Press reporters Trenton Daniel and Richard Lardner

Tim Walz speaks at a press conference at Burnsville City Hall about the two police officers and first responder that were killed. (Angelina Katsanis/Minneapolis Star Tribune/TNS)\n\nJ.D. Vance, the 2024 Republican vice presidential nominee, slammed Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), on Wednesday as \"absolutely shameful\" for reportedly retiring from his Army National Guard battalion before being deployed to Iraq.\n\nDiscussing reports that claimed Walz retired from the Army National Guard before his battalion was deployed in 2005 during a Wednesday interview with The Daily Mail, Vance said, \"I mean, your job as a senior enlisted guy in a unit is to keep your people safe. That's not a job you can switch out of on a moment's notice.\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's running mate added that it was \"absolutely shameful\" if Walz \"abandoned his troops before they went to Iraq or wherever.\"\n\n\"There was a clip the Kamala campaign posted about him where he's making a gun control argument. He said, 'Look, you should not be able to carry the weapons that I carried in war,'\" Vance added. \"And I'm, I'm thinking to myself, well, when did you go to war? What weapon did you carry in the war, Tim, because apparently you skipped out on your unit before they went to Iraq.\"\n\nVance questioned why Walz was \"lying to make a political point\" since it was public knowledge that the Minnesota governor had not been deployed to a combat zone during his service with the National Guard.\n\nREAD MORE: Harris' 2024 running mate revealed: Report\n\nThe Daily Mail noted that while Walz previously admitted that he was never in combat, the Harris campaign shared a video about gun control on Tuesday featuring Walz claiming that he carried guns \"in war.\"\n\nIn the video, Walz can be heard saying, \"I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can do CDC research, we can make sure we don't have reciprocal carry among states, and we can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\nAccording to The Post Millennial, Walz told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018 that he did not experience any combat during his time with the Army National Guard and acknowledged that there were \"certainly folks that did far more than I did.\"\n\nIn a letter published by West Central Tribune in 2018, retired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends and retired Command Sergeant Major Paul Herr claimed Walz \"embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances of his military career for years.\"\n\nThe two National Guard Sergeants Major also claimed that Walz left \"the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war\" when he retired in 2005.", "source": {"uri": "americanmilitarynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Military News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "timothy_frudd@americanmilitarynews.com", "name": "Timothy Frudd", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz as her running mate, the Trump-Vance campaign called into question claims he previously made about his military service, opening a broadside against the U.S. Navy veteran that some Republicans now liken to \"sort of a Swift Boat 2.0 attack.\"\n\nIt is a reference to the highly contentious playbook the GOP used against Sen. John Kerry when the Massachusetts Democrat ran for the White House in 2004, in large part on his record as a junior naval officer in Vietnam. Those character attacks, widely panned at the time, called into question whether Kerry really deserved his combat medals, notably the three Purple Hearts he was awarded while commanding Swift Boats in the Mekong Delta. For better or worse, this line of criticism has now been rebooted for Walz in the 2024 election.\n\nWalz likely remembers the history well. His first foray into politics was as a volunteer for the Kerry campaign in Minnesota, and later, as the district coordinator of an organization called \"Vets for Kerry.\" So does Chris LaCivita, a senior advisor to the Trump campaign, who worked as the chief strategist for the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a veteran's group that worked to scuttle the 2004 Kerry campaign.\n\nLaCivita made the comparison explicit in an interview with RealClearPolitics. \"Birds of a feather,\" he said of Walz and Kerry, \"will be tarred together.\"\n\nThe battle to define the vice-presidential candidate was joined the moment Harris brought him on stage in Philadelphia Tuesday evening. Her running mate was \"more than a governor,\" she told an at-capacity crowd in Philadelphia Tuesday. To his constituents, he was \"Congressman.\" To his high school football players, \"Coach.\" And, she added, \"to his fellow veterans, he is Sergeant Major Walz.\"\n\nWalz retired from the Minnesota National Guard in 2005, ending a 24-year career shortly before his unit, the National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery, deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him - a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,\" said Trump running mate Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance. A Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq, Vance added, \"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign responded to those allegations in a statement to RCP, saying that \"after 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nThe unit in question deployed to Iraq for 22 months after Walz left it and suffered casualties. At the time, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty ordered state flags lowered to half-staff in honor of Sgt. Kyle R. Miller who was killed by a roadside bomb when \"assigned to Army National Guard's Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery Regiment.\"\n\nArmy Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, public affairs officer for the Minnesota National Guard, told NBC News that Walz \"culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion\" and \"retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\"\n\nThat specific rank has added a wrinkle to the debate. A command sergeant major is the most senior enlisted noncommissioned officer in a battalion, and Walz has faced scrutiny for representing himself as \"the highest-ranking enlisted service member ever to serve in Congress.\"\n\nThese questions were first raised when Walz ran for governor in 2018. In a letter to the editor of a Minnesota newspaper, two command sergeant majors from Walz's unit wrote that Walz was only \"conditionally promoted\" to that rank \"but was never qualified at that rank, and will receive retirement benefits at one rank below.\"\n\nMinnesota Public Radio reported in 2018 that a public affairs office for the state National Guard stated that it was appropriate for Walz to say he served at the rank of command sergeant major. And others who served with Walz were quick to defend him in subsequent years. Joseph Eustice, a 32-year National Guard veteran who later led the same battalion as Walz, told the Star Tribune that the \"he was a great soldier\" and that \"when he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\n\"I love him as a soldier; I don't care much for him as a politician,\" Eustice told the Tribune in 2022, before adding, \"the man did nothing wrong.\"\n\nWhen running for reelection that year, the Walz gubernatorial campaign responded to criticism with a letter signed by 50 veterans praising his record. \"Gov. Walz secured additional funding for new veterans' homes,\" read the letter obtained first by NBC News. \"In his first term, Minnesota was one of just seven states initially selected by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to participate in the 'Governor's Challenge' to eliminate veteran deaths by suicide.\"\n\nWhile running for governor, Walz did not emphasize his military tenure, focusing instead on his time as a teacher and coach. \"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,\" Walz said in 2018. \"I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nBut Republican Rep. Michael Waltz, a Green Beret who retired from the Florida Army National Guard last year as a colonel, said the debate over Walz's rank is not clerical. It isn't just a point of mistaken emphasis either. \"From a veteran's perspective,\" Rep. Waltz said in an interview with RCP, \"these are not slip-ups that you would make. I would never purport myself to be a one-star general if I retired as a colonel. Those are just clear-cut lines that he has crossed.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign invited more controversy when they shared a video of the governor calling for gun control. \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" the vice-presidential candidate can be seen saying in the undated clip.\n\nBut did he really carry weapons in a war zone? The Harris campaign said Walz fought flooding and responded to tornadoes stateside while also spending months on active duty deployed in Italy. As a gubernatorial candidate, he told the Star Tribune that his battalion was deployed in 2003 to protect against potential threats in Europe while active military forces were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nVance called out Walz over this claim. \"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance asked at a Michigan campaign stop. \"What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq?\"\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is this stolen valor garbage,\" Vance added. \"Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\" During a subsequent Wisconsin campaign stop Vance added, that while he \"served in a combat zone,\" he had \"never said that I saw a firefight myself ... I've always told the truth about my Marine Corps service.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign did not dispute that the governor may have overstated his case when claiming he carried a weapon in war. \"In his 24 years of service, the governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Gov. Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country,\" the campaign said in a statement to RCP. \"It's the American way.\"\n\nSo is negative campaigning, as John Kerry can attest. The liberal Democrat, who later served as secretary of state under Obama and special presidential envoy for climate under Biden, maintained that the Swift Boat accusations against him were \"lies.\" He earned a Silver Star, a Bronze Star, and three Purple Heart medals, one for each time he was wounded in battle. \"They lied and lied and lied about everything,\" Kerry told the New York Times in 2006. \"How many lies do you get to tell before someone calls you a liar? How many times can you be exposed in America today?\"\n\nIn political ads blanketing the airwaves, Swift Boat veterans argued that Kerry embellished his record and that his medals had been awarded erroneously.

Another dog can be seen on a couch and a cat on the floor as the dog bites down and sparks begin to shoot from the battery.\n\nCINCINNATI - Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, with Republicans questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nHere's a look at Walz's record and how it's become a campaign issue:\n\nArmy National Guard service: Walz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's that retirement that Republicans have criticized in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 - just two days after his 17th birthday - and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army \ue816National Guard.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nMore: Harris selects Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate, aiming to add Midwest muscle to ticket\n\nRepublican criticism: Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance questioned whether Walz's departure from service months ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, calling it \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nVance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, serving four years as a combat correspondent, a type of military journalist, and deploying to Iraq in 2005.\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris has served in the U.S. military.\n\nDemocratic response: In a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 - said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic,\" arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.\"",

D. Vance (R-OH), took particular exception to a clip recently posted on X by the Harris campaign. In the clip, Walz -- discussing gun control -- said that politicians should \"make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\" Vance, who served in the Marines and deployed to Iraq, called it \"stolen valor garbage,\" saying, \"When I got the call to go to Iraq, I went. Tim Walz said he carried a gun in a war. Did he? No. It was a lie.\"\n\nWalz enlisted in the Army National Guard at the age of 17. During the course of his service, he did not enter combat, although he did deploy for six months to Italy during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. By 2005, he had served for 24 years and achieved the rank of command sergeant major in the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery. In February of the same year, he filed paperwork to run for Congress in Minnesota, where he lived and worked as a geography teacher for Makato High School.\n\nWhile some have claimed that Walz did not know about his battalion's future deployment before his retirement -- he retired some months before his unit was mobilized -- in March 2005 his campaign released a press statement informing the public of his intention to continue his run for office despite a potential deployment to Iraq. The statement read, \"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on.... I don't want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race.\"\n\nIn May 2005, Walz retired from the Army National Guard two months later as a master sergeant, not having held the position of command sergeant major for a sufficient period of time to qualify for retirement at that rank.

Tim Walz is again facing scrutiny over his military retirement after Trump running mate J.D. Vance accused Walz of running for Congress to avoid deployment in Iraq.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\" Vance said Wednesday at a Michigan news conference.\n\nWalz enlisted as a member of the National Guard at age 17, serving for 24 years in Nebraska and Minnesota. When he ran for Congress the first time in 2005, he held the rank of command sergeant major in the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery.\n\nOn March 17 of that year, the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced a possible mobilization of part or all of Walz's battalion to serve in Iraq over the following two years.\n\nAt that time, Walz said he was determined to stay in the race.\n\nMore from this section Nobel winner Yunus returns to Bangladesh, hails 'second independence' Tokyo's Nikkei index closes up 10.2% after previous day's record fall David Lynch reveals emphysema diagnosis, vows to 'never' retire\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,\" Walz said in a campaign news release. \"I don't want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race.\"\n\nAlmost exactly two months later, May 16, Walz retired honorably from military service without having seen combat. He won the congressional election in 2006, and won re-election five times before running for Minnesota governor. Walz has served as the state's governor since 2018.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign responded to Vance's accusations with praise for the governor's record, stating \"he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "center_square@reformer.com", "name": "Center Square", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "therese_boudreaux@reformer.com", "name": "Therese Boudreaux", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

But the former football coach, avid hunter and school teacher from a distinctly rural background is hard to typecast as a faithful disciple of Karl Marx. So the GOP is deploying an old playbook item that Trump campaign co-chair Chris LaCivita knows well from his deep involvement in the \"swiftboating\" of John Kerry in 2004: an attack on Walz's military record, one of his strongest credentials in rebutting the idea he is some sort of anti-American zealot.\n\nLaCivita is front and center in the attack on Walz, unsurprisingly, as Politico Playbook reports:\n\n\"The two biggest sins in the military are claiming credit for decorations you don't have or claiming combat action that you did not participate in ... And this much is certain: He's guilty of at least one of them,\" LaCivita told our colleagues Jared Mitovich, Meridith McGraw and Connor O'Brien yesterday. \"Nothing regarding his lies has been weaponized in a political sense. That's about to change.\"\n\nThe hit man in this attack was, appropriately enough, Walz's counterpart, J.D. Vance, who much like Walz enlisted right after high school (Vance in the Marines, Walz in the Army National Guard). As the New York Times reports, Vance came in very hot on the accusations to which LaCivita alluded:\n\nSpeaking at the police department in Shelby Township, Mich., on Wednesday morning, Mr. Vance said Mr. Walz had effectively deserted his fellow soldiers to avoid serving in Iraq because he retired from the National Guard in May 2005, several months before his artillery unit received orders to deploy there ...\n\nMr. Vance also seized on a remark by Mr. Walz in a video clip that the Harris campaign had promoted on social media on Tuesday, in which the governor told a crowd about support for gun control, saying that \"we can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nMr. Walz never served in combat, however, which prompted Mr. Vance to accuse him of \"stolen valor.\"\n\n\"I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did,\" Mr. Vance said.\n\nWill this effort work as it did (to some extent) against John Kerry? Probably not.\n\nFirst of all, the facts underlying the LaCivita-Vance line of attack don't appear to justify all the angry passion. No one is disputing that Walz served honorably in the Guard for 24 years. The first charge, and perhaps the most serious, is that Walz retired at the end of those 24 years (as he was fully eligible to do) in order to avoid deployment to Iraq. Two former Guard colleagues, apparently infuriated by Walz's opposition to the Iraq War, first raised this charge as part of an earlier political attack on Walz when he ran for governor in 2018. But other colleagues documented that Walz had been talking for quite some time about retiring in order to run for Congress (which is precisely what he did) and that he had no way of knowing about the subsequent deployment when he retired. There's really no more evidence of Walz's alleged cowardice than an assertion by two dudes who clearly didn't like his politics.\n\nThe second charge, which Vance dressed up with the lurid term of \"stolen valor,\" really just refers to a single ambiguous reference Walz made to carrying a gun \"in war,\" though others have pointed to a claim in a 2006 Walz press release that he served in \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" (the official name of the Afghanistan deployment). Whatever viewers of that press release thought, the claim is actually true since Walz and his unit were deployed to Europe in a support capacity for that war.\n\nThough Vance didn't mention it, his conservative allies have also charged that Walz inflated his rank in descriptions of his service. This attack line is probably the flimsiest: Everyone concedes Walz achieved the rank of command sergeant major in the Guard, the highest rank attainable by an enlisted service member. But he didn't complete some coursework required to retire at that rank. So are a few references on campaign websites to Walz as a \"retired command sergeant major\" some sort of \"lie?\" I don't think so; he was retired, and he did achieve that rank.\n\nAll in all, the attacks on Walz's military record come across as pretty weak tea. Even the most serious -- the claim that he dodged serving in Iraq -- requires an asterisk: J.D. Vance's running mate, Donald Trump, has endlessly described that war as a disastrous mistake. By the time he retired from the Guard, Walz shared that view. Should he have stuck around to see if he could be deployed there?\n\nBut, facts aside, there are two big-picture reasons the attempted swiftboating of Tim Walz won't work. First, we're in a different era of American experiences with war. 2.9 million young men were drafted into the U.S. military during the Vietnam War; John Kerry's service there resonated with a lot of voters. In the post-conscription era, people like Walz and Vance (a public-affairs officer deployed to Iraq) who chose to put on the uniform are the exception rather than the rule. More typical is Donald Trump, who was ahead of his time in finding a way to avoid military service (via his father's influence, some claim).\n\nAnd the second reason this won't be a replay of 2004 is that the Kerry campaign largely ignored the \"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\" attacks on his war record, after setting them up for success by overemphasizing that record at the Democratic National Convention (the candidate famously began his acceptance speech by saluting and saying, \"I'm John Kerry and I'm reporting for duty\"). Walz hasn't made his Guard service his principal credential for election as vice-president. And the Harris-Walz campaign sure as hell isn't falling silent and letting the smears stand.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_kilgore@nymag.com", "name": "Ed Kilgore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_LaCivita", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris LaCivita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiftboating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swiftboating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Americanism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Americanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Walz, the Democrat Party's nominee for vice president, purportedly never saw combat and left the service before his unit was sent to Iraq in 2005.\n\n\"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" Walz said in the past.\n\nHowever, a number of veterans who were personally familiar with Walz have now openly asserted that Harris's vice presidential pick never even deployed.\n\nRetired Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr claimed in a letter published on Facebook in 2018 that during Walz's initial gubernatorial campaign, he left the National Guard after discovering his battalion would be sent to Iraq, even though he had promised his fellow soldiers that he would be joining them.\n\n\"On May 16, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" wrote Behrends and Herr.\n\n60-year-old Walz left the military in time to begin his political career the next year, winning a congressional bid in 2006.\n\nAdditionally, Walz's radical far-left policies as governor has seemingly been ignored by left-wing mainstream media outlets, which praised him as a \"down-to-earth White guy\" who could win over rural America in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nMeanwhile, Walz has also made a number of offensive jokes about a true decorated war hero, JD Vance (R-Ohio), while viciously ridiculing him.\n\n\"I came from a family where nobody in my family had ever gone to law school, I grew up in a poor family,\" Vance said. \"The fact that Tim Walz wants to turn it into a bad thing is that I worked myself through college, through law school, and made something of myself. To me, that's the American dream, and if Tim Walz wants to insult it, frankly that's pretty bizarre.\"\n\nDonald Trump's running mate, Vance, was in the U.S. Marines and he was deployed to Iraq for six months in late 2005. The Ohio senator \"enlisted in the military directly out of high school\" and \"joined the Marines in 2003,\" serving as a \"combat correspondent,\" USA Today reported.\n\nA reporter had previously approached Vance in regards to Walz ridiculing him on his past service.\n\nAfter highlighting the extraordinary effort it required to fulfill his educational goals and after paying tribute to his modest beginnings, Vance unleashed a torrent of criticism on Walz for his heinous betrayal of his National Guard brethren.\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance asked. \"What was this weapon you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went into Iraq? And he has not spent a day in a combat zone.\"\n\n\"Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that's shameful,\" Vance continued.\n\nStay informed! Receive breaking news blasts directly to your inbox for free.

Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, with Republicans questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nHere's a look at Walz's record and how it's become a campaign issue:\n\nArmy National Guard service\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's that retirement that Republicans have criticized in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nRepublican criticism\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance questioned whether Walz's departure from service months ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, calling it \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nVance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, serving four years as a combat correspondent, a type of military journalist, and deploying to Iraq in 2005.\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris has served in the U.S. military.\n\nDemocratic response\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 -- said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic,\" arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nAlso Read: | Kamala Harris and Tim Walz hold first joint rally in Philadelphia\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilsed in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the US Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nAlso Read: | Tim Walz says 'It's an honour of lifetime' on being named as running mate for Harris\n\nRepublican criticism\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance questioned whether Walz's departure from service months ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, calling it \"stolen valour garbage\".\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nDemocratic response\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the US House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nAlso Read: | Minnesota court upholds Walz-backed law restoring felons' right to vote\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 -- said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic\", arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion\".", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Tim Walz ... was demoted and did not retire as a command sergeant major like he has claimed for years, including on his official gubernatorial biography.\n\nWhile Walz temporarily held the title of command sergeant major he \"retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" Army Lt.

Bloomberg told its readers that Walz had \"recently returned from serving in Iraq as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.\"\n\nOnly now, Bloomberg is stealth-editing this apparent act of stolen valor away. Get a load of this:\n\nBloomberg has now stealth-edited the claim that Tim Walz served in Iraq. The claim was originally made by the same reporter (Joshua Green) in 2004 while doing a profile of Walz.\n\nThe press are literally scrubbing the records to try to stop this scandal. They won't succeed. https://t.co/9ANE2AYdnB\n\n-- Bonchie (@bonchieredstate) August 7, 2024\n\nHere's an article from 2007 where Walz, who was then in Congress, inflates his rank and talks as though he served in Iraq:\n\nCongressman Walz has a personal history with the Red Bulls, having retired in 2005 as command sergeant major for the 1-125th Battalion of the 1st Brigade Combat Team: \"I served alongside these Soldiers for many years and I could not be more proud of them.

Tim Walz (D) falsely claimed to be \"in war,\" or address any of the stolen valor accusations plaguing new Democrat vice presidential nominee for the past two days.\n\nSince Vice President Kamala Harris (D) unveiled Walz as her running mate on Tuesday, Walz has been dogged by false claims he has made throughout his political career that misrepresent his military career.\n\nWalz served for 24 years in the Army National Guard, but never deployed to war or in combat. He retired as a master sergeant in 2005, shortly before his unit deployed to Iraq.\n\nHowever, he has claimed on multiple occasions that he is a retired sergeant major -- a higher rank than he ultimately achieved, and has falsely suggested he went to war.\n\nHe repeated that false suggestion in a video clip put out by the Harris campaign itself. In the video clip, Walz claims he carried weapons \"in war.\"\n\nHe also falsely claimed in the video he served 25 years, when he actually served 24 years and one month.\n\nThere are also accusations by veterans who served with Walz that he -- as the top enlisted soldier in his unit -- abandoned them right as they were preparing to deploy to Iraq at the peak of the war.\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), when asked Wednesday at a press conference about an attack on him by Walz, fired back at the governor:\n\nWhen the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq, to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably. And I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with. I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through and then to drop out right before you actually have to go.\n\nWhen asked about Vance's comments, the White House dodged the claims entirely, with White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre only saying that Walz enlisted and 17 and served for 24 years.\n\n\"This is someone who enlisted at 17 years old to serve his country. He was part of the Army National Guard for 24 years. This is someone who was a high school teacher, a high school coach, as well, who grew up in a small town in the Midwest, and, so, I think his bio speaks for itself, who he is speaks for itself, his record speaks for itself, and I'm just not going to say anything beyond that,\" she said.\n\nWalz himself ignored a question about his military record on Wednesday.\n\nAnd when the Harris-Walz campaign responded on Wednesday to the Washington Post about the his claims, it offered no explanations as to why Walz falsely claimed to be a retired sergeant major, or have been in \"war.\"\n\nInstead, the campaign sidestepped the his false claims altogether and reportedly told the Post that Walz \"carried, fired and trained others\" how to use \"weapons of war innumerable times,\" and \"declined to address why Walz claimed incorrectly to have done so in war.\"\n\nThe campaign also tried to cast aspersion Vance (R-OH), the Republican vice presidential nominee by saying, \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country.\"\n\nThe controversy has only grown in recent days, with even CNN commentators acknowledging that Walz has not been honest about his military record.\n\n\"Absolutely false,\" one commentator said.\n\nHarris's vetting of Walz as her running mate is now increasingly coming under question.\n\nVetting for Harris's vice presidential pick was reportedly done by Eric Holder, who served as the attorney general under former President Barack Obama.\n\nReuters, who broke the news of Holder's involvement, wrote: \"His involvement in the vetting process may reassure Democrats that a longtime political and legal hand is helping to ensure Harris' pick, should she win the nomination, is free of major conflicts.\"\n\nThe Associated Press called Harris's process to choose a running mate as \"whirlwind\" and a \"16-day blitz.\"\n\n\"By the end, the process offered a preview of how Harris might fare under the pressures of the Oval Office,\" the AP said.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news",

Tim Walz (D), the Democratic Party's vice presidential candidate, joined the Army National Guard when he was 17 and stayed in the service for 24 years before retiring in 2005 to campaign for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nBut a comment about carrying a weapon \"in war\" is leading to accusations of \"stolen valor\" on the right given Walz retired as his unit was set to be deployed to Iraq.\n\nAccording to some soldiers who served with Walz, he carefully considered the decision to retire from the force before stepping down, talking it over with his soldiers in Minnesota before he went ahead with it.\n\n\"Would the soldier look down on him because he didn't go with us? Would the common soldier say, 'Hey, he didn't go with us, he's trying to skip out on a deployment?' And he wasn't,\" Al Bonnifield, who served under Walz, told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018. \"He talked with us for quite a while on that subject. He weighed that decision to run for Congress very heavy. He loved the military, he loved the guard, he loved the soldiers he worked with.\"\n\nOthers claimed he was ducking out on combat, his departure not long after an order for his unit to be mobilized into active duty for deployment to Iraq.\n\n\"In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq,\" wrote two retired officers, Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr in a paid letter submitted to the Minnesota newspaper the West Central Tribune. \"On May 16, 2005 [Walz] quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war. His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for Congress. Which is false, according to a Department of Defense directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have.\"\n\nIn the past 24 hours, conservative opponents of Walz have revived the controversy, trying to slam Walz for stealing valor and choosing to cut and run when he was called up to serve.\n\nMany pointed to comments Walz made after the 2018 Parkland shooting where he called for stricter gun control as an example of Walz inflating his service.\n\n\"I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt, and I gave the money back [to the NRA],\" Walz said at the time. \"I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment. But we can do background checks, we can do CDC research, we can make sure we don't have reciprocal carry among states, and we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only places where those weapons are at.\"\n\nThat comment about carrying \"weapons of war ... in war\" drew particular ire from conservatives, who pointed out that Walz had never served in a combat zone and had never been in war.\n\n\"What's more disturbing about what Tim Walz says here?\" asked YouTuber Mrgunsngear, who describes himself as a U.S. Air Force and Army veteran on X. \"1. Gov. Walz never went to war yet clearly said he did 2. Gov Walz is a far left gun grabber.\"\n\n\"From what i hear, he literally quit the military just to dodge a deployment, so yea what you say checks out, if thats true lol,\" posted @afrancis2371, whose bio says he's a U.S. Marine Corps veteran.\n\n\"There is no way around this. It's stolen valor,\" wrote the conservative influencer Mike Cernovich about the video. \"You can ignore it. You can say it doesn't matter. You can say other issues matter more. That's perfectly honest. Denying that this [is stolen valor] is fraud. You cannot do so honestly.\"\n\nAccording to a Minnesota Public Radio report, Walz readily acknowledged never being in combat. U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs records which Walz shared with the station showed that he filed a claim with the agency in 2013 for hearing loss in both ears and tinnitus. According to the records, Walz attributed the damage to Howitzer cannon from training with his field artillery unit for 21 years. Walz also had a 2005 surgery to replace damaged bones in his ears.\n\n\"I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance asked at a press conference in Michigan on Wednesday. \"What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq? He has not spent a day in a combat zone. What bothers me about Tim Walz is this stolen valor garbage, do not pretend to be something that you're not ... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I'd lied about his military service like he did.\"\n\nVance, who was in the U.S. Marine Corps for four years after high school was a combat correspondent in the branch's Department of Public Affairs, according to Stars & Stripes, the military's in-house newspaper.\n\n\"He spent his service working in public affairs, writing about Marines and taking photographs of their work, escorting civilian news reporters and speaking about happenings on base,\" the newspaper reported. \"In Iraq, he embedded with different units to get a sense of their daily routines and wrote a story about a crew keeping KC-130J tankers in the air. He also waded into unprotected Iraqi territory with a civil affairs unit to meet with locals.\"\n\n\"I was lucky to escape any real fighting,\" Vance reportedly wrote.\n\nOver on Reddit's r/army subreddit, some soldiers were also troubled by Walz's story.\n\n\"He was the senior NCO in a field artillery battalion. The guy who is supposed to set the example and uphold the standard. He's the very definition of a Summer Soldier,\" wrote u/Bitter_Piano5550. \"During the early part of the [Global War On Terror] I served with guys who were Vietnam Vets. Those guys have a lot of respect from me. A guy who serves in the Guard in the 80s and 90s when it was easy, has a vacation to Italy, and then nopes out when his unit is going to combat, doesn't.\"\n\n\"He seems like a good dude, but that seems like the most 'I got mine' leadership I've ever heard of,\" wrote u/tanstaafl00. \"I know more leaders that pulled strings TO deploy than outright quit to avoid going ... I get it. Life is complicated, and more than one thing can be true at once, but that looks real bad.\"\n\nBut other people defended Walz, saying that the move to retire was a relatable trajectory and that there was no shame in bowing out after nearly two and a half decades in the National Guard.\n\n\"At 24 years of service, I don't think anyone can say you haven't done your time and paid your dues,\" posted u/Copropostis.\n\n\"When my Reserve unit was called up in 2003, we had a couple of guys retire. They were older and had 20 years in or so. No one thought it was a big deal. Getting called up for Reserve or Guard is complicated. It messes with your civilian job, not matter how prepared you are,\" added u/tjcoffice.\n\nOther posters saw Walz's decision to retire as a savvy move.\n\n\"The ... bots are attacking him because he dropped a retirement packet right as his unit got a warno for deployment to the mid east. Like that's called winning the fucking game,\" posted u/thisisntnamman.\n\n\"He did a noncombatant deployment to Eucom in support of Afghanistan operations a few years earlier. He's a teacher not Rambo,\" added u/thisisntnamman.", "source": {"uri": "dailydot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Dot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marlon_ettinger@dailydot.com", "name":

He Dropped Out': Vance Blasts Walz For Ducking Combat In Iraq", "body": "Speaking in Shelby Township, Michigan, on Wednesday, GOP vice presidential candidate JD Vance blasted Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz for ducking out of fighting in Iraq when it was time for him to serve.\n\nAccording to former command sergeant major Thomas Behrends, who reportedly went to Iraq in Walz's place, and former command sergeant major Paul Herr, Walz retired from their National Guard unit in 2005. Months before Walz retired, he had received a warning order that his battalion would be deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"I needed to hit the ground running and take care of the troops -- and tell them we were going to war,\" Behrends told The New York Post of the 500 soldiers who had been under his command. \"For a guy in that position, to quit is cowardice. When your country calls, you are supposed to run into battle -- not the other way. He ran away. It's sad. He had the opportunity to serve his country, and said 'Screw you' to the United States. That's not who I would pick to run for vice president.\"\n\nVance responded to the accusations on Wednesday.\n\n\"What really bothers me about Tim Walz, as a Marine who served his country in uniform?\" Vance asked rhetorically. \"When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. ... When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq ... he dropped out of the Army.\"\n\nVance, the first military veteran on a major presidential ticket since John McCain in 2008, joined the U.S. Marines in 2003. At roughly the same time, Walz allegedly ducked out of serving in Iraq, Vance served as a combat correspondent there for six months.\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER FOR 'AM I RACIST?' -- A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI\n\nIn 2018, when Walz first ran for governor of Minnesota, Behrends and Herr wrote on Facebook, \"On May 16th, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.\"\n\n\"Walz would have been the Battalion Command Sergeant Major, the highest-ranking non-commissioned officer and arguably the most important leader in his unit,\" Dan Holloway, who served in the 82 Airborne, noted in Newsweek. \"And in the moment they needed him most, when they were about to deploy to Iraq, Walz chose to abandon his men to run for Congress.

Tim Walz because this is a disqualifying disaster? It's one of the risks when you have a do-over candidacy. Reportedly, former Attorney General Eric Holder quarterbacked this effort, but the issue surrounding Walz's military service isn't going away, as multiple lies have been uncovered. Either the Democrats knew and didn't care, or they didn't know, but it's irrelevant. Either outcome is inexcusable.\n\nIt goes beyond the initial story, which was bad enough: Walz bolted from the National Guard in 2005, just before his unit was about to deploy to Iraq. He did this to run for Congress. Then, he claimed he was a veteran of the Afghanistan War, which was a lie, said he deployed to Iraq, another lie, and later claimed he held a rank which he did not have upon retirement. There's even a video from 2009 of a veteran confronting Walz on this matter. It's an issue big enough for The Washington Post to devote a piece on Mr. Walz's military record:\n\nTim Walz was weighing a life-altering decision when he stepped into a supply room at the National Guard Armory in New Ulm, Minn., nearly two decades ago. He closed the door behind him, recalled a colleague, Al Bonnifield, and confided he was considering whether to leave their unit even though it was preparing to go to war so he could run for Congress.\n\n...while Walz and his political allies have cited his 24 years of military experience as an asset, the circumstances of his departure from the National Guard and his characterization of his service already have come under attack. At least three former Guard colleagues have publicly voiced bitterness at Walz's decision to leave their unit at such a consequential moment. It's not clear how widespread that feeling was, but the Trump campaign has moved quickly to capitalize on the issue.\n\n\"Nobody wants to go to war. I didn't want to go, but I went,\" Doug Julin, a retired National Guard soldier who worked with Walz, said in an interview. \"The big frustration was that he let his troops down.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Walz also came under scrutiny for saying during a gubernatorial campaign event in 2018 that \"we can make sure those weapons of war that I carried in war\" are not on America's streets. Walz did not serve in combat, according to the Minnesota Army National Guard, and his Republican counterpart jumped on those comments.\n\nWalz and his political allies also have inaccurately described him as a retired command sergeant major, one rank higher than he holds in retirement. Walz himself did so in a video clip from 2006 that was surfaced by C-SPAN on Tuesday and in a 2018 clip posted on his own YouTube account.\n\n\"I'm a retired sergeant major in the Army and the Army National Guard,\" he told a group of voters in the latter video.\n\nThough Walz did achieve the rank of command sergeant major, it was a provisional rank until he completed required coursework for senior leaders, National Guard officials said. He did not do so by the time he departed the military and his retirement rank reverted to master sergeant on May 15, 2005, officials said. Walz retired the next day.\n\nThe Harris campaign declined to address why Walz has inaccurately said he retired as one.\n\nNewsweek has more on the issue concerning Walz's rank:\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard is disputing Governor Tim Walz's military biography, saying that the Democratic vice presidential candidate did not hold the rank of command sergeant major at the time of his retirement.\n\nArmy Lieutenant Colonel Kristen Aug\u00e9, the state public affairs officer for Minnesota National Guard, told Just the News on Wednesday that the governor did not retire as \"Command Sergeant Major Walz\" in 2005, as stated on Minnesota's official website, but as master sergeant \"because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\" A soldier who does not complete the requisite coursework is automatically demoted, according to Army regulations.\n\nThis is stolen valor. Period. And some news outlets and hosts, like CNN's Jake Tapper and ABC News' Selina Wang, need to update and apologize for their segments of fake news yesterday:\n\nWill Walz make it to the convention? Even CNN's Van Jones can't really spin this right now:", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_vespa@townhall.com", "name": "Matt

Vance Accuses 24-Year Army Veteran Tim Walz of 'Stolen Valor'", "body": "The Trump campaign has sharpened its line of attack against Kamala Harris' new running mate, Tim Walz, by accusing the Minnesota governor of dodging war service.\n\nWalz served 24 years in the Minnesota National Guard, reaching the rank of command sergeant major and leading an artillery unit.\n\nThe attack centers on a claim that Walz quit his unit to avoid being deployed to Iraq, an attack which was deployed against him when he ran for governor in 2018, a race which he won.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did?\" Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance said Wednesday during a press conference. \"He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact he's been criticized for aggressively by many of the people he served with.\"\n\nThe attack has been lifted from an accusation lobbed in 2018 by a retired Guardsman who alleged the Democratic governor quit the Army after his National Guard unit was called to active duty.\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage,\" said Vance, who served as a combat correspondent for the Marines in Iraq. \"Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\"\n\nThe barrage against Walz has all the hallmarks of the Swift Boating of Democrat John Kerry's 2004 presidential chances, right down to its architect, Chris LaCivita, who happens to be Donald Trump's campaign manager.\n\nThe allegations were also featured in a Tuesday Republican National Committee press release toward the bottom of a laundry list of Walz's pitfalls.\n\n\"Walz lied about his own National Guard service,\" it read.\n\nIn a New York Post story published Tuesday, a one-time member of Walz's unit accused the governor of retiring from the Minnesota National Guard just before he was scheduled to deploy to Iraq in 2005. Walz ran for Congress the next year.\n\nIn 2018, during Walz's first bid for governor, the critic published a scathing letter alleging Walz quit after their unit received notice that it would soon be called to active duty. Media outlets picked up the allegations, as did his GOP rival during his reelection bid.\n\n\"My record speaks for itself and my accomplishments in uniform speak for itself, and there's many people in this crowd, too, that I served with,\" Walz said in 2022.\n\nWalz also suggested that year that the veteran who made the attack might just disagree with his politics. Another veteran from the governor's unit said the accusation was ill-informed and possibly a product of personal grievance.\n\nRepublicans' tactic of attacking Walz's military service is similar to the \"swiftboating\" strategy that helped sink John Kerry two decades ago. Back then, a group of swift boat veterans sought to discredit the Democratic nominee's Naval record and medals with a smear campaign.\n\nThe architect of that plan was Chris LaCavita, who is now Donald Trump's top strategist.\n\nWhen Harris introduced Walz in Philadelphia on Tuesday, her line referring to him as \"Sergeant Major Walz\" earned particularly loud applause.

Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, Republicans are questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nHere's a look at Walz's record and how it's become a campaign issue:\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various branches of the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's the circumstances of that retirement that Republicans have criticized in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance questioned whether Walz's departure from service months ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, calling it \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 -- said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic,\" arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Trenton Daniel and

He let his troops go to war without him instead,\" Cotton posted on X Wednesday. \"Just like he let Minneapolis burn rather than confront the BLM rioters.\"\n\nCotton's post featured a video originally shared by Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance. Vance, who served in Iraq as a Marine, said Walz \"dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him\" when he was called to serve in Iraq.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do and I did it honorably, and I'm very proud of that service,\" he said.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he has been criticized aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,\" Vance said.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" Vance continued, slamming Walz, a retired National Guard sergeant major.\n\nVance also referred to a clip of Walz that the Harris campaign put out where the Minnesota governor talks about \"weapons of war, that [Walz] carried in War.\"\n\nGov. @Tim_Walz: I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt. I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war,... pic.twitter.com/3IVaXi2RP2\n\n-- Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) August 6, 2024\n\nVance challenged whether Walz had served in war and blasted him for \"Stolen Valor.\"\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq? And he has not spent a day in a combat zone,\" he said.\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the Stolen Valor garbage,\" he said. \"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" he added.\n\nNotably, retired Army Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr penned a letter published in the West Central Tribune on November 2, 2019, stating Walz \"quit\" the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in the lead-up to deployment:\n\nIn early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq.\n\nOn May 16th, 2005 he quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war. His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for congress. Which is false, according to a Department of Defense Directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have. If he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academy. Instead he waited for the paperwork to catch up to him. His official retirement document states, SOLDIER NOT AVAILABLE FOR SIGNATURE.\n\nWalz retired at the rank of E-8, though he shortly sevrved as an E-9 under a conditional promotion that was reduced in September 2005, the command sergeants major noted. However, Walz's personal bio suggests he retired as a command sergeant major, which is E-9.\n\n\"After 24 years in the Army National Guard, Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field

Tim Walz from accusations of \"abandoning\" his fellow soldiers before their deployment to Iraq, a charge leveled by JD Vance, Walz's competitor for the vice presidency.\n\nRetired Sgt. Major Joseph Eustice said Walz \"fulfilled his duty. He was a great soldier. When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\nEustice spoke to NewsNation about the timing of Walz's retirement in 2005 after serving in the Guard for 24 years. Walz left a few months before the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion was sent to Iraq.\n\n\"As far as I know, he did not know,\" Eustice said of whether Walz knew about the upcoming deployment. \"At that time, there were all kinds of rumors about us deploying. In May, when he decided to retire ... we had no 'Notice of Deployment.' That didn't come until July,\" he added.\n\nEustice said Walz told him before he left that he \"was going to become a congressman,\" and had spoken about the possibility for months before making his decision.\n\n\"I didn't think that was a great idea. I didn't think he would be a very good politician,\" Eustice said.\n\nAt a campaign event in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance, who served in Iraq with the Marines, said Walz's retirement was tantamount to desertion.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,\" Vance said.\n\nIn 2018, when Walz was first running for governor of Minnesota, two former colleagues wrote a paid letter to the editor of the West Central Tribune, a newspaper in Willmar, Minnesota.\n\n\"For Tim Walz to abandon his fellow soldiers and quit when they needed experienced leadership most is disheartening,\" wrote retired Command Sgts. Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr.\n\nVance also accused Walz of \"stolen valor\" for claiming he was in combat when he was not, apparently referring to Walz comments on gun control heard in a video released by the Harris campaign.\n\n\"I spent 25 years in the Army, and I hunt. I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" Walz said.\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said Wednesday.\n\nWhile he didn't go to Iraq, Walz was deployed to Italy in 2003 as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, but not in a combat zone.\n\n\"The governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" said Ammar Moussa, a campaign spokesperson.\n\n\"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\n\"Stolen valor\" is the term generally used to describe those who claim to have served in the military but did not. The \"Stolen Valor Act of 2013\" makes it a federal crime to lie about one's military service in order to profit from the lie.\n\nVance was on active duty with the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007 during the Iraq war. Then known as James D. Hamel, Vance was deployed to Iraq with the Second Marine Aircraft Wing. His job was \"combat correspondent,\" which included basic communication roles such as writing articles about the events taking place in his unit. Vance was not a frontline combatant.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewsNation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NewsNation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Artillery_Branch_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field Artillery Branch (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desertion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willmar,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willmar, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Willmar, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_Valor_Act_of_2013", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stolen Valor Act of 2013"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_correspondent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War correspondent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Active duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2024/08/GettyImages-2165780735.jpg?w=900", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) -- Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, Republicans are questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nHere's a look at Walz's record and how it's become a campaign issue:\n\nArmy National Guard service\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various branches of the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's the circumstances of that retirement that Republicans have criticized in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nRepublican criticism\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance questioned whether Walz's departure from service months ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, calling it \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nDemocratic response\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 -- said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic,\" arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.\"\n\nAssociated Press

According to Republican vice presidential pick (and U.S. Marine Crops veteran) J.D. Vance, Walz's retirement was an effort to avoid an imminent combat deployment.\n\n\"When the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance said at a recent campaign event. \"I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nMinnesota woodworker and former National Guard soldier J.R. Salzman, who deployed to Iraq on the tour Walz would have participated in, took to X to denounce the governor.\n\n\"I served in the Minnesota National Guard with him,\" Salzman wrote. \"He literally abandoned us when we were about to be deployed to Iraq. He's a coward and should be treated as such.\"\n\nRetired Minnesota Guard command sergeant major Thomas Behrends told the New York Post he was forced to assume Walz's role as the deployment loomed.\n\n\"I needed to hit the ground running and take care of the troops -- and tell them we were going to war,\" he told the paper.\n\nBehrends spoke negatively of senior enlisted personnel leaving their unit prior to a deployment, saying \"for a guy in that position to quit is cowardice.\"\n\nThere has also been controversy surrounding Walz's claims of having left the Army a command sergeant major. A command sergeant major is the most senior enlisted member of a color-bearing Army unit, and while Walz was promoted to the rank, lieutenant colonel Kristen Aug\u00e9 told Newsweek Walz left the Army as a master sergeant \"because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\"\n\nSoldiers who do not complete the requisite coursework to attain their ranks are automatically demoted, but Walz has consistently published campaign material indicating he was discharged as a command sergeant major.\n\nAs if all of this wasn't sufficiently troubling for the newly minted Democratic No. 2, Walz is also facing scrutiny for having repeatedly insinuated that he had seen combat.\n\n\"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz said during a speech pushing gun control that the Harris campaign promoted on X earlier this week.\n\nCNN fact-checker Tom Foreman disputed these claims on live television, saying there was \"no evidence that at any time Governor Walz was in the position of being shot at, and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest that he was.\"\n\n\"So that is absolutely false when he said that about gun rights out there,\" Foreman added.\n\nWalz is also facing scrutiny for implying he deployed to Afghanistan. A 2006 press release issued by his congressional campaign referred to him as \"a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom.\" He was also pictured campaigning for former Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry holding a sign identifying himself as an \"Enduring Freedom Veteran for Kerry.\"\n\nWhen Washington Free Beacon reporter and self-proclaimed \"never Trumper\" David Thul asked Walz's staffers about the claims in 2009, one staffer told Thul she was \"not aware\" Walz had served in Afghanistan - while another \"acknowledged that constituents could get the false impression\" he had served there.\n\nWalz was stationed in Italy during Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nWalz has also worn ball-caps sporting the insignia of the U.S. Army Special Forces, which has drawn the consternation of a number of members of this elite force's online community.\n\n\"For those of you saying it's just a hat. It is not just a hat,\" wrote X user Green Beret Nap Time.\n\n\"Anyone who has served knows that you do not wear the hat of a unit you were not a part of while you served,\" he added. \"You wouldn't wear a Vietnam Veteran hat if you were not a Vietnam Veteran. This is no different.\"\n\nWhile surrogates for the Harris-Walz campaign have emphasized Walz's decades of service in rebutting the claims stolen valor, the campaign itself quietly tweaked the language on its website this morning. Walz's bio previously termed the governor a \"retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard,\" but now says Walz \"served as a command sergeant major.\"\n\nAs of this writing, Walz's gubernatorial bio still describes him as \"Command Sergeant Major Walz.\"\n\nDylan Nolan is the director of special projects at FITSNews.

What is the truth?", "body": "Tim Walz retired from the National Guard two month before his unit was activated for an Iraq deployment. Republicans want that timing to be a major issue.\n\nQuestions about the final months of Tim Walz's 24-year National Guard career have triggered a flurry of questions and confusion among military members and veterans, and Wednesday drew a sharp accusation from Walz's vice presidential opponent, Republican J.D. Vance. In a bitter attack at a rally in Michigan, Vance claimed Walz \"abandoned\" his guard unit in 2005, just before a deployment to Iraq.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did?,\" Vance said Tuesday in Shelby Township, Michigan. \"He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nAccusing a 24-year veteran and former command master sergeant of abandoning his troops by ducking combat is a grave insult in the veteran community, and strikes deep emotions in many. By Wednesday afternoon, a conservative influencer had called for veterans to post pictures of themselves while deployed under the meme \"Me not being Tim Walz,\" drawing hundreds of responses.\n\nBut attacks on veteran service records are not new in politics.\n\nAt least one soldier who knew Walz as well as any has defended Walz -- despite not being a fan. Joseph Eustice, whose personal Facebook page today has anti-Walz posts, held the same job as Walz -- command sergeant major of 1st battalion, 125th Artillery Regiment\n\nBut when the retirement controversy flared up in 2022, he told local media that Walz fulfilled his duty.\n\n\"He was a great soldier,\" Eustice told the Star Tribune. \"When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\nSeveral other soldiers from Walz's unit echoed that sentiment, including a former brigadier general.\n\nEustice speculated the controversy could be stoked by sour grapes by a soldier who was passed over for the promotion to command sergeant major that went to Walz.\n\nStill, the assault on Walz's retirement appears to have caught the Harris-Walz campaign completely unaware. A Minnesota government spokesperson for Walz told Task & Purpose of Walz's retirement, \"In May 2005, Walz retired to run for Congress following 24 years of service.\" They did not address whether Walz knew a deployment was pending or if he actively sought to avoid it.\n\nThe timeline of Walz's service and the deployment of his unit, the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery Regiment, is relatively clear, through public records, news accounts and press releases at the time:\n\nWalz, as a senior member of the unit's leadership, may have known a deployment was in the unit's future before the July 2005 activation order. Extended deployments and guard activations are often planned across the Army a year or more before formal orders are issued.\n\nA second issue for Walz may be his retirement rank. He served as the 125th's command sergeant major, an E-9, the Army's highest enlisted rank. But, according to the Minnesota Guard, his retirement status and benefits was reduced to that of an E-8 because he did not complete training required of all E-9s.\n\n\"Soldiers who do not finish the course revert back to their prior rank,\" a spokesperson told Task & Purpose. \"This is what we refer to as an administrative reduction and not punitive in nature.\"\n\nWalz's military experience is being touted by Democrats as a strong part of his appeal to voters and a testimony to her personal values and commitment to defense and veterans issues as a lawmaker. Patrick Murphy, a former Under Secretary of the Army and the first Iraq War to be elected to the United States House of Representatives, told Task & Purpose that Walz will absolute get veterans to vote for the Harris-Walz ticket.\n\n\"There are 900,000 veterans in Pennsylvania ready to run through a wall for Tim Walz,\" Murphy said.\n\nBut Vance's attack, echoing accusations Walz faced in his 2022 race for Governor, characterized that retirement as a kind of betrayal -- and an echo of attacks that military veterans have faced in previous political races.\n\nVance's attacks on Wednesday echo a wide range of Republican officials and other conservatives who within hours of Walz introduction rushed to announce they are eager to \"swiftboat\" Walz.\n\n\"Swiftboat\" is a political short-hand for the 2012 media campaign that attacked Democrat John Kerry's combat experience as a Navy officer aboard riverine patrol boats in Vietnam, known to their crews as Swift Boats. That campaign, run by a group calling itself Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, was run by Chris LaCivita, who is now a co-manager of Donald Trump's Presidential campaign.\n\nLaCivita has posted at least three times about Walz's retirement in the last day, more than any other topic about the new Vice Presidential candidate.\n\nThe attacks on Walz's service go back to his run for Minnesota Governor. In November 2018, two retired Minnesota Guard command sergeant majors, including one that took over Walz's position as command sergeant major, wrote a paid endorsement letter to the editor of the West Central Tribune, a Minnesota newspaper. They described Walz's retirement ahead of his battalion's Iraq deployment as quitting and leaving the battalion's soldiers \"hanging\" and \"without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.\"\n\nWednesday, the attacks appeared to be gathering steam among veterans online.\n\nDuring his final year at the 125th, Walz was promoted to Command Sergeant Major, the highest ranking enlisted soldier in the unit, directly responsible for a wide range of health, welfare and readiness issues for every soldier. However, prior to retiring, Walz failed to complete a 750-hour course in the Army's Sergeants Major Academy, which would have included 86 hours in residence at Ft. Bliss, Texas. Completing the course is mandatory for E-9s, though completing the training after being promoted is not uncommon. But without the training, Walz was not eligible to retire as a full E-9 and his retired status and benefits were 'reduced' to E-8 after he left service.\n\nThe Minnesota Guard confirmed to Task & Purpose that Walz was properly promoted and served in the E-9 role, and \"retired as\" and E-9, despite the later adjustment. His campaign website for earlier races has said: \"When he retired, Tim was the highest-ranking enlisted National Guard soldier in southern Minnesota.\"\n\nThough he held the CSM rank, Walz retired in 2005 as a Walz served until May 16, 2005.\n\nJeffrey Frisby, former master sergeant for the Arkansas National Guard and executive director of the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States said similar situations still occur.\n\n\"I don't know that we would put on that rank, but we would definitely serve in that position,\" he said. \"I do think that that still happens and I do think that people serve in capacities above their rank but above their official military pay grade to serve in a leadership position still today.\"\n\nA gap in a leadership position like CSM could've meant that \"if they didn't put someone in there to manage those tasks, to oversee those soldiers, oversee that training, then something was gonna get missed and something might not have been done to standard,\" Frisby said. For CSMs in particular, he said, they manage transportation, food, lodging, and \"soldier care\" issues.\n\n\"They might have missed training events and training timelines so to have someone in that leadership role is very important, even if you're just an acting position,\" Frisby said. \"Even though he wasn't eligible for that command title, we would probably still put him in that role and let him serve in that capacity because somebody in that chain of command thought this was the right guy for the job,\" Frisby said.", "source": {"uri": "taskandpurpose.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Task & Purpose"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_white@taskandpurpose.com", "name": "Matt White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "patty_nieberg@taskandpurpose.com", "name": "Patty Nieberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_&_Purpose", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Task & Purpose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformed_services_pay_grades_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uniformed services pay grades of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Murphy_(Pennsylvania_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Murphy (Pennsylvania politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, with Republicans questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nHere's a look at Walz's record and how it's become a campaign issue:\n\nArmy National Guard service\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's that retirement that Republicans have criticized in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nWATCH: Democratic, GOP strategists analyze Harris-Walz ticket and Trump's tactics against them\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nRepublican vice presidential candidate Sen. J.D. Vance speaks at NMC-Wollard Inc. / Wollard International on Aug. 7, 2024, in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Photo by Adam Bettcher/ Getty Images\n\nRepublican criticism\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance questioned whether Walz's departure from service months ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, calling it \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nDemocratic response\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 -- said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic,\" arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.\"\n\nAssociated Press

Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, with Republicans questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nHere's a look at Walz's record and how it's become a campaign issue:\n\nArmy National Guard service\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's that retirement that Republicans have criticized in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance questioned whether Walz's departure from service months ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, calling it \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nDemocratic response\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 -- said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic,\" arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Trenton Daniel and Richard Lardner contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, the Minnesota National Guard's State Public Affairs Officer, told Just the News.\n\nGOP vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance said he was astonished that the Harris campaign had not checked out Walz's military record and accused him of lying to make a political point.\n\nVance, who spent six years in the U.S. Marines, including six months deployed to Iraq, said: \"There was a clip the Kamala campaign posted about him where he's making a gun control argument. He said, 'Look, you should not be able to carry the weapons that I carried in war.' And I'm, I'm thinking to myself, well, when did you go to war? What weapon did you carry in the war, Tim, because apparently you skipped out on your unit before they went to Iraq. I know he didn't go to a combat zone, so why is he lying to make a political point?\"\n\nThe Minnesota governor was accused by two retired senior officials in the Minnesota National Guard of retiring shortly before his battalion was set for a deployment to Iraq in 2005.\n\nThe two retired Command Sergeants Major in the guard wrote in an open letter that they felt it was their \"duty and responsibility to bring forth the truth as we know it concerning his service record.\" Thomas Behrends, one signer of the letter, was chosen to replace Walz. (WorldTribune.com ran the letter on Tuesday as part of its coverage of Walz being selected by Kamala Harris as her running mate.)\n\nAccording to the letter, Walz was selected in 2004 to serve as the Command Sergeant Major of the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and by September of that year Walz was conditionally promoted to the rank.\n\nBut, by early 2005, Walz's battalion was ordered to mobilize for an active duty deployment to Iraq. Shortly after, in May 2005, Walz \"quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" according to the two Command Sergeants Major.\n\n\"When your country calls, you are supposed to run into battle -- not the other way,\" Behrends told the New York Post Tuesday. He ran away. It's sad.\"\n\n\"He had the opportunity to serve his country, and said 'Screw you' to the United States. That's not who I would pick to run for vice president,\" he added.\n\nUrgent: Support Free Press Foundation\n\nThe extent of the Harris team's vetting of Walz looks even shakier after a Daily Mail report on Wednesday showed a resurfaced mugshot, a grainy black and white photo of a \"glassy-eyed\" Walz moments after he was arrested Sept. 30, 1995, and booked into Dawes County Jail, Nebraska, on charges of speeding and driving while intoxicated.\n\nWalz at the time was a 31-year-old schoolteacher and football coach in Alliance, Nebraska, when he was chased down by a State Patrol officer and charged for driving at 96mph in a 55mph zone. He was also serving in the Army National Guard at the time.\n\nAccording to a court transcript, Walz had a blood alcohol concentration of .128.\n\nCourt transcripts reviewed by DailyMail.com show that Walz's attorney Russell Harford claimed his client's speeding was due not to inebriation but to the fact that Walz had a hearing impairment which led him to believe that the officer attempting to stop him was chasing him. He was ultimately fined $200 and court costs.\n\nThe incident first resurfaced during Walz's 2006 campaign for Congress at which time a spokesman claimed that Walz simply \"couldn't understand what the officer was saying to him.\"\n\nKerry Greeley, Walz's campaign manager at the time, told a reporter for the Rochester Post that it was Walz's deafness from which he suffered thanks to his time serving with an artillery unit in the National Guard, lead to a miscommunication between Walz and the officer who stopped him.\n\nThere is no mention of Walz having any hearing impairment in the officer's report and it is referenced only obliquely in the court proceedings that followed, but according to The New York Times he underwent corrective surgery in 2005.\n\nAs governor of Minnesota, Walz signed legislation which ensured every boys' bathroom in public schools has tampons.\n\nYes, Minnesota taxpayer dollars went to a woke law which mandated boys be provided with a product they have no legitimate use for.\n\nWalz signed the bill that was pushed by Democrat state Rep. Sandra Feist, who insisted \"not all students who menstruate are female.\"\n\nThe law went into effect on Jan. 1. State Republican lawmakers pushed back on the legislation, but ultimately failed to amend the bill to apply only for girls' bathrooms.\n\nTrump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt called out Walz for the law shortly after Harris announced he would join her on the Democrat presidential ticket:\n\n\"As a woman, I think there is no greater threat to our health than leaders who support gender-transition surgeries for young minors, who support putting tampons in men's bathrooms in public schools,\" Leavitt said on Fox News. \"Those are radical policies that Tim Walz supports. He actually signed a bill to do that.\"\n\nIn 2023, Walz issued an executive order establishing Minnesota as a safe haven for children to receive trans surgeries.\n\nThe primary super PAC supporting GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump called Walz a \"weird radical liberal,\" as part of a new campaign ad against the governor.\n\n\"What could be weirder than signing a bill requiring schools to stock tampons in boys' bathrooms?\" the Make America Great Again Inc. account wrote Tuesday on X. \"Or weirder than signing legislation allowing minors to receive sex change operations?\"\n\nTwice failed Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton came to Walz's defense: \"How nice of the Trump camp to help publicize Gov. Tim Walz's compassionate and common-sense policy of providing free menstrual products to students in Minnesota public schools!

Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, Republicans are questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nHere's a look at Walz's record and how it's become a campaign issue:\n\nArmy National Guard service\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various branches of the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's the circumstances of that retirement that Republicans have criticized in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nRepublican criticism\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance questioned whether Walz's departure from service months ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, calling it \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nDemocratic response\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 -- said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic,\" arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press

Tim Walz of having 'quit' his Minnesota National Guard unit after it was informed to prepare for a deployment to Iraq.\n\nWalz, who is Vice President Kamala Harris' selection as her running mate, served for more than two decades in the Army National Guard, and his selection helps bolster the nominee on defense issues.\n\nThe timing of his separation from the military surfaced during his 2008 campaign for governor.\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends of the Minnesota National Guard accused Walz of having 'embellished' his record and of having abandoned his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress.\n\n'Tim Walz has embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances of his military career for years,' Behrends wrote in 2018.\n\n'In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq,' Behrends and Paul Herr in a letter they posted on Facebook.\n\nVice President Kamaal Harris has selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate. He spent two decades in the Army National Guard. A retired command sergeant major accused him of having retired to avoid a deployment to Iraq\n\n'On May 16th, 2005, he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.'\n\n'His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for Congress,' they wrote, calling the claim 'false.' They say the decision left his unit without a critical leader as it prepared for the deployment.\n\nWalz disputed the characterization, telling the Winona Daily News he did not quit due to the deployment orders, in a spat reported by the Daily Wire amid the fierce battle to define Harris' running mate.\n\n'After completing 20 years of service in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for an additional four years following Sept. 11 and retired the year before my battalion was deployed to Iraq in order to run for Congress,' he wrote.\n\nWalz, 60, enlisted in the Guard at the age of 17. He became the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to serve in Congress.\n\nHe said he considered the letter a 'partisan political attack.'\n\n'I'm certainly proud of my military service, but it's one piece of me. It doesn't define me,' Walz told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018. After going through basic training in Georgia, he was deployed to Arkansas, Texas, and the Artic Circle on disaster response and other missions. 'You go where you're told to go,' he said.\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign for further comment.\n\nWalz' duties in a field artillery unit including firing howitzer cannons, a task that according to Walz led to hearing damage that required surgery.\n\nThe blasts, he wrote in an application for benefits, 'would knock us down and after firing I had ringing in my ears.'\n\nWalz served for 21 years in the Army National Guard\n\nThe Harris camp believes Walz will be able to reach out to rural voters in the Midwest\n\nHis lawyer said hearing loss played a role in his DUI arrest back in 1995\n\nRead More J.D.

Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, Republicans are questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nHere's a look at Walz's record and how it's become a campaign issue:\n\nArmy National Guard service\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various branches of the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's the circumstances of that retirement that Republicans have criticized in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nRepublican criticism\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance questioned whether Walz's departure from service months ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, calling it \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nDemocratic response\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 -- said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic,\" arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporters Trenton Daniel and Richard Lardner contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

When the United States Marine Corps ... asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do and I did it honorably, and I'm very proud of that service.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nRelated: Sofa so bad for JD Vance as Trump's VP pick faces swirling speculation\n\nNow a US senator from Ohio, Vance, 40, deployed to Iraq in 2005, as a military journalist. Despite his title - combat correspondent - he did not experience combat.\n\nWalz, 60, was in the army national guard for 24 years, in infantry and artillery, deploying in response to natural disasters on US soil and to Europe in support of operations in Afghanistan. He retired in 2005, to run for Congress, shortly before his unit deployed to Iraq.\n\nHe has faced attacks before. In 2018, he told Minnesota Public Radio: \"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that. I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nA soldier who served under Walz, Al Bonnifield, said: \"Would the soldier look down on him because he didn't go with us? Would the common soldier say, 'Hey, he didn't go with us, he's trying to skip out on a deployment?' And he wasn't.\n\n\" ... He weighed that decision to run for Congress very heavy. He loved the military, he loved the guard, he loved the soldiers he worked with.\"\n\nCalling Walz \"very caring\" and a \"very good leader\", Bonnifield said Walz helped him and other soldiers when they returned from Iraq.\n\nVance seized on footage publicized by the Harris campaign in which, discussing gun control reform, Walz says: \"We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\nVance said: \"He says, 'We shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on the American streets.'\n\nRelated: Trump claims - without evidence - to have saved Walz from protesters in 2020\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq? He has not spent a day in a combat zone. What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\"\n\nObservers suggested Vance was attempting to \"swift boat\" Walz - a reference to attacks on John Kerry, the decorated US navy Vietnam veteran and Massachusetts senator who ran for president against George W Bush in 2004.\n\nBush avoided serving in Vietnam but Republicans attacked Kerry regardless.

The edit changed a reference to Walz's military service location from Iraq to Italy, with no explanation provided in the editor's note as to why the change was made.\n\nThe article, which describes Walz's services as a 24-year veteran of the Army National Guard, stated that Walz served in Iraq as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. However, after more attention was drawn to Walz's embellished military record, the article was changed to say Italy instead of Iraq.\n\nHowever, this is not the first time that Joshua Green, the author behind the Bloomberg article, has attempted to portray Walz as a combat veteran. In 2006, an article written by Green for The Atlantic included an interview with Walz and tried to paint him as an Iraqi war veteran. The article said that Walz left his hometown to \"serve overseas in Operation Enduring Freedom,\" implying he served in the Middle East. Green also wrote that Walz had \"just returned from fighting the war on terrorism\" despite him never actually seeing combat.\n\nGovernor Walz has faced allegations of stolen valor for misleading the public about his service in the military. According to an article by journalist Jordan Schachtel, Walz spent his career in the Armed National Guard preparing to lead people into battle. There, he served his lone deployment to Italy. After learning he would be leading his unit into battle in Iraq, Walz quit the military and decided to run for office.\n\nBecause of these actions, Walz has been accused of intentionally resigning to avoid combat. Republican nominee for vice president and military veteran JD Vance commented on the accusations regarding Walz dodging military service and misleading the country.\n\n\"As a Marine who served his country in uniform when the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it.

He Did Not", "body": "As Republicans began scrutinizing the military record of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Harris campaign released a statement supporting the vice-presidential nominee, in part, by pointing to his time in Congress and claiming that \"he chaired Veterans Affairs.\"\n\nWhile the former congressman spent over a decade in the House, serving on Veterans Affairs and eventually rising to become the ranking member of that committee, at no time was he ever the chairman.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris correctly characterized Walz's time in Congress when introducing her running mate in Philadelphia, calling him \"the top Democrat on the Veterans Committee.\"\n\nIt was her campaign, however, that erred.\n\nThe statement in question reads, \"after 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nIt was printed in RealClearPolitics, NBC News, and numerous other outlets, further raising the ire of Republicans who already claim that Walz has misrepresented his record. A Harris aide told RCP Thursday morning that the error \"was an innocent mistake\" made by staff.\n\n\"Governor Walz was ranking member/top Democrat on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\" a spokesman for the Harris campaign said, for the 115th Congress between 2017 and 2018.\n\nA spokesman for Illinois Republican Rep. Mike Bost, current chairman of the committee, told RCP the same, saying that \"Rep. Walz was only ever ranking member and he served in that role from 2017-2019.\"\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him - a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,\" said GOP vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance. A Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq, Vance added, \"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go.\"\n\nIt was a reference to the fact that Walz retired from the National Guard in 2005, ending a 24-year career before his unit, the National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery, deployed to Iraq.\n\nWalz eventually reached the rank of a command sergeant major, the most senior enlisted noncommissioned officer in a battalion and represented himself previously as \"the highest-ranking enlisted service member ever to serve in Congress.\"\n\nAs Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, public affairs officer for the Minnesota National Guard, told NBC News, however, Walz \"culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion\" and \"retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\"\n\nAnother discrepancy: In a video clip promoted by the Harris campaign, Walz called for gun control on the grounds that \"we can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\" The candidate did not, however, ever serve in a war zone.\n\nA spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign did not dispute that the governor may have overstated his case when claiming he carried a weapon in combat. \"In his 24 years of service, the governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Gov. Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country,\" the campaign said in a statement to RCP on Wednesday. \"It's the American way.\"", "source": {"uri": "realclearpolitics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Real Clear Politics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "philip_wegmann@realclearpolitics.com", "name": "Philip Wegmann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking_member", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ranking member"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Veterans Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/115th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "115th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bost", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Bost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Veterans'_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Pick Tim Walz \" American Greatness", "body": "Kamala Harris' running mate, Governor Tim Walz falsely claimed to be a \"Command Sergeant Major\" in the Minnesota Army National Guard while running for office in 2006, a newly surfaced video shows.\n\nOn March 20, 2005, Walz's campaign put out a press release announcing that the Democrat was still running for Congress after the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced the deployment of 2,000 Minnesota National Guard troops to Iraq.\n\nWhen asked about his possible deployment to Iraq, Walz at the time claimed that he didn't know whether his artillery unit would be part of the mobilization, and declined to comment further on the specifics of deployment.\n\nWalz had been \"conditionally promoted\" to Command Sergeant Major in September of 2004, but he quit the military in May 2005, soon after his artillery battalion received word that it would be deployed to Iraq.\n\nOn September 10th, 2005 Walz was reduced back to Master Sergeant.\n\nIn Walz's 2006 campaign video, he also falsely claimed to have retired \"four years late.\" In reality, he quit two years early to run for Congress, abandoning his battalion before they deployed to Iraq.\n\nWalz reenlisted in the Minnesota Army National Guard for six years on September 18th, 2001 and left in May of 2005.\n\nAdditionally, in 2009, then-congressman Walz sent a farewell message to some soldiers deploying to Iraq, repeating the false claim that he is a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign reportedly updated its online biography of Walz's military service to reflect his actual record in the Army National Guard.\n\nThe campaign initially referred to Walz as a \"retired command sergeant major\" in the bio. That has been tweaked to say he once served at the command sergeant major rank, which is technically accurate.\n\nMeanwhile, \"Stolen Valor\" accusations continue to dog the governor.\n\nIn 2008, the then-Minnesota congressman endorsed a book that falsely claimed he served in Afghanistan.\n\nThe book, \"Winning Your Election the Wellstone Way: A Comprehensive Guide for Candidates and Campaign Workers,\" by Jeff Blodgett, Bill Lofy, Ben Goldfarb, and Erik Peterson, sought to offer an \"advanced strategy for running and winning a progressive campaign.\"\n\nMore recently, Walz mischaracterized his military service while delivering remarks on gun control: \"We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" the governor said.\n\nBut the Democrat never carried a weapon on the battlefield, as implied.\n\nIn late summer of 2003, First Sergeant Walz was deployed to Italy with the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nTheir mission was \"to augment United States Air Force Europe Security Forces doing base security for six months,\" retired Command Sergeants Major of the Minnesota National Guard noted in a paid letter to the editor of the Western Central Tribune.\n\n\"In no way were the units or Soldiers of the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion replacing any units or military forces so they could deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan,\" the retired sergeants said.", "source":

One such attack came from Donald Trump's VP pick Sen. JD Vance, who said, while speaking in Michigan:\n\n\"He has not spent a day in a combat zone. What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not...I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nThis low jab stems from the fact that Walz retired from the military to campaign for Congress in 2005, not long before his unit was deployed to Iraq, where Vance served that same year. However, as POLITICO noted in an article addressing Vance's verbal incursion on his fellow veteran, Walz filed his paperwork to run for Congress a month prior to it being known that the Minnesota National Guard was to be sent to Iraq. This article's author also points out that, despite having been to Iraq, Vance does not have any more combat experience than Walz, as he was deployed as a military journalist.\n\nWalz was part of the US military for nearly a quarter of a century and has candidly acknowledged in the past that during those years he did not get deployed to a combat zone. Here's what we know about Walz's over two decades of service.\n\nA native Nebraskan, Tim Walz joined the military in 1981, mere days after his 17 birthday, and began his basic training in Georgia. During his time as a soldier, he was stationed in Arkansas, Texas, Italy, and the Arctic Circle, among other locations. While in Italy, where he spent nearly a year between 2003 and 2004, Walz was part of Operation Enduring Freedom, which offered support to the US war efforts in Afghanistan.\n\nAs part of the military, Walz responded to natural disasters such as floods and tornados. His specialty was heavy artillery, being part of Minnesota Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery by the time he stepped away to kickstart his political career. Due to his dealing with howitzer cannons, his hearing became compromised, having to undergo stapedectomy surgery in 2005 to help fix the damage.\n\nOwing to his performance over his 24 years of service, Walz climbed to the rank of Command Sargeant Major. For benefit purposes, and because he did not finish a required training course, he was reduced in rank shortly after retiring. When he was elected to the House of Representatives in 2006, Walz earned the informal honor of becoming the highest-elected former enlisted soldier to attain a seat in Congress.\n\nDuring his military career, Walz was awarded the Army Commendation Medal and two Army Achievement Medals. As a politician and retired soldier, Walz became an outspoken voice on the political injustices of war and made it his mission to help Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans get the benefits they deserve.\n\nAdequately responding to JD Vance's ungraceful accusations, the Harris-Walz campaign said in a statement:\n\n\"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired, and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nAs it frequently happens, some insults and gibes are more revealing of the person uttering them than the individual who's on the receiving end.", "source": {"uri":

Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, the Minnesota National Guard's State Public Affairs Officer, told Just the News.\n\nThe statement reignited a controversy that began during his 2018 election for governor in which National Guardsman claimed on social media and in a paid ad that Walz declined to deploy to Iraq for combat duty in 2005 and forfeited his title of command sergeant major. Walz chose to run for Congress that year. -Just the News\n\nThe governor's biography, however, says that \"Command Sergeant Major Walz\" retired from the Minnesota National Guard in 2005. At the time he was serving as one of the highest ranking members of the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion.\n\n\"He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" said Aug\u00e9.\n\nThat said, an unnamed Guard spokesperson told Task & Purpose, in direct contradiction to Aug\u00e9, that Walz's demotion was a technicality.\n\n\"Soldiers who do not finish the course revert back to their prior rank,\" they told the outlet. \"This is what we refer to as an administrative reduction and not punitive in nature.\"\n\nThe outlet also claims that the Guard 'confirmed' that Walz was properly promoted and served in the E-9 role, and \"retired as\" an E-9, despite the later reduction.\n\nThat said, Task & Purpose also framed the entire stolen valor controversy as \"The 'Swift Boating' of Tim Walz\" - as if his on-record lies about 'weapon of war, that I carried in war' (he never saw war), are the same as disputed allegations over John Kerry's (D) Vietnam war record.\n\nOn Wednesday we noted that Walz straight up lied about having been deployed in a combat zone.\n\nThe lies were so egregious that even CNN acknowledged they were less than ideal.\n\n\"Walz did make a comment speaking to a group, he's done it a couple of times, where he has used language that has suggested that he carried weapons in a fighting situation,\" said CNN correspondent Tom Foreman in a fact check. \"As you know, with your contact with the military, I know from coming from a military family, there is a difference between being in a combat area, being involved at a time of war and actually being in a position where people are shooting at you. There is no evidence that at any time Governor Walz was in a position of being shot at, and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest that he was.\"\n\n\"So that is absolutely false when he said that about gun rights out there. The campaign has essentially come forward to say, 'Look, he had a long career, he would never want to purposely mislead people about this.' It's what campaigns tend to say,\" Foreman continued.\n\nMeanwhile, in a 2006 press release issued by his campaign, Walz is described as a \"veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the US military operation in Afghanistan. As modernity.news notes, some have charged that this is misleading given that Walz was stationed in Italy at the time, with his battalion providing base security in Europe.\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major, I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on,\" Walz said in a campaign statement on March 20, 2005. Just three days prior, the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced that at least part of his battalion could be shipped overseas to the Middle East in the next two years.\n\nWalz left the National Guard that May. Two months later, his battalion was put on notice that they would be deploying to Iraq.\n\nWhen questioned about all of it, Walz decided to duck, cover, and run from a journalist before an explanation could be 'deployed.'", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type":

National Guard Disputes Walz's Military Biography", "body": "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's military biography is being disputed by the state's National Guard, which claims the Democrat vice presidential nominee did not hold the rank of command sergeant major at the time of his retirement, Newsweek reported Wednesday.\n\nWalz's official gubernatorial biography on the Minnesota's official website states, \"Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005.\" But Army Lt. Col. Army Kristen Aug\u00e9, the state public affairs officer for the Minnesota National Guard, said Wednesday the governor retired as a master sergeant \"because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" Newsweek reported.\n\nA soldier who does not complete the requisite coursework is automatically demoted, according to Army regulations.\n\nWalz's pick as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate has reignited a controversy surrounding his military service that began during his initial run for governor in 2018, when Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, two retired command sergeant majors in the Minnesota National Guard, criticized Walz for retiring shortly before his battalion was set for a deployment to Iraq.\n\nAccording to the letter Behrends and Herr posted on Facebook, Walz, who served in the National Guard for 24 years, was selected in 2004 to serve as command sergeant major of the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and by September of that year, Walz was conditionally promoted to the rank. But by early 2005, Walz's battalion was ordered to mobilize for an active-duty deployment to Iraq.\n\nShortly after, in May 2005, Walz \"quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior non-commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" according to the letter.\n\n\"When your country calls, you are supposed to run into battle - not the other way,\" Behrends told the New York Post on Tuesday. \"He ran away. It's sad. \"He had the opportunity to serve his country and said 'Screw you' to the United States. That's not who I would pick to run for vice president.\"\n\nOhio Sen. J.D. Vance, Donald Trump's running mate on the Republican ticket who served four years in the Marine Corps and was deployed to Iraq, said Wednesday in Michigan that Walz abandoned his unit before it was deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"When the United State Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance said, according to CNN. \"I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nRep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., who earned the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps, told Newsmax on Wednesday he plans to investigate whether Walz has been honest about his service in the National Guard. Bergman is a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the Military Personnel Subcommittee.\n\n\"I'm a Marine and you either go to the sound of the guns or you run from the sound of the guns,\" Bergman said. \"My staff is doing a deep dive into all the details of Walz's service to make sure that the portrait that's being presented of his service is accurate. And the point is, if you sign up in the military to not go to the sound of the guns, you probably shouldn't have signed up in the first place.\"\n\nNewsmax reached out to the Harris campaign for comment.\n\nMichael Katz \u2709\n\nMichael Katz is a Newsmax reporter with more than 30 years of experience reporting and editing on news, culture, and politics.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_katz@newsmax.com", "name": "Michael Katz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant colonel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newsmax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Bergman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Bergman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

When the United States Marine Corps ... asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do and I did it honorably, and I'm very proud of that service.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nNow a US senator from Ohio, Vance, 40, deployed to Iraq in 2005, as a military journalist. Despite his title - combat correspondent - he did not experience combat.\n\nWalz, 60, was in the army national guard for 24 years, in infantry and artillery, deploying in response to natural disasters on US soil and to Europe in support of operations in Afghanistan. He retired in 2005, to run for Congress, shortly before his unit deployed to Iraq.\n\nHe has faced attacks before. In 2018, he told Minnesota Public Radio: \"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that. I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nA soldier who served under Walz, Al Bonnifield, said: \"Would the soldier look down on him because he didn't go with us? Would the common soldier say, 'Hey, he didn't go with us, he's trying to skip out on a deployment?' And he wasn't.\n\n\"... He weighed that decision to run for Congress very heavy. He loved the military, he loved the guard, he loved the soldiers he worked with.\"\n\nCalling Walz \"very caring\" and a \"very good leader\", Bonnifield said Walz helped him and other soldiers when they returned from Iraq.\n\nVance seized on footage publicized by the Harris campaign in which, discussing gun control reform, Walz says: \"We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\nVance said: \"He says, 'We shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on the American streets.'\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq? He has not spent a day in a combat zone. What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\"\n\nObservers suggested Vance was attempting to \"swift boat\" Walz - a reference to attacks on John Kerry, the decorated US navy Vietnam veteran and Massachusetts senator who ran for president against George W Bush in 2004.\n\nBush avoided serving in Vietnam but Republicans attacked Kerry regardless. The Republican operative (and wounded Gulf war veteran) widely credited with coordinating the effort, Chris LaCivita, now runs the Trump-Vance campaign.\n\nIn a statement, the Harris campaign said: \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired veterans affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform ... As vice-president ... he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_pengelly@theguardian.com", "name": "Martin Pengelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_correspondent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War correspondent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Public_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Public Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "G.I.

He then put in 20 years of service and retired.\n\n'What the hell kind of leadership is that?'\n\nShortly after his retirement, the terrorist attacks of September 11 happened, and Walz re-enlisted just weeks later. In April 2005, he was promoted to the rank of command sergeant major before retiring again the following month and launching an ultimately successful campaign for Congress.\n\nThat's when aspects of his story become dicey.\n\nFor one thing, sometime in early 2005, Walz and other members of his battalion received word that they would be deployed to Iraq soon. Walz, the highest noncommissioned officer in the unit, then abruptly retired in May, leaving the unit without a designated leader.\n\nThomas Behrends, a former member of Walz's unit and now a retired command sergeant major of the Minnesota National Guard, said he stepped in to take Walz's place and eventually spent nearly two years fighting in Iraq while Walz stayed home and campaigned.\n\n\"I was like well, for Pete's sake, if this guy quits, if I say I'm not going to do it, I mean, what the hell kind of leadership is that?\" Behrends told Alpha News back in 2022. \"If a company would say we're going to deploy to Iraq and the foreman says, 'I'm not going,' what does that say to the 500 that work in that factory?\"\n\nAnother problem with Walz's retirement in May 2005 is that it falls several months short of a four-year enlistment and more than two full years short of a six-year enlistment.\n\nYet according to Alpha News, which ostensibly viewed Walz's Report of Separation and Military Service form, Walz initially pledged to serve six years when he re-enlisted in September 2001, meaning his contract with the Army National Guard would not be fulfilled until September 2007.\n\nIn apparent contravention to that document, Walz insisted that when he retired in 2005, he had put in four years as promised.\n\n\"After completing 20 years of service in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for an additional four years following Sept. 11 and retired the year before my battalion was deployed to Iraq in order to run for Congress,\" Walz wrote in the Winona Daily News in 2006.\n\n'Walz lied in his campaign literature that he retired as a command sergeant major. Not true.'\n\nFurthermore, Walz also seems to have misrepresented the rank he held at his retirement. He technically received a promotion to command sergeant major a few weeks before he retired and has previously boasted on campaign websites that he retired with that rank, according to screenshots shared by Alpha News.\n\n\"It kind of just sat there, you know, when he was a congressman. He bragged that he was a retired command sergeant major and the highest-ranking person ever in the House,\" Behrends said.\n\nYet Walz never completed the training or the requisite coursework for a command sergeant major at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, and his discharge documents were later amended to say that he retired with the rank of master sergeant, not command sergeant major.\n\nWhile officials with the National Guard told Alpha News that Walz could use the title of command sergeant major, he could not say he retired with it.\n\n\"Walz lied in his campaign literature that he retired as a command sergeant major. Not true,\" said Tony Wenzel, a retired platoon sergeant for the Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\n\"Tim Walz was reduced in rank to master sergeant and that is what he will receive retirement benefits for.\"\n\nBehrends went even further. \"It's stolen valor is really what it is,\" he insisted. \"I don't know of anybody else that's done what he's done.\"\n\nFinally, despite decades with the National Guard, Walz insulted many of his fellow guardsmen and demeaned them as mere teenage \"cooks\" after Minneapolis Democrat Mayor Jacob Frey requested that Walz, who had since been elected governor, send along the National Guard to help quell the violent BLM riots of 2020.\n\n\"I don't think the mayor knew what he was asking for,\" Walz said in August 2020. \"I think the mayor said, 'I request the National Guard, whew, this is great. We're going to have massively trained troops.' No. You're going to have 19-year-olds who are cooks.\"\n\nThe rioters ultimately burned down a police precinct and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage citywide.\n\n\"If he would have went to Iraq, he'd still be hiding under his desk over there because that's just, you know, just the cowardice that I see portrayed with him,\" Behrends said of Walz.\n\nFor years, Behrends, Wenzel, and others who served in the Minnesota Army National Guard say they have tried to correct the record regarding Walz's service so that voters aren't misled.\n\n\"I could never vote for Tim Walz as our governor, when he abandoned his fellow soldiers like he did,\" Wenzel stated in 2018.\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for Walz told Alpha News, \"Normally this type of partisan political attack only comes from one who's never worn a uniform.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tim Walz touted misleading descriptions of his military service during his 2006 congressional run, according to a media kit he distributed at the time obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nMedia kits, or press packets, are standard practice for candidates who seek to introduce themselves to the electorate and often feature a variety of news stories or interviews. In Walz's case, he hoped to emphasize his public service as both a public school teacher and veteran.\n\nBut, two of the articles Walz selected gave the impression that he served overseas in Afghanistan. That decision adds to a growing pattern of incidents in which Walz either misrepresented his military service or promoted others' misrepresentations of it.\n\nA March 20, 2006 Wall Street Journal report included in the kit states that Walz \"served overseas during the early war in Afghanistan.\" Walz told the paper that the Iraq war is \"not something that is a political game.\"\n\nAnother, from the January/February 2006 edition of The Atlantic, describes Walz as \"a command sergeant major who'd just returned from fighting the war on terrorism.\" The piece goes on to characterize Walz as one of the \"number of veterans from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq\" who were running for Congress that year.\n\nWalz, now the Democratic vice presidential nominee, did not serve in either Afghanistan or Iraq, and his title of command sergeant major was revoked after he left the service just two months before his National Guard battalion was informed of a future deployment to Iraq. Walz was stationed overseas in Italy from August 2003 to April 2004.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris's presidential campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThat Walz was not sent to a war zone came as a relief to him. In 2003, he told a local paper that \"in the big scheme of deployments, this probably isn't too bad. I thought we might end up in Iraq.\"\n\nThroughout Walz's first congressional campaign, he leaned heavily into his military service. As the Free Beacon reported Wednesday, Walz released a statement in March 2005 that he fully planned to continue his campaign in Iraq after hearing that his battalion was on the shortlist to deploy there.\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major, I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq but also to serve if called on,\" he said.\n\nOther press releases from the time, obtained by the Free Beacon and available on archived versions of Walz's campaign website, implied Walz served in Iraq as well. One from February of that year features an \"in the news section\" that includes two hyperlinked stories about \"Iraq war veterans\" running for Congress.\n\nWalz has since cited his military service as a rationale for his support of new gun control legislation. In a video posted by the Harris campaign earlier this month, Walz said, \"we can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is [sic] the only place those weapons are at.\" But Walz's suggestion that he was carrying weapons \"in war\" ignores the fact that he never saw combat.\n\nOn at least two instances, Walz described himself as a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom, the official name of the U.S. government's war in Afghanistan following the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nAs a first-time congressional candidate in 2006, Walz's campaign announcement described him as \"a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" an archived version of the press release shows. Two years earlier, in 2004, Walz organized a protest against then-President George W. Bush in Mankato, Minn.

Tim Walz's service in the Army National Guard on Wednesday in response to Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance accusing him of committing an act of \"stolen valor.\"\n\nVance, who served as a combat correspondent in the Marine Corps., criticized Walz on Wednesday for allegedly leaving his battalion upon learning of its deployment to Iraq in 2005. Jean-Pierre told a reporter that Walz bravely served in the National Guard for 24 years without addressing his avoidance of a deployment.\n\n\"Today, Sen. J.D. Vance has accused Gov. Walz of stolen valor, and obviously military service is something that is deeply personal to the president given the service of his son. I'm curious, how is he reacting to these statements?\" a reporter asked Jean-Pierre.\n\n\"Look, any statements, attacks or comments, I would have to refer you to the campaign,\" Jean-Pierre replied. \"I think when I was answering your colleague['s] question earlier about Gov. Walz, I laid out and you've all seen his bio, right? This is someone who enlisted at 17 years old to serve this country, he was part of the Army National Guard for 24 years. This is someone who [was] a high school teacher, a high school coach as well, who grew up in a small town in the Midwest. And so I think his bio speaks for itself, who he is speaks for itself, his record speaks for itself, and I'm just not going to say anything beyond that.\"\n\nRetired Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, two veterans who say they served in Walz's battalion, wrote a letter in 2018 accusing the Minnesota governor of \"betraying his country\" by allowing the remainder of the battalion to be deployed to Iraq without him, according to the New York Post.\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" Behrends and Herr wrote, according to the NYP.\n\nVance accused Walz on Wednesday of shamefully abandoning his battalion and \"lying\" about fighting in combat. Vice President Kamala Harris' headquarters posted footage of Walz saying civilians should not own the weapons he carried in war.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through and to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" Vance said during a Wednesday press conference. \"I also think it's dishonest ... He said we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on the streets. Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage.\"\n\nVance enlisted in the Marine Corps. in 2003 and was deployed to Iraq in the latter part of 2005, according to an excerpt from his 2016 bestselling memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Who? If you're like me, the Minnesota governor is not exactly a household name. I'm not sure I had even heard of him until after Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race.\n\nHaving said that, our friend Andrew Donaldson at Heard Tell had a good point when he said that Walz is a boring, safe pick and that can be a good thing in the Trump era when over-the-top anger and outrage can become exhausting to voters. Walz seems to be a relative moderate and pick that says \"Let's return to normal.\" (If you want a deep dive into Walz's history, the Lost Debate podcast provides a fair and balanced look at the new candidate.)\n\nWalz was a sleeper candidate for the VP slot, but in retrospect, it's easy to see why he was picked. Mark Kelly would have been an exciting pick, but he lacks experience and vetting, plus Democrats need him in the Senate. Josh Shapiro is not far into his first term as governor and, given the current geopolitical climate, would have caused a division in the Democratic Party between pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel factions. There are also indications that Shapiro and Harris did not hit it off when they met. Pete Buttigieg is also inexperienced and would have been a divisive pick because of his sexuality.\n\nWalz is short on sex appeal, but he does check a lot of boxes. He's a rural, white man, which helps to balance the ticket demographically. He is a veteran, a teacher, and a gun owner who was once endorsed by the NRA. As a congressman from 2007 through 2018, Walz was one of the most moderate Democrats. After more than a decade in a red-leaning district, Walz has also been thoroughly vetted.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some vulnerabilities. For example, some Republicans are charging that Walz is not really white. No, I'm only kidding. Tim Walz seems to be one of the whitest white guys out there.\n\nBut seriously, here are some of the criticisms that I am hearing about Tim Walz. First, many Republicans are claiming that Walz is a radical socialist who favors open borders. Honestly, Republicans say this about every Democrat. It loses its punch when you apply it to everyone, however, and I don't think that it will stick to Walz.\n\nA more serious criticism stems from Walz's handling of the 2020 George Floyd riots in Minneapolis. Walz has admitted to being slow to deploy the National Guard in response to the violence, but he has also been lauded for the state prosecution of the officers involved in Floyd's death.\n\nInterestingly, audio of Donald Trump praising Walz's response to the riots has surfaced. Trump's positive spin on Walz's performance will help to blunt criticism of his handling of the riots.\n\nWalz has also been criticized for his handling of transgender issues and some Republicans are calling him \"Tampon Tim.\" Transgender issues are an area where Democrats are most vulnerable. The \"Tampon Tim\" moniker relates to a new Minnesota law that mandates that menstrual products must be available in all public school restrooms used by students in grades 4 through 12 with no exception for boys' bathrooms. The Hill reports that Walz also issued an Executive Order and signed bills that protected access to \"gender-affirming\" healthcare for transgender minors.\n\nThere is also criticism of Walz's military record. Walz served in the National Guard for 24 years, achieving the rank of command sergeant major before retiring as a sergeant major. The lower rank for retirement was because \"he did not complete additional coursework at the US Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" per the National Guard.\n\nWalz deployed overseas to Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the war in Afghanistan, in 2003. The criticism involves the fact that Walz retired just before his unit deployed to Iraq. Some Republicans are implying that this was a cowardly attempt to avoid combat duty, but Walz was allowed to retire and received an honorable discharge.\n\nPer CNN, Walz retired in May 2005 and his unit did not receive alert orders for their deployment until July, two months later. Evidence has surfaced on the internet that Walz was aware of at least the possibility of a deployment before he retired. A fellow soldier told Alpha News that Walz was conditionally promoted to command sergeant major but retired to run for Congress after only being on the job about 14 days.\n\nJD Vance has used the term \"stolen valor\" in connection with Walz's military service. Whatever you think of the timing of Walz's retirement, it had nothing to do with stolen valor, which is claiming to be a service member or veteran when you are not or claiming to be entitled to wear badges or medals that you did not earn. As an example, Rep. Troy Nehls' (R-Texas) right to wear the Combat Infantry Badge was rescinded by the Army after it was determined that he did not meet the qualifications, but he continued to wear the badge.\n\nThe only thing that I've seen so far that approaches stolen valor is a statement in 2018 in which he said, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is [sic] the only place that those weapons are at.\"\n\nWalz seems to have never said that he served in combat, and his statement is technically accurate that he did carry a gun during wartime as a member of the military before retiring in 2005, but the statement could be understood as a claim to have served in combat, even it wasn't explicit.\n\nBut there is a bit more. Dave Thul is a Twitter friend and a retired army veteran from Walz's old congressional district in Minnesota. Thul criticized Walz in a 2009 blog post for implying on his congressional website that he served in Afghanistan.\n\nIn Thul's words, \"The use on Walz's official congressional website of the phrase 'in support of Operation Enduring Freedom' always seemed to me to be intentionally vague and misleading. Most people with military experience would know that the phrase doesn't necessarily mean having served in combat (although I didn't at first). But most civilians see 'Enduring Freedom' and equate that (correctly) with the war in Afghanistan.\"\n\nA final criticism involves a DUI charge from 30 years ago. In 1995, Walz was arrested on suspicion of intoxicated driving. Walz accepted a plea deal that reduced the charge to reckless driving and used the moment as an opportunity to become sober. It is a coincidence that both Walz and Donald Trump are now teetotalers and both have mugshots.\n\nCircling back to the original claim that Walz is a radical leftist, it does seem to be true that Walz has been further to the left as a governor than as a member of Congress, It is also true, however, that a lot of the positions that Republicans cite as evidence aren't exactly outside of the political mainstream. Among his positions are support for universal free school lunches, universal background checks and red flag laws for gun purchasers, and a law protecting abortion in Minnesota. Those positions are likely to be more popular with voters than his measures to provide health insurance, driver's licenses, and college tuition to illegal immigrants. Walz will likely be a supporter of immigration reform, which would probably be more popular as a comprehensive bill than these individual measures.\n\nBut ultimately, Walz's past policy preferences don't matter much as a vice presidential candidate. He's there to serve as a backup, to attack Donald Trump, and to not embarrass Kamala Harris or the Democratic Party (or, if elected, the United States). That's a low bar and one that his counterpart on the Republican ticket has not been able to meet.\n\nWalz is not conservative, but he is a conservative pick for Harris. He is a safe pick. He's a running mate who will allow Democrats to spend their time attacking Donald Trump and JD Vance rather than cleaning up Walz's messes. Walz is also an experienced executive who could lead the country immediately if called upon to do so. In those regards, Walz was a good pick who may provide a slight boost to Harris's ticket but at least won't prove to be a drag.", "source": {"uri": "ordinary-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

It is not only frowned upon by veterans, it can also be illegal if he gains any rewards from the embellishment.\n\nWalz has falsely claimed that he had carried a weapon in war. Although he served in the U.S. Army National Guard, Walz never went to war. In fact, when his unit deployed to Iraq, Walz quit the army, abandoning the soldiers in his command.\n\n\"I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt,\" Walz said. \"I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war\"\n\nThe key stolen valor prhase is, \"That I carried in war.\"\n\nIn a fiery exchange that has stirred up the political scene, JD Vance has openly criticized Governor Tim Walz, accusing him of \"stolen valor\" and questioning his commitment to his military unit and the country.\n\nVance, a Marine and current political figure backed by Silicon Valley, responded to Walz's remarks that implied Vance's elite education and backing made him part of the very elite class he opposes.\n\nVance retorted by emphasizing his humble beginnings and the hard work that led him through college and law school, representing what he considers the essence of the American dream. He expressed disbelief at Walz's attempt to frame his background negatively, suggesting that such a perspective was bizarre and out of touch with the core values of the American public.\n\nThe controversy centers on personal attacks and profound discrepancies in military records and public statements. Vance pointed out that while he served honorably in Iraq when called upon by his country,\n\nWalz allegedly withdrew from deployment at a critical moment. According to Vance, Walz prepared with his unit, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, for a deployment to Iraq but resigned his commission just as the unit was about to be mobilized. This action, Vance claims, left the unit without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer and was seen by many, including retired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends, as a betrayal.\n\n\"What really bothers me about Tim Walsh, it's not even the positions that he's taken, though certainly he has been a far left radical. You know what really bothers me about Tim Walsh as a Marine who served his country in uniform?\" Vance said. \"When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably, and I'm very proud of that service.\"\n\nBehrends has been vocal about Walz's military career, noting that while Walz served for 24 years, his record did not include active combat or deployment in the Global War on Terror theaters, contrary to some of his public claims. He highlighted that Walz's only deployments were to Italy and Norway and that Walz retired from the National Guard right before his unit was set to deploy to Iraq.\n\n\"'In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq,\" Behrends said. \"On May 16th, 2005, he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging, without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.\"\n\nThe dispute further deepens with Vance criticizing Walz for comments made about gun control, where Walz referenced carrying \"weapons of war\" during his service -- statements that Vance and others have challenged due to Walz's non-combat military record.\n\n\"When Tim Walsh was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with. I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go. I also think it's dishonest,\" Vance added.\n\nVance's accusations have stirred significant controversy and discussions about the integrity and honesty of political figures regarding their military service, especially in times of increasing scrutiny over the authenticity of such claims. The implications of these accusations are profound, touching on issues of trust, leadership, and the responsibilities of those in power.\n\nThe political ramifications are significant as Vance's comments come at a time when both figures are prominent in their respective roles. Vance's criticisms reflect a broader debate over military service's role in political credibility and leadership, particularly as both men continue to shape their political narratives in the face of public scrutiny.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, the public and media are closely watching both figures, anticipating further clarifications or rebuttals. The discussions around these accusations are expected to influence public opinion, potentially affecting both Vance's and Walz's future political prospects.", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walsh_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walsh (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-commissioned officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radicalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radicalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War on terror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Active duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/iraq-combat.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-16", "textStart": 3528, "textEnd": 3542}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket\n\nCINCINNATI (AP) -- Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, with Republicans questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nHere's a look at Walz's record and how it's become a campaign issue:\n\nArmy National Guard service\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's that retirement that Republicans have criticized in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nRepublican criticism\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance questioned whether Walz's departure from service months ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, calling it \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nDemocratic response\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the U.S. House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 -- said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic,\" arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion.\"\n\nAssociated Press reporters Trenton Daniel and Richard Lardner contributed to this report.\n\nMeg Kinnard can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP\n\nMore from this section\n\nEmpowering Youth and Adults with the

Tim Walz's online biography amid scrutiny of his military service record, according to Politico.\n\nThe Harris-Walz website as of Thursday afternoon lists the governor as having risen \"to the rank of Command Sergeant Major.\" It previously claimed Gov. Walz was a \"retired command sergeant major,\" according to Politico, a position he was allegedly never granted by the National Guard.\n\nIn a 2018 open letter in the West Central Tribune, retired Minnesota National Guard Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr accused Gov. Walz of purposely obscuring and inflating his service background.\n\nTim Walz has embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances of his military career for years,\" the letter claims.\n\nThe letter goes on to describe how Gov. Walz had been \"conditionally promoted\" to command sergeant major, meaning he was required to meet certain conditions in order to be promoted.\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005 he quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" it reads. \"On September 10th, 2005 conditionally promoted Command Sergeant Major Walz was reduced to Master Sergeant.\"\n\nREAD MORE | Harris campaign says teachers fueled 24-hour donation spree after Walz named running mate\n\nThe governor enlisted in the National Guard at 17 and served for 24 years. Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, on Wednesday attacked Gov. Walz over his decision to leave the National Guard before the Iraq War.\n\n\"When the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" he said. \"I did what they asked to do and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of the service.\"\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did?\" the senator asked. \"He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.

I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably. And I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did?

Vance accused Kamala Harris' running mate of \"stolen valor\" for claiming in a recently resurfaced 2018 clip that he carried \"weapons of war\" in war.\n\n\"Walz did make a comment speaking to a group, he's done it a couple of times, where he has used language that has suggested that he carried weapons in a fighting situation,\" Foreman told CNN host Brianna Keilar.\n\n\"I know from coming from a military family there is a difference between being in a combat area, being involved at a time of war, and actually being in a position where people are shooting at you,\" he added.\n\n\"There is no evidence that at any time Governor Walz was in a position of being shot at, and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest he was, so that is absolutely false.\"\n\nKeilar commented: \"The quote was, 'We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at,' and certainly for someone who wasn't familiar with their record, they might draw a different conclusion.\"\n\nWalz enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17 and served for 24 years before leaving to run for Congress. He retired just before his unit deployed to the Iraq War in 2005. That same year, Vance went to Iraq as a military journalist, but did not go into combat, according to the Guardian.\n\nVance, 40, a former marine, attacked Walz the day after he was unveiled as Harris's number two, saying: \"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?

Do not pretend to be something that you're not... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nIn his fact check, CNN's Foreman said there was \"no evidence\" to back Vance's assertion that Walz ducked out of his deployment as he left the guard two months before his unit got orders to go to Iraq.\n\nIn 2018, Walz reportedly told Minnesota Public Radio: \"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that. I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign released a statement defending Walz's record, saying: \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\n\n\"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nThe targeting of Walz's military service has raised the specter of the GOP \"swift boat\" attacks on John Kerry over his service in Vietnam that was credited with harming his losing 2004 presidential campaign against George W. Bush, who did not serve.\n\nThe operative credited with masterminding the attacks, Chris LaCivita, is now one of Donald Trump's top advisers.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brianna_Keilar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brianna Keilar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Vance has the press scrambling. CNN's Jake Tapper has called accusations of stolen valor against Democrat vice presidential candidate Tim Walz \"crazy\". We know that Walz served for more than two decades and we respect him for that. We know he was stationed in Italy for a short time. We know that he retired two months before his unit received \"alert orders\" to be deployed to Iraq. The current argument is over whether that's the reason he retired, and whether or not he served in Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon has obtained a 2006 campaign press kit outlining Walz's military career.\n\nA March 20, 2006, Wall Street Journal report included in the kit states that Walz \"served overseas during the early war in Afghanistan.\" Walz told the paper that the Iraq war is \"not something that is a political game.\"\n\nAnother, from the January/February 2006 edition of The Atlantic, describes Walz as \"a command sergeant major who'd just returned from fighting the war on terrorism.\" The piece goes on to characterize Walz as one of the \"number of veterans from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq\" who were running for Congress that year.\n\nWalz, now the Democratic vice presidential nominee, did not serve in either Afghanistan or Iraq, and his title of command sergeant major was revoked after he left the service just two months before his National Guard battalion was informed of a future deployment to Iraq. Walz was stationed overseas in Italy from August 2003 to April 2004.\n\nThe fact is, we shouldn't have to talk about this for three days. Kamala Harris held a rally with Walz this afternoon.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, Republicans are questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nCincinnati (US), Aug 8 (AP) Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket, Republicans are questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service.\n\nAlso Read | Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus Takes Oath As Head of Bangladesh's Interim Government.\n\nHere's a look at Walz's record and how it's become a campaign issue:\n\nArmy National Guard service\n\nAlso Read | Adam Britton Jailed: Former BBC Zoologist Sentenced to 10 Years and 5 Months for Raping, Killing At least 42 Dogs.\n\nWalz served a total of 24 years in various branches of the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. It's the circumstances of that retirement that Republicans have criticised in the presidential campaign.\n\nAccording to the Nebraska Army National Guard, Walz enlisted in April 1981 -- just two days after his 17th birthday -- and entered service as an infantryman, completing a 12-week Army infantry basic training course before graduating from high school.\n\nWhile attending the University of Houston in 1985, he was reclassified as a field artillery cannoneer as a member of the Texas Army National Guard, later serving as an instructor with the Arkansas Army National Guard.\n\nIn 1987, Walz returned to Nebraska's Guard detachment, continuing field artillery assignments while he completed a college degree. By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilisation of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilsed in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nDespite his having retired several months before the deployment order was issued, it's the fact that Walz left the service ahead of his unit's departure that Republicans have pointed to in attempts to argue that he was aiming to avoid being sent to a combat zone.\n\nBy the time Walz left the military entirely, he had achieved the rank of command sergeant major, one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. But personnel files show that he was reduced in rank months after retiring, leaving him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes. Minnesota National Guard officials have said that Walz retired before completing coursework at the US Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nRepublican criticism\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's running mate and himself a Marine Corps veteran, is among those who have called Walz's service into question.\n\nAs he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance questioned whether Walz's departure from service months ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, calling it \"stolen valour garbage\".\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during an event at the Shelby Township Police Department. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nDemocratic response\n\nIn a statement provided to The Associated Press, the Harris campaign pushed back on the GOP characterization of Walz's service, also pointing out his advocacy for veterans while in the US House.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" the campaign said.\n\nIn a post on X, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- who as a Naval intelligence officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2014 -- said Thursday that Republicans' criticism of Walz was \"strategic\", arguing that the Trump campaign \"needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion\".

First District congressional candidate Tim Walz currently holds the rank of Command Sergeant Major in the 1-125th Battalion, which is based in New Ulm and largely composed of men and women from southern Minnesota. The announcement from the National Guard PAO specified that all or a portion of Walz's battalion could be mobilized to serve in Iraq within the next two years.\n\nWalz, who teaches Global Geography at Mankato West High School, has been an active member of the National Guard since 1981. He has been previously deployed during his 23 years in the National Guard, including an eight month deployment during Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nWhen asked about his possible deployment to Iraq Walz said, \"I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment.\"\n\nAlthough his tour of duty in Iraq might coincide with his campaign for Minnesota's 1st Congressional seat, Walz is determined to stay in the race. \"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq.\"\n\n\"I don't want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.\"\n\nIf called to duty, Walz would leave behind his wife Gwen and four year old daughter, Hope.\n\nAs Breitbart News has reported, Walz did not retire as a command sergeant major (E-9), despite claiming otherwise.

And so I think his bio speaks for itself, who he is speaks for itself, his record speaks for itself, and I'm just not going to say anything beyond that.\"\n\nRetired Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, two veterans who say they served in Walz's battalion, wrote a letter in 2018 accusing the Minnesota governor of \"betraying his country\" by allowing the remainder of the battalion to be deployed to Iraq without him, according to the New York Post.\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" Behrends and Herr wrote, according to the NYP.\n\nVance accused Walz on Wednesday of shamefully abandoning his battalion and \"lying\" about fighting in combat. Vice President Kamala Harris' headquarters posted footage of Walz saying civilians should not own the weapons he carried in war.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through and to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" Vance said during a Wednesday press conference. \"I also think it's dishonest ... He said we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on the streets. Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage.\"\n\nVance enlisted in the Marine Corps. in 2003 and was deployed to Iraq in the latter part of 2005, according to an excerpt from his 2016 bestselling memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

He then put in 20 years of service and retired.\n\n'What the hell kind of leadership is that?'\n\nShortly after his retirement, the terrorist attacks of September 11 happened, and Walz re-enlisted just weeks later. In April 2005, he was promoted to the rank of command sergeant major before retiring again the following month and launching an ultimately successful campaign for Congress.\n\nThat's when aspects of his story become dicey.\n\nFor one thing, sometime in early 2005, Walz and other members of his battalion received word that they would be deployed to Iraq soon. Walz, the highest noncommissioned officer in the unit, then abruptly retired in May, leaving the unit without a designated leader.\n\nThomas Behrends, a former member of Walz's unit and now a retired command sergeant major of the Minnesota National Guard, said he stepped in to take Walz's place and eventually spent nearly two years fighting in Iraq while Walz stayed home and campaigned.\n\n\"I was like well, for Pete's sake, if this guy quits, if I say I'm not going to do it, I mean, what the hell kind of leadership is that?\" Behrends told Alpha News back in 2022. \"If a company would say we're going to deploy to Iraq and the foreman says, 'I'm not going,' what does that say to the 500 that work in that factory?\"\n\nAnother problem with Walz's retirement in May 2005 is that it falls several months short of a four-year enlistment and more than two full years short of a six-year enlistment.\n\nYet according to Alpha News, which ostensibly viewed Walz's Report of Separation and Military Service form, Walz initially pledged to serve six years when he re-enlisted in September 2001, meaning his contract with the Army National Guard would not be fulfilled until September 2007.\n\nIn apparent contravention to that document, Walz insisted that when he retired in 2005, he had put in four years as promised.\n\n\"After completing 20 years of service in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for an additional four years following Sept. 11 and retired the year before my battalion was deployed to Iraq in order to run for Congress,\" Walz wrote in the Winona Daily News in 2006.\n\n'Walz lied in his campaign literature that he retired as a command sergeant major. Not true.'\n\nFurthermore, Walz also seems to have misrepresented the rank he held at his retirement. He technically received a promotion to command sergeant major a few weeks before he retired and has previously boasted on campaign websites that he retired with that rank, according to screenshots shared by Alpha News.\n\n\"It kind of just sat there, you know, when he was a congressman. He bragged that he was a retired command sergeant major and the highest-ranking person ever in the House,\" Behrends said.\n\nYet Walz never completed the training or the requisite coursework for a command sergeant major at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, and his discharge documents were later amended to say that he retired with the rank of master sergeant, not command sergeant major.\n\nWhile officials with the National Guard told Alpha News that Walz could use the title of command sergeant major, he could not say he retired with it.\n\n\"Walz lied in his campaign literature that he retired as a command sergeant major. Not true,\" said Tony Wenzel, a retired platoon sergeant for the Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\n\"Tim Walz was reduced in rank to master sergeant and that is what he will receive retirement benefits for.\"\n\nBehrends went even further. \"It's stolen valor is really what it is,\" he insisted. \"I don't know of anybody else that's done what he's done.\"\n\nFinally, despite decades with the National Guard, Walz insulted many of his fellow guardsmen and demeaned them as mere teenage \"cooks\" after Minneapolis Democrat Mayor Jacob Frey requested that Walz, who had since been elected governor, send along the National Guard to help quell the violent BLM riots of 2020.\n\n\"I don't think the mayor knew what he was asking for,\" Walz said in August 2020. \"I think the mayor said, 'I request the National Guard, whew, this is great. We're going to have massively trained troops.' No. You're going to have 19-year-olds who are cooks.\"\n\nThe rioters ultimately burned down a police precinct and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage citywide.\n\n\"If he would have went to Iraq, he'd still be hiding under his desk over there because that's just, you know, just the cowardice that I see portrayed with him,\" Behrends said of Walz.\n\nFor years, Behrends, Wenzel, and others who served in the Minnesota Army National Guard say they have tried to correct the record regarding Walz's service so that voters aren't misled.\n\n\"I could never vote for Tim Walz as our governor, when he abandoned his fellow soldiers like he did,\" Wenzel stated in 2018.\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for Walz told Alpha News, \"Normally this type of partisan political attack only comes from one who's never worn a uniform.\"", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Walz, the governor of Minnesota, served for 24 years in the National Guard before retiring in 2005 from the military to run for the U.S. House, where he became the most senior enlisted soldier to serve in Congress.\n\nLed by GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance, a Marine Corps veteran who deployed to Iraq, Republicans have suggested that Walz inflated his credentials by calling himself a \"retired command sergeant major.\" The Minnesota governor did serve as a command sergeant major but was reverted back to the rank of master sergeant when he left the military because he had not completed required coursework for the higher rank with the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nSimilar accusations have followed Walz in previous campaigns, including his 2018 race for governor, when a paid letter to the editor written by two retired command sergeant majors alleged that Walz misrepresented his rank during the campaign. Walz went on to win that race.\n\n\"The son of an Army veteran who served as a command sergeant major, Walz was the ranking member on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, where he passed legislation to help stem veterans' suicides,\" the Harris campaign's biography of Walz now reads.\n\nIn the original biography, the same sentence called Walz \"the son of an Army veteran and a retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard himself,\" website archives show.

I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" Walz said in his speech, aiming toward voters who don't want guns on the streets.\n\nThere are lots of military vets here, I'm wondering what they think of this quote?\n\nBefore I go any further, let me be clear: I have not served in the military and cannot comment on this from a military perspective. I have spent time over the last few days looking into this to try and disentangle what facts exist and then offer my perspective on how they are being interpreted.\n\nGoing back to @Lucysfootball's comment, there are three primary attacks and two minor ones that have emerged to date. I am placing these in a rough order from the biggest claims to the smallest ones:\n\nHere's what the facts say (with some commentary from a range of people who have military experience). First, let's get rid of the two minor ones:\n\nWalz steals valor by wearing a special forces hat.\n\nThis is the most out-there one and pretty easily dismissed. The hat was gifted to him by a Special Forces unit when Walz was on the Congressional Armed Services committee. Here's context from the Stolen Valor Xtter account (which is one of the sources for this article).\n\nThis argument is similar to saying that wearing a Yankee's hat gifted to you by the team is the same as claiming you played for the Yankees.\n\nWalz never deployed during the Global War on Terror.\n\nThis is easily proven false. During his final tour of duty with the Minnesota National Guard, Walz deployed to Europe in 2003 as part of the Global War on Terror (aka Operation Enduring Freedom). From the Washington Post:\n\nWalz, asked by the oral history interviewer where his combat experience occurred, said initially that his unit -- the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery -- had served \"throughout the European theater with Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the name the Pentagon used to describe the war in Afghanistan and other counterterrorism assignments. A Minnesota Army National Guard history of Walz's battalion verifies that the unit deployed in 2003 to Italy, Turkey, Belgium and Britain in support of the war effort.\n\nWalz clarified later in the interview that he and his fellow Guard members initially thought they would fire artillery, but later learned they would be assigned in Europe to backfill other U.S. troops who were going to war.\n\nNow that the easily disproven claims are out of the way, we get into the thornier questions.\n\nWalz claimed to have been in combat.\n\nAt no point in his career has Walz explicitly claimed to have been in combat or served in a combat zone. As I just noted, his one OEF deployment was to Europe. While it was in support of the Afghan war, he and his unit, never got closer to Afghanistan than Turkey.\n\nHowever, he did make statements like the one @Lucysfootball noted which, intentionally or not, implied combat:\n\nWalz: \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nThe phrase people have called attention to is \"that I carried in war.\" Walz did carry a standard-issue rifle at times during his service and he served during a war. He most likely didn't carry it often during his time in Europe. From the Washington Post:\n\nThomas Behrends, a retired command sergeant major who also was on that deployment, said it was very clear that their unit was not going to war.\n\n\"He's sugarcoating it to make it more than it was,\" Behrends said. After 9/11, he added, the Air Force realized it needed to better safeguard its airfields and requested the National Guard to assist.\n\n\"That was the mission from the get-go,\" Behrends said. \"There was nothing ever said about going to combat.\"\n\nFor context, Retired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends is one of the two primary critics of Walz's service. However, I think he has a point on this one. When the average person hears \"in a war\" they often interpret it as \"in combat.\" Military members clearly see it in similar terms, as our own @Steve, who is a military veteran, responded to @Lucysfootball today with:\n\nI served during the Vietnam war but did not deploy there so I learned long ago not to declare myself a Vietnam vet.\n\nIn using those words Walz hammered home his view that AR-platform rifles are weapons of war. It would have been more accurate to say, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in the National Guard, are only carried in war.\" Rhetorically it doesn't work as well. But that doesn't excuse the ambiguity created by what he said.\n\nWalz retired to avoid deployment to Iraq and, in doing so, abandoned his unit.\n\nThis claim isn't so much one of Stolen Valor as it is, I guess, cowardess. At least that is the way that J. D. Vance has framed it:\n\n\"When the United State Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\"\n\n[source: https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/07/politics/tim-walz-military-record-vance-attack/index.html]\n\nUltimately, this is the muddiest of all the claims due to timelines and a question of who did what, who knew what, and when did everything happen. Thankfully Task and Purpose has done great research into the timeline, so I don't have to pull everything together:\n\nOne important thing to note here is that, like most jobs, you don't just announce on the day you are leaving that you are retiring. While I couldn't find a document that gave guidance for when to submit the request for retirement, I found the recommendations for Air Reservists and these mirror what I have seen people say about the National Guard (and most military branches):\n\nRetirees can apply no earlier than 12 months prior to their retirement effective date. It is recommended that applications are submitted no later than 180 days prior (earlier the better) to their retirement effective date to ensure payment and/or benefits are received on time.\n\nAssuming Walz followed a similar recommended timeframe, he would have submitted his retirement papers sometime in September 2004 (180 days before his retirement date). Theoretically, Walz could have known about the possible deployment as early as then, but there's no evidence to back that up. Here's Task and Purpose on that part of the timeline:\n\nMany details of Walz's decision process remain unclear. The press release by Walz's campaign indicates he knew a deployment was possible at least four months before the unit received official orders and two before he retired. But that timeline could have several missing pieces.\n\nFor one, such advanced 'heads-up' notice is commonly provided to senior leaders of deployable units, and can often change or fall through as Pentagon planners shuffle deployment plans a year or more ahead of time.\n\nA second uncertainty lies in the May 2005 retirement date when Walz's retirement became official. It likely came many months after he 'dropped his papers' to inform his chain of command he intended to retire, beginning the process.\n\nSo here's the tl;dr: Walz had retired from the guard at the 20-year mark and then re-enlisted after 9/11. He served four years in the guard and was eligible for retirement. By that time, he was 40, married, and had a young child at home. He had already been deployed once in the Global War on Terror. He had also made the decision that he was going to run for Congress and was in the process of laying the groundwork for that. And, he most likely had filed to retire in the fall of 2004. Also if he had chosen to stay in until the unit was deployed, he would have had to wait until 2006 and would not have been able to run for Congress.\n\nAs Task and Purpose notes, even some Walz critics have said he was well within his rights to make this decision:\n\nAt least one soldier who knew Walz as well as any has defended him -- despite not being a fan. Joseph Eustice, whose personal Facebook page today has anti-Walz posts, held the same job as Walz -- command sergeant major of 1st battalion, 125th Artillery Regiment.\n\nWhen the retirement controversy flared up in 2022, Eustice told local media that Walz fulfilled his duty.\n\n\"He was a great soldier,\" Eustice told the Star Tribune. \"When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave.\"\n\nSeveral other soldiers from Walz's unit echoed that sentiment, including a former brigadier general.\n\nWalz has misrepresented his rank, claiming to be a rank higher (Command Sergeant Major - E9) than his retirement rank (Master Sergeant - E8)\n\nThis is another case where the facts are clear, but the way Walz's office has represented them isn't very transparent. Starting with the facts from Military.com:\n\nWalz enlisted in the Army National Guard in Nebraska in 1981 and retired honorably in 2005 as the top enlisted soldier for 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery Regiment, in the Minnesota National Guard, according to a copy of his records provided by the Minnesota Guard. He reached the rank of command sergeant major and served in that role, but he officially retired as a master sergeant for benefits purposes because he didn't finish a required training course, according to the records and a statement from the Minnesota Guard.\n\nNow we get to the representation issue. If we look at Walz's biography on the Minnesota government site, it contains this passage:\n\nAfter 24 years in the Army National Guard, Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005.\n\nLikewise, his congressional bio states:\n\nWalz enlisted in the Army National Guard at the young age of 17, and retired 24 years later as\n\nCommand Sergeant Major.\n\nNow we get into a topic I didn't know anything about before two days ago (which, according to Xtter is just enough time to become a newly minted expert): Military Retirement Ranks. When you retire from the military, your retirement rank is used to determine benefits. At the time he retired, he had the provisional rank of Command Sergeant Major (an E9 position) and was serving in that role. However, he did not complete the coursework or the necessary service timeframe to be permanently given the rank, so his retirement rank is one lower, Sergeant Major (E8).\n\nAs with the \"I carried in war\" comment above, I think both bio entries are playing loose with the truth. What they said is technically true, we has serving in that capacity at the time of retirement, but don't tell the full story. Simply put, I think there is weasel wording happening here.\n\nBut is it Stolen Valor?\n\nFrom a lay persons perspective, while Walz is using weasel words, I don't think it rises to my understanding of Stolen Valor (and definitely not to the level of the 2013 amended Stolen Valor act).\n\nFWIW, this is reflected in the views of one Veteran with political experience who recently expressed his views on the topic. Former Republican Congressman Peter Meijer wrote the following take:\n\nGonna piss off everyone with this take, but what the hell:\n\nI think Walz played fast & loose with his military bio to stay above water as his congressional district drifted right. He let audiences paint in their minds a deceptive picture. It was shady but not stolen valor. (1/5)\n\nWalz alluding to \"weapons in war, that I carried in war\" to give credibility to his pro gun control stance intentionally sought to paint this 'deceptive picture,' just like saying 'deployed during OEF.' But he didn't claim unearned medals or lie about being in IRQ/AFG. (2/5)\n\nSome earlier reporting bought the 'deceptive picture' I mentioned above, but that's not Walz' words. I've had reporters say/write that I was a Marine, or an Afghanistan vet. Trickier was 'combat vet,' which I didn't claim but others have described. His burden to correct. (3/5)\n\nI'd try to correct reporting on me- I definitely wasn't a Marine, and though I spent 18 mos in AFG vs 9 mos in Iraq, fact is I was a civilian in AFG + not in uniform (tho in much more danger). Veteran of that conflict in a sense, but not in the sense 'Afghan vet' connotes. (4/5)\n\nWhether the mobilization/retirement timing was coincidental or a dick move is something I think only the enlisted soldiers in his unit can say. I know one or two have spoken publicly it was a dick move, but I'd like to hear from a plurality to account for personal beefs. (5/5)\n\nUnrelated to Walz, the 'combat vet' identifier has always made me wince. I wouldn't correct if someone called me one but I'm not comfortable describing myself as a 'combat vet.' I served in a combat zone, regularly left the wire, was on a number of smaller bases, and took occasional on-base IDF (including at least one POI probably within a CAB-qualifying <100m). But to me, 'combat vet' implies firing a shot in anger, getting fired at, or frequently being in a position to potentially have one or the other happen.\n\nIf I described myself as a 'combat vet' it would create an inaccurate picture of my service- and even if I met a technical definition and the underlying facts are accurate, that's still deceptive in my book.\n\nMeijer would go on to add:\n\nMore information may come out that changes my view, but for the moment I'm aligned with Meijer. I don't think this is a good look for Walz AND I also think this is being blown out of proportion for political reasons. That is, as I mentioned yesterday, normal politics. But I wonder if this is a great long-term play, especially when the Republican running for President was a draft dodger.", "source": {"uri": "outsidethebeltway.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Outside the Beltway"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_bernius@outsidethebeltway.com", "name": "Matt Bernius", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "War on terror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Special forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterterrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Counterterrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_&_Purpose", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Task & Purpose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Armed_Services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Armed Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz is facing scrutiny over his military service record, with critics, including his Republican rival Sen. JD Vance, accusing Walz of falsely suggesting he saw combat during his time as an Army reservist.\n\nIt's not the first time Walz has encountered such criticism.\n\nA CNN KFile review reveals that similar accusations were made in 2006, during Walz's first run for Congress. That year, multiple letters to his local paper in Mankato, Minnesota, accused him of making misleading statements about his service, including whether he had served in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nWalz found the accusations serious enough that he personally responded to them both.\n\nAt issue were a selection of political ads and statements on Walz's website describing his overseas military service. While they described Walz as having served overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, they neglected to specify that he did so while serving in Italy, not Afghanistan.\n\nWalz was more specific in other statements and interviews with the media from 2006, in which he did say that, \"by luck of the draw,\" he was posted to Italy, and not Afghanistan.\n\nRecent scrutiny of Walz's service record renewed after the Harris campaign posted a video of Walz speaking about his decision to change his position and support an assault weapons ban following the 2018 Parkland shooting. In the video, Walz states, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\nHow Walz described his service\n\nIn 2006, Walz heavily leaned into his brand as a soldier, focusing on his military service and teaching career to portray him as an everyman. But Walz never explicitly said he faced combat.\n\nWalz's official 2006 campaign biography read, \"Prior to retiring, Walz served overseas with his battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" and his website's front page prominently featured him in military uniform.\n\nOne TV advertisement called Walz \"the soldier who served for two decades but ready when they attacked,\" with an image of the Twin Towers burning on the front page of a newspaper.\n\nThe ad said he was a \"command sergeant major, retiring four years late after a tour supporting the war in Afghanistan,\" over an image of a newspaper article headline reading, \"Troops welcomed home,\" with a photo of Walz saluting on his local paper the New Ulm Journal.\n\nAnother ad attacked his opponent for not voting for pay increases for soldiers and voting to raise the salary of members of Congress.\n\n\"When we deployed many in my unit took a pay cut,\" Walz said in another ad. \"He gives himself a pay raise, but he tells the soldiers no.\"\n\nEndorsements on his official website, including from retired Gen. Wesley Clark and former Sen. John Kerry, noted his military experience.\n\nWalz was deployed between 2003 and 2004 to Europe to support Operation Enduring Freedom, but was never deployed to Afghanistan, where the operation occurred.\n\nCriticism prompts Walz response\n\nIn 2006, the Walz campaign's description of his service drew pushback in separate letters to the editors.\n\nOne letter to his local paper said the Walz campaign's phrasing suggested service in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n\"It strongly suggests that he fought in Iraq or Afghanistan, but does not say which country,\" read the letter archived online here from July 2006. \"Because the information is not classified, Walz can tell the voters where he deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan and his BOG (boots on the ground) dates. If Walz did not deploy downrange, he should say so.\"\n\nThe letter caused a string of letters in support of Walz.\n\n\"I was wondering when the Republicans would start 'swift boating' Tim Walz,\" read one. \"Tim Walz has never lied about his service. I have heard him speak several times, and he always explains that the battalion he led was sent to Italy during Operation Enduring Freedom to provide support to the U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan.\"\n\nWalz himself personally responded.\n\n\"On Saturday The Free Press printed a letter which implied I embellished my military record. The details of my record can be easily found in numerous articles by The Free Press and other newspapers. Therefore, I must assume that the letter is meant to slander my good name,\" wrote Walz.\n\n\"For the record, I served 24 years in the Army National Guard and retired as a command sergeant major in May of 2005. I served in three NATO training missions to the Arctic and deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, serving in Italy in 2003-2004,\" he said.\n\n\"Using innuendo to defame a candidate's character has no place in this debate,\" he added. \"This nation must do better because we have too many important issues facing us to do anything less.\"\n\nOne person who wrote a letter supporting Walz was Sgt. Ryan Marti, a former member of Walz's battery who was deployed in Iraq at the time. Marti said members of his unit were extremely supportive and glad to see Walz run for Congress.\n\n\"In 2003, we were stationed in Italy at the beginning of the Iraq invasion,\" Marti told CNN. \"He'd been serving since I think he was 17 when he joined up. ... An opportunity that he never planned for came up to do something bigger. No one in the unit felt bad about this. I mean, a lot of us were extremely happy, and a lot of the teachers at school were happy.\"\n\nWalz accurately described his service in an interview that year with the Minneapolis-St. Paul City Pages in June 2006.\n\n\"I did 10 months with Operation Enduring Freedom, where, by luck of the draw, I served in Italy. It was originally Turkey or Iraq and then they changed it to Enduring Freedom and I said, 'That's Afghanistan.' But they said, 'You guys are going to do the supply lines between Turkey and England.' We provided total base security and the training for soldiers coming in,\" he said.\n\nIn November 2006, the same allegation was leveled at Walz.\n\n\"Through artful omission, Walz is leaving the impression that he served in the combat zones of the current conflict,\" read another letter to the editor in a local paper in November 2006. \"The truth is that he served in Italy. There is a significant difference between Walz' garrison service in Italy and the extreme danger young men and women are facing in the combat zones of Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\n\nWalz again responded.\n\n\"I am writing in response to Tom Hagen's lies about my service record,\" Walz wrote at the time. \"My biography on my official campaign website simply states that 'prior to retiring, Walz served overseas with his battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.'\"\n\n\"From this, Mr. Hagen makes the ridiculous claim that I am misleading voters that I served in combat in Iraq. After completing 20 years of service in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for an additional four years following Sept. 11 and retired the year before my battalion was deployed to Iraq in order to run for Congress,\" he added.\n\n\"I'm proud of the 24 years I served our country in the Army National Guard. There's a code of honor among those who've served, and normally this type of partisan political attack comes only from one who's never worn a uniform,\" he added. \"Mr. Hagen, if you were confused about my service, you could have checked my Web site, or simply had the decency to call and ask me. When you dishonor a veteran, you dishonor all soldiers and veterans. You owe an apology to all those who serve honorably.\"\n\nCNN's Danya Gainor and Allison Gordon contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Most of the media seems very eager to help the Harris campaign get around this speed bump as quickly as possible. Case in point, this Politico story with three credited authors is titled \"Vance runs a Swift Boat attack against Walz's military service.\" Despite the three authors, the article manages to mangle the story pretty effectively. Here's the opening paragraph:\n\nOhio Sen. JD Vance slammed the timing of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's retirement from a more-than-two-decades-long military career as a means of avoiding a deployment to Iraq on Wednesday, calling it \"stolen valor garbage\" and testing a new line of attack on the newly minted Democratic vice presidential contender.\n\nIf you've followed this closely, you know that there are two different issues here. First, Walz claimed during a 2018 town hall event that he wanted to make sure weapons of war like the ones he carried \"in war\" were not available on the street. But as Vance pointed out, Walz never deployed to a combat zone and thus was never \"in war.\" Not mentioned anywhere in the Politico story is that the Harris camp has already conceded Walz was embellishing in those comments. NBC News reported this yesterday: \"Asked about the video, a Harris campaign spokesperson did not deny that Walz had embellished when he spoke of carrying weapons in war.\"\n\nVance also said that that Walz \"abandoned [his] unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone.\" The part about Walz leaving his unit before it went to Iraq is undeniably true, the only issue is whether or not that would constitute abandoning the unit. That's a bit open to interpretation and there are voices on either side who disagree.\n\nRep. Mike Waltz (R-Fla.), a former Green Beret, characterized the timing of Walz's retirement from the Army National Guard with a football analogy in a video posted on X: \"It is kind of like the quarterback of a big team walking away from their team right before they go to the Super Bowl. I've never heard anything like it.\"\n\nIn fact, Walz filed paperwork for his congressional run in February 2005, about a month before reports emerged that the Minnesota National Guard might be deployed. Walz then announced his run in May of that year, two months before the Minnesota National Guard's directive was officially issued.\n\nAgain, Politico is bungling the story here. Vance may have filed to run in February, but that didn't require him to retire. In fact, we know from a report published by the Washington Post yesterday that Walz already knew of rumors his unit was deploying to Iraq before he decided to quit. His supervisor at the time says Walz went over his head to avoid being challenged on his retirement.\n\n\"Nobody wants to go to war. I didn't want to go, but I went,\" Doug Julin, a retired National Guard soldier who worked with Walz, said in an interview. \"The big frustration was that he let his troops down.\"...\n\nJulin, who oversaw Walz as a more senior command sergeant major, said that Walz approached him in 2005 and said he was prepared to go on their upcoming deployment to Iraq, but also was interested in running for Congress. Julin said he thought \"no big deal\" because other members of Congress had deployed.\n\nBut a couple of months later, Julin learned from another member of the Guard that Walz had retired. Julin was frustrated, he said, because Walz had arranged his retirement with two officers who outranked Julin.\n\n\"I would have analyzed it and challenged him,\" Julin said. \"It would have been a different discussion, but he went to the higher ranks. He knew I would have told him, 'Suck it up, we're going.'\"\n\nAnother soldier Walz served with said he remembers Walz telling him he was thinking about leaving after rumors of the deployment spread.\n\nTim Walz was weighing a life-altering decision when he stepped into a supply room at the National Guard Armory in New Ulm, Minn., nearly two decades ago. He closed the door behind him, recalled a colleague, Al Bonnifield, and confided he was considering whether to leave their unit even though it was preparing to go to war so he could run for Congress...\n\nThe deployment to Iraq turned out to be grueling for their unit, which was deployed to Camp Scania, a way station between Baghdad and Kuwait constantly targeted by insurgents with rockets and other long-range fire, Bonnifield said. On the day their deployment was supposed to end, he said, it was extended an extra six months. The soldiers were away from home for a total of 22 months, he said, and multiple people died.\n\nBonnifield is a Democrat who voted for Walz and doesn't think he did anything wrong by leaving on the cusp of deployment. He says he might have done the same thing under the circumstances.\n\nSo there you have it. The facts are that Walz knew deployment was likely before he quit even though it didn't become official until a couple months after he quit. Whether that decision was abandoning the unit or not is something the people who were there at the time feel differently about. But the fact remains that some of them do feel Walz ducked combat for a shot at congress and that's exactly how Vance characterized it yesterday.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_sexton@hotair.com", "name": "John Sexton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Special_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Special Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Waltz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Waltz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Ulm,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Ulm, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Ulm, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baghdad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuwait", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kuwait"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/108/d17424fd-91bc-4288-b3ff-d2954bcced60.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-02-", "textStart": 2147, "textEnd": 2160}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris introduced Walz, a former teacher, as her running mate during a Tuesday rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Walz claims on his official gubernatorial website that he retired as a Command Sergeant Major, but Behrends said in a letter attached to the 2018 Facebook post that Walz's rank was reduced to Master Sergeant due to his sudden retirement.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Vance accused Kamala Harris' running mate of \"stolen valor\" for claiming in a recently resurfaced 2018 clip that he carried \"weapons of war\" in war.\n\n\"Walz did make a comment speaking to a group, he's done it a couple of times, where he has used language that has suggested that he carried weapons in a fighting situation,\" Foreman told CNN host Brianna Keilar.\n\n\"I know from coming from a military family there is a difference between being in a combat area, being involved at a time of war, and actually being in a position where people are shooting at you,\" he added.\n\n\"There is no evidence that at any time Governor Walz was in a position of being shot at, and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest he was, so that is absolutely false.\"\n\nKeilar commented: \"The quote was, 'We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at,' and certainly for someone who wasn't familiar with their record, they might draw a different conclusion.\"\n\nWalz enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17 and served for 24 years before leaving to run for Congress. He retired just before his unit deployed to the Iraq War in 2005. That same year, Vance went to Iraq as a military journalist, but did not go into combat, according to the Guardian.\n\nVance, 40, a former marine, attacked Walz the day after he was unveiled as Harris's number two, saying: \"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone?\"\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nIn his fact check, CNN's Foreman said there was \"no evidence\" to back Vance's assertion that Walz ducked out of his deployment as he left the guard two months before his unit got orders to go to Iraq.\n\nIn 2018, Walz reportedly told Minnesota Public Radio: \"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that. I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign released a statement defending Walz's record, saying: \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\n\n\"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nThe targeting of Walz's military service has raised the specter of the GOP \"swift boat\" attacks on John Kerry over his service in Vietnam that was credited with harming his losing 2004 presidential campaign against George W. Bush, who did not serve.\n\nThe operative credited with masterminding the attacks, Chris LaCivita, is now one of Donald Trump's top advisers.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

They claim that Walz, who is now the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, never saw combat and left the service before his unit's 2005 deployment to Iraq.\n\nWalz, 60, ended his military service just in time to begin his political career, successfully winning a seat in Congress in 2006. Walz, chosen by Vice President Kamala Harris as her running mate, served over twenty years in the Army National Guard. His selection strengthens the nominee's stance on defense issues. The timing of his separation from military came to light during his 2008 gubernatorial campaign.\n\nNever Saw Combat, Left Service Midway\n\nIn a 2018 letter posted on Facebook during Walz's initial gubernatorial campaign, retired Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr claimed that Walz ended his 24-year National Guard career after finding out his battalion was headed to Iraq. They also alleged that he had previously promised his comrades that he would go with them.\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" Behrends and Herr wrote.\n\nBehrends and Herr condemned Walz for leaving the National Guard to pursue a congressional seat, noting that he could have requested permission from the Pentagon to run for office while still on active duty.\n\nThey also accused him of bypassing the necessary paperwork for a proper military discharge, saying he \"slithered out the door,\" as indicated by his retirement documents showing \"soldier not available for signature.\"\n\nThe National Guard members further charged the now two-term Minnesota governor with \"embellishing and selectively omitting facts about his military career for years.\"\n\nThe letter was originally revealed by the Daily Wire.\n\nMany in His Defense\n\nDespite the accusations, Walz has maintained that he has \"an honorable record,\" and other service members who led the same battalion have come to his defense.\n\n\"He was a great soldier,\" said Joseph Eustice, a 32-year National Guard veteran, in a 2022 interview with the Star Tribune.\n\n\"When he chose to leave, he had every right to leave,\" Eustice added, suggesting that the criticisms of Walz's record might have come from disgruntled soldiers who were overlooked for promotions.\n\nAnother National Guard member who served under Walz said that the future U.S. lawmaker had been considering a congressional run before 2005.\n\n\"Would the soldier look down on him because he didn't go with us? Would the common soldier say, 'Hey, he didn't go with us, he's trying to skip out on a deployment?' And he wasn't,\" Al Bonnifield recalled to Minnesota Public Radio of Walz's concerns about dipping out before the deployment to Iraq.\n\n\"He talked with us for quite a while on that subject. He weighed that decision to run for Congress very heavy [sic],\" Bonnifeld added. \"He loved the military, he loved the guard, he loved the soldiers he worked with.\"\n\n\"We all do what we can. I'm proud I did 24 years,\" Walz has said about his service.\n\nWalz enlisted in the National Guard after high school and served in the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery, where he rose to the rank of command sergeant major before retiring.

Tim Walz, pictured at UAW Local 900, August 8 in Wayne, Michigan, is facing scrutiny over his military service record.\n\n(CNN) -- Newly selected Democratic vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is facing scrutiny over his military service record, with critics, including his Republican rival Sen. JD Vance, accusing Walz of falsely suggesting he saw combat during his time as an Army reservist.\n\nIt's not the first time Walz has encountered such criticism.\n\nA CNN KFile review reveals that similar accusations were made in 2006, during Walz's first run for Congress. That year, multiple letters to his local paper in Mankato, Minnesota, accused him of making misleading statements about his service, including whether he had served in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nWalz found the accusations serious enough that he personally responded to them both.\n\nAt issue were a selection of political ads and statements on Walz's website describing his overseas military service. While they described Walz as having served overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, they neglected to specify that he did so while serving in Italy, not Afghanistan.\n\nWalz was more specific in other statements and interviews with the media from 2006, in which he did say that, \"by luck of the draw,\" he was posted to Italy, and not Afghanistan.\n\nRecent scrutiny of Walz's service record renewed after the Harris campaign posted a video of Walz speaking about his decision to change his position and support an assault weapons ban following the 2018 Parkland shooting. In the video, Walz states, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\nHow Walz described his service\n\nIn 2006, Walz heavily leaned into his brand as a soldier, focusing on his military service and teaching career to portray him as an everyman. But Walz never explicitly said he faced combat.\n\nWalz's official 2006 campaign biography read, \"Prior to retiring, Walz served overseas with his battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" and his website's front page prominently featured him in military uniform.\n\nOne TV advertisement called Walz \"the soldier who served for two decades but ready when they attacked,\" with an image of the Twin Towers burning on the front page of a newspaper.\n\nThe ad said he was a \"command sergeant major, retiring four years late after a tour supporting the war in Afghanistan,\" over an image of a newspaper article headline reading, \"Troops welcomed home,\" with a photo of Walz saluting on his local paper the New Ulm Journal.\n\nAnother ad attacked his opponent for not voting for pay increases for soldiers and voting to raise the salary of members of Congress.\n\n\"When we deployed many in my unit took a pay cut,\" Walz said in another ad. \"He gives himself a pay raise, but he tells the soldiers no.\"\n\nEndorsements on his official website, including from retired Gen. Wesley Clark and former Sen. John Kerry, noted his military experience.\n\nWalz was deployed between 2003 and 2004 to Europe to support Operation Enduring Freedom, but was never deployed to Afghanistan, where the operation occurred.\n\nCriticism prompts Walz response\n\nIn 2006, the Walz campaign's description of his service drew pushback in separate letters to the editors.\n\nOne letter to his local paper said the Walz campaign's phrasing suggested service in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n\"It strongly suggests that he fought in Iraq or Afghanistan, but does not say which country,\" read the letter archived online here from July 2006. \"Because the information is not classified, Walz can tell the voters where he deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan and his BOG (boots on the ground) dates. If Walz did not deploy downrange, he should say so.\"\n\nThe letter caused a string of letters in support of Walz.\n\n\"I was wondering when the Republicans would start 'swift boating' Tim Walz,\" read one. \"Tim Walz has never lied about his service. I have heard him speak several times, and he always explains that the battalion he led was sent to Italy during Operation Enduring Freedom to provide support to the U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan.\"\n\nWalz himself personally responded.\n\n\"On Saturday The Free Press printed a letter which implied I embellished my military record. The details of my record can be easily found in numerous articles by The Free Press and other newspapers. Therefore, I must assume that the letter is meant to slander my good name,\" wrote Walz.\n\n\"For the record, I served 24 years in the Army National Guard and retired as a command sergeant major in May of 2005. I served in three NATO training missions to the Arctic and deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, serving in Italy in 2003-2004,\" he said.\n\n\"Using innuendo to defame a candidate's character has no place in this debate,\" he added. \"This nation must do better because we have too many important issues facing us to do anything less.\"\n\nOne person who wrote a letter supporting Walz was Sgt. Ryan Marti, a former member of Walz's battery who was deployed in Iraq at the time. Marti said members of his unit were extremely supportive and glad to see Walz run for Congress.\n\n\"In 2003, we were stationed in Italy at the beginning of the Iraq invasion,\" Marti told CNN. \"He'd been serving since I think he was 17 when he joined up. ... An opportunity that he never planned for came up to do something bigger. No one in the unit felt bad about this. I mean, a lot of us were extremely happy, and a lot of the teachers at school were happy.\"\n\nWalz accurately described his service in an interview that year with the Minneapolis-St. Paul City Pages in June 2006.\n\n\"I did 10 months with Operation Enduring Freedom, where, by luck of the draw, I served in Italy. It was originally Turkey or Iraq and then they changed it to Enduring Freedom and I said, 'That's Afghanistan.' But they said, 'You guys are going to do the supply lines between Turkey and England.' We provided total base security and the training for soldiers coming in,\" he said.\n\nIn November 2006, the same allegation was leveled at Walz.\n\n\"Through artful omission, Walz is leaving the impression that he served in the combat zones of the current conflict,\" read another letter to the editor in a local paper in November 2006. \"The truth is that he served in Italy. There is a significant difference between Walz' garrison service in Italy and the extreme danger young men and women are facing in the combat zones of Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\n\nWalz again responded.\n\n\"I am writing in response to Tom Hagen's lies about my service record,\" Walz wrote at the time. \"My biography on my official campaign website simply states that 'prior to retiring, Walz served overseas with his battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.'\"\n\n\"From this, Mr. Hagen makes the ridiculous claim that I am misleading voters that I served in combat in Iraq. After completing 20 years of service in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for an additional four years following Sept. 11 and retired the year before my battalion was deployed to Iraq in order to run for Congress,\" he added.\n\n\"I'm proud of the 24 years I served our country in the Army National Guard. There's a code of honor among those who've served, and normally this type of partisan political attack comes only from one who's never worn a uniform,\" he added. \"Mr. Hagen, if you were confused about my service, you could have checked my Web site, or simply had the decency to call and ask me. When you dishonor a veteran, you dishonor all soldiers and veterans. You owe an apology to all those who serve honorably.\"\n\nCNN's Danya Gainor and Allison Gordon contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Tim Walz, the current vice president pick for 2024 Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris, has been aware of stolen valor accusations going back to 2006, according to a report from CNN.\n\nWhile Walz's service in the U.S. National Guard remains undisputed, his use of the rank \"retired Command Sergeant Major\" has sparked accusations of stolen valor as well as his claims to have carried weapons \"in war,\" even though he never served in war or a combat zone. As Breitbart News reported, Walz \"listed on his official biography a higher military rank than the one he ultimately retired with, drawing criticism from some veterans\":\n\nWalz served in the Minnesota Army National Guard and retired at the rank of master sergeant, or an E-8. However, on his official website bio, he lists a higher rank that he served at for a short period that ultimately was rescinded, as he did not complete all the requirements to serve at that rank. However, his bio implies that he retired at the rank of command sergeant major, or an E-9.\n\nAfter reports surfaced questioning his use of rank, the Kamala Harris campaign altered its official website's biography of Walz by removing its reference to him as a \"retired command sergeant major\" and only noting that he once served at the command sergeant major rank.\n\nAccording to CNN, Walz encountered criticisms of his service characterizations going all the way back to 2006 during his run for U.S. Congress, which he denied at the time. Per the report:\n\nThat year, multiple letters to his local paper in Mankato, Minnesota, accused him of making misleading statements about his service, including whether he had served in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nWalz found the accusations serious enough that he personally responded to them both.\n\nAt issue were a selection of political ads and statements on Walz's website describing his overseas military service. While they described Walz as having served overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, they neglected to specify that he did so while serving in Italy, not Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the statements and ads painted a confusing picture of Walz's service, he did say in other interviews at the time he was posted to Italy instead of Afghanistan \"by the lack of the draw.\" In other interviews, Walz said that he had been deployed to Italy \"in support of\" Operation Enduring Freedom - the war in Afghanistan. His 2006 campaign biography also read, \"Prior to retiring, Walz served overseas with his battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. A TV advertisement at the time also called Walz \"the soldier who served for two decades but ready when they attacked\" that showed an image of the Twin Towers burning on the front page of a newspaper. The ad also said he was \"command sergeant major, retiring four years late after a tour supporting the war in Afghanistan.\"\n\nAt the time, some of the ads drew scrutiny and several letters were sent to the editors at his local paper saying that Walz had been phrasing his service in a way to suggest he set foot in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n\"It strongly suggests that he fought in Iraq or Afghanistan, but does not say which country,\" read the letter archived letter from 2006. \"Because the information is not classified, Walz can tell the voters where he deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan and his BOG (boots on the ground) dates. If Walz did not deploy downrange, he should say so.\"\n\nOther letters were written in support of Walz.\n\n\"I was wondering when the Republicans would start 'swift boating' Tim Walz,\" read one. \"Tim Walz has never lied about his service. I have heard him speak several times, and he always explains that the battalion he led was sent to Italy during Operation Enduring Freedom to provide support to the U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe accusations were intense enough that Walz himself had to respond.\n\n\"On Saturday The Free Press printed a letter which implied I embellished my military record. The details of my record can be easily found in numerous articles by The Free Press and other newspapers. Therefore, I must assume that the letter is meant to slander my good name,\" wrote Walz. \"For the record, I served 24 years in the Army National Guard and retired as a command sergeant major in May of 2005. I served in three NATO training missions to the Arctic and deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, serving in Italy in 2003-2004.\"\n\n\"Using innuendo to defame a candidate's character has no place in this debate,\" he added. \"This nation must do better because we have too many important issues facing us to do anything less.\"\n\nThe accusation surfaced again in November 2006, which he also denied. At least one former service member under Walz's leadership, Sgt. Ryan Marti, came to his defense.\n\nA viral video, which the Kamala HQ account on X originally shared on Wednesday, featured Walz touting gun control before saying he carried a weapon in war:\n\nI spent 25 years in the Army, and I hunt ... I've been voting for common-sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can do CDC research ... We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at. [Emphasis added]\n\nThe Kamala HQ account repeated his claim in the post sharing the clip.\n\nA subsequent report from the Washington Free Beacon on Wednesday also claimed that Walz had previously presented himself as a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom. Per Breitbart News:\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), who is facing accusations of stolen valor, allegedly falsely claimed in a previous press release that he was a veteran of Afghanistan.\n\nIn a 2006 press release issued by his campaign, Walz was described as being a \"veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom.\"\n\nThe war in Afghanistan, which began on October 7, 2001, was called Operation Enduring Freedom, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command website.

Tim Walz's service in the Army National Guard on Wednesday in response to Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance accusing him of committing an act of \"stolen valor.\"\n\nVance, who served as a combat correspondent in the Marine Corps., criticized Walz on Wednesday for allegedly leaving his battalion upon learning of its deployment to Iraq in 2005. Jean-Pierre told a reporter that Walz bravely served in the National Guard for 24 years without addressing his avoidance of a deployment.\n\n\"Today, Sen. J.D. Vance has accused Gov. Walz of stolen valor, and obviously military service is something that is deeply personal to the president given the service of his son. I'm curious, how is he reacting to these statements?\" a reporter asked Jean-Pierre.\n\n\"Look, any statements, attacks or comments, I would have to refer you to the campaign,\" Jean-Pierre replied. \"I think when I was answering your colleague['s] question earlier about Gov. Walz, I laid out and you've all seen his bio, right? This is someone who enlisted at 17 years old to serve this country, he was part of the Army National Guard for 24 years. This is someone who [was] a high school teacher, a high school coach as well, who grew up in a small town in the Midwest. And so I think his bio speaks for itself, who he is speaks for itself, his record speaks for itself, and I'm just not going to say anything beyond that.\"\n\nRetired Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, two veterans who say they served in Walz's battalion, wrote a letter in 2018 accusing the Minnesota governor of \"betraying his country\" by allowing the remainder of the battalion to be deployed to Iraq without him, according to the New York Post. (RELATED: Harris' VP Pick Said It Was 'Completely Unacceptable' For Trump To Bar Transgender People From Military)\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" Behrends and Herr wrote, according to the NYP.\n\nVance accused Walz on Wednesday of shamefully abandoning his battalion and \"lying\" about fighting in combat. Vice President Kamala Harris' headquarters posted footage of Walz saying civilians should not own the weapons he carried in war.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through and to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" Vance said during a Wednesday press conference. \"I also think it's dishonest ... He said we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on the streets. Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage.\"\n\nVance enlisted in the Marine Corps. in 2003 and was deployed to Iraq in the latter part of 2005, according to an excerpt from his 2016 bestselling memoir, \"Hillbilly Elegy.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Vance accused Kamala Harris' running mate of \"stolen valor\" for claiming in a recently resurfaced 2018 clip that he carried \"weapons of war\" in war.\n\n\"Walz did make a comment speaking to a group, he's done it a couple of times, where he has used language that has suggested that he carried weapons in a fighting situation,\" Foreman told CNN host Brianna Keilar.\n\n\"I know from coming from a military family there is a difference between being in a combat area, being involved at a time of war, and actually being in a position where people are shooting at you,\" he added.\n\n\"There is no evidence that at any time Governor Walz was in a position of being shot at, and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest he was, so that is absolutely false.\"\n\nKeilar commented: \"The quote was, 'We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at,' and certainly for someone who wasn't familiar with their record, they might draw a different conclusion.\"\n\nVets Group Calls BS on GOP Attacks of Tim Walz's Military Service\n\nWalz enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17 and served for 24 years before leaving to run for Congress. He retired just before his unit deployed to the Iraq War in 2005. That same year, Vance went to Iraq as a military journalist, but did not go into combat, according to the Guardian.\n\nVance, 40, a former marine, attacked Walz the day after he was unveiled as Harris's number two, saying: \"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone?\"\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nIn his fact check, CNN's Foreman said there was \"no evidence\" to back Vance's assertion that Walz ducked out of his deployment as he left the guard two months before his unit got orders to go to Iraq.\n\nIn 2018, Walz reportedly told Minnesota Public Radio: \"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that. I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign released a statement defending Walz's record, saying: \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\n\n\"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nThe targeting of Walz's military service has raised the specter of the GOP \"swift boat\" attacks on John Kerry over his service in Vietnam that was credited with harming his losing 2004 presidential campaign against George W. Bush, who did not serve.\n\nThe operative credited with masterminding the attacks, Chris LaCivita, is now one of Donald Trump's top advisers.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service,\" Vance said on Tuesday during a public appearance, making the latest punch in the veep beef.\n\nHe then slighted Walz, saying that unlike him, he remained faithful to his fellow troops while Walz on the other hand dipped out of his duties.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country, you know what he did, he dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,\" Vance suggested. \"I think it's shameful.\"\n\nThe tussle between the two popped off after Walz joked that he'd be more than happy to take Vance on in a debate, under one condition.\n\n\"I've gotta tell you, I can't wait to debate the guy -- that is, if he's willing to get off the couch and show up,\" Walz said during a Kamala Harris rally on Tuesday. His joke was in reference to a now-debunked rumor that Vance once had sexual relations with a couch.\n\nVance's remarks about Walz leaving the army stems from a slew of accusations from veterans, who claimed Walz has embellished his military background and in reality abandoned his National Guard battalion. Some vets also said he isn't telling the truth about serving in combat, adding that he retired from his service before he was sent to Iraq with his team of soldiers.\n\nFormer Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr made the allegations in a 2018 Facebook post.\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" they wrote at the time.\n\nEither way, Walz has been recognized for serving 24 years in the National Guard and is the longest-serving soldier in Congress history, while Vance did press relations for the Marines in Iraq (as opposed to combat duty).", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheWrap"}, "authors": [{"uri": "raquel_rocky_harris@thewrap.com", "name": "Raquel Rocky Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-commissioned officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Untitled-design-3-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-16", "textStart": 1930, "textEnd": 1944}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks.\n\n\"We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nWhile Mr Walz would have carried a gun during his deployments, he does not appear to have ever seen active combat.\n\nIn a 2018 interview, he conceded: \"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did.\"\n\nHowever, his use of the phrase \"in war\" triggered a fierce backlash, with fellow service members accusing Mr Walz of \"abandoning\" his US Army national guard unit by retiring shortly before it deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\n\"The big frustration was that he let his troops down,\" Doug Julin, a retired soldier who worked with Mr Walz, told the Washington Post.\n\nThe Harris campaign told the newspaper that Mr Walz carried, fired and trained others on how to use \"weapons of war innumerable times\", but declined to address why he claimed to have done so in war.\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends claimed Mr Walz was fabricating his record to advance his \"political career\".\n\nMr Walz has not responded to the recent attacks, but has previously said of Mr Behrends's comments: \"I don't know if Tom just disagrees with my politics or whatever, but my record speaks for itself.\"\n\nMr Behrends also took issue with Mr Walz describing himself as a command sergeant major in campaign promotional material despite quitting before serving the full period required to officially retire at the rank.\n\nMr Walz earned the promotion - one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier - in September 2004 but retired in May 2005.\n\nDonald Trump's running mate JD Vance, himself a military veteran, accused Mr Walz of \"stolen valour\".\n\nMr Vance, an Ohio senator, said: \"When the US Marine Corps asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that's shameful.\"\n\nHowever, another retired command sergeant major who served with Mr Walz said there was no firm indication that the unit would be deployed to Iraq before his departure.\n\n\"There were lots of rumours, and we didn't know where we were going until... early summer, I believe,\" Joseph Eustice told ABC News.\n\nAccording to national guard records, Mr Walz's battalion was alerted about deployment in July 2005, two months after he retired and around five months before he filed paperwork to run for Congress. The battalion deployed in 2006.\n\nThere is no evidence that Mr Walz left to avoid a wartime deployment, and experts suggest his retirement would have to have been approved by his commander.\n\nMr Eustice said he remembered Mr Walz struggling with the timing of his run for office, weighing up his desire to serve in Congress with his wish to avoid asking for a deferment to do so.\n\n\"He had a window of time. He had to decide. And in his [time spent] deciding, we were not on notice to be deployed,\" he said.\n\nMr Walz has also been accused of being misleading about his involvement in Operation Enduring Freedom, a US military operation centred on Afghanistan.\n\nPhotographs have emerged of Mr Walz, a critic of President George Bush's handling of the Iraq war, holding a \"Operation Enduring Freedom veterans for John Kerry\" poster during the Democrat's 2004 presidential run.\n\nWhile Mr Walz was deployed between 2003 and 2004 to Norway and Italy in support of the operation, he was never deployed to Afghanistan.\n\nFootage has since emerged of veterans of the operation confronting Mr Walz's political staff in 2009 and suggesting his description of his record gave the false impression he had served in Afghanistan.\n\nThe Trump campaign has relentlessly attacked Mr Walz over his military record in the last few days amid a shift in the polls which has seen the former president's lead narrow in several battleground states.\n\nChris LaCivita, a senior Trump adviser, who led an effort to aggressively attack Mr Kerry's military record in the 2004 election to great effect, said Mr Walz's record would be vigorously scrutinised.\n\n\"Nothing regarding his lies has been weaponised in a political sense. That's about to change,\" Mr LaCivita told Politico.\n\nHowever, the strategy carries risks for Republicans given Trump's own Vietnam-era military deferment.\n\nSome GOP strategists also believe the campaign should expend their efforts attacking Ms Harris' governing record rather than focusing on Mr Walz, a relative unknown to the American public.\n\nLeading Democrats have hit back at the attacks on Mr Walz. Mark Kelly, an Arizona senator and combat veteran, said: \"Don't become Donald Trump. He calls veterans suckers and losers and that is beneath those of us who have actually served.\"\n\nPete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary, said the GOP attacks were \"strategic\".\n\n\"Team Trump needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rozina_sabur@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Rozina Sabur", "type": "author",

Walz, who served in the Army National Guard for 24 years, retired just two months before his unit received deployment orders to Iraq. The Harris campaign hopes his military background will appeal to voters, while Republicans seek to portray him as an out-of-touch liberal.\n\nAt a Michigan campaign stop, Vance accused Walz of abandoning his unit.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\" Vance said.\n\nRelated Story: What Polling Shows About Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' New Running\n\nWalz's retirement in May 2005 coincided with his congressional campaign launch. In a 2009 interview, he explained that he left the Guard to focus on his congressional run, citing the Hatch Act, which limits political activities for federal employees.\n\nThe Harris campaign emphasized Walz's extensive service, while the White House defended his record. This is not the first time Walz's military record has faced scrutiny, as similar criticisms arose during his gubernatorial campaigns.\n\n\"This is someone who enlisted at 17 years old to serve his country. He was part of the Army National Guard for 24 years. This is someone who was a high school teacher, right?\" said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. \"A high school coach as well, who grew up in a small town in the Midwest, and so I think his bio speaks for itself, who he is speaks for himself, his record speaks for itself, and I'm just not going to say anything beyond that.\"", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anthony_w_haddad@gvwire.com", "name": "Anthony W.

Vance Slams 'shameful' Tim Walz For 'abandoning' His Minnesota National Guard Unit Before They Deployed To Iraq - Ny Breaking News", "body": "Donald Trump's running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, criticized Kamala Harris's pick for vice president on Wednesday amid reports that Gov. Tim Walz has canceled his deployment to Iraq with the Minnesota National Guard.\n\nVance, who served in the U.S. Marines in Iraq, said it was \"disgraceful\" when Walz retired in 2005, just as his battalion was preparing for war.\n\n\"I mean, your job as a senior ensar in a unit is to keep your people safe. That's not a job you can just walk away from,\" Vance told DailyMail.com during an exclusive interview aboard his campaign plane, nicknamed Trump Force Two.\n\n\"So if he abandoned his troops before they went to Iraq or wherever ... absolutely outrageous.\"\n\nWalz, the governor of Minnesota, was named by Harris as her running mate on Tuesday.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz is accused of skipping his National Guard unit just before it was deployed to Iraq in 2005 to launch his political career\n\nLater that day, he appeared next to her at a campaign rally in Philadelphia.\n\nBut soon reports emerged of anger among his former comrades in arms, who accused him of \"betraying\" his country as they prepared for deployment.\n\nRetired Minnesota National Guard Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends accused Walz of \"embellishing\" his record and abandoning his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress.\n\n\"In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which also noted the position in which he was serving, to prepare for mobilization to active duty for a deployment to Iraq,\" he wrote on Facebook in 2018.\n\n'On May 16, 2005, he resigned, betraying his country. He left the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its soldiers behind, without their top noncommissioned officer, as the battalion prepared for war.'\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Vance was en route to Michigan for a campaign rally, just hours before Harris was scheduled to arrive at the same location.\n\nHe said his job was to remain \"sharply focused\" on examining her failed policies on immigration, energy and manufacturing.\n\nHowever, he added that he was surprised that the Harris campaign had not investigated Walz's military record and accused him of lying to make a political point.\n\nDailyMail.com travels with Trump's running mate JD Vance and his wife Usha aboard Trump Force Two\n\nJD Vance served six years in the United States Marines, including six months in Iraq.\n\nVance added that he was surprised that the Harris campaign had not checked Walz's military record and accused him of lying to make a political point. Walz is pictured at right while serving in the U.S. Army National Guard in 1992\n\n\"There was a clip that the Kamala campaign put out of him making an argument for gun control,\" Vance said. \"He said, 'Look, you shouldn't be carrying the weapons that I carried in the war.'\"\n\n'And I, I think to myself, well, when did you go to war? What weapon did you carry in the war, Tim, because apparently you skipped your unit before they went to Iraq.\n\n\"I know he hasn't been to a war zone, so why is he lying to make a political point?\"\n\nVance, who grew up in Ohio, is seen by the Trump campaign as a key figure in breaking down the Democrats' so-called \"blue wall\" in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Wednesday he will first be in Shelby Township, Michigan, and at 2 p.m. in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nThe aim is to keep the pressure on Harris, who should be in both places a few hours later.", "source": {"uri": "nybreaking.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NY Breaking News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

JD Vance slammed CNN after anchor Brianna Keilar suggested he embellished his military service as the GOP hopeful attacks his Democratic rival Tim Walz.\n\nSen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, fired back at CNN after an anchor suggested he embellished his own military service as the Republican vice presidential nominee hammered his Democratic rival over his record.\n\nVance, who served as a U.S. Marine in Iraq, has taken aim at Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as questions have been swirling over how he represented his military service since he was tapped by Vice President Harris as her running mate.\n\nBut, according to CNN's Brianna Keilar, Vance \"may be an imperfect messenger\" on the issue.\n\n\"Because we have, as you introduced him, as a combat correspondent, which is what [Vance's] title was,\" Keilar told her CNN colleague Dana Bash Thursday. \"But when you dig a little deeper into that, he was a public affairs specialist, someone who did not see combat, which certainly the title 'combat correspondent,' kind of gives you a different impression. So he may be the imperfect messenger on that.\"\n\nJD VANCE ACCUSES TIM WALZ OF 'LYING' ABOUT MILITARY SERVICE: 'STOLEN VALOR GARBAGE'\n\nVance knocked Keilar and CNN on social media.\n\n\"Brianna this is disgusting, and you and your entire network should be ashamed of yourselves,\" Vance wrote on X. \"When I got the call to go to Iraq, I went. Tim Walz said he carried a gun in a war. Did he? No. It was a lie.\"\n\nVance told reporters Wednesday, \"I served in a combat zone. I never said that I saw a firefight myself, but I've always told the truth about my Marine Corps service. That's the difference.\"\n\nCNN did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\n\nCritics have put a spotlight on an old video incidentally shared by the Harris campaign of Walz pushing for gun control, telling voters, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\nRetired Command Sgt. Maj. Thomas Behrends, who said he was a member of Walz's battalion, blasted the governor's comments.\n\n\"To most people, that would mean that he was actually in combat, carrying a weapon in a combat zone and getting combat pay and in a dangerous and hostile environment where he is getting shot at,\" Behrends told the 'Ingraham Angle' on Wednesday.\n\nA CNN correspondent even fact-checked Walz on Wednesday, declaring that \"there is no evidence\" he carried weapons in combat as the vice presidential candidate appeared to previously imply.\n\nCNN FACT-CHECKS TIM WALZ ABOUT 'ABSOLUTELY FALSE' CLAIM HE CARRIED WEAPONS 'IN WAR'\n\nWalz was never in an active war zone. He deployed with the Minnesota National Guard to Italy on Aug. 3, 2003, to support Operation Enduring Freedom, according to the Minnesota Guard. The battalion supported security missions at various locations in Europe and Turkey, according to the Guard, and Walz was stationed in Vicenza, Italy, until returning to Minnesota in 2004. He did not deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nVance's opponent has been at the center of a brewing controversy since he joined the Democratic ticket. Walz, who served in the Minnesota National Guard for 24 years, repeatedly referred to himself as a \"retired command sergeant major,\" which is not accurate. According to the Minnesota National Guard, while Walz served as command sergeant major, \"He retired as a Master Sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the Harris campaign changed the language in Walz's bio on their website after the dust-up. The biography initially said Walz was a \"retired Command Sergeant Major,\" but was then updated to say he \"served as a command sergeant major.\"\n\nMEDIA HYPES 'FOLKSY' TIM WALZ, SAYS PROGRESSIVE GOVERNOR BRINGS 'CENTRIST MIDWESTERNER' PERSONA TO DEM TICKET\n\nWalz has also faced criticism over the timing of his retirement from military service over allegations that he did so earlier than he planned to dodge deployment to Iraq.\n\nTom Schilling, a veteran who served in the same battalion as Walz, said he \"ditched\" his soldiers before they were deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\n\"We all did what we were supposed to do, we did the right thing,\" Schilling said on Fox News' \"Jesse Watters Primetime\" Wednesday. \"It's dishonorable what he did. He left somebody else up to take over his spot. He just ditched us.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Harris campaign released a statement saying, \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nFox News' Alexa Moutevelis, Jennifer Griffin and Anders Hagstrom contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"},

Tim Walz is facing scrutiny over his military service record, with critics, including his Republican rival Sen. JD Vance, accusing Walz of falsely suggesting he saw combat during his time as an Army reservist.\n\nIt's not the first time Walz has encountered such criticism.\n\nA CNN KFile review reveals that similar accusations were made in 2006, during Walz's first run for Congress. That year, multiple letters to his local paper in Mankato, Minnesota, accused him of making misleading statements about his service, including whether he had served in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nWalz found the accusations serious enough that he personally responded to them both.\n\nAt issue were a selection of political ads and statements on Walz's website describing his overseas military service. While they described Walz as having served overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, they neglected to specify that he did so while serving in Italy, not Afghanistan.\n\nWalz was more specific in other statements and interviews with the media from 2006, in which he did say that, \"by luck of the draw,\" he was posted to Italy, and not Afghanistan.\n\nRecent scrutiny of Walz's service record renewed after the Harris campaign posted a video of Walz speaking about his decision to change his position and support an assault weapons ban following the 2018 Parkland shooting. In the video, Walz states, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\nHow Walz described his service\n\nIn 2006, Walz heavily leaned into his brand as a soldier, focusing on his military service and teaching career to portray him as an everyman. But Walz never explicitly said he faced combat.\n\nWalz's official 2006 campaign biography read, \"Prior to retiring, Walz served overseas with his battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" and his website's front page prominently featured him in military uniform.\n\nOne TV advertisement called Walz \"the soldier who served for two decades but ready when they attacked,\" with an image of the Twin Towers burning on the front page of a newspaper.\n\nThe ad said he was a \"command sergeant major, retiring four years late after a tour supporting the war in Afghanistan,\" over an image of a newspaper article headline reading, \"Troops welcomed home,\" with a photo of Walz saluting on his local paper the New Ulm Journal.\n\nAnother ad attacked his opponent for not voting for pay increases for soldiers and voting to raise the salary of members of Congress.\n\n\"When we deployed many in my unit took a pay cut,\" Walz said in another ad. \"He gives himself a pay raise, but he tells the soldiers no.\"\n\nEndorsements on his official website, including from retired Gen. Wesley Clark and former Sen. John Kerry, noted his military experience.\n\nWalz was deployed between 2003 and 2004 to Europe to support Operation Enduring Freedom, but was never deployed to Afghanistan, where the operation occurred.\n\nCriticism prompts Walz response\n\nIn 2006, the Walz campaign's description of his service drew pushback in separate letters to the editors.\n\nOne letter to his local paper said the Walz campaign's phrasing suggested service in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n\"It strongly suggests that he fought in Iraq or Afghanistan, but does not say which country,\" read the letter archived online here from July 2006. \"Because the information is not classified, Walz can tell the voters where he deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan and his BOG (boots on the ground) dates. If Walz did not deploy downrange, he should say so.\"\n\nThe letter caused a string of letters in support of Walz.\n\n\"I was wondering when the Republicans would start 'swift boating' Tim Walz,\" read one. \"Tim Walz has never lied about his service. I have heard him speak several times, and he always explains that the battalion he led was sent to Italy during Operation Enduring Freedom to provide support to the U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan.\"\n\nWalz himself personally responded.\n\n\"On Saturday The Free Press printed a letter which implied I embellished my military record. The details of my record can be easily found in numerous articles by The Free Press and other newspapers. Therefore, I must assume that the letter is meant to slander my good name,\" wrote Walz.\n\n\"For the record, I served 24 years in the Army National Guard and retired as a command sergeant major in May of 2005. I served in three NATO training missions to the Arctic and deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, serving in Italy in 2003-2004,\" he said.\n\n\"Using innuendo to defame a candidate's character has no place in this debate,\" he added. \"This nation must do better because we have too many important issues facing us to do anything less.\"\n\nOne person who wrote a letter supporting Walz was Sgt. Ryan Marti, a former member of Walz's battery who was deployed in Iraq at the time. Marti said members of his unit were extremely supportive and glad to see Walz run for Congress.\n\n\"In 2003, we were stationed in Italy at the beginning of the Iraq invasion,\" Marti told CNN. \"He'd been serving since I think he was 17 when he joined up. ... An opportunity that he never planned for came up to do something bigger. No one in the unit felt bad about this. I mean, a lot of us were extremely happy, and a lot of the teachers at school were happy.\"\n\nWalz accurately described his service in an interview that year with the Minneapolis-St. Paul City Pages in June 2006.\n\n\"I did 10 months with Operation Enduring Freedom, where, by luck of the draw, I served in Italy. It was originally Turkey or Iraq and then they changed it to Enduring Freedom and I said, 'That's Afghanistan.' But they said, 'You guys are going to do the supply lines between Turkey and England.' We provided total base security and the training for soldiers coming in,\" he said.\n\nIn November 2006, the same allegation was leveled at Walz.\n\n\"Through artful omission, Walz is leaving the impression that he served in the combat zones of the current conflict,\" read another letter to the editor in a local paper in November 2006. \"The truth is that he served in Italy. There is a significant difference between Walz' garrison service in Italy and the extreme danger young men and women are facing in the combat zones of Iraq and Afghanistan.\"\n\nWalz again responded.\n\n\"I am writing in response to Tom Hagen's lies about my service record,\" Walz wrote at the time. \"My biography on my official campaign website simply states that 'prior to retiring, Walz served overseas with his battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.'\"\n\n\"From this, Mr. Hagen makes the ridiculous claim that I am misleading voters that I served in combat in Iraq. After completing 20 years of service in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for an additional four years following Sept. 11 and retired the year before my battalion was deployed to Iraq in order to run for Congress,\" he added.\n\n\"I'm proud of the 24 years I served our country in the Army National Guard. There's a code of honor among those who've served, and normally this type of partisan political attack comes only from one who's never worn a uniform,\" he added. \"Mr. Hagen, if you were confused about my service, you could have checked my Web site, or simply had the decency to call and ask me. When you dishonor a veteran, you dishonor all soldiers and veterans. You owe an apology to all those who serve honorably.\"\n\nCNN's Danya Gainor and Allison Gordon contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"},

We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" Walz, 60, can be heard saying.\n\nCritics were quick to point out that Walz, who retired from the National Guard in 2005, never actually served in a combat zone.\n\nCNN, of all places, even started discussing Walz's claims on air pointing out the mischaracterization of his service on multiple occasions:\n\nOver at the Federalist, Matt Beebe dug into into the Walz stolen valor controversy and found much deeper problems with the governor's story that go beyond merely inflating his service record:\n\nThe commonly accepted definition of stolen valor includes misrepresenting the scope of one's military service. For his part, the man who replaced Walz and eventually deployed to Iraq in his place -- Command Sgt. Maj. Tom Behrends -- claimed it is absolutely reflective of his character and integrity, saying, \"The public needs to know how pathetic his leadership was as a National Guardsman.\"\n\nBehrends linked Walz's abrupt retirement to the fact that the unit had received a warning order to deploy only a few months before Walz's departure. \"He abandoned us. What the hell kind of leader does that? As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq he turned and ran the other way and hung his hat up and quit,\" Behrends said.\n\nAs for Walz's retirement from the National Guard and controversy over his rank, the recordkeeping doesn't line up with the governor's repeated statements:\n\nHe was conditionally promoted to command sergeant major during this time, which placed him at risk of having the promotion revoked if he failed to complete his minimum length of service obligation and pass the Army's Sergeant Major Course. He elected to retire abruptly after about four years of total additional service and failed to complete his obligation. In September 2005, the paperwork caught up with him, and his promotion was officially rescinded.\n\nThe conditional promotion, however, immediately confers all the benefits and privileges of the higher rank but lays out certain obligations that the service member must promise to fulfill or his promotion will be rescinded. This is what happened in the case of Walz's short-lived promotion to command sergeant major. He wasn't given a temporary privilege that expired when he left the service, but he was retroactively demoted in accordance with the agreement he signed and failed to live up to. His paperwork shows he retired as a master sergeant.\n\nDigging deeper into the NGB Form 22, Report of Separation and Record of Service for Walz, his date of rank for his promotion to command sergeant major (E9) was April 1, 2005. His date of discharge was May 16, 2005. Only 46 days had elapsed. Given the National Guard is a part-time job, one would be forgiven for wondering if this was even enough time to have new insignia sewn on all his uniforms. The official government paperwork marking his demotion was processed approximately four months later on Sept. 10.\n\nYet Tim Walz campaigned and marketed himself as a \"retired\" command sergeant major until the backlash caused him to fine-tune his messaging: In most of his literature now he's careful to refer to himself as a \"former\" command sergeant major. In some places, he uses an \"achieved the rank of\" modifier to provide a fig leaf of plausibility to his puffery. His official Minnesota biography still refers to him as \"Command Sergeant Major Walz.\" Presumably, most ordinary voters won't notice the sleight of hand, but one wonders why he doesn't just say retired master sergeant.\n\nIs it splitting hairs? Maybe, but when a politician constantly and repeatedly refers to their service and makes claims related to whether they served in combat or specific ranks they achieved, it's entirely within the purview of public interest to validate the veracity of those claims.\n\nIf your reasoning for pushing gun control is that you saw \"weapons of war\" on the battlefield that don't belong on America's streets, but that isn't true, is it worth pointing that out? Yes, it is, especially when false claims are being twisted to give someone like Walz some sort of moral high ground in the argument.\n\nIn many ways, Walz is simply a Minnesota version of Joe Biden.\n\nEverything he says is couched in a story that's emotionally related to himself or his past service or experience so you better damn well not question him. You also better not question his commitment to the military because he served \"in war,\" \"at war,\" or \"during a war\" or something. In reality, Walz went to Italy but never saw combat, according to his record.\n\nWalz is a quintessential blowhard like Joe Biden. His ego inflates his record and experience to gain the moral high ground in the room when in reality he falls apart under scrutiny.\n\nThe Harris campaign must have known about this but maybe brushed it off as a non-issue, and in the end, it may mean nothing to voters.\n\nOn the other hand, the last big-ticket Democrat to flagrantly use his military service was John Kerry, and that ended poorly.\n\nHere's JD Vance, at a press conference, something the Harris campaign is unfamiliar with, answering a direct question about Walz's attack:", "source": {"uri":

JD Vance, R-Ohio, accused Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Wednesday of quitting the Army National Guard two decades ago to avoid being deployed to Iraq and of exaggerating his service record to claim falsely that he had served in combat.\n\nBoth provocative charges amounted to some of the sharpest Republican attacks yet on the Minnesota governor, and appeared aimed at disrupting what has been a run of positive news coverage of the Democratic ticket since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the party's nominee.\n\nThe accusations by Vance, who served a four-year active duty enlistment in the Marine Corps, about Walz, whose career in the national guard spanned 24 years, also served to pit the military records of the two major party's vice-presidential candidates against each other.\n\nSpeaking at the police department in Shelby Township, Michigan, on Wednesday morning, Vance said Walz had effectively deserted his fellow soldiers to avoid serving in Iraq because he retired from the National Guard in May 2005, several months before his artillery unit received orders to deploy there.\n\n\"You abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq,\" Vance said.\n\nVance based his accusations on a Facebook post from 2018, and a paid letter to the editor to the West Central Tribune that same year in which the writers, Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, both retired command sergeant majors in the Minnesota National Guard, accused Walz of \"conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq.\"\n\nThe criticisms were first leveled by Behrends and Herr during Walz's first campaign for governor.\n\nBut Joseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the national guard who led the same battalion as Walz and served under him, recalled in an interview Wednesday that Walz's decision to run for Congress came months before the battalion received any official notice of deployment, though he said there had been rumors that it might be deployed.\n\nVance was on active duty with the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007 during the Iraq War.\n\nVance, who then went by the name James D. Hamel, was deployed to Iraq in 2005 and 2006 with the aircraft wing but did not serve as a front-line combatant.\n\nHis official military occupation, known as a combat correspondent, meant he was tasked with basic communication roles such as writing articles about the happenings in his unit.", "source": {"uri": "westhawaiitoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "West Hawaii Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Active duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelby_Township,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shelby Township, Michigan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_correspondent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War correspondent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_occupation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military occupation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.westhawaiitoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/og_image_logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-", "textStart": 1031, "textEnd": 1039}], "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Here Are The Examples.", "body": "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz served in the U.S. National Guard for 24 years. He even re-enlisted after 9/11 to serve once again. Yet the circumstances around his retirement - and the way he has presented his military service since retiring - have caused an uproar over whether he has misled about his service.\n\nHere are examples of Walz making a claim about his service that is not supported by the facts.\n\nHis Official Government Biography\n\nAs of this writing, Walz's biography on the Minnesota government's website says, \"After 24 years in the Army National Guard, Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005.\"\n\nWalz briefly held the position of command sergeant major as a conditional promotion, provided he adhered to several stipulations, including one that he serve a specific amount of time after that promotion, which Walz failed to do. Thus, his rank reverted back to what he was before that conditional promotion: Master sergeant, which is still rank E8 out E10 and a major accomplishment.\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard, for which Walz served, confirmed that at the time of his retirement in 2005, Walz was a master sergeant \"for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\"\n\nHis Official Vice Presidential Campaign Biography\n\nWalz's biography on Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign website originally said he was a \"retired command sergeant major,\" Politico reported. That bio now says he \"served as a command sergeant major.\"\n\nSaying He's A \"Retired Sergeant Major\" In An Interview\n\nDuring an interview in 2018 while running for governor of Minnesota, Walz said he was \"a retired sergeant major,\" even though he is a retired master sergeant.\n\nCalling Himself A \"Retired Command Sergeant Major\" In An Address To Troops\n\nIn 2009, then-Rep. Walz sent a farewell message to soldiers deploying to Iraq, and called himself a \"retired command sergeant major.\"\n\nTelling People He Carried Weapons \"In War\"\n\nWalz said in a video shared by Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign that he supports limits to the Second Amendment. In the clip shared online, he says, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war - that I carried in war - are the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\nWATCH BEN SHAPIRO'S 'SCAMALA: KAMALA HARRIS UNMASKED' ON DAILYWIRE+\n\nWalz, as a member of the military who specialized in artillery, would have experience with the weapons he is talking about, but he never carried them \"in war\" as he never saw combat. Even CNN correspondent Tom Foreman called out Walz's misleading statement, which would seem to indicate he had been in combat.\n\n\"Walz did make a comment, speaking to a group -- he's done it a couple of times, where he has used language that suggested that he carried weapons in a fighting situation,\" Foreman said on Wednesday, according to Fox News.\n\n\"There is a difference between being in a combat area, being involved in a time of war, and actually being in a position where people are shooting at you,\" Foreman said, adding that there \"is no evidence that at any time Governor Walz was in the position of being shot at, and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest that he was. So that is absolutely false when he said that about gun rights out there.\"\n\nCalling Himself An \"Enduring Freedom Veteran\" At A George. W. Bush Protest\n\nIn 2004, Walz organized a protest against then-President George W. Bush, The Washington Free Beacon reported. In a photo from that event, Walz can be seen holding a photo that says \"Enduring Freedom Veterans for Kerry.\" Operation Enduring Freedom is a reference to the War in Afghanistan that began after the September, 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S.\n\nBut Walz never went to Afghanistan - he was sent to Norway and Italy in roles supporting the Afghanistan War, yet the mention of OEF leads people to assume he was in Afghanistan, which he was not.\n\nIn 2009, an Iraq war veteran mentioned this photo to Walz staffers and used it to suggest Walz may have violated Stolen Valor laws.\n\nImplying He Served In Afghanistan In His First Campaign Announcement\n\nDuring his first campaign in 2006, in which he ran for congress, Walz's announcement indicated he was a \"veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" in another example of Walz implying he had been to Afghanistan.\n\nSaying He \"Deployed In Support Of Operation Enduring Freedom\" On C-SPAN\n\nDuring an appearance on C-SPAN in 2007, Walz claimed he \"deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" again implying he went to Afghanistan when he was actually in Italy.\n\nIn Josh Green's Articles Featuring Profiles Of Walz\n\nIn this example, it is unclear whether Walz is to blame for the misleading phrases, or the veteran Bloomberg reporter Josh Green. In a 2006 profile for the Atlantic, Green wrote that Walz left Minnesota \"to serve overseas in Operation Enduring Freedom,\" a clear implication that Walz went to Afghanistan.\n\nGreen also wrote that Walz was confronted by Bush staffers during his protest against the war, and said he had asked the Bush staffers if \"they really wanted to arrest a command sergeant major who'd just returned from fighting the war on terrorism.\"\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Green wrote for Bloomberg that Walz served \"in Iraq as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.\" Bloomberg has since stealth edited the line to say that Walz had served in Italy instead of Iraq. Green posted the correction on his X account.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Vance slammed Kamala Harris's V.P. pick on Wednesday amid reports that Gov. Tim Walz had skipped out on being deployed to Iraq with the Minnesota National Guard.\n\nVance, who served with the U.S. Marines in Iraq, said it was 'shameful' if Walz had retired in 2005 just as his battalion was preparing to go to war.\n\n'I mean, your job as a senior enlisted guy in a unit is to keep your people safe. That's not a job you can switch out of on a moment's notice,' Vance told DailyMail.com during an exclusive interview aboard his campaign plane, nicknamed Trump Force Two.\n\n'So if he abandoned his troops before they went to Iraq or wherever ... absolutely shameful.'\n\nWalz, the governor of Minnesota, was named by Harris as her running mate on Tuesday.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz is accused of skipping out on his National Guard unit just before it deployed to Iraq in 2005 to begin his political career\n\nHe appeared alongside her at a campaign rally in Philadelphia later that day.\n\nBut reports quickly resurfaced of anger among his former brothers in arms who accused him of 'betraying' his country just as they were preparing for deployment\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends of the Minnesota National Guard accused Walz of having 'embellished' his record and of having abandoned his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress.\n\n'In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq,' he wrote on Facebook in 2018.\n\n'On May 16th, 2005, he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.'\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Vance was on his way to Michigan for a campaign event hours before Harris was due to arrive in the same spot.\n\nHe said his role was to remain 'laser-focused' on scrutinizing her policy failures on immigration, energy and manufacturing.\n\nBut he added he was astonished that the Harris campaign had not checked out Walz's military record and accused him of lying to make a political point.\n\nDailyMail.com is traveling with Trump's running mate J.D.

Vance spent six years in U.S. Marines, including six months deployed to Iraq\n\nVance added he was astonished that the Harris campaign had not checked out Walz's military record and accused him of lying to make a political point. Walz is pictured right while serving with the U.S. Army National Guard in 1992\n\n'There was a clip the Kamala campaign posted about him where he's making a gun control argument,' ' said Vance. ' He said, Look, you should not be able to carry the weapons that I carried in war.\n\n'And I'm, I'm thinking to myself, well, when did you go to war?

While Walz did serve in the Minnesota National Guard, it has come to light that he bailed on his unit in the face of being deployed to Iraq, receiving a demotion in the process.\n\nREAD: A Tale of Two Veterans, What the Service of Walz and Vance Tell Us About the Men\n\nWalz's moment of truth came when his unit was ordered to deploy to Iraq. As Matt Funicello details, Walz had his enlistment cut short by asking for an early retirement. In the process, he violated his pledge to complete a training course and was administratively reduced to one rank.\n\nWhere Vance was the ultimate volunteer, choosing a service he knew would result in deployment to Iraq, Walz approached his enlistment to get benefits and improve his chances for professional advancement. When Vance was ordered to Iraq, he went. When Walz, the senior noncommissioned officer in his battalion, was ordered to Iraq, he quit and left his men high and dry.\n\nMen who served with Walz are already coming forward to express their discontent with his decision to skip out on the deployment. Here's just one example.\n\nWhile Walz's sudden decision to leave his men high and dry so he could go pursue a political career was bad enough, I wouldn't have described it as a scandal. That developed later when a video of the Minnesota governor emerged showing him stealing valor by claiming to have gone to war. Ironically, it was posted by the official Kamala Harris campaign account on social media.\n\nSEE: Tim Walz Goes Full-Metal Stolen Valor in Anti-Gun Rant\n\nWALZ: I'll take my kick in the butt from the NRA. I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt. And I gave the money back. And I'll tell you what I have been doing. I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\n\nThe immediate response from Harris-Walz supporters was to claim that was just a slip of the tongue. According to them, he was speaking off the cuff and was simply trying to refer to his general military service, not necessarily claiming to have gone to war (despite him saying just that).\n\nPerhaps that excuse may have flown if that was the end of it. That's not the end of it, though. A bombshell report from Jordan Schachtel dropped on Wednesday afternoon has blown this scandal wide open.\n\nGreen discusses a 2004 visit from former President George W. Bush to Gov. Walz's hometown, in which a protesting Walz (who was still serving in the military) told the reporter about him supposedly demanding to speak to the then commander in chief.\n\n\"Walz thought for a moment and asked the Bush staffers if they really wanted to arrest a command sergeant major who'd just returned from fighting the war on terrorism,\" Green writes.\n\nAs Schatchel notes in his piece, the first mention of Walz going to Iraq could have just been Joshua Green, the reporter who did the profile, making an assumption. That would be unusual given the editorial standards at play at such an outlet, but it is at least possible that Walz himself didn't tell Green that he served in Iraq.\n\nThat second mention, though? That one isn't explained away by assuming an overzealous reporter just got out over his skis. Green is clearly describing what Walz told him regarding his supposed denial of entry to a George W. Bush rally in 2004 (that claim also appears to be largely made up, but that's another story). There is no other logical explanation.\n\nFurther, Green, who now works for Bloomberg is still under the impression that Walz served in Iraq, making the same claim on the day the governor was made Harris' running mate. Again, the way this reads doesn't seem like a professional reporter just making an assumption. Green appears to have been told this by Walz himself.\n\nTo this day, Green remains under the false impression that Walz served and fought in the war. In a piece for Bloomberg on Tuesday, he wrote that Walz served \"in Iraq as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.\"\n\nIn marketing Walz as a veteran upstart politician, he created a false construct that involved heroism in the war in terror, when in reality, Tim Walz never fought in a war or anywhere near a war.\n\nThis scandal isn't going away, and from what I'm hearing, this is just the beginning of the revelations regarding Walz's career. I don't know if the Harris campaign didn't bother to vet him or if they were just this arrogant, but there's a lot more to come.\n\nOn that note, be sure to help support RedState as we continue to bring you the most up-to-date information on all of this.

JD Vance (R-OH) attacked the military record of Tim Walz during a press conference on Wednesday morning by accusing him of stolen valor.\n\nVance claimed that Walz \"abandoned\" his unit in the National Guard before it was deployed to Iraq while attacking the Democratic VP nominee for his apparent claims that he served in a war.\n\nWalz served in the National Guard in Nebraska and later Minnesota for 24 years reaching the rank of commander sergeant major and was deployed to Italy. He decided to leave the National Guard in 2005 to pursue a political career by running for Congress.\n\nMoreover, the Ohio senator went after Walz for claiming he served in a war while explaining his stance on gun control.\n\nIn a video posted by the Kamala Harris campaign, Walz says on the issue of gun control, \"I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nVance slammed Walz for never spending \"a day in a combat zone\" and that he would be \"ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\" Vance added:\n\nWell, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not. And if he wants to criticize me for getting an Ivy League education, I'm proud of the fact that my mama supported me. That I was able to make something of myself. I'd be ashamed if I was him. And I lied about my military service like he did.\n\nThe cruz of Vance's claim seems to be centered on comments Walz made -- in a video posted by the Kamala Harris campaign -- on the issue of gun control, \"I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nFollowing the press conference, CNN reporter Alayna Treene fact-checked Vance's claims against Walz.", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/POW-MIA", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/POW-MIA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/7_32_33-am.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Racist MAGA constituents have been attacking him for having an Indian wife and children, forcing him to essentially defend the non-whiteness of his spouse by highlighting her other qualities.\n\nMeanwhile, Vance is getting dragged by women across America for essentially telling them that if they choose not to have children that they're worthless-while also inadvertently insulting step-parents, adoptive parents and people who are struggling to become parents. He's catching flack for being a middle-class Ivy Leaguer who has tried to pass himself off as an all-American who came from humble beginnings.\n\nRelated Stories Old Audio Of Trump Praising Walz On George Floyd Protests Undermines GOP Claim He 'Let Rioters Burn Minneapolis' Kamala Harris Selecting Tim Walz Is A Big Win, But It Doesn't Mean Black People Can Take Our Eyes Off The Prize Democratic Nominee Kamala Harris Picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz As VP Running Mate\n\nThere's more. Some guy on the internet made a joke about him having sexual relations with a couch and now half of social media is clowning him for receiving \"sectional healing.\" On top of all that, the former Trump-hater-turned-Trump-humper has to back his racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, lying, observably unintelligent, criminally convicted felon of a running mate after every nonsensical attack he spits out of his anus-shaped mouth.\n\nSource: Stephen Maturen / Getty\n\nAll this as every new piece of insight we learn about Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, sounds something like: \"Tim Walz rescued a cat from a tree while bringing free lunch to school kids and helping an old lady cross the street while walking his two-dozen rescue dogs and filling in for Santa Clause during the holiday season.\"\n\nMaybe this is why Republicans are desperately reaching for legitimate reasons to attack the man. Trump and his campaign have already claimed ad nauseam that Walz will \"UNLEASH HELL ON EARTH\" by -- *checks notes* -- \"proposing his own carbon-free agenda, suggesting stricter emission standards for gas-powered cars, and embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote.\" (The horror, right?) Republicans (and Van Jones) have also claimed Harris, who is married to a Jewish man, Doug Emhoff, chose Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to appease antisemitic Democrats.\n\nThe new round of lies and weirdo stuff\n\nNow, Vance is out here attacking Walz on his 24-year military record, because, as Trump has long shown us, all of that pseudo-patriotic \"support the troops\" and \"honor our veterans\" rhetoric goes right out the window when it becomes politically inconvenient.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Wednesday that Vance accused Walz of quitting the Army National Guard after 24 years of service to avoid being deployed to Iraq and lying about being in combat. Neither are true.\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nMr. Vance based his accusations on a Facebook post from 2018, and a paid letter to the editor to The West Central Tribune that same year in which the writers, Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, both retired command sergeant majors in the Minnesota National Guard, accused Mr. Walz of \"conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq.\"\n\nThe criticisms were first leveled by Mr. Behrends and Mr. Herr during Mr. Walz's first campaign for governor.\n\nBut Joseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the national guard who led the same battalion as Mr. Walz and served under him, said in an interview on Wednesday that the governor was a dependable soldier and that the attacks by his fellow comrades were unfounded.\n\n\"He was as good a soldier as you'd find, and to have two former sergeant majors say that he wasn't, it's just not true,\" Mr. Eustice said, adding that he disagreed with Mr. Walz's politics and most likely would not vote for him in November even though they were friends.\n\nIt probably would have been more convenient for opponents of Walz if he had retired a few days, maybe a week before the deployment to Iraq. But the fact that he retired several months before his unit was even notified that it would be deployed indicates that his detractors were and still are stretching themselves into a star-spangled knot to find a legitimate attack against the 60-year-old. And they're failing miserably.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs, and as vice president of the United States, he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" said campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa.\n\nVance also thought he had Walz on the ropes after he came across a video clip Harris' campaign posted Tuesday, in which the governor told a crowd about support for gun control, saying that \"we can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\" Vance took it upon himself to interpret that comment as Walz claiming he was in combat, which he wasn't.\n\nMore from the Times:\n\n\"I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did,\" Mr. Vance said.\n\nMr. Walz was deployed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, but not in a combat zone.\n\n\"The governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" Mr. Moussa said. \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nIt's almost as if Vance has forgotten he is the running mate of an accused draft dodger who once said this about late combat veteran John McCain: \"He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.\"\n\nBut that aside, there was also yesterday. That's when Vance decided the best way forward was to make himself look like a broken toy soldier by trying to storm Air Force Two and get in Harris' face after his plane landed at Chippewa Valley Regional Airport in Wisconsin, where hers also had landed.\n\nBut surprise! Vice President Harris, already out in the community, wasn't there.\n\nAwkward.\n\nVance was caught on video charging up to the plane with his entourage of white men in suits who looked like they were trying to recreate the opening scene of Reservoir Dogs, standing close to the plane looking stupid for a while and then walking back to talk to reporters in a transparent effort to play off how ridiculous the awkward performance was.\n\n\"Hopefully it's gonna be my plane in a few months,\" he told the reporters.\n\n\"I also thought you guys might be lonely because the vice president doesn't answer questions from reporters,\" he continued. \"I hope that she has changed her mind because it would be good for the American people and I think it would be good for you all if she actually ran a real campaign instead of one from a basement with a teleprompter.\"\n\nAbort mission. Abort mission!\n\nIt's unclear what Vance was even talking about since Harris has been the one pressing for Trump to attend a Sept. 10 debate that he already agreed to when he thought was running against President Joe Biden. Trump is the one who had been ducking and dodging the debate before recently walking back his cowardly ultimatum that it be moderated by Fox News. (He still hasn't really committed to it though.) Trump is the one who got up on the stage at NABJ and thought launching racist attacks on Harris' ethnicity would serve as an alternative to answering the questions he was asked.\n\nAccording to the Independent, \"Harris and Walz are in fact touring several battleground states this week,\" while Vance \"is trailing his Democratic rivals with much smaller campaign events.\" If all Vance has up his sleeve are lies about Harris not talking to the media and desperate attacks on Walz's military record, well, he's going to continue to have a rough go of it.\n\nYeah -- good luck with all that.\n\nSEE MORE:\n\nDemocratic Nominee Kamala Harris Picks Minnesota Gov.

While Walz did leave the military before his unit was deployed, there is no hard evidence that he did so to avoid combat in Iraq.\n\nDuring an interview with CNN's Laura Coates on Thursday night, Julin said that Walz \"went around\" and \"above and beyond\" him to retire when he did, accusing the governor of using a \"backdoor process\" to leave the service.\n\n\"[Walz] did something wrong in service,\" Julin told Coates. \"He knew the policies and procedures and how we go to leadership and address issues ... He went around me when he should have addressed it with me.\"\n\n\"There's a possibility he realized I would have said, 'no, it's too late, you're going forward,'\" he added. \"He knew he was going forward. Had he gotten his orders yet? No, at that time he had not.\"\n\nJulin did not directly answer when asked by Coates how he felt about \"political talking points\" accusing Walz of \"stolen valor.\"\n\nNewsweek reached out for comment to the Harris/Walz campaign via email on Thursday night.\n\nWalz achieved the rank of command sergeant major in the Army National Guard before retiring after 24 years of service, having launched his political career around the same time. He went on to win a U.S. House seat in 2006, serving for six terms before winning the Minnesota governorship in 2018.\n\nVance served four years in the Marine Corps, leaving the military as a corporal in 2007 to attend Ohio State University. Neither man served in combat and both spent limited time serving overseas, with Vance deployed to Iraq as a press officer for about six months and Walz spending nine months in Italy in support of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.\n\nOthers who served in Walz's battalion disagree with Julin's assessment of the governor and his decision to leave the military. Retired Staff Sergeant Ryan Marti, who deployed with the unit to Italy with Walz and to Iraq without him, offered an alternative view during a CNN interview on Thursday night.\n\n\"Absolutely not, I don't think he tried to avoid the deployment at all,\" Marti said. \"In fact, I'm really glad he went to Congress and did what he did. If you want to give someone grief for taking a promotion or moving on, I think that's wrong. I think him going to Congress is like taking a promotion.\"\n\n\"Tim is probably one of the most honorable men I know,\" he added. \"I have no hurt feelings and so many other folks from my unit, we really understand that what he was doing was important, moving on to the next job, going to Congress.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors":

And I think that we all should.'\n\nPresident Biden made a comment on Walz's selection as Harris' Vice-Presidential nominee, as he reportedly told his campaign staff: 'When you get to know him, he's the real deal,' per CNN.\n\nWalz served 24 years in the National Guard before he retired in 2005 ahead of his run for congress.\n\nHowever, while he served as a command sergeant major, he was reverted back to master sergeant due to leaving the military before he completed the coursework for the higher rank.\n\nThis week, Harris' campaign was forced to make an embarrassing edit to his biography as it removed the higher rank from his profile.\n\nWalz also raised eyebrows during his introduction speech on Monday as he made a point about gun control legislation, arguing people should not have access to weapons that he 'carried in war.'\n\nHe quickly faced allegations that he never actually saw combat, although he did train with heavy artillery and was deployed to Italy in 2003 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nWalz previously faced scrutiny for his claims that he served overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, with some feeling he implied that he served in Afghanistan.\n\nThe recent spotlight on Walz's military record is not new for the Minnesota Governor, and in the past he has denied claims that he retired from the National Guard to avoid being deployed.\n\nDuring his first run for congress in 2005, Walz's campaign insisted in March that he would stay in the race despite the possible mobilization of his unit. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nReports quickly resurfaced of anger among his former brothers in arms who accused Walz of 'betraying' his country just as they were preparing for deployment.\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends of the Minnesota National Guard accused Walz of having 'embellished' his record and of having abandoned his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress.\n\n'In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq,' he wrote on Facebook in 2018.\n\n'On May 16th, 2005, he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.'\n\nAfter Harris faced a grilling from reporters for the first time in weeks on Thursday, conservatives criticized the level of the questions and felt she was handed some softballs.\n\nAmid a back-and-forth from hers and Trump's campaign over potential debates, Harris was asked for her reaction to news that Trump agreed to one in early September.\n\n'Well, I'm glad that he's finally agreed to a debate on September 10,' she said.\n\n'I am happy to have that conversation about an additional debate, or after September 10, for sure.'\n\nHarris added she is working with her team to finally sit down for a prime-time interview, saying she wants to get one scheduled 'before the end of the month.'\n\nBloomberg journalist Matthew Yglesias led the criticisms of the softball questions, saying on X: 'Peak journalism is that when you finally get a chance to ask the candidate a question you ask about when they will take more questions.'\n\nConservative commentator Ben Shapiro added: 'No, this doesn't count as her answering serious or tough questions.

Now seeking to hold the second highest office in the land, the governor's fitness for office was challenged over the timing and nature of his retirement from the Minnesota National Guard.\n\n\"I mean, your job as a senior enlisted guy in a unit is to keep your people safe. That's not a job you can switch out of on a moment's notice,\" said Vance to the Daily Mail. Having served with the United States Marine Corps, the senator added, \"So if he abandoned his troops before they went to Iraq or wherever...absolutely shameful.\"\n\nFurther commentary was provided by the Republican nominee for vice president as he fielded questions from the press in Shelby County, Michigan, and challenged, \"Well I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\"\n\n\"What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq? And he has not spent a day in a combat zone,\" accused Vance. \"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not. And if he wants to criticize me for getting an Ivy League education -- I'm proud of the fact that my Mamaw supported me, that I was able to make something of myself. I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nAllegations against Walz predate his initial run for Congress during the 2006 midterms, a year after he had retired as a master sergeant for benefits purposes, having attained the rank of command sergeant major but lacking additional coursework completion.\n\nAccording to a 2018 Facebook post from retired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends, the man who succeeded Walz, \"In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq.\"\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005, he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" Behrends went on.\n\nHe continued those allegations as Walz pursued his gubernatorial re-election in 2022 when he had joined former state Sen. Scott Jensen and other veterans who criticized the pre-deployment retirement.\n\nThe response to the allegations included him saying of Behrends during a Medal of Honor Memorial dedication, as reported by the Star Tribune, \"I don't know if Tom just disagrees with my politics or whatever, but my record speaks for itself and my accomplishments in uniform speak for itself, and there's many people in this crowd, too, that I served with. It's just unfortunate.\"\n\nIt had also been suggested that the reason for his resignation was because he was deciding to run for Congress.\n\nSimilarly, in 2006 Walz responded to criticism from Iraq war veteran Tom Hagen who co-authored a letter to the Winona Daily News regarding the politician's retirement, referring to their claims as \"lies\" as he cited his campaign website's biography that read, \"Walz served overseas with his battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\" The detail referenced his service in Italy.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

They're personal and cutting. If substantiated, they can be career-ending. Even if unsubstantiated, they can be image-defining -- but can also undercut the gravity of the charge itself, reducing it to just another political grenade.\n\n\"The two biggest sins in the military are claiming credit for decorations you don't have or claiming combat action that you did not participate in .... And this much is certain: He's guilty of at least one of them,\" LaCivita told our colleagues Jared Mitovich, Meredith McGraw and Connor O'Brien yesterday. \"Nothing regarding his lies has been weaponized in a political sense. That's about to change.\"\n\nThere are risks to this approach.\n\nWhile there are legitimate questions about how Walz -- who served in the Nebraska and Minnesota National Guard -- has characterized parts of his 24-year-long military career, there are just as many questions about whether Team Trump is characterizing them fairly. Plus, we'll note, Walz has faced these attacks in past races and still won.\n\nLet's unpack some of this.\n\n1. The accusation: Walz abandoned his men before they deployed, leaving them hanging without a leader.\n\nThe facts: Walz retired to run for Congress amid rumors that his men could be deployed, JOSEPH EUSTICE, who served with Walz at the time, told ABC News' Anne Flaherty, Nathan Luna, Luis Martinez, and Justin Fishel. But they didn't know for sure.\n\nIn fact, \"Walz filed paperwork for his congressional run in February 2005, about a month before reports emerged that the Minnesota National Guard might be deployed,\" our colleagues report. \"Walz then announced his run in May of that year, two months before the Minnesota National Guard's directive was officially issued.\"\n\nThere's no evidence that Walz left specifically to avoid a wartime deployment. In fact, Eustice told ABC News that Walz struggled with the decision. Walz, a critic of Bush's war in Iraq, had a 4-year-old daughter at the time. While some of his fellow servicemembers criticized his decision to leave, others balked at the notion that he was trying to dodge combat.\n\nThe facts: The Harris campaign itself recently circulated a video of Walz calling for background checks for gun purchases: \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nThat remark continues to raise eyebrows since Walz has openly acknowledged he never faced active combat, thus leaving real questions about why he'd say he carried such a weapon \"in war.\"\n\n3. The accusation: Walz \"falsely claimed he served in Afghanistan\"\n\nThe facts: Chuck Ross of the conservative Washington Free Beacon dug up an archived Walz press release from 2006 that calls him \"a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the first stage of the War on Terror after 9/11. They also have video of an upset veteran confronting Walz staff about his claim, arguing that those who didn't serve on the ground in Afghanistan are not allowed to do so.\n\nIt's not exactly a clean shot. Walz was, in fact, deployed between 2003 and 2004 to Europe to support Operation Enduring Freedom, but was never deployed to Afghanistan, where OEF was centered. There appears to be some disagreement not only about whether OEF was Afghanistan-specific -- and whether those who served in support of the mission are allowed to say they were part of it. As WaPo's military reporter Dan Lamothe noted on X last night, the operation itself lists casualties in countries beyond Afghanistan.\n\n4. The accusation: Walz inflated his rank -- an allegation two retired command sergeants major also made during Walz's 2018 run for governor.\n\nThe facts: The Harris campaign and others have described Walz as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major\" in recent days. It's true that he rose to that rank, but he didn't retain that title.\n\n\"Walz indeed achieved that rank in service in September 2004,\" ABC News notes. \"But he would have had to serve in that particular role for three years to retire as one officially, according to the National Guard.\"\n\nThus, claims by Walz and his allies describing him as such are inaccurate, per WaPo: \"Walz himself did so in a video clip from 2006 that was surfaced by C-SPAN on Tuesday and in a 2018 clip posted on his own YouTube account.\" (The Harris campaign website now says, accurately, that Walz \"served for 24 years, rising to the rank of Command Sergeant Major.\")\n\nWHAT OTHER VETERAN POLS SAY: Rep. MIKE WALTZ (R-Fla.), a former Green Beret, was among the Republicans slamming Walz yesterday: \"It is kind of like the quarterback of a big team walking away from their team right before they go to the Super Bowl. I've never heard anything like it.\"\n\nBut some high-ranking Democrats appear to think they can parry these attacks -- and maybe use them to their benefit.\n\nTransportation Secretary PETE BUTTIGIEG, who served in Afghanistan in the Navy Reserve, took a swipe at Vance on X, saying \"denigrating the worth of a soldier's service based on whether he deployed to a war zone is... kind of like denigrating the worth of a woman's citizenship based on whether she happens to have children.\"\n\nSen. MARK KELLY (D-Ariz.), a former Navy fighter pilot, used the chance to take a shot at Trump: \"You both deserve to be thanked for your service. Don't become Donald Trump. He calls veterans suckers and losers and that is beneath those of us who have actually served.\"\n\nAnd, FWIW, here's former Rep. PETER MEIJER (R-Mich.), who was an intelligence adviser in Iraq: \"I think Walz played fast & loose with his military bio,\" he wrote on X late last night. \"He let audiences paint in their minds a deceptive picture. It was shady but not stolen valor.\"\n\nGood Thursday morning. Thanks for reading Playbook. Drop us a line: Rachael Bade, Eugene Daniels, Ryan Lizza.\n\nUP FOR DEBATE -- Trump edged closer to agreeing to debate Harris yesterday in a Fox News interview, saying it would probably happen \"in the pretty near future.\" More from USA Today\n\nLOOK WHO'S TALKING -- ABC's Lucien Bruggeman and Katherine Faulders revealed eye-popping audio from 2020 of Trump praising Walz's response to protests after GEORGE FLOYD's murder: \"I fully agree with the way he handled it the last couple of days,\" the then-president said on June 1. That could undercut an emerging line of GOP criticism against Walz (and, perhaps, be a sore spot for the left, too).\n\nLOOK WHO'S (NOT) TALKING -- Harris is starting to face more questions about why she isn't doing more press, which are only bound to grow louder. Our West Wing Playbook colleagues report that her campaign is thinking about setting up a big joint interview with her and Walz -- but they're generally skeptical that such moments provide much electoral value.\n\nFEAR AND LOATHING AT MAR-A-LAGO -- \"Trump complains about campaign as advisers try to focus on attacking Harris,\" by WaPo's Josh Dawsey and Michael Scherer: \"[H]e has grown increasingly upset about Harris's surging poll numbers and media coverage since replacing [President JOE] BIDEN on the ticket, complaining relentlessly and asking friends about how his campaign is performing ... Allies have taken to finger-pointing ... The Trump campaign, for its part, remains confident that he will win decisively.\"\n\nFEAR AND LOATHING IN PACIFIC HEIGHTS -- Former Speaker NANCY PELOSI said yet more yesterday about her July campaign to nudge Biden out of office, this time in a sitdown with WaPo's Paul Kane and other reporters: \"'My goal in life was that that man would never set foot in the White House again,' she said of Trump, pounding the table nine times for emphasis and to explain why she acted. She added that she couldn't stand to see 'an unfolding of events that were just putting rose petals in front of him to go there.'\"\n\nDNC COUNTDOWN -- The Democratic National Convention is less than two weeks away. Are you headed to Chicago? Join POLITICO for live, in-person conversations with the Democratic Party's biggest newsmakers. Sign up to get notified when registration opens\n\nWhat we're watching ... Ahead of a possible GOP governing trifecta next year, Republican climate hawks are setting down a marker: They don't want a full repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act. Emma Dumain of POLITICO's E&E News scooped a letter to Speaker MIKE JOHNSON by 18 House members arguing that the historic climate bill's clean energy tax credits, which have spurred investment in many of their districts, should be preserved. The signers include Rep. ANDREW GARBARINO (R-N.Y.), co-chair of the bipartisan House Climate Solutions Caucus; Rep. MARIANNETTE MILLER-MEEKS (R-Iowa), chair of the House Conservative Climate Caucus; and Rep. JOHN CURTIS (R-Utah), who is likely to be Sen. Curtis next year.\n\nAt the White House\n\nBiden will call Hawaii Gov. JOSH GREEN and Maui County Mayor RICHARD BISSEN at 12:30 p.m. to mark one year since the awful Maui wildfires. At 4 p.m., he'll welcome the World Series champion Texas Rangers to the White House. In the evening, he and first lady JILL BIDEN will greet campaign staffers in Wilmington, Delaware, before heading to Rehoboth Beach.\n\nOn the trail\n\nHarris will deliver remarks at a campaign event in Detroit this afternoon before traveling to Phoenix.\n\nAMERICA AND THE WORLD\n\nMIDDLE EAST LATEST -- The big Hezbollah and Iranian retaliation against Israel hasn't yet arrived. But Israeli officials have already warned the U.S. that Hezbollah hurting civilians would trigger a \"disproportionate\" response from the Israel Defense Forces, Axios' Barak Ravid reports. Israel says it doesn't want an even larger regional war than the one that already exists, but it's setting out red lines now -- especially as fears loom of any error by Hezbollah potentially killing civilians near Israeli military bases around Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, responding to outrage about alleged Israeli sexual assault of a Palestinian detainee, the State Department's MATTHEW MILLER said Israel needs to investigate and have \"zero tolerance,\" per CNN.\n\nAcross the region, the ongoing series of Houthi attacks on Red Sea ships in response to the Israel-Hamas war has operated on a mostly slower burn. But with time, the Western reaction has become \"the most sustained military campaign by American forces since the anti-ISIS air war in Iraq and Syria that reached its height in 2016-2019,\" Paul McLeary, Joe Gould and Connor O'Brien write. That could escalate with new Iranian/Hezbollah attacks. And Congress is now reckoning with whether the Pentagon will need more funding for the mission.\n\n2024 WATCH\n\nREALITY CHECK -- Playbook readers already know that though Project 2025 is independent of the Trump campaign, his claims to know nothing of it aren't credible. A new report from WaPo's Isaac Arnsdorf, Josh Dawsey and Hannah Knowles puts a finer point on that: In 2022, Trump and Heritage leader KEVIN ROBERTS took a 45-minute flight together to a conference where Trump said, \"They're going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.\"\n\nTHE HARRIS CAMPAIGN -- Harris has managed to rally labor unions around her candidacy quickly by telling them she'll continue with Biden's pro-worker policies, Adam Cancryn reports. She's also consolidating support from vulnerable Senate Democrats, who are showing up to her events after keeping their distance from Biden, per Megan Messerly. And from tech venture capitalists, who held the latest big Zoom call to support Harris, per NYT's Teddy Schleifer and Erin Griffith.\n\nTHE AGE-OLD QUESTION -- \"Trump keeps losing his train of thought. Cognitive experts have theories about why,\" by Stat's Olivia Goldhill: \"Back in 2017, Trump's first year in the White House, a STAT analysis showed Trump's speaking style had deteriorated since the 1980s. Seven years on, now that Trump has the GOP presidential nomination, STAT has repeated the analysis. The experts noted a further reduction in Trump's linguistic complexity and, while none said they could give a diagnosis without an examination, some said certain shifts in his speaking style are potential indications of cognitive decline.\"\n\nEXAMINING HARRIS' RECORD -- \"Harris was 'last person in the room' on Afghan exit, but her influence is unclear,\" by WaPo's Michael Kranish and Dan Lamothe: \"She raised important questions about the Afghanistan withdrawal before the calamitous, 17-day evacuation from Kabul but did not push for any alternative policy.\"\n\nPOLICY CORNER\n\nOIL AND WATER -- If Trump returns to the White House, he is pledging to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve back up to a high level as soon as possible. The plan, which he pronounced most recently on Fox News yesterday, would return U.S. energy reserves to a similar level as during Trump's term, FT's Malcolm Moore reports. Buying nearly 300 million barrels of crude -- which would need congressional sign-off -- would push oil demand higher, with potential ramifications for global prices. Republicans have blasted Biden for releasing significant amounts from the reserves since Russia attacked Ukraine, which they argue is just trying to keep prices low ahead of the election, though his administration has been buying more recently.\n\nAt the same time, U.S. oil production is booming: Crude output hit an all-time high last week, Ben Lefebvre reports. That means that despite GOP criticism of Biden -- and his environmentalist bona fides -- the U.S. remains \"the biggest oil and gas producer in history.\"\n\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\n\nPOTUS SPEAKS -- Biden sat down with CBS' Robert Costa for his first interview since dropping out of the race, which will mostly air on \"CBS News Sunday Morning.\" In an advance snippet released yesterday, Biden worried aloud about Trump disrupting a peaceful transfer of power if Harris wins: \"I'm not confident at all\" in that case, the president said. \"He means what he says. We don't take him seriously. He means it. All this stuff about 'if we lose, it'll be a bloodbath.'\"\n\nMORE POLITICS\n\nBATTLE FOR THE SENATE -- Republicans are going up with some notable ad buys in key Senate races. The NRSC's independent expenditure and the One Nation super PAC are both hammering Democratic Rep. ELISSA SLOTKIN, newly nominated in Michigan's Senate race, for voting for pandemic-era spending that they link to inflation, NBC's Bridget Bowman reports. Americans for Prosperity Action is launching nearly $6 million in ads in Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, largely criticizing Democratic spending and touting GOP challengers, Fox News' Julia Johnson scooped.\n\nIT'S 2020 SOMEWHERE -- \"Reinvestigation of Fulton's 2020 election ordered by Georgia Election Board,\" by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Mark Niesse\n\nThe accusation, which comes as part of the tax case against the president's son, says for the first time that Hunter Biden and his business partners got $3 million from Popoviciu from 2015 to 2017. Hunter Biden didn't respond to ABC's request for comment; there remains no evidence that Joe Biden acted corruptly. Overall, the prosecutors' filing shows that they don't plan to charge Hunter Biden with a Foreign Agents Registration Act violation, but they will use the foreign influence allegations to build an aggressive tax case, NYT's Glenn Thrush and Ken Vogel report.\n\nVALLEY TALK\n\nBRUTAL FOR ELON MUSK -- \"It's Elon Musk's X and governments are having to live with it,\" by John Sakellariadis, Christine Mui and Brittany Gibson: \"Musk's latest flurry of innuendo, half-truths and lies online is making it increasingly clear that it is the tech mogul -- and not just his platform -- who poses the greatest challenge to governments struggling to rein in content that can incite extremist violence. ... Angry officials are trying to find levers to pull to influence the world's richest man.\"\n\nFIRST IN PLAYBOOK -- Jessica McCall and Erika West have launched a new political and advocacy consulting firm, Auburn Advisors. Together, they're alums of Barack Obama, Color of Change, John Conyers Jr., the DCCC and Planned Parenthood.\n\n-- Jessica Presley is joining the American Sunlight Project as managing director. She previously was digital content strategist to NASA Administrator Bill Nelson and is a Nancy Pelosi alum.\n\nTRANSITIONS -- Gina Metrakas is now chief of staff at HUD. She previously was the agency's COO. ... Peter Reid is joining Barclays as managing director and group head of external engagement. He previously was head of strategic comms for U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. ... Katelyn Ringrose is now a privacy and cybersecurity associate at McDermott Will & Emery. She previously was global policy lead for law enforcement and government access at Google.\n\nCorrections: Yesterday's Playbook misstated the primary results in Michigan. Paul Hudson and Paul Junge will be the Republican candidates in two Democratic districts. In one Republican-held seat, Carl Marlinga will be the Democratic candidate. It also mischaracterized the ranking Tim Walz was given by the Center for Effective Lawmaking while in Congress. He was named the seventh-most effective member of the House.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks.\n\n\"We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nWhile Mr Walz would have carried a gun during his deployments, he does not appear to have ever seen active combat.\n\nIn a 2018 interview, he conceded: \"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did.\"\n\nClick here to view this content.\n\nHowever, his use of the phrase \"in war\" triggered a fierce backlash, with fellow service members accusing Mr Walz of \"abandoning\" his US Army national guard unit by retiring shortly before it deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\nClick here to view this content.\n\n\"The big frustration was that he let his troops down,\" Doug Julin, a retired soldier who worked with Mr Walz, told the Washington Post.\n\nThe Harris campaign told the newspaper that Mr Walz carried, fired and trained others on how to use \"weapons of war innumerable times\", but declined to address why he claimed to have done so in war.\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends claimed Mr Walz was fabricating his record to advance his \"political career\".\n\nMr Walz has not responded to the recent attacks, but has previously said of Mr Behrends's comments: \"I don't know if Tom just disagrees with my politics or whatever, but my record speaks for itself.\"\n\nClick here to view this content.\n\nMr Behrends also took issue with Mr Walz describing himself as a command sergeant major in campaign promotional material despite quitting before serving the full period required to officially retire at the rank.\n\nMr Walz earned the promotion - one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier - in September 2004 but retired in May 2005.\n\nDonald Trump's running mate JD Vance, himself a military veteran, accused Mr Walz of \"stolen valour\".\n\nClick here to view this content.\n\nMr Vance, an Ohio senator, said: \"When the US Marine Corps asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that's shameful.\"\n\nClick here to view this content.\n\nHowever, another retired command sergeant major who served with Mr Walz said there was no firm indication that the unit would be deployed to Iraq before his departure.\n\n\"There were lots of rumours, and we didn't know where we were going until... early summer, I believe,\" Joseph Eustice told ABC News.\n\nAccording to national guard records, Mr Walz's battalion was alerted about deployment in July 2005, two months after he retired and around five months before he filed paperwork to run for Congress. The battalion deployed in 2006.\n\nThere is no evidence that Mr Walz left to avoid a wartime deployment, and experts suggest his retirement would have to have been approved by his commander.\n\nMr Eustice said he remembered Mr Walz struggling with the timing of his run for office, weighing up his desire to serve in Congress with his wish to avoid asking for a deferment to do so.\n\n\"He had a window of time. He had to decide. And in his [time spent] deciding, we were not on notice to be deployed,\" he said.\n\nMr Walz has also been accused of being misleading about his involvement in Operation Enduring Freedom, a US military operation centred on Afghanistan.\n\nPhotographs have emerged of Mr Walz, a critic of President George Bush's handling of the Iraq war, holding a \"Operation Enduring Freedom veterans for John Kerry\" poster during the Democrat's 2004 presidential run.\n\nWhile Mr Walz was deployed between 2003 and 2004 to Norway and Italy in support of the operation, he was never deployed to Afghanistan.\n\nFootage has since emerged of veterans of the operation confronting Mr Walz's political staff in 2009 and suggesting his description of his record gave the false impression he had served in Afghanistan.\n\nClick here to view this content.\n\nThe Trump campaign has relentlessly attacked Mr Walz over his military record in the last few days amid a shift in the polls which has seen the former president's lead narrow in several battleground states.\n\nChris LaCivita, a senior Trump adviser, who led an effort to aggressively attack Mr Kerry's military record in the 2004 election to great effect, said Mr Walz's record would be vigorously scrutinised.\n\n\"Nothing regarding his lies has been weaponised in a political sense. That's about to change,\" Mr LaCivita told Politico.\n\nHowever, the strategy carries risks for Republicans given Trump's own Vietnam-era military deferment.\n\nSome GOP strategists also believe the campaign should expend their efforts attacking Ms Harris' governing record rather than focusing on Mr Walz, a relative unknown to the American public.\n\nLeading Democrats have hit back at the attacks on Mr Walz. Mark Kelly, an Arizona senator and combat veteran, said: \"Don't become Donald Trump. He calls veterans suckers and losers and that is beneath those of us who have actually served.\"\n\nPete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary, said the GOP attacks were \"strategic\".\n\n\"Team Trump needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to abortion,\" he said.\n\nClick here to view this content.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rozina_sabur@aol.co.uk", "name": "Rozina

Tim Walz and his military record.\n\nWalz, tapped as Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate this week, has made headlines over his departure from the Army National Guard and sidestepping a deployment to Iraq when he ran for Congress in 2005. The concerns over \"stolen valor\" have been circulating as Democrats accuse critics of lying about Walz and the timing of his retirement from the Minnesota National Guard.\n\n\"Walz served in the Minnesota Army National Guard and retired at the rank of master sergeant, or an E-8. However, on his official website bio, he lists a higher rank that he served at for a short period that ultimately was rescinded, as he did not complete all the requirements to serve at that rank,\" Breitbart reported. \"However, his bio implies that he retired at the rank of command sergeant major or an E-9.\"\n\n\"He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, an officer with the Minnesota National Guard's State Public Affairs, confirmed to the outlet.\n\nWalz reportedly quit while the rest of his unit eventually deployed to Iraq. Now a press release from Walz's own campaign in 2005 sheds light on the actual timeline of events.\n\n\"On Thursday, March 17 the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced a possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard. First District congressional candidate Tim Walz currently holds the rank of Command Sergeant Major in the 1-125th Battalion, which is based in New Ulm and largely composed of men and women from southern Minnesota,\" the 2005 press release read.\n\n\"The announcement from the National Guard PAO specified that all or a portion of Walz's battalion could be mobilized to serve in Iraq within the next two years,\" it continued.\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,\" he said before evidently breaking his promise.\n\n\"I don't want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq,\" he added at the time.\n\nThe latest in the ongoing controversy prompted a fresh wave of criticism on social media.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Tim Walz on its website amid credible allegations of stolen valor.\n\nThe website initially referred to Walz as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\" His page was updated Thursday to say that he \"served as a command sergeant major\" instead.\n\nThere is a key difference there.\n\nWhile Walz refers to himself as a \"retired command sergeant major,\" he was only conditionally promoted to the rank. Per National Guard officials, Walz retired before fulfilling the requirements for the position of command sergeant major.\n\n\"[Walz] retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, a Minnesota National Guard's State public affairs officer, told Just the News.\n\n\"The Soldier must complete the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Course as a condition of this promotion. Failure to meet the condition will cause demotion per AR 600 - 8 - 19, according to Army rules.\"\n\nJD Vance, a Marine Corps veteran, had this to say about his Democrat counterpart:\n\n\"As a Marine who served his country in uniform when the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.\"\n\nHarris' selection of Walz as her running mate has given the Trump campaign some new, much-needed material.\n\nShe passed over a more moderate vice presidential candidate in Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - most likely because he's Jewish - for a radical and evidently very dishonest progressive in Tim Walz.\n\nFor those who believe you can read a person based on their supporters, Walz received a glowing endorsement from MSNBC race lady Joy Reid this week. Reid said while Walz is white, he's not \"mayonnaise sandwich on Wonder Bread white,\" like Sen. Mark Kelly.\n\nGood for him.\n\nWalz's defense of the deadly and destructive BLM riots of 2020 is likely what Reid references when she implies Walz is the good kind of white.\n\nLuckily for him, lying about his military credentials won't make him the bad kind of white - at least in the eyes of Reid and Kamala.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors":

Tim Walz took the \"coward's way out\" when he retired months before his National Guard unit was deployed to Iraq, according to a grieving mom whose teen son was killed by a roadside bomb.\n\nSgt. Kyle Miller, 19, who was part of Walz's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery unit, died in Iraq in 2006 -- just as the Democrat was serving his freshman term in Minnesota's 1st Congressional District. The unit's Sgt. 1st Class David Berry was killed a year later.\n\n\"My son wasn't even 21 years old. He couldn't even buy alcohol. Yet he took the step to serve our country while Walz found the best way to run away,\" Miller's mother, Kathy Miller, told the Daily Mail.\n\n\"It was the coward's way out.\"\n\nWalz -- Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate -- officially retired as command sergeant major in the Minnesota National Guard after 24 years on May 16, 2005 to launch his political career.\n\nTwo months later, 1-125th received an alert order for mobilization as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The unit mobilized that October, according to CBS News.\n\n\"It makes you wonder if he will bow out in some manner, and not accomplish the job he is supposed to get done,\" said Kathy Miller.\n\nMiller joined the Minnesota National Guard when he was a junior in high school, his family said. He graduated in June 2005, and deployed to Iraq with the 1-125th after he completed basic training.\n\nMiller, 19, was four months into his deployment when he was killed by a roadside bomb in Balad on June 29, 2006, the West Central Tribune reported at the time.\n\n\"My son stepped up to the plate. All our sons stepped up,\" Kathy Miller said.\n\nWalz's rank, meanwhile, was reduced to master sergeant because he had not finished coursework for the US Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\n\"I don't think it's fair that [Walz] takes credit when he didn't step up to the plate,\" Kathy Miller said. \"Walz claims a rank he never earned. When he was called to serve, and protect our country he didn't. To publicly present false prestige of his unearned rank an inaccurate representation, is a falsehood of who he truly is.\n\nThe mom told the Daily Mail that she has never heard from Walz or his office.\n\nThe 1-125th suffered another blow on Feb. 22, 2007, when squad leader Berry was killed by an IED that struck his Humvee in Qasim, according to the Desert Bulls newsletter.\n\nBerry, 37, was a member of the Kansas National Guard who had been with the 1-125th since their mobilization for deployment in October 2005, the write-up explained.\n\nIn 2005, Berry had been awarded the Soldier's Medal - the highest peacetime honor - for pulling an unconscious man from a burning pickup truck on a remote highway near Wichita, NPR reported.\n\nBerry's family declined to comment to The Post.\n\nWalz has faced renewed scrutiny of his 24-year military record - particularly the timing of his retirement -- since he debuted this week as Harris' running mate.\n\nDonald Trump's VP pick, Marine Corps veteran JD Vance, went so far as to accuse Walz of \"stolen valor\" in response to a video that showed Walz implying that he had actually seen combat.\n\nVance, 40, deployed to Iraq for six months in an administrative role in 2005. Trump, 78, was medically exempt from the Vietnam War draft in the late 1960s due to bone spurs.\n\nWhile one former colleague remembered that Walz \"heavily\" weighed his choice to retire instead of deploy with the unit, a former superior accused the future governor of going over his head in order to step down.\n\n\"I would have analyzed it and challenged him. It would have been a different discussion, but he went to the higher ranks. He knew I would have told him, 'Suck it up, we're going,'\" Doug Julin claimed to the Washington Post.\n\nOthers have criticized that Walz retired in order to run for Congress, even though he knew that he could request permission from the Pentagon to run for office while deployed.\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" retired Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr wrote in a letter posted to Facebook in 2018.\n\nWalz filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 10, 2005, online records show.\n\nThe next month, the National Guard announced the possible partial mobilization of about 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard, CBS News reported.\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on.

Tim Walz of Minnesota appeared to disregard shouted questions on Wednesday regarding allegations that he lied about his military service with the National Guard, instead walking to a nearby vehicle.\n\nWalz's 2005 retirement from the Minnesota National Guard after a 24-year career was questioned in a resurfaced 2018 Facebook post by retired Army Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends, who replaced Walz as the top enlisted man in an artillery battalion after the Minnesota governor's retirement. The unidentified person twice shouted questions at Walz about \"stolen valor\" as Walz greeted people at the airport before he hurriedly moved to an SUV.

J.D. Vance of Ohio, the party's nominee for vice president, was among those accusing Walz of \"stolen valor,\" highlighting comments Walz made in a video posted on X by the Harris-Walz campaign in which he called for a ban on so-called \"assault weapons,\" labeling them \"weapons of war, that I carried in war.\" Walz never served in the Middle East but was deployed to Italy during the War on Terror, the Washington Free Beacon reported.\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance asked during a Wednesday campaign event in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. \"What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage.\"(RELATED: 'You Don't Quite See That': MSNBC Data Guru Delivers Brutal Reality Check To Dems After Walz Pick)\n\nVice President Kamala Harris introduced Walz, a former teacher, as her running mate during a Tuesday rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Walz claims on his official gubernatorial website that he retired as a Command Sergeant Major, but Behrends said in a letter attached to the 2018 Facebook post that Walz's rank was reduced to Master Sergeant due to his sudden retirement.\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Tim Walz's military record after Vice President Kamala Harris named him as her running mate this week.\n\nHere's a look at the issue:\n\nRetirement\n\nWalz served 24 years in various units and jobs in the Army National Guard. His retirement in 2005 is prompting criticism from some Republicans who suggest he abandoned his team to pursue a campaign for Congress.\n\nAs he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. According to the Guard, Walz retired from service in May of that year.\n\nIn August 2005, the Department of the Army issued a mobilization order for Walz's unit. The unit mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006. It's unclear why Walz timed his departure as he did but he left ahead of his unit's departure.\n\nPeople are also reading...

By 1996, he transferred to the Minnesota Army National Guard. In 2003, he deployed to Italy in a support position of active military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. But he was not in a combat zone himself.\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance said Wednesday as he campaigned in Michigan. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nVance enlisted in the Marine Corps after graduating high school, serving for four years as a combat correspondent, a type of military journalist, and deploying to Iraq in that capacity in 2005.\n\nNeither Trump nor Harris served in the U.S. military. Trump received deferments during the Vietnam War, including one attained with a physician's letter stating he suffered from bone spurs in his feet.\n\nThe Harris campaign statement said Walz \"would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country\" and \"thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nWhat about his rank?\n\nHarris' campaign referred to Walz as a \"retired Command Sergeant Major,\" one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier. He achieved that rank, but personnel files show he was reduced in rank months after retiring. That left him as a master sergeant for benefits purposes.\n\nMinnesota National Guard officials said Walz retired before completing coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, along with other requirements associated with his promotion.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site

Vance responds to Tim Walz 'abandoning' unit before deployment", "body": "By Rob Crilly, Chief U.S. Political Correspondent For Dailymail.Com Aboard Trump Force Two\n\nDonald Trump's running mate Sen. J.D. Vance slammed Kamala Harris's V.P. pick on Wednesday amid reports that Gov. Tim Walz had skipped out on being deployed to Iraq with the Minnesota National Guard.\n\nVance, who served with the U.S. Marines in Iraq, said it was 'shameful' if Walz had retired in 2005 just as his battalion was preparing to go to war.\n\n'I mean, your job as a senior enlisted guy in a unit is to keep your people safe. That's not a job you can switch out of on a moment's notice,' Vance told DailyMail.com during an exclusive interview aboard his campaign plane, nicknamed Trump Force Two.\n\n'So if he abandoned his troops before they went to Iraq or wherever ... absolutely shameful.'\n\nWalz, the governor of Minnesota, was named by Harris as her running mate on Tuesday.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz is accused of skipping out on his National Guard unit just before it deployed to Iraq in 2005 to begin his political career\n\nHe appeared alongside her at a campaign rally in Philadelphia later that day.\n\nBut reports quickly resurfaced of anger among his former brothers in arms who accused him of 'betraying' his country just as they were preparing for deployment\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends of the Minnesota National Guard accused Walz of having 'embellished' his record and of having abandoned his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress.\n\n'In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq,' he wrote on Facebook in 2018.\n\n'On May 16th, 2005, he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.'\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Vance was on his way to Michigan for a campaign event hours before Harris was due to arrive in the same spot.\n\nHe said his role was to remain 'laser-focused' on scrutinizing her policy failures on immigration, energy and manufacturing.\n\nBut he added he was astonished that the Harris campaign had not checked out Walz's military record and accused him of lying to make a political point.\n\nDailyMail.com is traveling with Trump's running mate J.D. Vance and his wife Usha aboard Trump Force Two\n\nJ.D. Vance spent six years in U.S. Marines, including six months deployed to Iraq\n\nVance added he was astonished that the Harris campaign had not checked out Walz's military record and accused him of lying to make a political point. Walz is pictured right while serving with the U.S. Army National Guard in 1992\n\n'There was a clip the Kamala campaign posted about him where he's making a gun control argument,' ' said Vance. ' He said, Look, you should not be able to carry the weapons that I carried in war.\n\n'And I'm, I'm thinking to myself, well, when did you go to war? What weapon did you carry in the war, Tim, because apparently you skipped out on your unit before they went to Iraq.\n\n'I know he didn't go to a combat zone, so why is he lying to make a political point?'\n\nVance, who grew up in Ohio, is seen by the Trump campaign as key to eating into the Democrats' so-called 'blue wall' of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Wednesday, he will first be in Shelby Township, Michigan, and at 2 p.m. in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nThe aim is to keep pressure on Harris, who is due in both places a few hours later.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

However, when exaggeration or false claims involve service to one's country, that's different. For a politician to tell an audience his military record is something it is not, even to just give that impression, crosses the line from puffery to approaching stolen valor. Just a couple of days after being chosen to run alongside Kamala Harris, Tim Walz now faces this question: Can he avoid the stolen valor label?\n\nVeterans, active duty service members, and reservists, having put their lives on the line in defense of America, are often particularly sensitive to false claims of service. Those who served in Iraq and Afghanistan might be exceptionally touchy about a politician who would give the impression he had engaged in combat when he hadn't. For Walz, the kerfuffle about whether he had been been in combat began when a video clip surfaced of him during a campaign speech in which he talked about his stand on gun control. He asserted: \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\n\"When Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz chose to leave the military on the eve of his deployment to Iraq, Thomas Behrends went in his place. 'I needed to hit the ground running and take care of the troops -- and tell them we were going to war,' Behrends said of the 500 soldiers under his command. 'For a guy in that position, to quit is cowardice,'\" the New York Post reported. When faced with the demands of combat and the terrible realities of war, emotions understandably run high. To be fair, Tim Walz spent 24 years in the Minnesota National Guard, achieving the rank of command sergeant major. As the late former Secretary of Defense, Don Rumsfeld, was fond of saying, \"That's not nothing.\"\n\nHowever, there are problems with Walz's portrayal of his service rank following retirement. On the Office of the Governor of Minnesota webpage, \"After 24 years in the Army National Guard, Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005,\" his official biography reads. Although it looks good as a campaign talking point, it would be more accurate to say Walz retired as a master sergeant. \"Behrends said Walz had been promoted to command sergeant major in 2004 but claimed he was required to serve two additional years, or the promotion would be void. His early retirement terminated the promotion, reducing his rank to master sergeant,\" Fox reported. An inquiry to the Minnesota National Guard confirmed Walz's rank at retirement was master sergeant. Whether this deception rises to the level of \"Stolen Valor,\" however, is debatable.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign must have realized it was a growing problem for the Democrat duo because \"Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign quietly edited Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's biography on Thursday to remove a reference to him as a 'retired command sergeant major,'\" the Daily Caller reported. There is a definition of stolen valor, about falsely claiming awards and decorations, in the applicable 2013 legislation passed by Congress, but Walz's transgressions probably don't make the cut.\n\nOther politicians have had glancing blows with claiming military service or accomplishments that were questionable. One notable example is Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who asserted while running for the US Senate that he had served in Vietnam. \"There was one problem: Mr. Blumenthal, a Democrat now running for the United States Senate, never served in Vietnam. He obtained at least five military deferments from 1965 to 1970 and took repeated steps that enabled him to avoid going to war, according to records,\" The New York Times reported at the time. Blumenthal won his election anyway.\n\nAnother example was John Kerry. When running for president of the United States, he ran afoul of former Swift Boat (Fast Patrol Craft) colleagues who mounted a successful campaign to discredit his awards during his time as a US Navy officer and swift boat commander. The attacks on Kerry's service were effective, and the rounds were put below the water line, sinking the would-be president's campaign. Regardless of whether the allegations of inflated service were accurate, Kerry's anti-war behavior while Americans were fighting and dying in Vietnam was unseemly enough to make the charges of Kerry's inflated commendations have the ring of truth.\n\nSo, Governor Tim Walz does have a bit of a credibility problem. He has moved into the crosshairs of his opponent, Republican and vice-presidential nominee Senator JD Vance, who does have a military record that includes service in the Iraq combat zone. \"As he campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance questioned whether Walz's departure from service months ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq, calling it 'stolen valor garbage,'\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nPresidential campaigns are highly charged affairs - but candidates don't do themselves any favors by providing obvious fodder for their opponents to seize on during the rhetorical hand-to-hand combat. Governor Walz leaving his unit before its deployment to run for political office does not mark him as a villain. Leaving his audience during a campaign stop with the impression he saw combat, well, that's shoddy behavior - but it can be chalked up to misplaced metaphorical exuberant bravado. It does, however, call into question Walz's character as a potential holder of the second-highest office in the land. And for the governor to claim he retired as a command sergeant major when it was his choice to retire as the lower rank of master sergeant - well, that is something else.", "source": {"uri":

Tim Walz (D), and now running mate to Vice President Kamala Harris, has made his 24-year military career an important cornerstone of his political persona. He has made multiple references to his time in the Minnesota National Guard, but some of those comments have come under renewed scrutiny due to their misleading nature.\n\nAside from putting in his retirement paperwork after it became clear his unit was going to be deployed to Iraq, Walz has also suggested in some of his remarks that he was in combat, even though he was not, and said he retired as a command sergeant major when, in reality, he retired as a master sergeant.\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard explained \"because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" Walz was unable to retain the higher rank when he retired.\n\nOn the Harris' campaign website page that introduced Walz as her running mate, the post repeated the false rank he retired as: \"The son of an Army veteran and a retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard himself.\" The Harris campaign has since corrected the sentence to have his true rank.\n\nIn a video promoted by the Harris campaign, Walz previously told a crowd while advocating for gun control that \"we can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon further reported that in 2009, Iraq war veteran David Thul, a sergeant in the Minnesota National Guard, told Walz staffers the then-congressman was misrepresenting his service by claiming to be a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom. OEF was the U.S. military operation that was started in and primarily focused on Afghanistan. Like Iraq, Walz did not serve in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Congressman Walz is clearly claiming ... to be an Enduring Freedom veteran. Nobody disputes the fact that he is not an Afghanistan or Enduring Freedom veteran.

We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nWhile Mr Walz would have carried a gun during his deployments, he does not appear to have ever seen active combat.\n\nIn a 2018 interview, he conceded: \"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did.\"\n\nClick here to view this content.\n\nHowever, his use of the phrase \"in war\" triggered a fierce backlash, with fellow service members accusing Mr Walz of \"abandoning\" his US Army national guard unit by retiring shortly before it deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\nClick here to view this content.\n\n\"The big frustration was that he let his troops down,\" Doug Julin, a retired soldier who worked with Mr Walz, told the Washington Post.\n\nThe Harris campaign told the newspaper that Mr Walz carried, fired and trained others on how to use \"weapons of war innumerable times\", but declined to address why he claimed to have done so in war.\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends claimed Mr Walz was fabricating his record to advance his \"political career\".\n\nMr Walz has not responded to the recent attacks, but has previously said of Mr Behrends's comments: \"I don't know if Tom just disagrees with my politics or whatever, but my record speaks for itself.\"\n\nClick here to view this content.\n\nMr Behrends also took issue with Mr Walz describing himself as a command sergeant major in campaign promotional material despite quitting before serving the full period required to officially retire at the rank.\n\nMr Walz earned the promotion - one of the top ranks for an enlisted soldier - in September 2004 but retired in May 2005.\n\nMr Vance, an Ohio senator, said: \"When the US Marine Corps asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that's shameful.\"\n\nClick here to view this content.\n\nHowever, another retired command sergeant major who served with Mr Walz said there was no firm indication that the unit would be deployed to Iraq before his departure.\n\n\"There were lots of rumours, and we didn't know where we were going until... early summer, I believe,\" Joseph Eustice told ABC News.\n\nAccording to national guard records, Mr Walz's battalion was alerted about deployment in July 2005, two months after he retired and around five months before he filed paperwork to run for Congress. The battalion deployed in 2006.\n\nThere is no evidence that Mr Walz left to avoid a wartime deployment, and experts suggest his retirement would have to have been approved by his commander.\n\nMr Eustice said he remembered Mr Walz struggling with the timing of his run for office, weighing up his desire to serve in Congress with his wish to avoid asking for a deferment to do so.\n\n\"He had a window of time. He had to decide. And in his [time spent] deciding, we were not on notice to be deployed,\" he said.\n\nMr Walz has also been accused of being misleading about his involvement in Operation Enduring Freedom, a US military operation centred on Afghanistan.\n\nPhotographs have emerged of Mr Walz, a critic of President George Bush's handling of the Iraq war, holding a \"Operation Enduring Freedom veterans for John Kerry\" poster during the Democrat's 2004 presidential run.\n\nWhile Mr Walz was deployed between 2003 and 2004 to Norway and Italy in support of the operation, he was never deployed to Afghanistan.\n\nFootage has since emerged of veterans of the operation confronting Mr Walz's political staff in 2009 and suggesting his description of his record gave the false impression he had served in Afghanistan.\n\nClick here to view this content.\n\nThe Trump campaign has relentlessly attacked Mr Walz over his military record in the last few days amid a shift in the polls which has seen the former president's lead narrow in several battleground states.\n\nChris LaCivita, a senior Trump adviser, who led an effort to aggressively attack Mr Kerry's military record in the 2004 election to great effect, said Mr Walz's record would be vigorously scrutinised.\n\n\"Nothing regarding his lies has been weaponised in a political sense. That's about to change,\" Mr LaCivita told Politico.\n\nHowever, the strategy carries risks for Republicans given Trump's own Vietnam-era military deferment.\n\nSome GOP strategists also believe the campaign should expend their efforts attacking Ms Harris' governing record rather than focusing on Mr Walz, a relative unknown to the American public.\n\nLeading Democrats have hit back at the attacks on Mr Walz. Mark Kelly, an Arizona senator and combat veteran, said: \"Don't become Donald Trump. He calls veterans suckers and losers and that is beneath those of us who have actually served.\"\n\nPete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary, said the GOP attacks were \"strategic\".\n\n\"Team Trump needs us tied up in debates over pre-retirement conditional rank promotions because they are desperate NOT to discuss their (unpopular) policies, like tax cuts for the rich and banning access to

Other Republicans have accused Walz of stolen valor after he mentioned using weapons in war, despite never seeing combat.\n\nWalz did serve as a command sergeant major but reverted to the rank of master sergeant when he left the military because he had not completed required coursework for the higher rank with the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, Politico reported.\n\n\"The son of an Army veteran who served as a command sergeant major, Walz was the ranking member on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, where he passed legislation to help stem veterans' suicides,\" Walz's biography now reads.\n\nPreviously, it read, \"the son of an Army veteran and a retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard himself,\" Politico reported.\n\nWalz's online biography at the Minnesota state website refers to him as a \"command sergeant major.\"\n\n\"Walz attained the rank of command sergeant major and served in that role but retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes due to not completing additional coursework,\" Army public affairs officer Lt.

It's sad.\n\n\"He had the opportunity to serve his country, and said 'screw you' to the United States. That's not who I would pick to run for vice-president.\"\n\nWalz, 60, joined the National Guard after high school and served 24 years in the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery, rising to the rank of command sergeant major. He retired in 2005 -- months after a warning order that the battalion would be deployed to Iraq -- to run for Congress. He was elected to office in 2006.\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" Behrends and fellow retired Guardsman Paul Herr wrote in a letter posted to Facebook during Walz's first gubernatorial run, in 2018.\n\nBehrends and Herr wrote that Walz could have requested permission from the Pentagon to seek Congressional office while on active duty.\n\nWhen Walz left the unit, he offered to raise funds to cover his fellow soldiers' bus trips home for Christmas -- a gesture that was seen as a cynical ploy by some of them, according to Behrends.\n\n\"If it were me, I would feel guilty about leaving and do something to make up for it, but if you ask me he was doing it to buy votes,\" Behrends told The Post. \"He will do anything for votes.\"\n\nThe unit spent 17 months in Iraq and suffered three casualties, including Kyle Miller, a 19-year-old from Willmar, MN.\n\nLike Walz, Miller signed up for the National Guard in high school, and hoped to work as an auto mechanic after his deployment, according to reports. He died when the vehicle in which he was a passenger was hit by a roadside bomb on June 29, 2006.\n\n\"Unlike Walz, Kyle volunteered to go with his unit,\" said Behrends, who worked with Miller's mother, Cathy Miller, to create a bronze memorial of her son.\n\nAccording to Behrends, Walz had been selected for the US Army Sergeants Major Academy and promoted to Command Sergeant Major in 2004 -- which required him to serve two more years or lose the promotion.\n\nHis retirement nullified the promotion and, on September 10,2005, his rank was reduced to Master Sergeant, according to the Daily Wire.\n\nHowever, Walz continued to use the rank in descriptions of his military career in campaign materials, Alpha News reported in 2022.\n\n\"He continued to say 'retired Command Sergeant Major' for his political career,\" Behrends told The Post. \"When he used that ... it was stolen valor.\"\n\nBehrends and Herr wrote about this in their letter.\n\n\"If he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academy,\" the two wrote. \"Instead he slithered out the door and waited for the paperwork to catch up to him.\"\n\nThe Post has reached out to Walz's office for comment.\n\nIn 2006, another Iraq war veteran who was part of Walz's unit reportedly called his retirement just before deployment \"disturbing.\"\n\n\"But even more disturbing is the fact that Walz quickly retired after learning that his unit -- southern Minnesota's 1-125 FA Battalion -- would be sent to Iraq,\" wrote Tom Hagen in a Nov. 1, 2006, letter to the editor of the Winona Daily News, according to the Daily Wire. \"For Tim Walz to abandon his fellow soldiers and quit when they needed experienced leadership most is disheartening.\"\n\nWalz reportedly responded with his own letter to the editor of the Winona Daily News, writing: \"After completing 20 years of service in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for an additional four years following Sept. 11 and retired the year before my battalion was deployed to Iraq in order to run for Congress. I'm proud of the 24 years I served our country in the Army National Guard.\"\n\nWalz has said he did not see any combat during his more than two decades of service with the National Guard.\n\nHe was part of several disaster response deployments in the Midwest and deployed to Italy in 2003 to serve with the European Security Force, which was supporting operations in Afghanistan, according to reports. The seven-month deployment was connected to the post-Sept 11 Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nHe has an Army Commendation Medal and two Army Achievement Medals, according to the Stars and Stripes.\n\n\"Tim Walz has embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances of his military career for years,\" said Behrends in a second social media post co-authored with Herr during Walz's second gubernatorial campaign.\n\nBehrends said he hung a giant yellow sign on his grain silo during Walz's 2022 gubernatorial race, reading, \"Abject failure! Walz is a traitor! Vote him out!!\"\n\nHe told The Post that Harris made the wrong choice in tapping Walz as the Democratic candidate for vice president.\n\n\"I think picking Walz shows the nation the incompetence of vetting who he is,\" Behrends said. \"I would think they wouldn't want his baggage.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tim Walz on its website to reflect that he did not retire as a command sergeant major, as it previously said.\n\nPolitico reported that the campaign website described Walz, a National Guard veteran, as a \"retired command sergeant major,\" which is the highest rank an enlisted soldier can achieve in the U.S. Army.\n\nThe site now reads that he \"served for 24 years, rising to the rank of Command Sergeant Major.\"\n\nHarris placed Walz's military service front and center at their first rally together in Philadelphia on Tuesday, saying, \"To his fellow veterans, he is Sgt. Maj. Walz.\"\n\nThe governor has frequently described himself as a retired command sergeant major from the Army.\n\nHowever, military records obtained by Alpha News in 2022, as Walz was running for re-election as governor, showed that while he did obtain the rank of command sergeant major, known as an E9, he was demoted to master sergeant, E8, because he failed to complete the requirements to keep the higher rank before leaving the Army.\n\nSpecifically, he did not graduate from the Army's Sergeants Major Academy, among other matters.\n\nRetired Command Sgt. Maj. Thomas Behrends told Alpha News that Walz in fact left the Army in 2005 after receiving a warning order that his unit, 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, was to be deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"He abandoned us. ... As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way, hung his hat up and quit,\" Behrends said.\n\nThe former Minnesota National Guard soldier explained that he was next in line behind Walz in the unit to take the command sergeant major's slot and stepped up and deployed to Iraq for nearly two years.\n\n\"[Walz] can say that he served as a command sergeant major, but he can't say he's a retired one, because he's not,\" Behrends said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Minnesota National Guard in a 2022 statement to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune said, \"Walz attained the rank of command sergeant major and served in that role but retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes due to not completing additional coursework.\"\n\nBehrends told Fox News host Laura Ingraham Wednesday night that Walz \"has used the rank he never achieved in order to advance his political career.\"\n\n\"He still says he's a retired command sergeant major to this day, and he's not,\" Behrends added.\n\nIn fact, his official biography on his Minnesota governor's website says, \"Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005.\"",

Walz.\"\n\nThe governor has reportedly frequently described himself as a retired command sergeant major from the Army, the highest enlisted rank one can achieve.\n\nHowever, military records obtained by Alpha News in 2022, as Walz was running for re-election, showed that while he did obtain the rank of command sergeant major, known as an E9, he was demoted to master sergeant, E8, because he failed to complete the requirements to keep the higher rank before leaving the Army.\n\nRetired Command Sgt. Maj. Thomas Behrends told Alpha News that Walz in fact left the Army after receiving a warning order that his unit, 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, was to be deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"He abandoned us. ... As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way, hung his hat up and quit,\" Behrends said.\n\nThe former Minnesota National Guard soldier explained that he was next in line in the unit to take the command sergeant major's slot and stepped up and deployed to Iraq for nearly two years.\n\n\"[Walz] can say that he served as a command sergeant major, but he can't say he's a retired one because he's not,\" Behrends said.\n\nAlpha News reported that it reached out to the Minnesota National Guard and a spokesman confirmed that Walz did not retire as a command sergeant major because he failed to complete the coursework and other requirements before leaving the military.\n\n\"If he would have went to Iraq, he's still be hiding under his desk over there, because that's just the cowardice that I seen portrayed with him,\" Behrends concluded.\n\nBehrends and fellow retired Command Sgt. Maj. Paul Herr published a joint letter in the West Central Tribune in 2018 when Walz first ran for governor titled, \"The Truth About Tim Walz.\"\n\n\"Tim Walz has embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances of his military career for years,\" the letter began.\n\nThey noted that Walz re-enlisted following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but he would never see combat during his time in the military.\n\n\"In early 2003 he was selected to attend the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy. The non-resident course consists of two years of correspondence coursework, followed by a two-week resident phase at Fort Bliss, Texas,\" Behrends and Herr recounted.\n\nOne of the stipulations that is part of enrolling in the academy is a requirement to serve two years following graduation or promotion to command sergeant major.\n\nIf soldiers fails to complete the school, they can be separated from the Army and will be reduced in rank to master sergeant, E8, unless the promotion board steps in.\n\n\"These stipulations are put in place because the academy is a college level school, the military invests a lot of taxpayer money in the student. The military needs to ensure they will get the return on investment that the taxpayers deserve,\" Behrends and Herr explained.\n\nIn September 2004, Walz was conditionally promoted to the position of command sergeant major of 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion.\n\nThen in early 2005, a warning order was issued to the unit saying prepare to deploy to Iraq.\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005 he quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war. His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for congress,\" Behrends and Herr wrote.\n\nThe veterans highlighted that this was false, because all Walz needed to do was seek permission from the secretary of defense to become a candidate, as many reservists have done.\n\nFurther, \"If he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academy. Instead he waited for the paperwork to catch up to him. His official retirement document states, SOLDIER NOT AVAILABLE FOR SIGNATURE,\" Behrends and Herr wrote.\n\n\"On September 10th, 2005 conditionally promoted Command Sergeant Major Walz was reduced to Master Sergeant. It took a while for the system to catch up to him as it was uncharted territory, literally no one quits in the position he was in, or drops out of the academy. Except him,\" they added.\n\nBehrends and Herr argued Walz falsely claimed for years to be a retired command sergeant major.\n\n\"Yes, he served at that rank, but was never qualified at that rank, and will receive retirement benefits at one rank below. You be the judge,\" they said.\n\nThe 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion would serve in Iraq on a 22-month deployment in 2006 -2007, according to the retired command sergeant majors.\n\nWalz responded to the controversy when if first arose in 2006 when as he was running for Congress, writing in a letter, \"After completing 20 years of service in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for an additional four years following Sept. 11 and retired the year before my battalion was deployed to Iraq in order to run for Congress.\"\n\n\"I'm proud of the 24 years I served our country in the Army National Guard. There's a code of honor among those who've served, and normally this type of partisan political attack comes only from one who's never worn a uniform,\" he added.\n\nBut Behrends and Herr argued that Walz was not even being truthful in that letter.\n\n\"According to his official Report of Separation and Record of Service, he re-enlisted for six years on September 18th, 2001. However, in his response he says that he re-enlisted for four years, conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq,\" they wrote.\n\nFurther, if he had in fact re-enlisted for four years that would have made his retirement date Sept. 18, 2005 rather than when he did \"retire\" on May 16, 2005.\n\n\"And he makes it sound like he 'retired' a year before his battalion deployed to Iraq; when in reality he knew when he 'retired' that the battalion would be deployed to Iraq,\" Behrends and Herr pointed out.\n\nThey concluded, \"The bottom line in all of this is gut wrenching and sad to explain. When the nation called, he quit. He failed to complete the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy. He failed to serve for two years following completion of the academy, which he dropped out of.\n\n\"He failed to serve two years after the conditional promotion to Command Sergeant Major. He failed to fulfill the full six years of the enlistment he signed on September 18th, 2001. He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers. And he failed to lead by example. Shameful.\"", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "randy_desoto@westernjournal.com", "name": "Randy DeSoto", "type":

Tim Walz has \"embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances of his military career for years,\" according to two retired National Guard service members.\n\nRetired Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr also accuse Walz of quitting his post ahead of his unit's deployment to Iraq in 2005, leaving it without a leader at a critical time. Walz, 60, whom Kamala Harris announced as her running mate Tuesday, served in the National Guard for 24 years after joining in 1981 when he was just 17 years old.\n\nIn an open letter posted to Facebook in 2018, Behrends and Herr wrote, \"In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq.\"\n\nThey added, \"On May 16th, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.\"\n\nThe letter goes on to say Walz's \"excuse\" for quitting was that he was running for Congress, but the two called that claim \"false,\" noting that Walz could have requested permission from the Pentagon to run for office while on active duty.\n\nThe two vets further called out Walz's sudden retirement, saying it complicated his promotion to Command Sergeant Major, which had to be nullified after Walz left the service. Behrends and Herr say Walz \"slithered out the door and waited for the paperwork to catch up to him.\"\n\nThe two are not the only ones to raise questions about Walz's military service. Tom Hagen, an Iraq war veteran, wrote a letter to the Winona (Minnesota) Daily News in 2018, calling Walz's retirement \"disturbing\" and saying it \"dishonors those brave American men and women who did answer their nation's call and who continue to serve, fight, and unfortunately die in harm's way for us.\"\n\nWalz responded, ripping Hagen for his \"partisan political attack.\"\n\nWalz maintains he has \"an honorable record\" and has been defended by other service members who led the same battalion.

Vance (R-OH) lit a fire that had only grown larger after he called out his vice presidential opponent Governor Tim Walz (D-MN) for \"stolen valor\" after he ditched his Army National Guard artillery unit shortly before they deployed to Iraq in 2005. The morning newscasts of ABC, CBS, and NBC sprang into action Thursday morning as they openly lied about the sequence of events and what Walz had said on camera.\n\nABC's Good Morning America was arguably the worst as an indignant Selina Wang, their senior White House correspondent, framed the serious criticism and just a desperate attack from a team that was behind. \"While Vance is on the road chasing Harris and Walz, Trump is at home...sending Vance to be his attack dog,\" she declared.\n\nWang did the 'Republicans pounce' meme as she huffed about the Trump/Vance campaign using the Harris-Walz campaign's own words against them:\n\nWANG: Vance accusing his new opponent of lying about his military service, seizing on this moment.\n\nWALZ: We can make sure those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\n\nVANCE: What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq? [Transition] Do not pretend to be something you are not.\n\nKeep an eye on the soundbite they used of Vance there, they edited out a critical point which we'll address shortly.\n\nDespite just playing a soundbite of Walz claiming he carried a weapon in war, Wang told viewers not to trust their lying ears. \"Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years and has never claimed to have seen active combat,\" she declared, parroting campaign talking points: \"The Harris campaign not addressing Walz's comments that he carried a gun in war saying only that he 'carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerous times...'\"\n\n\"Walz ignoring Vance attacks on the trail.

Tim Walz on Minnesota had exaggerated his service record and quit the Army National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq.\n\nSenator JD Vance of Ohio accused Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota on Wednesday of quitting the Army National Guard two decades ago to avoid being deployed to Iraq and of exaggerating his service record to claim falsely that he had served in combat.\n\nBoth provocative charges amounted to some of the sharpest Republican attacks yet on the Minnesota governor, and appeared aimed at disrupting what has been a run of positive news coverage of the Democratic ticket since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Biden as the party's nominee.\n\nThe accusations by Mr. Vance, who served a four-year active duty enlistment in the Marine Corps, about Mr. Walz, whose career in the national guard spanned 24 years, also served to pit the military records of the two major party's vice-presidential candidates against each other.\n\nSpeaking at the police department in Shelby Township, Mich., on Wednesday morning, Mr. Vance said Mr. Walz had effectively deserted his fellow soldiers to avoid serving in Iraq because he retired from the National Guard in May 2005, several months before his artillery unit received orders to deploy there.\n\n\"You abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq,\" Mr. Vance said.\n\nMr. Vance based his accusations on a Facebook post from 2018, and a paid letter to the editor to The West Central Tribune that same year in which the writers, Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, both retired command sergeant majors in the Minnesota National Guard, accused Mr. Walz of \"conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq.\"\n\nThe criticisms were first

Now, after several days of being hammered on Minnesota Governor and vice presidential candidate Tim Walz's heavily embellishing his military record, the campaign is responding - by quietly amending Walz's campaign bio:\n\nSorry, but that's too little, too late.\n\nKamala Harris' presidential campaign updated its online biography of running mate Tim Walz's military service amid Republican efforts to question his record in the Army National Guard.\n\nOn its website, the Harris campaign axed a reference to Walz as a \"retired command sergeant major\" and now says that he once served at the command sergeant major rank -- a small change that nonetheless reflects his true rank at retirement from the Army National Guard. Walz, the governor of Minnesota, served for 24 years in the National Guard before retiring in 2005 from the military to run for the U.S. House, where he became the most senior enlisted soldier to serve in Congress.\n\nThat's not the part that many of us veterans, combat and non-combat alike, objected to the most.\n\nSee Related: Even CNN Torches Tim Walz in Blistering Fact Check About Carrying Weapon 'In War'\n\nTim Walz's Campaign Claimed He Was Going to Iraq Even As He Was in the Process of Deserting His Men\n\nThe edits are, to put it bluntly, weaksauce, in that they gloss over only one part of the objections veterans have to Walz's claims.\n\nIn the original biography, the same sentence called Walz \"the son of an Army veteran and a retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard himself,\" website archives show. A Harris campaign spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Walz's gubernatorial office in Minnesota, the website for which still describes him as \"Command Sergeant Major Walz.\" Walz's campaign website for governor also used this title.\n\nThere is no mention of Walz's claims about carrying \"weapons of war in war\":\n\nAs you can see, that X post, from the Harris-Walz campaign, is still up. He never carried these \"weapons of war\" in war. He was never anywhere near a war. He never deployed to a designated combat zone. Gov. Walz is lying.\n\nBut here's the real kicker: The lie that started Walz's political career, when he was confronted at a protest of an appearance by then-President George W. Bush:\n\nHis challenge prompted a KGB-style interrogation that was sadly characteristic of Bush campaign events. Do you support the president? Walz refused to answer. Do you oppose the president? Walz replied that it was no one's business but his own. (He later learned that his wife was informed that the Secret Service might arrest him.) Walz thought for a moment and asked the Bush staffers if they really wanted to arrest a command sergeant major who'd just returned from fighting the war on terrorism.\n\nDid you get that? Walz - who has never in his life been on the same continent as a war zone - described himself as a \"command sergeant major who'd just returned from fighting the war on terrorism.\" Everything in that statement is a lie. Tim Walz is a liar. His political career began with a lie, and he's been lying ever since - and if he ever ends up as Vice President of the United States, he will continue right on lying.\n\nFortunately, America's veterans and others will most certainly continue bringing the heat to the Harris-Walz campaign over Walz's lies:\n\nThe post reads:", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ward_clark@redstate.com", "name": "Ward Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Frey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Frey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

They come days after Vice President Kamala Harris chose the governor as her running mate earlier this week. Vance, who served in the U.S. Marine Corps., is the first Iraq veteran to appear on a presidential ticket.\n\n\"When the US Marine Corps asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance posted Wednesday on X. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that's shameful.\"\n\nWalz, a Nebraska native, enlisted in the National Guard out of high school at 17 and served 24 years.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign emailed NewsNation the following statement Wednesday:\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nWalz's unit, Minnesota's 1-125 FA Battalion, deployed to Iraq in September of that year. His departure as a sergeant major has followed him throughout his political career, including during his initial congressional bid and again when he ran for governor in 2018.\n\nIn 2018, Behrends and retired Command Sgt. Maj. Paul Herr wrote a paid endorsement letter to the West Central Tribune accusing Walz of abandoning his unit.\n\n\"His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for congress,\" the letter stated. \"Which is false, according to a Department of Defense Directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have.\"\n\nNewsNation has reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign for additional comment.\n\nTrump's military involvement -- or lack thereof -- has also been the subject of speculation.\n\nTrump was diagnosed with bone spurs in his heels in 1968, which led to his medical exemption from the military during Vietnam, The New York Times reported. The podiatrist who diagnosed Trump has since died, but his daughter told The New York Times the diagnosis was a favor to Trump's father.

They have a Midwestern (though, in fairness, Minnesota is much more of an ersatz Canada than Midwestern) veteran high school coach to take the edge off Kamala's particularly nutty form of Marxism. Things haven't worked out that way.\n\nWithin hours of Walz's announcement, it became apparent that his military service was characterized by opportunism and selfishness rather than the servant leadership that is the tradition of the United States Army. RedState has covered the issue exhaustively since it emerged.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nUPDATED: MN Gov. Tim Walz Accused of Cowardice and Embellishment of Army Service Record by Former Peers - RedState\n\nA Tale of Two Veterans: What the Service of Walz and Vance Tells Us About the Men - RedState\n\nTim Walz Goes Full Metal Stolen Valor in Anti-Gun Rant - RedState\n\nAs Walz's Military Record Combusts Under Casual Scrutiny, the Left Goes for Whataboutism - RedState\n\nJD Vance Rightly Calls Tim Walz Out for Being a Sheep and a Coward - RedState\n\nVA Senate Candidate and Navy Combat Veteran Hung Cao Weighs In on Kamala's VP Pick, Stolen Valor Tim Walz - RedState\n\nThe media has been torn over the subject. CNN debunked Walz's claims that he served in combat (see Even CNN Torches Tim Walz in Blistering Fact Check About Carrying Weapon 'In War' - RedState). But the preponderance of evidence is beginning to indicate that Walz himself portrayed his service as duty in combat. A Bloomberg profile posted the day of Walz's announcement specifically says that Walz served in Iraq. It has since been edited with no explanation of how the error came to be (see NEW: The Tim Walz Stolen Valor Scandal Just Got Much Worse Following Bombshell Report - RedState).\n\nThe Harris campaign has sought to minimize Walz's lack of manliness by denigrating JD Vance's service in the US Marine Corps in Anbar Province, Iraq. A top Harris surrogate claimed that Vance had not served in the military; see Top Harris Surrogate's Claim About Vance's Military Service Is So Disgusting Jim Acosta Has to Jump In - RedState.and Harris and Walz Using the 'Big Lie' With No Media Pushback Portends a Very Ugly Campaign - RedState.\n\nOnline, they have been portraying Vance's service as a safe, cushy job because the Marines assigned him to be a public affairs specialist.\n\nI have other questions about Walz's military service. For instance, how did Walz's military career survive doing 95 in a 55 while functionally embalmed? See Tim Walz Drove 95 in a 55, Tried to Flee Police, and Blamed It on 'Deafness' -- RedState.\n\nThis may have been Walz's choice, but it was not a requirement. Many members of the National Guard and Reserve have served in the House and Senate. Tulsi Gabbard is probably the highest-profile example of the last few years. Walz could have decided that service in the Guard cramped his style, but his decision to run for Congress did not necessitate his retirement.\n\nA second emerging narrative is that Walz did not know his unit would be mobilized.\n\nThe Harris-Walz camp is using a former colleague of Walz's as a surrogate to push this story.\n\nWe know for a fact that the mobilization of Walz's battalion was public knowledge months before he retired. How do we know? Walz's Congressional campaign told us.\n\nWalz Still Planning to Run for Congress Despite Possible Call to Duty in Iraq\n\nMarch 20, 2005 -- FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nOn Thursday, March 17 the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced a possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard. First District congressional candidate Tim Walz currently holds the rank of Command Sergeant Major in the 1-125th Battalion, which is based in New Ulm and largely composed of men and women from southern Minnesota. The announcement from the National Guard PAO specified that all or a portion of Walz's battalion could be mobilized to serve in Iraq within the next two years.\n\nWalz, who teaches Global Geography at Mankato West High School, has been an active member of the National Guard since 1981. He has been previously deployed during his 23 years in the National Guard, including an eight month deployment during Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nWhen asked about his possible deployment to Iraq Walz said, \"I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment.\"\n\nAlthough his tour of duty in Iraq might coincide with his campaign for Minnesota's 1st Congressional seat, Walz is determined to stay in the race. \"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq.\"\n\n\"I don't want to speculate on what shape my campaign will take if I am deployed, but I have no plans to drop out of the race. I am fortunate to have a strong group of enthusiastic supporters and a very dedicated and intelligent wife. Both will be a major part of my campaign, whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.\"\n\nIf called to duty, Walz would leave behind his wife Gwen and four year old daughter, Hope.\n\nIn May 2005, Walz retired two years short of the six-year enlistment he was serving and took a one-grade demotion.\n\nFirst off, the idea that the first inkling that Walz got of mobilization was a press release from the National Guard Bureau is ludicrous. The unit command group would have received a warning order, or WARNORD, months before the official notification. What is instructive is that in March, Walz told everyone that he intended to deploy with his battalion. For Walz to retire in May, his retirement request would have already been submitted. He not only abandoned his men, he lied to his constituents.\n\nIn short, neither of the newfound excuses for Walz is operable. He didn't retire from the National Guard to run for office because a) there was no requirement that he do so and b) because his campaign said he would deploy to Iraq with his unit, and the campaign would go on. He did know his unit would deploy to Iraq because it was public knowledge in March and the decision by the Pentagon to call up his unit would have been made months earlier.\n\nMy colleague, Joe Cunningham, has a must-read titled On Tim Walz, Stolen Valor, and American Values - RedState. Americans will forgive a lot of stuff (see the Clinton 1992 and Trump 2016 campaigns). They won't forgive cowardice and duplicity.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz",

Tim Walz, the Democratic Party's vice presidential nominee, both on his claims concerning his military service and for his response to unrest following the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis in 2020.\n\n\"When the police are not empowered to do their job, it is the most vulnerable people in our communities who suffer,\" Vance said. \"We saw that force in 2020 with the summer riots.\"\n\nHe added that Walz was \"promoting rioters and looters\" as they were \"burning down the city of Minneapolis,\" while Harris was \"helping to bail the rioters and looters out of jail.\"\n\nHarris in 2020 called for donations for a bail fund that was used to get rioters in Minneapolis out of jail, but public reports indicated that only some of the money that was raised ended up being used for that reason.\n\nWalz, meanwhile, came under fire in 2020 after he delayed in calling in the National Guard. Protests started in Minneapolis on May 26, 2020, but he did not call the Guard until four days later.\n\nVance further on Wednesday blamed Harris for costs skyrocketing for housing and groceries and said his main priority is to make necessities like groceries, gas, and rent more affordable.\n\n\"The way you do that is really unleashing American energy, unleashing American farmers and not spending like a drunken sailor which is what Kamala Harris has done during her time in office,\" he said.\n\nVance also accused Walz of lying about his military service and claimed that his rival nominee \"dropped out\" of his Army Reserves unit before it went to Iraq.\n\n\"As a Marine who served his country in uniform, when the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance told reporters at a campaign rally in Detroit. \"I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.\"\n\nHe also called it \"shameful\" to prepare a unit to go to Iraq but then \"drop out right before you actually have to go.\"\n\nVance's remarks come in connection with criticism Walz got in 2018 when he first ran for governor. Newsweek reports that at that time, two retired senior officials with the Minnesota National Guard wrote an open letter that criticized Walz for retiring from the military just before his battalion was to head into an active-duty deployment for Iraq.\n\nThey said he left the \"1-125th Field Battalion and its soldiers hanging.\"\n\nVance slammed Walz for saying that weapons shouldn't be allowed on America's streets that he \"used in war.\"\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" said Vance. \"When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone?

The Ohio Sen. JD Vance claim that Walz shirked duty by retiring after learning of the deployment is a baldfaced lie. It was two months after Walz retired that \"his unit received alert orders to deploy to Iraq.\"\n\nTwo. Months.\n\nAccording to records by the National Guard, the 1st Battalion of the 125th Field Artillery received an alert order on July 14, 2005, - two months after Walz retired. The mobilization order came in August and the unit mobilized in October.\n\nHere is Vance's lie about Walz:\n\nWhen Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that's shameful.\n\nThe New York Times, Politico and CNN chose to spike their headlines with click bait by repeating Vance's charge. They broke a cardinal rule of ethical journalism in this age of dis- and mis-information: refuse to amplify the lie.\n\nOnly Politico has subsequently modified the actual story headline (with an insider baseball reference):\n\nHere's the thing. Republicans generated this lie out of whole cloth in 2018 when Walz ran for governor. They reprised it when Walz ran for re-election in 2022.\n\nAll it would have taken to contextualize Vance's lies would have been... I dunno. Anticipating attacks (based on prior campaigns) and running a query? Asking questions? In short, acting like a journalist not a stenographer. When will they learn that these men must be fact-checked in real time?\n\nVance, 40, served a single four-year enlistment in the Marine Corps as an enlisted combat correspondent in public affairs. When he left service in September 2007, he did so as a corporal.\n\nPublic affairs Marines play the primary role in telling the Marine Corps story to a global audience.\n\nHere is Vance's exaggeration about his service:\n\nI agree that lying is \"shameful,\" whether by ommission or commission.\n\nWalz, 60, enlisted in the Army National Guard in 1981, re-enlisted after 9-11, and served 24 years before retiring. When he left service, it was as \"command sergeant major -- the highest enlisted rank for his unit and one with considerable responsibility.\"\n\nWhat did Walz do those 24 years? Why, it seems he provided support for the war in Afghanistan:\n\nAs part of the job, he responded to natural disasters, served with the European Security Force to support the war in Afghanistan, and was stationed around Europe to train with NATO militaries. He received several Army medals and retired as a master sergeant shortly before running for Congress in 2006. Walz has repeatedly said he left the military in order to run for office, not out of cowardice, as Vance implies.\n\nIn his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\n\nIt's going to be a long slog until November if traditional media continue to amplify lies that come as easily as breathing to Donald Trump and Vance.\n\nDemocracy dies when news organizations fall asleep at the wheel.\n\n~~~~\n\nThe stakes in November have never been more urgent, nor the choices more extreme.\n\nRemember: you are not voting for one person. You are voting for a team.\n\nI'm voting for Team America not Team Russia-Hungary-North Korea.", "source": {"uri": "themoderatevoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Moderate Voice"},

Tim Walz of having 'quit' his Minnesota National Guard unit after it was informed to prepare for a deployment to Iraq.\n\nWalz, who is Vice President Kamala Harris' selection as her running mate, served for more than two decades in the Army National Guard, and his selection helps bolster the nominee on defense issues.\n\nThe timing of his separation from the military surfaced during his 2008 campaign for governor.\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends of the Minnesota National Guard accused Walz of having 'embellished' his record and of having abandoned his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress.\n\n'Tim Walz has embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances of his military career for years,' Behrends wrote in 2018.\n\n'In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq,' Behrends and Paul Herr in a letter they posted on Facebook.\n\n'On May 16th, 2005, he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.'\n\n'His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for Congress,' they wrote, calling the claim 'false.' They say the decision left his unit without a critical leader as it prepared for the deployment.\n\nWalz disputed the characterization, telling the Winona Daily News he did not quit due to the deployment orders, in a spat reported by the Daily Wire amid the fierce battle to define Harris' running mate.\n\n'After completing 20 years of service in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for an additional four years following Sept. 11 and retired the year before my battalion was deployed to Iraq in order to run for Congress,' he wrote.\n\nWalz, 60, enlisted in the Guard at the age of 17. He became the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to serve in Congress.\n\nHe said he considered the letter a 'partisan political attack.'\n\n'I'm certainly proud of my military service, but it's one piece of me. It doesn't define me,' Walz told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018. After going through basic training in Georgia, he was deployed to Arkansas, Texas, and the Artic Circle on disaster response and other missions. 'You go where you're told to go,' he said.\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign for further comment.\n\nWalz' duties in a field artillery unit including firing howitzer cannons, a task that according to Walz led to hearing damage that required surgery.\n\nThe blasts, he wrote in an application for benefits, 'would knock us down and after firing I had ringing in my ears.'\n\nHe underwent a surgical procedure in 2005 called a stapedectomy, where doctors replaced damaged earbones with a synthetic ones.\n\nWalz invoked hearing loss during a low point that emerged after Harris selected him over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and other contenders.\n\nBack in 1995, he was pulled over doing 96 mph in a 55 mile per hour zone. He failed a field sobriety test and was arrested for driving under the influence. He later pleaded down the charges to reckless driving.\n\nHis lawyer, Kerry Greeley told the Rochester, Minnesota Post Bulletin that hearing loss played a role.\n\n'He couldn't understand what the officer was saying to him,' attorney Kerry Greeley told the paper.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The issue with those lines of attack, of course, is that they are entirely false.\"\n\nIn the clip, Vance accused Walz of retiring from the National Guard in order to avoid service in Iraq:\n\nWhat really bothers me about Tim Walz, it's not even the positions that he's taken, though certainly he has been a far-left radical, you know what bothers me about Tim Walz, as a Marine who served his country in uniform? When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do and I did it honorably, and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq? You know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\n\nVance also cited Walz justifying his calls for gun control by claiming he simply wants to ban weapons he carried \"in war,\" but Velshi didn't play that part and completely ignored Walz's claim.\n\nInstead, Velshi fact-checked a straw man:\n\n[Walz] responded to floods and tornadoes and he spent months on active duty overseas doing things like training our NATO allies in Italy. Now, Walz has never claimed that he had a combat role in the military. He's never had one.\n\nBut that's not the point, because there's an understanding among people who served this country in the military that you have answered a sacred call no matter what you are, whether you're in reserve or you're active duty, no matter whether you're a cook or mechanic or fighter pilot, no matter whether you serve at home or abroad, you see combat or not. Tim Walz never saw combat. But you know who else didn't see combat? JD Vance.\n\nVance was a civil affairs Marine who took photos, wrote stories, and escorted journalists around Iraq. But that doesn't matter because neither of these two men have ever pretended they had combat roles. They both had incredibly important non-combat roles, and they are both veterans. And we should be grateful to both of them for their service to this nation.\n\nVelshi is correct, if Walz had just said, \"I served in the National Guard for 24 years,\" even Republicans would find that admirable, but he embellished his record in order to create a fallacious appeal to authority argument in favor of gun control, and that's the problem.\n\nWalz also embellished his rank, but, again, Velshi ignored that, \"The only reason Walz ultimately left the National Guard was to run for Congress. I mean, to go back and listen to how he presented himself even in that very first run for office, doesn't sound like stolen valor to me.\"\n\nIrony officially being dead, Velshi played a radio of Walz's 2006 congressional campaign, \"I am a retired command sergeant major in the Minnesota National Guard.\"\n\nBefore he appoints himself the guardian of truth, Velshi should at least learn what the definitions of \"entirely\" and \"false\" are.\n\nALI VELSHI: It does seem that both JD Vance and Donald Trump have found potentially potent lines of attack. The issue with those lines of attack, of course, is that they are entirely false.\n\nJD VANCE: What really bothers me about Tim Walz, it's not even the positions that he's taken, though certainly he has been a far-left radical, you know what bothers me about Tim Walz, as a Marine who served his country in uniform?

We're just going to put that aside as it relates to JD Vance for a little while because I want to talk about this particular issue.\n\nOn its face, with no context or fact-checking, that line of attack, the idea that governor Tim Walz is lying about his military service, is potent. We saw an incredibly similar fabricated line of attack in 2004 against the then-Democratic nominee for president, John Kerry. And those completely made-up attacks led to nearly 20 percent of voters saying they didn't think that Kerry deserved his war medals.\n\nI should note that the one person who orchestrated that fabricated line of attack against John Kerry was Chris LaCivita, who is now Donald Trump's chief campaign strategist, but like in Kerry's case back in 2004, this allegation of stolen valor against Walz is just wrong. Tim Walz served in the National Guard for 24 years. He responded to floods and tornadoes and he spent months on active duty overseas doing things like training our NATO allies in Italy. Now, Walz has never claimed that he had a combat role in the military. He's never had one.\n\nBut that's not the point, because there's an understanding among people who served this country in the military that you have answered a sacred call no matter what you are, whether you're in reserve or you're active duty, no matter whether you're a cook or mechanic or fighter pilot, no matter whether you serve at home or abroad, you see combat or not. Tim Walz never saw combat. But you know who else didn't see combat? JD Vance.\n\nVance was a civil affairs Marine who took photos, wrote stories, and escorted journalists around Iraq. But that doesn't matter because neither of these two men have ever pretended they had combat roles. They both had incredibly important non-combat roles, and they are both veterans. And we should be grateful to both of them for their service to this nation. The only reason Walz ultimately left the National Guard was to run for Congress. I mean, to go back and listen to how he presented himself even in that very first run for office, doesn't sound like stolen valor to me.\n\nTIM WALZ [2006]: I am a retired command sergeant major in the Minnesota National Guard. And after years of firing artillery, I sustained severe inner ear damage. Because I have good health insurance provided through my employer, I was able to have surgery on my ear. As my ear healed, my hearing was gradually restored.\n\nOne morning several weeks after the surgery, I awoke to a sound I couldn't identify. I asked my wife what I was hearing and she told me, \"Tim, that's your 4-year-old daughter, Hope.\"\n\nYou see, Hope wakes up singing every morning, but I had never heard that sound until that day. I'm running for Congress because I believe we as a country have a moral obligation to ensure that every father can hear his daughter sing, that every citizen receives the best care our medical community has to offer. I'm Tim Walz, and I approve this message because I've heard how important healthcare is to everyone.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Velshi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ali Velshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Active duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Wagner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Wagner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fighter pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Our West Wing Playbook colleagues report that her campaign is thinking about setting up a big joint interview with her and Walz -- but they're generally skeptical that such moments provide much electoral value.\"\n\nDemocrat strategist Christy Setzer all but admitted that the Harris-Walz strategy consists of using the media while at the same time avoiding any tough questions and saying nothing of any substance at rallies.\n\nHarris \"is showing all of us that you don't need to do high-profile interviews or press conferences in order to get attention from the media or from voters,\" Setzer told the Hill. \"I'd say she has a robust communications strategy.\"\n\nStill, the marching orders the legacy media are dutifully following are essentially the same they were given when Joe Biden was still atop the Democrat ticket.\n\nGOP candidate Donald Trump summed it up:\n\nKamala refuses to do interviews because her team realizes she is unable to answer questions, much like Biden was not able to answer questions, but for different reasons. He is just plain \"shot,\" and she is just plain \"Incompetent.\" Her policies of Open Borders, No Fracking or Drilling for Oil in any Way, Shape or Form, Transgender \"anything,\" Anti Israel but gross incompetence toward getting anything done for the Palestinians, No Clue on Inflation, or the Economy, Unlimited Money to fight Foreign Wars, and so much more, are CATASTROPHIC.

The Fake News is the Enemy of the People!\n\nUrgent: Support Free Press Foundation\n\nThat Harris-Walz \"robust communications strategy,\" however, has hit a major snag -- the issue of Walz's military stolen valor.\n\nThe Walz stolen valor story \"goes back to the very beginning of his political career. From the onset of his foray into national politics, Walz sold himself to the public and the media as a combat veteran of the Global War on Terror, masking the reality that he quit the military to run for office and avoid being deployed to Iraq,\" Jordan Schachtel wrote in The Dossier blog on Wednesday.\n\nSchachtel details the history of Walz's deceit on his military record.\n\nThanks to some quality reporting, we know that the Minnesota governor -- who yesterday officially joined the Kamala Harris campaign for President as its VP on the ticket -- quit the military in 2005, after learning that his battalion was about to be sent to Iraq. Walz spent his entire career in the Army National Guard learning to lead people into battle, with training and his lone six month overseas deployment to Italy provided at U.S. taxpayer expense. He then retired when he learned he was going to be leading people into battle in Iraq, leaving Minnesota's 125th Field Artillery Regiment high and dry for a career in politics.\n\nBut that's not what Tim Walz told the public when he decided to run for public office upon abruptly leaving the military.\n\nJust months after leaving his battalion to go to Iraq without him, he announced a run for Congress, and the dissembling about his serivce record began immediately.\n\nInstead of being honest about his early departure from the military, Walz told the media a much more heroic tale, one that was entirely ficticious.\n\nTrump on Wednesday called Walz \"a disgrace to our country\" on Truth Social, linking to a Newsweek op-ed by podcast host and Army veteran Dan Holloway calling \"Tim Walz's abandonment of his unit . . . unforgivable.\"\n\nPolitico reported that the Minnesota National Guard was notified of its deployment in July 2005, two months after Walz announced his run for Congress. There were, however, rumors at the time of Walz's announcement that his battalion could be deployed, retired command sergeant major Joseph Eustice, who served with Walz, told ABC News.\n\n\"As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way and hung his hat up and quit,\" said Tom Behrends, a retired command sergeant major who replaced Walz on a deployment to Iraq.\n\nSchachtel noted that Walz \"continues to lie to the public about his military service.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the X account for the Harris campaign posted a video of Walz discussing the need to disarm American citizens.\n\n\"We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" Walz tells the audience.\n\nHuman Events editor Jack Posobiec cited the story of Sgt. Kyle Miller of the Minnesota National Guard, who was 19-years-old and a soldier in Walz's unit.\n\n\"He was killed by an IED on the deployment Tim Walz abandoned,\" Posobiec noted.", "source": {"uri":

He was a six-term congressman, a public school teacher and a football coach.\n\nThe 60-year-old governor -- who was announced as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on Aug. 6 -- also brings something else to the ticket: military experience.\n\nWalz spent 24 years in the Army National Guard, eventually rising to the rank of command sergeant major.\n\nThe Nebraska native enlisted in the Army National Guard at age 17 after graduating high school, according to his congressional biography.\n\nHe served full time with the reserve force after attending Chadron State College and before becoming a high school teacher and coach, according to his gubernatorial biography.\n\nDuring his tenure in the National Guard, Walz responded to natural disasters, including floods and tornadoes, according to a 2018 Minnesota Public Radio report.\n\nHis battalion was also stationed overseas to support Operation Enduring Freedom -- a component of America's war on terror -- though he never saw combat.\n\n\"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that,\" Walz told the outlet. \"I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nHe also earned multiple military awards, including a pair of Army Achievement Medals and was named Minnesota's Citizen Soldier of the Year in 1989, according to Military.com.\n\nWalz retired from the National Guard when he was 34 after becoming a command sergeant major -- which is described by the Army as a \"senior NCO (non-commissioned officer) of the command at battalion or higher levels.\"\n\nHe was elected to the House of Representatives in 2006 after campaigning on an anti-war platform, according to NPR.\n\nOnce in office in 2007, he voted for an amendment to recall U.S. troops from Iraq after 90 days, though he later voted in favor of supplemental war funding.\n\nWalz was re-elected five times, leaving office in 2018. At the time, he had the distinction of being the \"highest-ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in Congress,\" according to his congressional biography.\n\nDuring his 2022 campaign for governor, his opponent criticized him as having left his battalion shortly before it deployed to Iraq, according to the Star Tribune.\n\nWalz said he retired in order to run for Congress.\n\n\"We all do what we can. I'm proud I did 24 years,\" Walz said, according to the outlet. \"I have an honorable record.\"\n\nSince becoming governor, he has said he valued his time with the military, claiming it gave him valuable experience.\n\n\"I couldn't be more grateful for the skills that being a member of U.S. Army National Guard gave me,\" he said in a 2020 Minnesota National Guard news release.\n\n\"In the Guard, you put your community first,\" he said. \"Everything you do, you do to ensure the health, safety, and security of the people who are depending on you. And as Governor, those are principles of servant leadership that I rely on every day.\"\n\nHarris' choice of Walz as her running mate all but guarantees the next vice president will have military experience.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brendan_rascius@charlotteobserver.com", "name": "Brendan Rascius", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chadron_State_College", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chadron State College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_reserve_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military reserve force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War on terror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achievement_Medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Achievement Medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military.com", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-commissioned officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Public_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Public Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.I._Bill", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "G.I.

He did not see combat, yet, in a video shared by the Harris-Walz campaign, he said that he carried weapons \"in war.\"\n\nHe also faces harsh criticism from Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Republican Vice Presidential Nominee JD Vance for not going to Iraq with his battallion. Cotton, a veteran who did two combat tours in the U.S. Army, says Walz \"let his troops go to war\" in Iraq \"without him.\"\n\nThe sentiments echo those of two Army command sergeants major who wrote that when Walz retired on May 16, 2005, he left \"1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war\" in a letter published in the West Central Tribune in 2018.\n\nWalz notably filed to run for Congress in February 2005 before the unit was notified of potential deployment in March 2005. However, the alert came two months before his retirement.\n\nFinally, Walz's bio implied he retired at the rank of E-9 when he actually retired as an E-8. However, he did serve as an E-9 for a time before leaving as a master sergeant E-8.\n\nRep. Jim Banks (R-IN), an Afghanistan veteran, ripped Walz on Wednesday as a \"fraud\" and remarked it is \"Crazy that Kamala would pick a running mate who lied about his military service.\"\n\nCrazy that Kamala would pick running mate who lied about his military service. Either her vetting process led by Eric Holder was very weak or she doesn't care ... or both!\n\n-- Jim Banks (@Jim_Banks) August 7, 2024\n\n\"Either her vetting process led by Eric Holder was very weak or she doesn't care ... or both!\" said Banks, the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Indiana.\n\nBanks also posted a picture of himself from his time deployed in the Army as part of a larger trend on X.\n\nRep. Brian Mast (R-FL), a veteran bomb disposal expert of the U.S. Army who lost both of his legs to an improvised explosive device, hammered Walz.\n\n\"Tim Walz LIED about his rank. He LIED about serving in Afghanistan,\" he wrote in a post on X. \"And now, according to CNN, Walz LIED about carrying weapons of war in a war zone.\"\n\nU.S. Air Force veteran Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), whose husband, also a veteran, was shot in Afghanistan fighting al-Qaeda and received a Bronze Star, blasted Walz for \"claiming to be a combat veteran.\"\n\n\"Today is Purple Heart day and we have a guy who is claiming to be a combat veteran as Harris' running mate. Disgusting,\" she stated on X.\n\nRep. Mike Waltz (R-FL), a combat-decorated Green Beret, broke down the problems the Democrat vice presidential pick is facing in a 1:35 video posted to X. He focused on both Walz's rank and his \"walking away from his soldiers after they had been called to go to Iraq.\"\n\n\"I commanded Green Berets,\" the Florida congressman emphasized. \"Everything that you do prepares you for that moment when you have to lead your men and women into harm's way. It's kind of like the quarterback of a big team walking away from their team right before they go to the Super Bowl.\"\n\nAnother Florida combat veteran, Rep. Cory Mills (R), blasted Walz while speaking with Fox News's Laura Ingraham on her eponymously-named show The Ingraham Angle.\n\n\"I think it's very clear when your job as a leader is to continue to try and fight and deploy alongside your troops that the idea of running for politics should be the last thing on your mind,\" Mills, an Army veteran who served in Iraq and received a Bronze Star, said.\n\nRep. Ryan Zinke (R-MT), a retired U.S. Navy SEAL commander, weighed in as well, with criticisms of Walz and Harris. Zinke notably served in Iraq, leading special operations.\n\n\"In 2005 Walz abandoned his unit just like Kamala abandoned Americans in Afghanistan and she abandoned our closest allies in Israel,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Tim Walz didn't fight for us then. He didn't fight for Minnesota when she burned in 2020. And he won't fight for you now,\" Zinke said.\n\nRep. Ronny Jackson (R-TX), a Navy veteran and former physician to multiple U.S. presidents, ripped Walz as a \"lying coward.\"\n\n\"Your 'war stories' disgust me and disgust most other veterans that actually deployed in defense of this country!\" he wrote, addressing Walz. \"SIMPLY PUT, YOU ARE PATHETIC AND A NATIONAL DISGRACE!!!\"\n\nVeteran Rep. Derick Van Orden (R-WI), who saw five combat deployments and retired as a Navy SEAL senior chief, called Walz \"a coward\" as well.\n\n\"As the actual longest-serving enlisted member of Congress in the history of our nation, I am disgusted by this and would shun him from any military function,\" he wrote.\n\nRep. Rich McCormick (R-GA), who served in the Marines and Navy with service in combat zones, said, \"Georgia's military community will find it rather repugnant that Walz opted to retire from the National Guard right when he found out his unit was headed to Iraq.\"\n\nLaurie Buckhout, a candidate for North Carolina's First Congressional District and a decorated Army colonel combat veteran, also ripped Walz as a \"coward\" who \"quit\" on his unit.\n\n\"I understood the full extent of my commitment to this country when I served in the Army for 26 years,\" Buckhout wrote in a post on X. \"But when @Tim_Walz heard his unit was mobilizing to Iraq...he quit.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_gilbertson@breitbart.com",

As Soon as the Shots Were Fired'", "body": "A former member of the National Guard unit in which Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz once served slammed Walz's actions in leaving the unit.\n\nRetired Command Sgt. Maj. Thomas Behrends sounded off in 2022 as Walz, now the Democratic Party's vice presidential candidate, was in the middle of his successful campaign to be re-elected governor of Minnesota.\n\n\"He abandoned us,\" Behrends said in an interview with Alpha News posted to YouTube.\n\n\"I mean, what the hell kind of a leader does that,\" Behrends said.\n\n\"As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way and hung his hat up and quit.\"\n\nWalz spent 24 years in the National Guard, according to USA Today, beginning with the Nebraska National Guard in 1981. He then served in the Minnesota National Guard from 1996 to 2005. Walz has said he re-enlisted in the Guard after the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn an extensive 2018 Facebook post, Behrends and fellow retired Command Sgt. Maj. Paul Herr said, Walz \"has embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances of his military career for years.\"\n\nIn the post, they alleged, \"In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq.\"\n\nThey wrotee, Walz said he would go on the mission, but \"it appears that was a lie\"\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005 he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" they wrote.\n\nThe post said Walz did not need to quit to run for Congress, but the two men wrote that Walz \"slithered out the door.\"\n\nThe post said that if Walz's story is to be believed, the four-year hitch he said he signed up for, which they claimed was actually six years, would have expired on Sept. 18, 2005.\n\n\"Why then did he 'retire' on May 16th, 2005, before his supposed four-year enlistment was up? And he makes it sound like he 'retired' a year before his battalion deployed to Iraq; when in reality he knew when he 'retired' that the battalion would be deployed to Iraq,\" they wrote.\n\n\"The bottom line in all of this is gut wrenching and sad to explain. When the nation called, he quit.\" they wrote.\n\n\"He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers. And he failed to lead by example,\" they wrote.\n\n\"On top of that he failed to uphold the seven Army Values: Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage.

Tim Walz (D-Minn.) and Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio).\n\nAt issue is the specifics of either man's years in the armed forces, a topic that was quickly ignited between their camps this week after the vice presidential matchup was set.\n\nVance, who served in the Marines, took the opening shot on Wednesday at Walz, who served 24 years in the National Guard. The Republican presidential nominee accused his Democratic rival of \"stolen valor\" for leaving service before a deployment to Iraq and claiming he served in a war.\n\n\"I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance said at a campaign stop in Michigan. \"He has not spent a day in a combat zone. ... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nVance appeared to be referring to a clip of Walz, which the Harris campaign shared on social media, in which the governor says while speaking about gun control, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nWalz has not served in combat. The Hill has reached out to the Harris-Walz campaign for comment. Supporters of Walz have pointed out that Vance admitted in his memoir that he never saw real combat either, and that Walz has never misrepresented his rank.\n\nJacob Thomas, communications director and a spokesperson for the progressive veterans' group Common Defense, said it was \"weird and desperate\" to attack a fellow veterans' military record.\n\n\"That just doesn't seem like a winning message,\" he said. \"We don't need to spend this time hitting each other on things that don't matter. We all served. And like I said, frankly, it just reeks of desperation.\"\n\nWalz and Vance stand out as veterans on national tickets; the first since the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) ran for president in 2008. Former President Trump famously avoided the draft during the Vietnam war after being diagnosed with bone spurs, and Vice President Harris did not serve in the military.\n\nEither man will be the first veteran to serve as president or vice president since President George W. Bush, a former lieutenant in the Texas Air National Guard.\n\nFor Harris and Trump, choosing a veteran with a notable military record was likely a factor in selecting their vice-presidential candidates.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ellen_mitchell@thehill.com", "name": "Ellen Mitchell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "brad_dress@thehill.com", "name": "Brad Dress", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hill_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hill (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Air_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas Air National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

He left somebody else up to take over his spot. He just ditched us.\"\n\n\"It would be a disaster if he ever got to be the commander-in-chief,\" Schilling said of Walz, who was tapped this week as Kamala Harris' running mate.\n\nWalz is described as a retired \"command sergeant major\" in his governor's website biography and has also claimed he carried a gun \"in war,\" despite never experiencing active combat. Walz retired from the Minnesota National Guard before he would have been deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\nVP KAMALA HARRIS PICKING GOV. TIM WALZ AS RUNNING MATE MET WITH MEDIA SCORN: 'SUCH A WEIRD CHOICE'\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard told Fox News that Walz's unit was not given deployment orders to Iraq until July and he had put his retirement papers in five to seven months prior to his retirement in May 2005.\n\n\"He probably knew he wasn't a good leader and he wanted to do something else, and we did get a really good leader with Command Sgt. Behrends,\" Schilling said.\n\nRet. Command Sgt. Maj. Thomas Behrends, who also served with Walz, has also spoken out publicly against Walz's description of his military career.\n\n\"He's used the rank that he never achieved in order to advance his political career,\" Behrends said of Walz on Fox News. \"I mean, he still says he's a retired command sergeant major to this day, and he's not. He uses the rank of others to make it look like he's a better person than he is.\"\n\nArmy Lt. Col. Ryan Rossman, Minnesota National Guard's Director of Operations, detailed Walz's service in a statement to Fox News: \"He held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant, and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion. He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\"\n\nVETERAN WHO SERVED IN TIM WALZ'S BATTALION ADDRESSES STOLEN VALOR ACCUSATIONS: 'FAR DARKER THAN PEOPLE THINK'\n\n\"When I see the leadership that Walz offered to Minnesota,\" Schillling said, recalling Walz' policies during the 2020 riots and COVID, \"I'm thankful he didn't come over there, or we'd have brought back a lot more body bags. Tom Behrends, he saved a lot of lives for us by being a good leader.\"\n\nWhen asked about claims that Walz reportedly made about carrying a weapon during war, Schilling responded that it was \"stolen valor.\"\n\n\"There you go with the stolen valor again,\" he said. \"It's what he made up to advance himself in a political world.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign previously issued a statement on the controversy surrounding Walz's military career: \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as our Vice President of the United States, he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nWalz was deployed to Italy with the Minnesota National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery on Aug. 3, 2003, to support Operation Enduring Freedom.

Tim Walz of Minnesota on Wednesday of quitting the Army National Guard two decades ago to avoid being deployed to Iraq and of exaggerating his service record to claim falsely that he had served in combat.\n\nBoth provocative charges amounted to some of the sharpest Republican attacks yet on the Minnesota governor, and appeared aimed at disrupting what has been a run of positive news coverage of the Democratic ticket since Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Biden as the party's nominee.\n\nThe accusations by Mr. Vance, who served a four-year active duty enlistment in the Marine Corps, about Mr. Walz, whose career in the national guard spanned 24 years, also served to pit the military records of the two major party's vice-presidential candidates against each other.\n\nSpeaking at the police department in Shelby Township, Mich., on Wednesday morning, Mr. Vance said Mr. Walz had effectively deserted his fellow soldiers to avoid serving in Iraq because he retired from the National Guard in May 2005, several months before his artillery unit received orders to deploy there.\n\n\"You abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq,\" Mr. Vance said.\n\nMr. Vance based his accusations on a Facebook post from 2018, and a paid letter to the editor to The West Central Tribune that same year in which the writers, Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, both retired command sergeant majors in the Minnesota National Guard, accused Mr. Walz of \"conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq.\"\n\nThe criticisms were first leveled by Mr. Behrends and Mr. Herr during Mr. Walz's first campaign for governor.\n\nBut Joseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the national guard who led the same battalion as Mr. Walz and served under him, said in an interview on Wednesday that the governor was a dependable soldier and that the attacks by his fellow comrades were unfounded.\n\n\"He was as good a soldier as you'd find, and to have two former sergeant majors say that he wasn't, it's just not true,\" Mr. Eustice said, adding that he disagreed with Mr. Walz's politics and most likely would not vote for him in November even though they were friends.\n\nMr. Eustice recalled that Mr. Walz's decision to run for Congress came months before the battalion received any official notice of deployment, though he said there had been rumors that it might be deployed.\n\nThe two men were exercising in early 2005, when Mr. Walz, who was then a command sergeant major, turned to Mr. Eustice, who was then a first sergeant, and said: \"I got to ask you something. I'm thinking about running for Congress,\" Mr. Eustice recalled.\n\n\"I said, 'What the hell's wrong?'\" he added. \"I mean, why would you want to do such a thing?\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign did not provide any new details about the timeline of Mr. Walz's decision to retire. Instead, it pointed to other past comments from fellow guardsmen who said that Mr. Walz had been considering running for office for some time and that the decision to retire from the military had weighed heavily on him.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform,\" said Ammar Moussa, a campaign spokesman, \"and as vice president of the United States, he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Vance also seized on a remark by Mr. Walz in a video clip that the Harris campaign had promoted on social media on Tuesday, in which the governor told a crowd about support for gun control, saying that \"we can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nMr. Walz never served in combat, however, which prompted Mr. Vance to accuse him of \"stolen valor.\"\n\n\"I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did,\" Mr. Vance said.\n\nMr. Walz was deployed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, but not in a combat zone.\n\n\"The governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" Mr. Moussa said. \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nMr. Vance assailed Mr. Walz over his military record in response to a reporter's question about Mr. Walz's suggestion, in his debut speech alongside Ms. Harris the previous night, that Mr. Vance had misrepresented himself as a voice of the working class.\n\n\"Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires and wrote a best seller trashing that community,\" Mr. Walz had said. \"Come on. That is not what Middle America is.\"\n\nBut Mr. Vance's comments were also reminiscent of the \"Swift boat\" attacks in 2004 that effectively cast doubt on the military exploits of Senator John Kerry, then the Democratic presidential nominee. A key strategist behind those attacks, which helped doom Mr. Kerry's bid for the White House, was Chris LaCivita, who is a senior strategist for the Trump campaign.\n\nMr. Walz's long years in uniform began when he enlisted as an infantryman in the Nebraska Army National Guard in 1981, a few days after his 17th birthday. When he transferred to the Minnesota National Guard in the 1990s, his job changed to artillery.\n\nHe retired in 2005 as a master sergeant but had served earlier as a command sergeant major, one of the Army's highest enlisted ranks.\n\nThe accusation also recalled similar criticisms that former President Donald J. Trump has faced about avoiding military service. The three-time Republican presidential nominee sidestepped the war in Vietnam thanks to a deferment related to bone spurs in his heel, a medical assessment that was made as a favor for Mr. Trump's father, the doctor's daughter told The New York Times in 2018.\n\nPatrick Murphy, a former U.S. Army captain who was a roommate of Mr. Walz's when both served in the U.S. House, said he was dismayed by the attacks on Mr. Walz's military record.\n\n\"Anyone who tries to criticize his record but looks the other way at Donald Trump's six deferments to Vietnam is beyond the pale,\" said Mr. Murphy, a Pennsylvania Democrat.\n\nMr. Vance was on active duty with the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007 during the Iraq war.\n\nMr. Vance, who then went by the name James D. Hamel, was assigned to the Second Marine Aircraft Wing, one of the Marine Corps' largest subordinate commands that oversees aircraft such as fighter jets and helicopters. He was deployed to Iraq in 2005 and 2006 with the aircraft wing but did not see combat as a frontline combatant.\n\nHis official military occupation, known as a combat correspondent, meant he was tasked with basic communication roles such as writing articles about the happenings in his unit.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Democrats say they've learned since. - The Boston Globe", "body": "But the distinguished Vietnam record that Kerry had made the centerpiece of his campaign quickly came under attack by a shadowy outside veterans group, one that helped sink his White House bid.\n\nNow, with the first military veteran on the Democratic presidential ticket since Kerry, that tactic is resurfacing. And it's being led by Republican Donald Trump's campaign and its chief, who was a key part of the 2004 attacks on Kerry.\n\nWithin a day after Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was unveiled as the Democrats' vice presidential pick, Trump's running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, led the Republican attack on Walz's 24-year service in the Army National Guard.\n\nBut Democrats said they've learned from 2004, when Kerry's campaign responded slowly to what they called smears by the group called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth after the type of small river patrol craft that Kerry commanded in the war.\n\nThose 2004 attacks had such an impact the strategy became its own political term of art -- swift-boating -- and Democrats want to avoid having another candidate torpedoed by it.\n\n\"I think we saw 20 years ago with the swift-boating of John Kerry, who served honorably in Vietnam, that we cannot presume that unfounded attacks will implode under their own lies,\" said Representative Jake Auchincloss, a Newton Democrat and Afghanistan war veteran. \"We have to specifically and substantively call them out for the bad faith attacks that they are and then to hit back to make clear that we are not going to be pliant in this.\"\n\nVance, a Marine veteran who served as a military journalist and deployed to Iraq for six months, hit Walz on two points on Wednesday, accusing him of \"stolen valor garbage.\" Vance criticized Walz for retiring from the National Guard in 2005 before his unit received orders to deploy to Iraq and for comments he made on at least two occasions referring to \"weapons of war that I carried in war\" when Walz never served in combat.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\" Vance told reporters in Michigan. \"He said, 'We shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets.' Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in a war?\"\n\nOther Republicans also accused Walz of misrepresenting his military rank when he retired.\n\nWalz has rebutted similar attacks in past campaigns, with support from another soldier in his unit. Walz retired to launch his bid for Congress, not to avoid serving in Iraq, the Harris campaign said, adding that he began the process to do so before any deployment was official.\n\nWalz was aware of a possible deployment to Iraq in March 2005 when he was already running for Congress, according to a press release from his congressional campaign at the time. He retired in May 2005 and his unit received its deployment orders two months later, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. The unit did not finish its training and go to Iraq until March 2006, according to the National Guard.\n\nThe Harris campaign also defended his \"weapons of war\" comment while not disputing that he did not serve in combat.\n\n\"In his 24 years of service, the governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" the campaign said in a statement. \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nAs for the rank dispute, Walz attained and served at the rank of command sergeant major, but retired without it due to incomplete coursework. The Harris campaign changed its website to say he had risen to the rank before retiring, according to multiple news outlets.\n\nThe Trump campaign sees an opening with Walz to slow the Democratic momentum since Vice President Kamala Harris stepped in as the nominee after President Biden announced he would not seek reelection. Trump's campaign cochair, Chris LaCivita, was an adviser to Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in 2004 and said he intends to follow the same playbook.\n\n\"Birds of a feather will be tarred together,\" LaCivita told RealClear Politics about Walz and Kerry. In a statement, Trump campaign senior adviser Brian Hughes echoed Vance's comments and referred to the Democrat as \"Stolen Valor Walz\" and \"a fraud.\"\n\nKerry's Vietnam War service was the cornerstone of his political career. While serving in combat in South Vietnam, he commanded a swift boat and earned several medals, including three Purple Hearts for being wounded as a result of enemy action. Kerry returned from service and became an activist against the war.\n\nWith the United States enmeshed in the controversial Iraq war in 2004, Kerry leaned heavily on his military service in his campaign against President George W. Bush as the rationale for the war -- the country's supposed weapons of mass destruction -- turned out to be unfounded. Kerry accused Bush, who did not serve in Vietnam because he volunteered for the National Guard, of misleading the nation into war.\n\nAfter the convention, the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth published a book and began running TV ads questioning his military leadership and the validity of some of his medals, while criticizing his anti-Vietnam War activities. The Kerry campaign called the attacks lies and tried to counter them. But Kerry later acknowledged they didn't do enough in the weeks after the convention.\n\n\"Within the leadership of the campaign there was a strong view that the lies had been exposed. Some argued that there was no need to 'waste money' on ads regarding something the public wasn't concerned about,\" Kerry wrote in his 2018 memoir, \"Every Day is Extra.\"\n\nBut he acknowledged it ultimately was his fault for not responding more forcefully.\n\n\"What I should have done was stop the campaign, stand up with my crew and answer every lie in detail and create and air ads to run in every market where theirs ran,\" Kerry wrote.\n\nAsked by reporters Thursday about the Walz attacks, Harris said, \"I praise anyone who has presented themselves to serve our country. And I think that we all should.\" Democratic elected officials -- particularly military veterans -- have gone on TV and social media defending Walz.\n\n\"We're not going to allow this to happen. We're going to defend one of our own because it's not okay,\" Representative Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat and Army veteran, said on a Democratic National Committee conference call Thursday that included Auchincloss and other veterans. The call was about the threat they said Trump and Vance pose to veterans' benefits, but nearly every person on the call spoke up against the Walz attacks.\n\nCriticizing Walz's military record could be a problem for Trump, who avoided serving in the Vietnam War because of five draft deferments. But Republican strategist Doug Heye said attacking Walz logically falls to Vance. And the attacks could harm Walz, depending on what the facts ultimately are.\n\n\"The heart of what we're being told about Tim Walz is his character,\" Heye said. \"So if there's a problem with his character, whether it's something he did or didn't do in military service or as a coach or a teacher, it certainly matters.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Vets_and_POWs_for_Truth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Swift Vets and POWs for Truth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Auchincloss", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Auchincloss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newton, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newton, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_LaCivita", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris LaCivita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Star Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Vance says his rival running mate is guilty of 'stolen valor' - one of the biggest sins in the military.\n\nVance, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, told DailyMail.com on Wednesday: 'Your job as a senior enlisted guy in a unit is to keep your people safe. That's not a job you can switch out of on a moment's notice'.\n\nWalz's gun control comments in 2018 saying 'we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets' have also raised eyebrows because he didn't see combat.\n\nThe Harris campaign have strenuously denied the allegations and insist the former teacher had decided to pursue a career on Capitol Hill long before he left the military, and point to fellow soldiers who have praised his leadership.\n\nMiller loved to make paper roses. It's one of the many things his mother misses about him every day\n\nIn response to Mrs Miller's claims, Walz spokesperson Lauren Hitt told DailyMail.com: 'The Governor honors Kyle Miller's service and mourns him and all those fellow guardsmen and service members who made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\nRead More Tim Walz accused of quitting Guard unit to avoid Iraq deployment\n\n'After 24 years of service, Governor Walz retired from the Guard to run for Congress, where he was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform and their families - speaking out about the unacceptable human cost of these wars and increasing funding and mental health resources for the military members who served in them.'\n\nBut those he served with say he stepped aside just as rumors started to circulate that they could be deployed.\n\nMrs Miller still has immense pride for her son 20 years later, but her resentment for Walz lingers.\n\nShe said Kyle truly believed in his duty to serve and keep Americans free and safe.\n\nHe signed up for the National Guard during high school and had dreams of going to college.\n\nHe was three months into his Iraq tour working primarily in communications when he volunteered for an operation on June 29, 2006.\n\nMiller says her son Kyle would keep her on her toes and was 'smart' even as a child. She remembers how he would make her blush every day, his sense of humor and how he was a flirt with the ladies\n\nMinnesota National Guard soldiers pay their respects to Kyle after he was killed by the roadside bomb in Iraq in 2026\n\nHe was a passenger in the first vehicle of seven in a convoy when it ran over a roadside bomb.\n\nThe explosion blew in the doors of his Humvee and he suffered catastrophic injuries.\n\nColleagues rushed to get him to hospital, but their efforts were in vain.\n\nAt the same time, Walz was running his Congressional campaign for Minnesota's 1st District. He won the election less than five months later.\n\nKyle's mother found out when her daughter called her crying with the news. Then she got that knock on the door every military family dreads.\n\nIt took a week for Mrs Miller to get her son's body back to Minnesota.\n\nMrs Miller was amazed by the respect shown at his funeral by those who had grown up around her son.\n\nHis legacy lives on in The North Star State in the form of a life-size bronze statue in Brewster, south west Minnesota.\n\nKyle is kneeling in the center of a pentagon pedestal memorial to fallen soldiers.\n\nTwenty-one footprints made from the boots work by Ryane Clark - a Minnesota native killed in Afghanistan in 2010 - lead to the center.\n\nMinnesota Gov.

Walz is pictured right while serving with the U.S. Army National Guard in 1992\n\nMrs Miller misses her son every day and with Gold Star families helps keep his memory alive with events such as the Fallen Heroes high school football game every fall.\n\nShe remembers how he would make her blush every day, his sense of humor and how he was a flirt with the ladies.\n\n'He kept me on my toes. He was a smart kid.'\n\nTwo-year-old Kyle had already mastered part of the alphabet and was driving round his yard in a John Deere lawn tractor.\n\nWhen he was five years old he was doing the foxtrot and lighting up the dance floor in a little tuxedo and tails.\n\nKathy Miller (second from left) stands with Gold Star Moms at a memorial ride for veterans.

Tim Walz speaks at a press conference at Burnsville City Hall about the two police officers and first responder that were killed. (Angelina Katsanis/Minneapolis Star Tribune/TNS)\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard confirmed on Wednesday that Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 running mate, Gov. Tim Walz (D-Minn.), was demoted before his retirement, contrary to the governor's claims that he retired as a command sergeant major.\n\nAccording to Just the News, Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, Minnesota National Guard's State Public Affairs Officer, said that while Walz was temporarily promoted to command sergeant major, the Democrat governor \"retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\"\n\nDespite his retirement as a master sergeant, Walz's official gubernatorial biography states, \"After 24 years in the Army National Guard, Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Aug\u00e9 told Just the News that the Minnesota governor served in the National Guard from April 8, 1981, to May 16, 2005. The National Guard spokesperson noted that Walz served in the Minnesota National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery after his transfer from the Nebraska National Guard in 1996.\n\nREAD MORE: Video: Vance exposes Harris' VP for 'abandoning' troops before Iraq deployment\n\n\"While serving in Minnesota, his military occupational specialties were 13B - a cannon crewmember who operates and maintains cannons and 13Z -field artillery senior sergeant. In Nebraska, he served as a 11Z - infantry senior sergeant, and a 71L - administrative specialist,\" Aug\u00e9 said. \"He held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant, and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion.\"\n\nAfter serving as command sergeant major, Aug\u00e9 explained that Walz \"retired as a master sergeant.\"\n\nArmy Regulation 600-8-19 explains that a soldier who fails to complete conditional coursework will be demoted in rank. The regulation states, \"The Soldier must complete the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Course as a condition of this promotion. Failure to meet the condition will cause demotion per AR 600 - 8 - 19.\"\n\nIn a public letter posted on Facebook in 2018, retired Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr claimed that Walz retired from the National Guard after he was notified that his battalion would be deployed to Iraq.\n\nBehrends and Herr claimed, \"On May 16th, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Behrends, who was deployed to Iraq in place of Walz, told The New York Post, \"He had the opportunity to serve his country, and said 'Screw you' to the United States.

Retired veterans at the time said in a Facebook post that Walz retired from his 24-year tenure in the National Guard after learning that his battalion would be deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"He says that we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on the American streets. Well, I wonder Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq,\" Vance said.\n\n\"He has not spent a day in a combat zone,\" he said. \"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\"\n\nOther vets have come to Walz's defense over the criticism that's been lobbed years ago and back in the forefront, reminiscent of the \"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth\" campaign that badly damaged Democrat John Kerry's 2004 presidential prospects.\n\nChris LaCivita, the Republican strategist who was behind the movement, is a senior strategist for Trump.\n\nWalz, 60, was in the Army National Guard and reached the rank of command sergeant major prior to retiring.\n\n\"Many followers not familiar with the military are asking me 'so what's the big deal about a command sergeant major?' Walz joined at 18 as a private. Rose through the NCO (sergeant) ranks, each requiring extreme competence at increasingly demanding jobs with more people & responsibility at every rank,\" retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Mark Hertling said on X.\n\n\"They know what they're doing. They uphold standards,\" he said. \"So, those are my thoughts on Command Sergeants Major. While I don't know the details of @GovTimWalz career wearing the cloth of our country, just the fact that he volunteered to serve and wore the CSM rank tells me a lot about him.\"\n\nVance is a former Marine who was deployed to Iraq.\n\nNPR's Quil Lawrence, who covers national security, climate and veterans' issues nationwide, reported Vance worked as a \"civil affairs Marine\" who helped escort journalists around the wartorn country. He noted Vance has been careful not to say he served in a combat role.\n\n\"There's a civilian-military divide in this country and very people have firsthand experience, or even family experience, of military service, and I think most veterans, they really don't care what role you had with the proviso that at long as you're not bragging about doing something that you didn't do. And he hasn't done that,\" Lawrence said.\n\n\"He was in Iraq in a very tough year in Iraq. I can tell you, personally, that it was a very violent year and a lot of the combat in Iraq and Afghanistan wasn't really any sort of a frontline combat gunfight,\" he said. \"It was convoys getting blown up and mortars dropping anywhere on anyone, so I think veterans give Vance credit for going and as he says, serving honorably. And he has not been saying that he did anything other than what he did, which was go over and serve honorably.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, avoided service in the Vietnam War through student and medical deferments.\n\nHe said he got a medical deferment for a bone spur in a foot, but could not remember which foot when he talked about it in 2015.

You'll hear about his leadership, you'll hear about his time in office, and you'll hear about his military service.\n\nBut here's the truth you won't hear from the mainstream media: Tim Walz abandoned his men before a combat deployment and he abandoned his city when it was literally on fire.\n\nThat's the kind of leader Tim Walz truly is.\n\nYou're already no doubt hearing about how Walz spent 24 years in the Army National Guard and retired as a command sergeant major. He is fond of referring to himself as the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to serve in Congress.\n\nHere's the truth: He indeed spent 24 years as an enlisted soldier in the Minnesota National Guard. As far as I can tell, he deployed once to Italy and once to Norway. But when it was finally his turn to deploy in the actual Global War on Terror, Walz instead chose his own aspirations over leadership. In a letter posted to Facebook in 2018, veterans from his unit said Walz retired from the National Guard after learning his battalion would be deployed to Iraq -- though he assured his troops he would join them.\n\nWalz would have been the Battalion Command Sergeant Major, the highest-ranking non-commissioned officer and arguably the most important leader in his unit. And in the moment they needed him most, when they were about to deploy to Iraq, Walz chose to abandon his men to run for Congress. According to sources within the unit, three of his soldiers died on that deployment.\n\nThis isn't a leader. This is a man who uses others to further his own ambitions, then discards them when they become inconvenient. He abandoned his men and left the military before completing the school necessary to become a Command Sergeant Major -- though this hasn't stopped him from using the title on the Minnesota government site in his bio.\n\nTo me as a combat veteran, this kind of abdication of leadership is unforgivable. It's the true measure of the man, and all I need to know about him.\n\nBut this wasn't his only failure of leadership. He did the same thing when it came to the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots. After allowing the largest city in his state to be overrun by violent protestors who burned entire districts to the ground, Walz scoffed at the mayor's request for National Guard support, referring to the Minnesota National Guard as a bunch of \"19 year old cooks.\"\n\nWere it anyone else, they could plead ignorant. But this was an unforgiveable error for a 24-year veteran of the same State's Guard. Having served, Walz should have known that the Minnesota National Guard boasts 180 Military Police in the 34 Military Police Company and more in the 257 Military Police Company, as well as Air National Guard Security Forces, an infantry battalion, and a cavalry regiment. The National Guard Reaction Force is on standby for rapid deployments in natural disasters and civil unrest scenarios.\n\nAnd still, he refused to deploy his Guard to protect his residents.\n\nThis isn't leadership; it's pandering to extremists to protect his personal ambition.\n\nInstead of holding responsible those who destroyed 1,500 businesses and buildings, caused $500 million in damage, and killed three people, he turned his ire on the police. Walz, like his running mate Kamala Harris, supported the Minnesota Freedom Fund, which bailed domestic terrorists out of jail after their arrests.\n\nWalz continued by supporting defund the police movements, resulting in a 70 percent rise in violent crime and a greater than 500 percent rise in carjackings.\n\nLeadership is decisive and accountable. Walz cuts and runs, then lies and hides.\n\nIn the end, no matter what you hear about Tim Walz, this is the truth: When his men needed him before what would have been his only combat deployment, he was nowhere to be found. He bailed on them to chase political aspirations and three of them died.\n\nWhen his state needed him, he was nowhere to be found. He waited days to call in the National Guard, froze in panic, and then three of his citizens died.\n\nAnd now we're expected to believe that when we need Tim Walz the most, when the fate of the country is on the line, he will be there for us.\n\nHistory shows us that this is too great a lie to believe.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Enlisted rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War on terror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/82nd_Airborne_Division", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "82nd Airborne Division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Lives_Matter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black Lives Matter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-commissioned officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defund_the_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defund the police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_terrorism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Domestic terrorism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carjacking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carjacking"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2444248/tim-walz.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=dc9b187b18d591c4cb5f39ef55604ffc", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Tim Walz -- Kamala Harris's running mate in her 2024 presidential election bid -- endorsed a book that falsely labeled him a \"national guardsman who served in Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe book, Winning Your Election the Wellstone Way, has been available since 2008 and has been making the rounds on social media ever since questions have swirled around Walz's military record. The book's Amazon page features the following endorsement from the governor when he was a then-congressman: \"Winning Your Election the Wellstone Way provides a refreshing look at how to run an election in a grassroots people-powered way -- just as the great Senator Paul Wellstone did -- and win.\"\n\nConsidering that the book falsely said he \"served in Afghanistan,\" Tim Walz either did not read the book before he endorsed it or missed the following excerpt:\n\nWalz ran a campaign that highlighted his real experience and commitment to his community as his qualifications for serving the First District in Congress. A longtime National Guardsman who served in Afghanistan, Walz was a popular high school teacher and football coach...\n\nWhile Walz served in the U.S. military for 24 years before retiring, he never saw combat and has no record of ever being deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq.\n\nMatthew Betley, a screenwriter and novelist, noted on X that he previously corrected a book that falsely described his military record.\n\n\"That's pretty bad. When my first book came out in 2016, one outlet -- without asking me -- described me as fighting in the streets of Fallujah (I wasn't), and I was livid because I felt it dishonored fallen Marines who died in direct combat. I had it corrected immediately because taking indirect fire on a base (I did, a lot) was a lot different than doing patrols in Anbar in 2006. Walz should've forced that book to correct the record. It's shameful and on him,\" Betley said on X in response to the excerpt.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Walz has faced accusations of \"stolen valor\" over his military record, with claims that he \"listed on his official biography a higher military rank than the one he ultimately retired with, drawing criticism from some veterans\":\n\nWalz served in the Minnesota Army National Guard and retired at the rank of master sergeant, or an E-8. However, on his official website bio, he lists a higher rank that he served at for a short period that ultimately was rescinded, as he did not complete all the requirements to serve at that rank. However, his bio implies that he retired at the rank of command sergeant major, or an E-9.\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (OH) also took issue with some of Walz's claims during a press conference on Wednesday:\n\nWhen the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq, to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably. And I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" he added.\n\nA viral video, which the Kamala HQ account on X originally shared on Wednesday, featured Walz touting gun control before saying he carried a weapon in war:\n\nI spent 25 years in the Army, and I hunt ... I've been voting for common-sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can do CDC research ... We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at. [Emphasis added]\n\nThe Kamala HQ account repeated his claim in the post sharing the clip.\n\nA subsequent report from the Washington Free Beacon on Wednesday also claimed that Walz had previously presented himself as a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom. Per Breitbart News:\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), who is facing accusations of stolen valor, allegedly falsely claimed in a previous press release that he was a veteran of Afghanistan.\n\nIn a 2006 press release issued by his campaign, Walz was described as being a \"veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom.\"\n\nThe war in Afghanistan, which began on October 7, 2001, was called Operation Enduring Freedom, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command website. The operation's start came after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\n\"Democrat Tim Walz will spend Sunday, Feb. 19th and Monday, Feb. 20th traveling across Minnesota's 1st Congressional District as he formally announces his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives,\" the press release said. \"Walz, a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom and longtime Mankato educator is unopposed for the DFL endorsement and is slated to challenge Rep. Gil Gutknecht in November of 2006.\"\n\nA photo at the time featured Walz at an anti-President George W. Bush protest in which he was seen carrying a sign that read, \"Enduring Freedom Veterans for [John] Kerry.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors":

Yet, on Wednesday, NewsNation host Leland Vittert interviewed a member of the National Guard put forward by the Harris/Walz campaign and upended their defense with Walz's own misleading words about his service. Ultimately getting the campaign's own expert to denounce what Walz said.\n\nRetired Army National Guard Sergeant Major Joseph Eustice served with Waltz in the Minnesota National Guard for many years, up until his sudden retirement, nearly two months before the unit got the order they'd be getting deployed to Iraq.\n\nEustice had defended Walz claiming, \"The Governor fulfilled his duty. He was a great soldier when he chose to leave he had every right to leave.\" He claimed that there were only \"rumors\" of potential deployment were not substantial and his leaving.\n\nA press release found on Walz' congressional website from 2005 states that the candidate knew as of March 17th of that year that there would be a possible mobilization of nearly 2,000 members of the Minnesota National Guard. These were more than rumors and as a Command Sergeant Major, Tim Walz would have been very aware of an imminent deployment.\n\nVittert then questioned Eustice on the controversial video of Walz claiming to have seen combat, a video which the Sergeant Major had not seen previous to his endorsement of the Harris/Walz ticket:\n\nVITTERT: The second question here is I think a little bit more poignant, which is that oftentimes and there was that video, actually, that the Kamala Harris campaign put out. Where he sure makes it sound like he was in combat, which is something that he never was in. And there's these accusations. Now the line is stolen valor. There are men who were in combat. There were men who didn't come home. There were men who were wounded. To say you were there when you weren't, it just isn't right. How do you come down on that?\n\nEUSTICE: Well, I hadn't heard that he had said that until today. Now., from my perspective, you shouldn't say when you don't, you shouldn't say you used weapons in war when you did not. I do know that our politicians do tend to say things that get embellished or they embellish themselves. And you know I think it is wrong to say you've done something that you didn't do. So if he said that and your video shows that I would say that's very mischaracterization of what took place.\n\n\"You know, I guess I don't think that you should portray yourself in a light that makes you something you weren't. And if that's what he's done. I guess I would say he shouldn't have - he shouldn't have said it. He shouldn't keep saying it. An untruth shouldn't be kept going, especially when it has to do with serving our country,\" Eustice added.\n\nIt is no shock that with a media so bent on furthering the agenda of the Democratic Party, integrity in journalism has been thrown to the wayside as uninformed witnesses testify against major accusations.\n\nLELAND VITTERT: Much of the Tim Walz story revolves around this time in which the National Guard. He talks about, as you can see. It's true. But Walz now tells a very different story about his time in the Guard. Previously over and over. He made it appear he served in combat when he did not.\n\n[Cuts to video]\n\nTIM WALZ: I spent 25 years in the army and I hunt. And I gave the money back and I'll tell you what I have been doing. I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can do CDC research. We can make sure we don't have reciprocal carrying among states and we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\n\n[Cuts back to live]\n\nVITTERT: \"That I carried in war.\" But Walz never went to war, not to Afghanistan and not to Iraq. In fact, he retired so he can run for Congress just months before his unit deployed to Iraq. He didn't go to war. Here's J.D. Vance today.\n\n[Cuts to video]\n\nJ.D. VANCE: Well you know what really bothers me about Tim Walz, as a Marine who served his country in uniform. When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do. And I did honorably and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know, he did. He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people served with.\n\n[Cuts back to live]\n\nVITTERT: All right. Sergeant Major Joseph Eustice served with Walz. In fact, the Harris campaign put out a statement by him. \"Joseph Eustice, 32 year veteran of the Guard who led the same battalion as Walz said, 'The Governor fulfilled his duty. He was a great soldier when he chose to leave he had every right to leave.'\"\n\nIt's good to see you, sir. Thank you for being with us Sergeant Major. It seems to me is there's two issues here. One is, did Walz retire, knowing or having an idea that if you didn't retire and run for Congress at that moment, he was going to go to Iraq. Did you all know that you're probably going to Iraq when he puts in his papers.\n\nJOSEPH EUSTICE: As far as I know, he did not know the timeline is that he retired in May. And at that time, there were all kinds of rumors about us deploying. Cause that's what happens there's rumors that you're going to deploy, you're going to go somewhere or whatever. In May, when he decided to retire, we have no, other than rumors, there was no \"NOS,\" which is the notice of deployment. Which that didn't come until July of that year. And then there's - - I don't remember the name of the 3rd thing that came in August, that told us where we're going.\n\nVITTERT: Fair enough, okay.\n\nEUSTICE: I did talk to him, in prior to his decision to retire. And he told me he was going to become a congressman. Which I didn't think that is a great idea. But, he said -\n\nVITTERT: Why didn't you think it was a great idea?\n\nEUSTICE: I think most of our politicians are in it for the wrong reasons and I didn't think he would be a very good politician. His views matched mine quite a bit and I know I wouldn't be a good politician. I'm not politically correct. I say some things sometimes to without, always thinking them completely through. So he decided, he thought he could win. And I said, \"Oh, well. I guess good luck.\" I - -\n\nVITTERT: Okay fair enough he retired, you cleared this part up that you didn't know - - there were rumors. Lord knows I work in a newsroom, there's a lot of rumors. So I understand that.\n\nThe second question here is I think a little bit more poignant, which is that oftentimes and there was that video, actually, that the Kamala Harris campaign put out. Where he sure makes it sound like he was in combat, which is something that he never was in. And there's these accusations. Now the line is stolen valor. There are men who were in combat. There were men who didn't come home. There were men who were wounded. To say you were there when you weren't, it just isn't right. How do you come down on that?\n\nEUSTICE: Well, I hadn't heard that he had said that until today. Now, from my perspective, you shouldn't say went it you didn't, you shouldn't say you used weapons in war when you did not. I do know that our politicians do tend to say things that get embellished - or they embellish themselves. And you know I think it is wrong to say you've done something that you didn't do. So, if he said that and your video shows that, I would say that's very mischaracterization of what took place.\n\nVITTERT: You know, you always have to be worried. And we always are when we see videos about whether it's real these days, of course, or whether it is taken out of context or anything like that. It's telling that it was put out by the Kamala Harris campaign. I think because of his stance on gun control, right? He was using - -\n\nEUSTICE: Yes!\n\nVITTERT: - - what his experience of war to justify gun control. This has happened before right, 20 years ago they were Swift Vote Veterans for Truth. That was about John Kerry who had talked about getting a purple heart. Here's one of their ads that perhaps ended Kerry's presidential ambitions. Take a listen.\n\n[Swift Boat Veterans Campaign Ad]\n\nVITTERT: Alright Sergeant Major is saying that you were in combat in the way that Tim Walz did as a politician. Is that the equivalent to what John Kerry did and is it disqualifying, maybe not for Governor, but for Vice President?\n\nYou know, I guess I don't think that you should portray yourself in a light that makes you something you weren't. And if that's what he's done. I guess I would say he shouldn't have - he shouldn't have said it. He shouldn't keep saying it. An untruth shouldn't be kept going, especially when it has to do with serving our country.\n\nVITTERT: Well, well said by somebody who served it for an awfully, awfully long time. Sergeant Major, thank you. We appreciate hearing from you. It's notable that Tim Walz has significantly changed how he talks about his time in the National Guard. Now that there's so much more scrutiny.

Vance Wrongfully Attacks Tim Walz's Military R", "body": "NewsOne Featured Video CLOSE\n\nThousands attend a Harris-Walz rally this week Source: BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI / Getty\n\nLook, there's no denying that Donald Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, has been off to a rough start. Racist MAGA constituents have been attacking him for having an Indian wife and children, forcing him to essentially defend the non-whiteness of his spouse by highlighting her other qualities.\n\nMeanwhile, Vance is getting dragged by women across America for essentially telling them that who choose not to have children that they're worthless-while also inadvertently insulting step-parents, adoptive parents and people who are struggling to become parents. He's catching flack for being a middle-class Ivy Leaguer who has tried to pass himself off as an all-American who came from humble beginnings.\n\nThere's more. Some guy on the internet made a joke about him having sexual relations with a couch and now half of social media is clowning him for receiving \"sectional healing.\" On top of all that, the former Trump-hater-turned-Trump-humper has to back his racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, lying, observably unintelligent, criminally convicted felon of a running mate after every nonsensical attack he spits out of his anus-shaped mouth.\n\nSource: Stephen Maturen / Getty\n\nAll this as every new piece of insight we learn about Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, sounds something like: \"Tim Walz rescued a cat from a tree while bringing free lunch to school kids and helping an old lady cross the street while walking his two-dozen rescue dogs and filling in for Santa Clause during the holiday season.\"\n\nMaybe this is why Republicans are desperately reaching for legitimate reasons to attack the man. Trump and his campaign have already claimed ad nauseam that Walz will \"UNLEASH HELL ON EARTH\" by -- *checks notes* -- \"proposing his own carbon-free agenda, suggesting stricter emission standards for gas-powered cars, and embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote.\" (The horror, right?) Republicans (and Van Jones) have also claimed Harris, who is married to a Jewish man, Doug Emhoff, chose Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro to appease antisemitic Democrats.\n\nThe new round of lies and weirdo stuff\n\nNow, Vance is out here attacking Walz on his 24-year military record, because, as Trump has long shown us, all of that pseudo-patriotic \"support the troops\" and \"honor our veterans\" rhetoric goes right out the window when it becomes politically inconvenient.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Wednesday that Vance accused Walz of quitting the Army National Guard after 24 years of service to avoid being deployed to Iraq and lying about being in combat. Neither are true.\n\nFrom the Times:\n\nMr. Vance based his accusations on a Facebook post from 2018, and a paid letter to the editor to The West Central Tribune that same year in which the writers, Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, both retired command sergeant majors in the Minnesota National Guard, accused Mr. Walz of \"conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq.\"\n\nThe criticisms were first leveled by Mr. Behrends and Mr. Herr during Mr. Walz's first campaign for governor.\n\nBut Joseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the national guard who led the same battalion as Mr. Walz and served under him, said in an interview on Wednesday that the governor was a dependable soldier and that the attacks by his fellow comrades were unfounded.\n\n\"He was as good a soldier as you'd find, and to have two former sergeant majors say that he wasn't, it's just not true,\" Mr. Eustice said, adding that he disagreed with Mr. Walz's politics and most likely would not vote for him in November even though they were friends.\n\nIt probably would have been more convenient for opponents of Walz if he had retired a few days, maybe a week before the deployment to Iraq. But the fact that he retired several months before his unit was even notified that it would be deployed indicates that his detractors were and still are stretching themselves into a star-spangled knot to find a legitimate attack against the 60-year-old. And they're failing miserably.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs, and as vice president of the United States, he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" said campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa.\n\nVance also thought he had Walz on the ropes after he came across a video clip Harris' campaign posted Tuesday, in which the governor told a crowd about support for gun control, saying that \"we can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\" Vance took it upon himself to interpret that comment as Walz claiming he was in combat, which he wasn't.\n\nMore from the Times:\n\n\"I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did,\" Mr. Vance said.\n\nMr. Walz was deployed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, but not in a combat zone.\n\n\"The governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" Mr. Moussa said. \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nIt's almost as if Vance has forgotten he is the running mate of an accused draft dodger who once said this about late combat veteran John McCain: \"He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.\"\n\nBut that aside, there was also yesterday. That's when Vance decided the best way forward was to make himself look like a broken toy soldier by trying to storm Air Force Two and get in Harris' face after his plane landed at Chippewa Valley Regional Airport in Wisconsin, where hers also had landed.\n\nBut surprise! Vice President's Harris, already out in the community, wasn't there.\n\nAwkward.\n\nVance was caught on video charging up to the plane with his entourage of white men in suits who looked like they were trying to recreate the opening scene of Reservoir Dogs, standing close to the plane looking stupid for a while and then walking back to talk to reporters in a transparent effort to play off how ridiculous the awkward performance was.\n\n\"Hopefully it's gonna be my plane in a few months,\" he told the reporters.\n\n\"I also thought you guys might be lonely because the vice president doesn't answer questions from reporters,\" he continued. \"I hope that she has changed her mind because it would be good for the American people and I think it would be good for you all if she actually ran a real campaign instead of one from a basement with a teleprompter.\"\n\nAbort Mission. Abort Mission!\n\nIt's unclear what Vance was even talking about since Harris has been the one pressing for Trump to attend a September 10 debate that he already agreed to when he thought was running against President Joe Biden. Trump is the one who had been ducking and dodging the debate before recently walking back his cowardly ultimatum that it be moderated by Fox News. (He still hasn't really committed to it though.) Trump is the one who got up on the stage at NABJ and thought launching racist attacks on Harris' ethnicity would serve as an alternative to answering the questions he was asked.\n\nAccording to The Independent, \"Harris and Walz are in fact touring several battleground states this week,\" while Vance \"is trailing his Democratic rivals with much smaller campaign events.\" If all Vance has up his sleeve are lies about Harris not talking to the media and desperate attacks on Walz's military record, well, he's going to continue to have a rough go of it.\n\nYeah -- good luck with all that.\n\nSEE MORE:\n\nDemocratic Nominee Kamala Harris Picks Minnesota Gov.

It's like I heard someone say in the flurry of digesting the news yesterday: Walz is the guy who wanders into your backyard with a beer in his hand, helps fix the grill, and has a pleasant conversation with every single person at your barbeque. When he leaves, everyone loves the guy.\n\nBut Walz in his own element, comfortable among his peeps speaking his language of revolution and social change, is scary af.\n\nAnother truism I saw yesterday, besides the explosion of information about what he's done to destroy MN while under his purview, alluded to what possible parallels one could expect from a victorious Harris-Walz team:\n\nKamala Harris has progressive plans she wants to enact. Tim Walz and Minnesota are the result when those are enacted in real life.\n\nBut I'm not going to parse the terrifying social programs today.\n\nI've taken an interest in the picture of citizen soldier Walz that was presented yesterday. The vet-cred Walz is supposed to bring that the Harris campaign is so proud of.\n\nThe warrior cred the campaign feels confident enough to use that they posted one of his former appearances speaking of his rationale for gun-control measures. How the weapons of war veteran Walz carried in war shouldn't be allowed anywhere but a battlefield.\n\nWell, okay - he has a right to his opinion.\n\nBut not to his own version of the facts if he's going to use his biography as an appeal to authority as justification in denying your 2d Amendment rights.\n\nBecause Tim Walz has never \"carried\" a weapon \"in war\" because Tim Walz - citizen soldier - has never been to war.\n\nThe closest he got to a battlefield in 25 years in various Guard units was a deployment to Italy.\n\n...In late summer of 2003, First Sergeant Walz deployed with the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom to Italy. The mission was to augment United States Air Force Europe Security Forces doing base security for six months. In no way were the units or Soldiers of the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion replacing any units or military forces so they could deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nThen, when his unit got called up for deployment to an actual war zone in 2005 and Tim Walz had been appointed as their command's acting senior enlisted leader?\n\nTim Walz bugged out on his guys. \"Retired\" to run for Congress, while everyone else he'd trained with left for battlefields in Iraq for almost the next two years.\n\n...In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq.\n\nOn May 16th, 2005 he quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war. His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for congress. Which is false, according to a Department of Defense Directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have. If he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academy. Instead he waited for the paperwork to catch up to him. His official retirement document states, SOLDIER NOT AVAILABLE FOR SIGNATURE.\n\nOn September 10th, 2005 conditionally promoted Command Sergeant Major Walz was reduced to Master Sergeant. It took a while for the system to catch up to him as it was uncharted territory, literally no one quits in the position he was in, or drops out of the academy. Except him.\n\nThey were gone for twenty-two months.\n\nThe two Command Sergeants Major (CSM) - Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr - who penned the above letter to the West Central Tribune were the ones who did go, with CSM Behrends stepping in to take the spot Walz had abandoned (great video interview with him here).\n\n...According to his official Report of Separation and Record of Service, he re-enlisted for six years on September 18th, 2001. However, in his response he says that he re-enlisted for four years, conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq. Even if he had re-enlisted for four years following Sept.11, his retirement date would have been September 18th, 2005. Why then did he \"retire\" on May 16th, 2005, before his supposed four-year enlistment was up? And he makes it sound like he \"retired\" a year before his battalion deployed to Iraq; when in reality he knew when he \"retired\" that the battalion would be deployed to Iraq.\n\nThere was a third CSM who stepped forward to corroborate the accounts of the others.\n\nA third retired command sergeant major is speaking out against Gov. Tim Walz, saying he \"let his soldiers down\" by avoiding a deployment to Iraq in 2005 before running for Congress.\n\nDoug Julin worked his way up to division command sergeant major (CSM) before he retired from the Minnesota National Guard in 2012 after serving 35 years.\n\n\"This was a backdoor deal,\" Julin said of Walz not going on the mission.\n\n...Julin said a group of senior leaders met in early 2005 to get on the same page about the deployment. He said six battalions in total were going on the Iraq mission and four were from Minnesota. Julin recalled that Walz was at this meeting because he had just been conditionally promoted to the rank of command sergeant major of the First Battalion-125th Field Artillery. According to Julin, Walz said he would be going on the deployment.\n\n...Julin said he was most upset with how it was handled because Walz didn't come to him as brigade command sergeant major, the position he held at the time.\n\n\"He went around my authority to get out of the position. I probably would have told him 'No, you're going on the deployment,'\" Julin said.\n\n\"At that point in time my focus wasn't on Tim Walz walking out the door. My focus was on all the enlisted. I had to make sure all the soldiers had their head on straight. Their health and welfare were at the forefront, and we had to make sure they had everything they needed to do their jobs,\" he added.\n\nHe said, however, that Walz pulling out set a tone.\n\n\"Soldiers are thinking, 'What does he know that I don't know?' That's the kind of message it sends,\" he said.\n\nIn the short time since news of Walz's selection as Harris's running mate broke, there has been a tremendous amount of information emerging on this aspect of the governor's career. He has claimed to be a retired \"Command Sergeant Major\" (E-9 pay grade) which is completely wrong. He held the rank temporarily, never completed the requirements for the permanent rank, and bugged out before bothering to even sign his paperwork. The Army reduced his retired pay grade to E-8.\n\nHe wasn't ever truly the \"highest ranking enlisted member of Congress\" because he wasn't ever promoted to the rank he claimed he was.\n\nSo flying under a false flag there? Yeah. You could absolutely make that argument.\n\nAnd about that trip to Italy? It got kind of a heroic burnishing job just a couple of months after ditching his unit when it came time for Walz's first congressional run.\n\n...Instead of being honest about his early departure from the military, Walz told the media a much more heroic tale, one that was entirely fictitious.\n\nBloomberg's Joshua Green, then employed at The Atlantic, was the first major reporter to profile Walz. In an interview with the then-congressional candidate, Green writes that in 2004, Walz left his hometown in Minnesota \"to serve overseas in Operation Enduring Freedom.\"\n\nCommand Sergeant Major Tim Walz is a twenty-four-year veteran of the Army National Guard, now retired but still on active duty when a visit from President George W. Bush shortly before the 2004 election coincided with Walz's homecoming to Mankato, Minnesota. A high school teacher and football coach, he had left to serve overseas in Operation Enduring Freedom. Southern Minnesota is home to a large Guard contingent that includes Walz's unit, the First 125th Field Artillery Battalion, so the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are naturally a pressing local concern -- particularly to high school students headed into the armed services.\n\nIt's unclear if this is Green, a veteran reporter, omitting major facts, or if Walz, the interviewee, is selling Green on a particular narrative. Nonetheless, the assertion is incredibly misleading, as it leaves the reader under the impression that Walz served as boots on the ground in the Global War on Terror, when in reality, he merely deployed to Italy in 2003 for a six month stint.\n\nIf this is the best they could do for vet cred, it might well have been better not to have any at all. As Rep Mike Waltz noted this morning, you betcha vets are talking about this.\n\nAnd you know how you take the temperature of what the \"military community\" is saying?\n\nAnd a shameless Military.com feature - I mean, breathtakingly partisan - extols the wonders of Walz while screaming, \"FAR-RIGHT, FAR-RIGHT, FAR-RIGHT\" when it comes to any question of his exit from the service. They are also desperate enough to claim Walz's diagnosis via the VA of tinnitus makes him an expert on Veterans Affairs.\n\nI Schlitz you not.\n\n...His Guard career included responding to natural disasters in the United States, as well as a deployment to Italy to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan, according to a 2018 article by Minnesota Public Radio. Walz earned several awards, including the Army Commendation Medal and two Army Achievement Medals, according to his military records. Working a civilian job as a high school teacher and football coach, the Nebraska native was also named that state's Citizen Soldier of the Year in 1989, according to official biographies.\n\nDuring the 2022 Minnesota governor's race, Walz' opponent accused him of leaving the Guard when he did in order to avoid a deployment to Iraq, though Walz maintained he retired in order to focus on running for Congress, according to the Star Tribune newspaper.\n\nFar-right commentators and media resurfaced those allegations and knocked him for never serving in combat -- something he has never claimed to do -- in contrast with Vance's deployment to Iraq as a combat correspondent.\n\nBy the by, that tinnitus was also part of his excuse for his DUI.\n\n...Walz's campaign manager Kerry Greeley didn't dispute that Walz was speeding when he was pulled over that night, but she said Walz was not drunk. She attributed the misunderstanding to Walz's deafness, a condition resulting from his years of serving as an artillerist in the Army National Guard.\n\n\"He couldn't understand what the officer was saying to him,\" Greeley said.\n\nShe said deaf people also can have balance issues. The judge eventually threw out the DUI charges against Walz and chastised the officer for not realizing that Walz was deaf, Greeley said.\n\nThis guy's one helluva operator. I mean, DAY-YUM! I can't wait to use that excuse after 12 years on a flight line. Who knew? I also did not know tinnitus could be \"surgically repaired,\" as my doctor tells me I'm stuck with it. What gives?\n\nBack to damage control central - Military.com also does an admirable job of glossing over Walz's inexplicable waffling for four days while Minneapolis burned before calling out the National Guard to finally stop the riots.\n\nOh, golly, says the author - the mayor asked for help when \"some protests turned destructive,\" and Walz sent them right along. The mayor later bitched.\n\n...Since becoming governor of Minnesota in 2019, Walz' role as commander in chief of the Minnesota National Guard has come under a spotlight several times. In response to a request from the Minneapolis mayor, he activated the Guard in May 2020 to assist law enforcement when some protests over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd turned destructive. At the time, Minneapolis' mayor accused Walz of being too slow to order the deployment, a charge he denied.\n\nWhat a tongue bath.\n\nBut that tells you that they know they are in trouble. They even use an Erickson quote about Swift boats, but, again, in the Lefty gaslighting context. The Swiftboat guys had Kerry dead to rights about his lies and exaggerations, so naturally, the Left has turned it into a pejorative.\n\nIf they can get out ahead of the country discovering that Walz is, in reality, a Blue Falcon/Chicken Hawk poseur maybe there's hope they can salvage some military faux moral authority out of this.\n\nThe Harris campaign is going to have to work awfully hard, though, because my military contacts and friends are exploding, as are the social media platforms.\n\nI made the point yesterday a couple of times.

The comment came as Walz made fun of JD Vance's Yale degree followed by his bestseller book attacking the elites.\n\n\"I came from a family where nobody in my family had ever gone to law school.I grew up in a poor family. The fact that Tim Walz wants to turn it into a bad thing, that I actually worked myself through college, through law school and made something myself - to me, that's the American dream.

I did what they asked me to do it, and I did it honorably,\" he said.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,\" Vance said accusing Tim.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" Vance said.\n\nDid Tim Walz never serve in combat?\n\nAs Tim Walz's name was announced, his past credentials as a teacher, as a football coach, service in the military were widely shared. But then came the accusation that Tim Walz \"abandoned his National Guard battalion ahead of its 2005 deployment to Iraq\". But it was claimed that Walz retired from his unit before it received any notice for deployment and his retirement was not to avoid deployment.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

But they diverge on campaign style and what they offer their running mates, political analysts told Newsday.\n\nVance, 40, a second-year senator, is regarded by conservatives as a young firebrand who can carry on Trump's MAGA movement beyond a potential second Trump term. But he has had a rocky launch, having to defend comments he previously made about \"childless cat ladies\" and his belief that families should carry more weight in elections than childless voters.\n\nWalz, 60, a former congressman turned governor, has reportedly told Harris that he has no future plans to run for the White House and is viewed by Democrats as an affable everyman figure who can help Harris gin up support among white male voters, particularly in the Rust Belt. But Walz is now facing his own scrutiny from Republicans over his National Guard service and liberal-leaning policies he enacted as governor.\n\n\"The challenge for both of these vice presidential candidates now, and in the months ahead, is really introducing themselves to a national constituency,\" said William Howell, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago. \"Walz has a longer record, but he was all but unknown at the national level as early as a month ago. And Vance, while he has a fan group at the national level, he doesn't have a kind of presence that Harris or a Trump does. And so much of what we're going to see is just how they introduce themselves to people who've never heard of them before.\"\n\nHere are three ways the vice-presidential candidates are looking to define themselves:\n\nVance became a fixture on the cable news circuit in 2016 after the release of his memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" which describes his time growing up in Middletown, Ohio, and rural Kentucky, surrounded by poverty and addiction. He went on to graduate Yale Law School and work as a venture capitalist.\n\nWalz, who was born and raised in rural Nebraska before moving to Minnesota, has touted his own self-declared \"hillbilly\" background, saying in television interviews that he graduated from a high school class of 24 where half the class were his cousins. Walz is an avid hunter and former high school football coach who political analysts say will help Harris shore up support in Midwestern battlegrounds.\n\n\"The Harris campaign believes that Walz's personal biography gives them the ability to reach out to rural voters in a way that many Democrats cannot,\" said Dan Schnur, who served as communications director for Republican John McCain's 2000 presidential primary campaign. \"Their goal is for him to talk to voters in less populated parts of Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania and hopefully win them. It's not a lot of votes, but in a close election it can make a difference.\"\n\nMilitary Service\n\nBoth men served in the military -- Vance for four years in the Marines and Walz for 24 years in the U.S. Army National Guard -- and while both served stints overseas, neither experienced combat.\n\nVance, who enlisted in 2003 after graduating high school, has raised questions about Walz's decision to retire from the Minnesota National Guard to run for a U.S. House seat in 2005, months before his Minnesota battalion was deployed to Iraq.\n\nWalz, who enlisted in the National Guard in 1981 at the age of 17, faced similar criticisms about the timing of his retirement during his gubernatorial run but has said he made his decision months before his battalion was ordered to Iraq in August 2005. Walz filed to run for Congress in February 2005, and his retirement from the Guard was made official in May of that year, according to military records and media reports. The battalion he served was mobilized in October of that year before it deployed to Iraq in March 2006.\n\nVance served a six-month stint in Iraq in 2005 and was part of a public affairs unit, tasked with writing about the experience of troops. He also spent time visiting Iraqi locals as part of a civilian affairs unit, according to his memoir.\n\n\"I was lucky to escape any real fighting,\" Vance wrote in the book.\n\nWalz, during his time in the guard, was deployed to help with natural disaster recovery efforts. In August 2003 his battalion was deployed to Vicenza, Italy to provide backup to U.S. troops leaving the base there to serve in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nThough Walz never served in a combat zone, he has come under attack from Vance for stating in a 2018 town hall that he carried \"weapons of war . . . in war.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign defended Walz' service in a statement, saying: \"in his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times.\"\n\nElected experience\n\nVance is a relative political newcomer -- having won an open U.S. Senate seat from Ohio in 2022 that was previously held by a Republican. He emerged the victor in a crowded primary field with Trump's endorsement.\n\nDuring his two years in office, Vance has used his time on the Senate floor to promote right-flank positions including opposing U.S. aid to Ukraine and to denounce the Biden Administration's handling of migration at the U.S. southern border.\n\nWalz served in the U.S. House for 12 years, flipping a rural Minnesota seat long held by Republicans in 2006. He was regarded as a bipartisan lawmaker, who was ranked the 7th-most bipartisan House member during the 114th Congress, according to the Lugar Center and the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, which tracks each House member's ability to co-sponsor legislation across the aisle.\n\nHe ran and won his first bid for Minnesota governor in 2018 and was reelected in 2022.\n\nWalz's time in the U.S. House and as governor have given both parties more of a record to analyze compared with Vance. Democrats praise Walz for passing initiatives like free school meals for Minnesota school children and codifying abortion protections into state law. Republicans have taken aim at some of his socially liberal policies, including passing a bill that provided undocumented immigrants the ability to obtain a driver's license and signing an executive order to protect the rights of transgender individuals to receive medical treatments allowing them to live according to their gender identity.\n\nChristopher Malone, a political-science professor at Farmingdale State College, told Newsday that while Vance may not have an expansive legislative record, Democrats will likely look to brand him as inexperienced and unable to step into the role of commander in chief if needed.\n\n\"With Biden out of the race, Democrats will likely pivot to talking about Trump being the oldest nominee and the oldest serving president if he does get reelected,\" Malone said. \"That's why Vance becomes very important, because people may start to think, if Trump is unable to serve a full term, is his vice presidential nominee ready?\"", "source": {"uri":

Tim Walz faced fresh allegations of \"stolen valor\" Wednesday, with accusations that Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate embellished his military service record.\n\nWalz's record was disputed by the Minnesota National Guard, which claimed Wednesday he did not hold the rank of command sergeant major at the time of his retirement in 2005, something that is listed on his official gubernatorial biography. Instead, a spokeswoman for the Minnesota National Guard said the governor retired as a master sergeant \"because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" Newsweek reported.\n\nThe allegations were buttressed Wednesday on Newsmax by retired Army Command Sgt. Maj. Thomas Behrends. Behrends, who served with Walz in the Minnesota National Guard, voiced concerns about Walz's military record during an appearance on \"Rob Schmitt Tonight.\"\n\n\"The goal is to just get the truth out there, let the nation know that this guy is a liar,\" Behrends said. \"He embellishes his record, trying to make it look like he's better than he is. He's got stolen valor. He uses the command sergeant major rank as, you know, as an embellishment for political gain. And it's all a lie.\"\n\nBehrends criticized Walz's calculated decision to leave the military before the unit was being deployed to Iraq, saying, \"I'm not knocking that. But when the United States calls and says, 'Hey, are you going to go to war?' And the answer is 'No, I'm not, you know, screw you. I got better things to do ...' \"\n\nBehrends detailed Walz's departure timeline.\n\n\"Well, you know, the order came out in March of 2005 that that battalion was going to be part of the brigade to go to Iraq,\" he said. \"So it was like the warning order basically saying, well, you're going to be going on a trip, get your will together, you know, get your bags packed, tell your family, do all that stuff. And then, you know, basically two months later in May, I think it was May 16 actually, or close to that time when they had drills, then the rumor came out that he had turned in his papers and turned in his gear and slithered down the stairs and quit after 24 years.\"\n\nThe controversy intensified recently when Walz was confronted by a reporter on a tarmac before a recent campaign event with Harris. The reporter repeatedly asked Walz whether he had a response to an accusation of stolen valor made by Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, Republican Donald Trump's running mate.\n\n\"You know what really bothers me about Tim Walz as a Marine who served his country in uniform? When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance said, according to The Hill. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nBehrends said he's not surprised by Walz not answering the question because he has been \"running from the answer to that question for dang near two decades.\"\n\n\"It's been brought out to him, you know, why did you quit?\" Behrends said. \"And there's never been a response, and it doesn't surprise me one bit. I mean, it's just crazy for him to come up with this stuff and quite a bit of the public actually, they believe it because he [Walz] says it [then] it must be true.\"\n\nAbout NEWSMAX TV:\n\nNEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!\n\nFind Newsmax channel in your home via cable and satellite systems - More Info Here Watch Newsmax+ on your home TV app or smartphone and watch it anywhere!

He told reporters that Walz, who retired from the Minnesota guard after 24 years of service to run for Congress in the 2006 election, had \"dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go [to Iraq] without him.\"\n\nVance also accused Walz of falsely claiming to have seen combat, citing comments the Minnesotan had made about not wanting \"weapons of war\" to be available on American streets.\n\nThe Ohio senator's accusation that his opponent ditched his guard unit rather than deploy to combat is patently false.\n\nAccording to military records, Walz officially retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005, two months before his unit received word that it would be deployed, four months before deployment preparations began and ten months before the unit deployed.\n\nIn a statement, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson strongly pushed back against Vance's claim that Walz had \"dropped out\" rather than deploy with the men he led, instead accurately describing the governor's separation from service as a normal retirement after nearly a quarter-century in uniform.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" they said.\n\nAccording to Army records, Walz's nearly two and a half decades in the Minnesota Guard began at age 17 and ended with him holding the rank of Command Sergeant Major, the highest possible rank for an enlisted soldier.\n\nLike most National Guard soldiers, he was frequently deployed in response to national disasters, but he also was sent overseas to Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the US mission to Afghanistan that toppled the Taliban in the wake of the September 11 attacks.\n\nThe campaign spokesperson also pushed back on Vance's claim that Walz had falsely claimed to have carried arms against the enemy by noting that he never claimed to have seen combat.\n\n\"The Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" they said, including by specializing in heavy artillery to the point of suffering hearing damage as a result of exposure to decades of heavy gun blasts. They added that Walz \"would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country\" and said he thanks Vance for having \"put his life on the line\" by deploying to Iraq as a public affairs specialist with the US Marine Corps.\n\nThe attacks against the governor appear to be the brainchild of Chris LaCivita, one of the two GOP operatives who run former president Donald Trump's 2024 campaign. Twenty years ago, he was one of the consultants who orchestrated a smear campaign against John Kerry, then a Massachusetts senator and the Democratic challenger who sought to deny Bush a second term in the White House.\n\nThe campaign was the work of a GOP group called \"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth,\" ostensibly made up of Vietnam veterans who served with Kerry, a US Navy veteran who earned a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star while commanding small riverine craft in the Vietnamese jungles.\n\nIt was 2004, just three years removed from the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, and Kerry was running against Bush -- and in opposition to the US-led war in Iraq -- by invoking his military service. Opinion polls at the time showed that Americans saw Kerry's record as a positive and put him ahead of Bush after the party nominating conventions that year.\n\nThe \"Swift Boat Veterans\" group responded by airing television ads in which purported veterans who claimed to have served with Kerry criticized him and accused him of being dishonest about his service record.\n\nIt wasn't true. Only one of the people in the ad had actually served alongside Kerry, and the claims they made about Kerry's alleged dishonesty didn't hold up to independent fact-checking. But the damage was done, and Kerry would go on to lose the 2004 election to Bush.\n\nTwo decades later, with Trump foundering in the polls against Harris and Walz, LaCivita began telegraphing his intention to dust off his \"Swift Boat\" playbook just minutes after Walz was announced as Harris's running-mate.\n\nIn response to a post on X (formerly Twitter) noting that Walz -- a former Command Sergeant Major in the Minnesota guard -- was the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in the US Congress during his decade in the House of Representatives, LaCivita wrote that the would-be vice president \"deserted his men and quit before they went to combat.\"\n\nA person close to the Harris-Walz campaign told The Independent that the vice president and a host of surrogates plan to push back hard against any attempt to \"swift boat\" the Minnesota governor and said LaCivita's playbook \"will not work this time.\"\n\n\"It's a tired, old strategy and the American people are too smart to fall for that, especially from anyone allied with a draft dodger like Donald Trump,\" they said.\n\nRick Wilson, a former GOP operative who founded and runs the anti-Trump Lincoln Project super PAC, told The Independent that LaCivita's decision to go after Walz's military record is a sign that he's increasingly desperate and trying to keep from being fired by Trump as the ex-president loses ground to Harris and Walz.\n\n\"Chris is worried about getting fired right now, so obviously he's going to do everything and can to play the LaCivita greatest hits album. If Donald Trump wasn't bunkered down in Mar-a-Lago hiding like a f*****g psychopath, it might be more effective,\" Wilson said.\n\nHe added that the attacks against Walz have \"a fat Elvis imitator vibe\" from \"some guy playing in a casino/gas station 27 miles out of Elko, Nevada.\"\n\n\"Chris and Susie are in real trouble in Trump world, and it's not getting any better,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Tim Walz's candidacy into question centering on his military record.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate, accused Walz of \"lying\" about serving in a combat zone and claiming he \"dropped out\" of the Army after learning his unit was set to be deployed to Iraq. (The governor has said he filed for retirement months before his battalion got its tour order.)\n\nVance's criticisms are regurgitations of similar allegations first made in 2006, the year after he retired from the military to run for Congress, according to CNN.\n\nJ.D. Vance Accuses 24-Year Army Veteran Tim Walz of 'Stolen Valor'\n\nThe network's KFile unit reported on Thursday that at least two people wrote in to Walz's local paper, the Mankato Free Press, that year to accuse him of embellishing his record, claims Walz refuted at the time as defamatory and false. The local paper's letters to the editor also prompted a subsequent flurry of letters in support of the congressional hopeful.\n\nWalz served honorably for more than 24 years in the Army National Guard before retiring, according to CBS News.\n\nIn 2003, he deployed to Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nHis official candidate biography in 2006 used the same wording, saying that he \"served overseas with his battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" but made no mention of where he served. Several campaign ads also featured his military service prominently, but did not mention any specifics of that service, according to CNN.\n\nDespite those omissions, Walz never sought to hide his record, speaking openly in several interviews during his 2006 congressional run about his experience in Italy. He told the local alt-weekly, CityPages, that it was only the \"luck of the draw\" that allowed him to serve in Europe rather than in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nWalz has never explicitly claimed to have been in active combat, but Republicans have fixated on a single 2018 clip of Walz referring to \"weapons of war, that I carried in war\" as a deliberate misrepresentation of his record.\n\nThe Harris/Walz campaign disputed that characterization in a statement this week, writing: \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nVets Group Calls BS on GOP Attacks of Tim Walz's Military Service\n\nThe Minnesota governor had another high-profile defender Thursday in Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), herself a Navy veteran, who went on CNN to declare Republicans' attacks on Walz's service record as \"so incredibly offensive.\"\n\n\"It's reminiscent of the swift boat bulls--t that Sen. John Kerry faced during his election [in 2004],\" she told host Kaitlan Collins. \"It's even more offensive because these accusations are being launched by another veteran.\"\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

Tim Walz (D-MN), embellished and excluded crucial facts about his military career.\n\nIn a letter from retired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends and retired Command Sergeant Major Paul Herr, Walz lied about how long he served in the National Guard despite signing up for another deployment but then quitting early.\n\nAccording to Walz, he reenlisted in the military to serve an additional four years in the National Guard following the September 11 terror attacks, adding that he retired the year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq so that he could run for Congress.\n\nHowever, that is untrue.\n\nInstead, he reenlisted for an additional six years and quietly retired a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq.\n\nMore from Behrends and Herr's letter below:\n\nEven if he had re-enlisted for four years following Sept.11, his retirement date would have been September 18th, 2005. Why then did he \"retire\" on May 16th, 2005, before his supposed four-year enlistment was up? And he makes it sound like he \"retired\" a year before his battalion deployed to Iraq; when in reality he knew when he \"retired\" that the battalion would be deployed to Iraq.\n\nThe bottom line in all of this is gut wrenching and sad to explain. When the nation called, he quit. He failed to complete the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy. He failed to serve for two years following completion of the academy, which he dropped out of. He failed to serve two years after the conditional promotion to Command Sergeant Major. He failed to fulfill the full six years of the enlistment he signed on September 18th, 2001. He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers. And he failed to lead by example. Shameful.\n\nThe letter criticized Walz for abandoning fellow soldiers when they needed a leader the most. The most disturbing part is that Harris' running mate was promoted to Command Sergeant Major in less than eight months and then quit before his duties were met. He was then reduced to Master Sergeant for retirement and served at that rank. However, Walz never qualified for that rank but still reaps its retirement benefits.\n\nOn the contrary, Republican vice president nominee JD Vance (R-OH) served in the Marines for four years as a combat correspondent. He deployed to Iraq with the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, making him the first veteran to appear on a presidential ballot since John McCain in 2008.\n\nFormer Marine Corps special operations team leader Elliot Ackerman said the U.S. needs a leader who has served the country, can make tough decisions, and has experienced life on the battlefield.\n\nIraq War veteran and the CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Allison Jaslow, suggested that the idea of a Marine on the ballot alone could appeal to Americans and encourage them to vote for Vance.\n\nJaslow pointed out that voting for a deployed service member who put their lives on the line shows they are willing to defend the Americans at home.\n\n\"The idea of war or what it takes to defend ourselves from terrorism is all too often an abstract concept that people want to intellectualize, when in reality, it's something that impacts real human lives ... in ways that are lost on many of the American people in real-time today,\" Jaslow said. \"Having a veteran serve in elected office would mean that the men and women whose lives are on the line to defend what we have here at home would be more top of mind than they otherwise would be.\"\n\nVance criticized Walz for misleading the country about his military career, calling it \"shameful\" for the governor to have made a promise to his unit that he would follow through on the deployment and drop out instead right before the troops were slated to leave.\n\n\"As a Marine who served his country in uniform when the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably,\" Vance said. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.\"", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_arnold@townhall.com", "name": "Sarah Arnold", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_correspondent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War correspondent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Marine_Aircraft_Wing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2nd Marine Aircraft Wing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_operations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special operations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/219/1a7044ff-03ad-44a3-a84d-6daf9f3d530f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-11", "textStart": 516, "textEnd": 528}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-09-18", "textStart": 945, "textEnd": 965}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-16", "textStart": 995, "textEnd": 1009}, {"amb": false, "date": "2001-09-18", "textStart": 1660, "textEnd": 1680}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-09-", "textStart": 900, "textEnd": 907}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

His unit received its deployment orders in July 2005, trained through the fall and deployed the following March, according to a 2007 article on the National Guard's website.\n\nIn a press call hosted by the Democratic National Committee, Reps. Jason Crow, D-Colo., and Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., excoriated Vance for calling Walz's military service into question. Crow is an Army veteran, and Auchincloss served in the Marines.\n\n\"To try to do one of the worst things you can do in America -- that is to attack a veteran and their service -- it's old, it's tired, and America is just not going to put up with it,\" Crow said. \"And we're not going to put up with it.\"\n\nThe subject of the press call was to highlight the progress made in the two years since President Joe Biden signed the PACT Act, which expanded health benefits to veterans exposed to toxic substances while serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo. But the Vance-Walz controversy received just as much attention, if not more.\n\nAuchincloss said the Trump campaign's attacks on Walz are intended to distract from former President Donald Trump's \"long track record of disparaging veterans.\"\n\n\"He called those who gave the last full measure of devotion 'losers' and 'suckers' and he can try to deny it as much as he wants, but a four-star general and his own staffer heard him say it and has confirmed it on the record repeatedly,\" Auchincloss said, referring to former Trump White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.\n\nAuchincloss also criticized Vance for \"repeatedly\" saying \"he wants to cut and run from our allies, including the freedom fighters in Ukraine, and has said that we should not support Taiwan should it come under attack.\"\n\nThe Massachusetts congressman added, \"If I were Donald Trump, with five deferments from Vietnam as a favor to my father, I would be very cautious about opening the door to attacks on those who served honorably.\"\n\nTrump received five draft deferments in the 1960s, when the U.S. joined the Vietnam War: four to attend college and one for a diagnosis of bone spurs in his heels.\n\nSeparately on Thursday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan with the Navy Reserve, also defended Walz, writing in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that Walz \"served honorably and well.\"\n\nAuchincloss said it's \"critical\" that Democrats push back on baseless claims like the ones made by Vance.\n\n\"I think we saw 20 years ago with the 'swift-boating' of John Kerry, who served honorably in Vietnam, that we cannot presume that unfounded attacks will implode under their own lies,\" he said. \"We have to specifically and substantively call them out.\"\n\nCrow said of the Trump campaign: \"It just shows how morally bankrupt they are. They have no ideas. They have no vision for the future. All they can do is attack and lie and twist and contort.\"\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., a former Navy helicopter pilot, said during the press call the veteran community is \"excited\" Harris selected Walz as her running mate.\n\n\"It really speaks to so many of us to see somebody with that fantastic record of public service to want to raise his hand again and serve again as our vice president of this great nation,\" she said.\n\nVance also highlighted a past quote, shared Tuesday by the Harris campaign, in which Walz, speaking about gun restrictions, said, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance asked. \"When was this? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone.\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\"\n\nNBC News reported Wednesday that a Harris campaign spokesperson did not deny Walz had embellished in the video when he spoke about carrying weapons of war.\n\n\"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" the spokesperson told the network. \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country.

Tim Walz state of the state address (Screenshot Office of the Governor of Minnesota/YouTube)\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' campaign quietly edited Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's biography on Thursday to remove a reference to him as a \"retired command sergeant major.\"\n\nWalz has fallen under scrutiny from Republicans for referring to himself as a retired command sergeant major when, in reality, he was only conditionally promoted to the rank but failed to perform the training necessary to permanently obtain it before retiring as a master sergeant in 2005, according to a statement provided by the Minnesota National Guard to Just the News on Wednesday. Harris' website referred to Walz as a \"retired command sergeant major\" until at least Thursday morning, according to an archived copy of the page, but has since clarified its description to note that he once served as command sergeant major without stating that he retired as one.\n\n\"[Walz] retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, a Minnesota National Guard's State public affairs officer, told Just the News. \"The Soldier must complete the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Course as a condition of this promotion. Failure to meet the condition will cause demotion per AR 600 - 8 - 19,\" according to Army rules.\n\nWalz's original biography on Harris' campaign website called him \"the son of an Army veteran and a retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard himself,\" according to an archived version of the page. The current version of the website, however, calls him \"the son of an Army veteran who served as a command sergeant major.\"\n\nWalz is also facing allegations that he retired from the Minnesota National Guard early to avoid deployment to Iraq, claims Democratic operatives have denied. Walz, however, knew his battalion was likely to be deployed to Iraq when he retired as he mentioned the possibility in congressional campaign materials published before his retirement, the Washington Free Beacon reported Wednesday.\n\n\"When your country calls, you are supposed to run into battle -- not the other way,\" retired command sergeant major Thomas Behrends, who took Walz's place after his retirement and was deployed to Iraq, told the New York Post on Tuesday. \"He had the opportunity to serve his country, and said 'Screw you' to the United States.

Tim Walz says that Walz was aware his unit would deploy to Iraq before he decided to retire in 2005 despite some claiming that he had no idea about the upcoming deployment.\n\nAccording to MPR News, Bonnifield, who met Walz in 1999, said in a 2018 interview that Walz debated focusing on a run for Congress or staying in the National Guard, knowing there was an upcoming deployment to Iraq.\n\nMPR News reported:\n\n\"He weighed that decision to run for Congress very, very heavy,\" Bonnifield said. \"He loved the military, he loved the Guard, he loved the soldiers that he worked with, and making that decision was very tough for him. Especially knowing that we were going on another deployment to Iraq. He didn't take that decision lightly at all.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nBonnifield also told a News Nation reporter on Thursday that accusations that Walz retired to avoid a deployment were \"bullshit\" but then confirmed that Walz knew an upcoming deployment for the unit was an \"inevitability\":\n\nBonnifield says the entire unit was convinced it was an inevitability that they WOULD be deployed to Iraq soon. They hadn't been given the orders to deploy yet. But Bonnifield says they, Walz included, assumed it was coming:\n\n\"He told us that he wanted to run for Congress, and he was in a tough spot, because he was pretty sure we were going to Iraq. We didn't have orders. We didn't have any kind of orders at all. At this time, he was pretty sure we were going, and he was in a position that pretty sure meant we were going.\"\n\nSupporters of Walz note that he retired from the National Guard in May 2005, and his unit received an alert order for deployment in July 2005 and official orders in August 2005. However, troops -- particularly leaders, which Walz was at the time -- typically know about official notifications months in advance.\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard acknowledged in an email sent to reporters that there are \"unofficial alerts\" and notices and told Breitbart News it did not have any information on when an unofficial notice may have been given to Walz's unit.\n\nJoel Berry, Marine veteran and managing editor of the Babylon Bee, noted that units receive \"warning orders\" before \"alert orders\" to deploy.\n\nThe media is trying to report that Tim Walz retired before he knew his unit was deploying, since he retired 2 months before his unit received \"alert orders\" to deploy. What they're not telling you is that units also receive something called \"warning orders\" much earlier -- months, sometimes years in advance. Tim Walz knew his unit was deploying to Iraq, which is why he quit.\n\nEven according to Walz himself, he was acutely aware of the likelihood of a deployment by at least March.\n\nWalz had filed as a candidate for Congress on January 5, 2005, according to a Federal Election Commission document, and, in March 2005, his campaign sent out a press statement that said the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced a \"possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard.\"\n\n\"The announcement from the National Guard PAO specified that all or a portion of Walz's battalion could be mobilized to serve in Iraq within the next two years,\" Walz's campaign said in the statement. In the statement, Walz said he did not know if his unit would be part of the mobilization but acknowledged that, as the top enlisted leader of his unit, he had a \"responsibility\" to \"ready my battalion for Iraq\" and \"serve if called on.\"\n\nDespite this statement, he retired two months later.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Public_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Public Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Soldier-Who-Served-Under-Tim-Walz-Says-He-Knew-of.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-01-05", "textStart": 2832, "textEnd": 2847}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-", "textStart": 1670, "textEnd": 1678}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-07-", "textStart": 1735, "textEnd": 1744}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-08-", "textStart": 1768, "textEnd": 1779}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-03-", "textStart": 2910, "textEnd": 2920}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Vance slammed Kamala Harris's V.P. pick on Wednesday amid reports that Gov. Tim Walz had skipped out on being deployed to Iraq with the Minnesota National Guard.\n\nVance, who served with the U.S. Marines in Iraq, said it was 'shameful' if Walz had retired in 2005 just as his battalion was preparing to go to war.\n\n'I mean, your job as a senior enlisted guy in a unit is to keep your people safe. That's not a job you can switch out of on a moment's notice,' Vance told DailyMail.com during an exclusive interview aboard his campaign plane, nicknamed Trump Force Two.\n\n'So if he abandoned his troops before they went to Iraq or wherever ... absolutely shameful.'\n\nWalz, the governor of Minnesota, was named by Harris as her running mate on Tuesday.\n\nHe appeared alongside her at a campaign rally in Philadelphia later that day.\n\nBut reports quickly resurfaced of anger among his former brothers in arms who accused him of 'betraying' his country just as they were preparing for deployment\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends of the Minnesota National Guard accused Walz of having 'embellished' his record and of having abandoned his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress.\n\n'In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq,' he wrote on Facebook in 2018.\n\n'On May 16th, 2005, he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.'\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Vance was on his way to Michigan for a campaign event hours before Harris was due to arrive in the same spot.\n\nHe said his role was to remain 'laser-focused' on scrutinizing her policy failures on immigration, energy and manufacturing.\n\nBut he added he was astonished that the Harris campaign had not checked out Walz's military record and accused him of lying to make a political point.\n\n'There was a clip the Kamala campaign posted about him where he's making a gun control argument,' ' said Vance. ' He said, Look, you should not be able to carry the weapons that I carried in war.\n\n'And I'm, I'm thinking to myself, well, when did you go to war? What weapon did you carry in the war, Tim, because apparently you skipped out on your unit before they went to Iraq.\n\n'I know he didn't go to a combat zone, so why is he lying to make a political point?'\n\nVance, who grew up in Ohio, is seen by the Trump campaign as key to eating into the Democrats' so-called 'blue wall' of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Wednesday, he will first be in Shelby Township, Michigan, and at 2 p.m. in Eau Claire, Wisconsin.\n\nThe aim is to keep pressure on Harris, who is due in both places a few hours later.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

When a Local Vet Called Him Out, His Office Did Nothing.\n\nWalz launched his first congressional campaign as 'a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom'\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz has described himself as \"a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the official name of the U.S. government's war in Afghanistan following the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nBut Walz never deployed to the Middle East. And, when an Iraq war veteran confronted Walz's aides with evidence of what he called \"stolen valor,\" his aides didn't do much to address his concerns.\n\nAs a first-time congressional candidate in 2006, Walz's campaign announcement described him as \"a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" an archived version of the press release shows. Two years earlier, in 2004, Walz organized a protest against then-President George W. Bush in Mankato, Minn. A photo of the rally shows Walz carrying a sign reading \"Enduring Freedom Veterans for Kerry.\"\n\nSuch a title historically applies to someone who served on the ground in Afghanistan during the Global War on Terrorism. Walz, a 24-year veteran of the Army National Guard, spent time in Norway in support of NATO forces and in Italy working in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. He had never seen combat, he told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018.\n\nWalz's claims spurred Iraq war veteran David Thul, a sergeant in the Minnesota National Guard, to approach Walz's aides at the Democrat's Mankato office in 2009. Thul filmed the encounter, in which a staffer told Thul she was \"not aware\" of Walz serving in Afghanistan. Thul went on to present the 2004 photo of Walz, as well as Walz's website, to another aide, who acknowledged that constituents could get the false impression that Walz served in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Operation Enduring Freedom is limited to Afghanistan and the airspace directly above,\" Thul told the aide. \"Congressman Walz is clearly claiming ... to be an Enduring Freedom veteran. Nobody disputes the fact that he is not an Afghanistan or Enduring Freedom veteran. So this represents a fairly serious issue.\" Asked whether he understood how constituents could falsely \"assume that means [Walz] served in Afghanistan,\" the aide responded, \"Perhaps, I guess.\"\n\nThe aide did not dispute that Walz was pictured in the 2004 photograph, and, indeed, a 2006 Atlantic article describes the spectacle of the future governor protesting the Bush visit with a group of high school students. The aide told Thul he would follow up with him. A source familiar with the situation said neither Walz nor his staffers followed through with that pledge.\n\nWalz, who has called himself a \"citizen soldier,\" has been accused before of embellishing his military service. Two Minnesota National Guardsmen said in 2022 that Walz falsely claimed he reached the rank of command sergeant major. But Walz did not fulfill the duties required to maintain that rank before he quit the service in 2005.\n\nAnd Walz, in a video posted this week by the Harris campaign, called for a ban on the kind of guns \"that I carried in war,\" the Washington Free Beacon reported.\n\nStolen Valor: Tim Walz launched political career on false claim as combat veteran in the War on Terror\n\nVP candidate told public and media that he ran for office after fighting in Iraq.\n\nThe Tim Walz Stolen Valor story goes back to the very beginning of his political career. From the onset of his foray into national politics, Walz sold himself to the public and the media as a combat veteran of the Global War on Terror, masking the reality that he quit the military to run for office and avoid being deployed to Iraq.\n\n...\n\nJust months after leaving his battalion to go to Iraq without him, he announced a run for Congress, and the dissembling about his serivce record began immediately.\n\nInstead of being honest about his early departure from the military, Walz told the media a much more heroic tale, one that was entirely ficticious.\n\nBloomberg's Joshua Green, then employed at The Atlantic, was the first major reporter to profile Walz.\n\nIn a piece discussing the then-congressional candidate, Green writes that in 2004, Walz left his hometown in Minnesota \"to serve overseas in Operation Enduring Freedom.\"\n\nIt's unclear if this is Green, a veteran reporter, omitting major facts, or if Walz is selling Green on a particular narrative. Nonetheless, the assertion is incredibly misleading, as it leaves the reader under the impression that Walz served as boots on the ground in the Global War on Terror, when in reality, he merely deployed to Italy in 2003 for a six month stint.\n\nIt gets much worse.\n\nGreen discusses a 2004 visit from former President George W. Bush to Gov. Walz's hometown, in which a protesting Walz (who was still serving in the military) supposedly demanded to speak to the then commander in chief.\n\n\"Walz thought for a moment and asked the Bush staffers if they really wanted to arrest a command sergeant major who'd just returned from fighting the war on terrorism,\" Green writes.\n\nWhile the first instance can be written off as an issue of unclear reportage, the second example cannot be explained away. Walz was not just serving in a support role for the war effort (from Italy), he had been \"fighting the war on terrorism.\"\n\nAccording to the article, Walz was picked out of relative obscurity by Democrat operatives due to his military service.\n\nThese operatives went out and recruited \"veterans from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq,\" Green writes.\n\nTo this day, Green remains under the false impression that Walz served and fought in the war. In a piece for Bloomberg on Tuesday, he wrote that Walz served \"in Iraq as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.\"\n\nIn marketing Walz as a veteran upstart politician, he created a false construct that involved heroism in the war in terror, when in reality, Tim Walz never fought in a war or anywhere near a war.", "source": {"uri": "acecomments.mu.nu", "dataType": "news", "title": "acecomments.mu.nu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "War on terror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George W.

A notable attack came from Donald Trump's VP pick, Senator JD Vance. In a recent speech in Michigan, Vance criticized Walz, saying:\n\n\"He has not spent a day in a combat zone. What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not...I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nVance's comment is a jab at Walz's military record. Walz retired from the military in 2005 to run for Congress just before his unit was deployed to Iraq, where Vance served that year. However, POLITICO pointed out that Walz had filed his paperwork to run for Congress before it was known that his unit would be deployed.

Here's the truth about Tim Walz's military service", "body": "Sen. JD Vance accused Gov. Tim Walz of \"stolen valor\" -- but the facts tell a different story.\n\nEvery year, about 2 million Americans serve in the armed forces, either full time or one weekend a month. These people come from all walks of life and serve in different ways.\n\nMany serve as Sen. JD Vance of Ohio did. After high school, Vance signed up for a four-year enlistment in the Marines including six months in Iraq doing public affairs. Then he was honorably discharged.\n\nThat's a bit of a rarity among politicians. Most served as officers after college, which means better pay and benefits. But there is an even rarer experience: Among the tiny fraction of Americans who enlist, a much smaller share make a career of it -- serving 20 years or more, with multiple deployments. And only a small fraction of those stay in the service after being disabled on the job.\n\nOne of them is Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, an enlisted soldier in the National Guard for nearly a quarter of a century. A journey that began on a Nebraska farm as soon as he was eligible to join.\n\n\"My father served during the Korean War. And the day after I turned 17, he took me down to an Army National Guard recruiter and I raised my hand and signed up,\" Walz said of his enlistment.\n\nThat was in 1981 when Ronald Reagan was president. Walz continued to serve for the next 24 years under four commanders in chief.\n\nHe spent most of that time as an artillery soldier, which took a toll on his hearing. In 2002, after Walz had already done 20 years and qualified for retirement, a medical board considered discharging him because of his hearing loss. Instead, he convinced them to let him complete his final enlistment, which began after 9/11.\n\nWalz achieved theh highest enlisted rank in the Army, command sergeant major. But rather than stay in and complete the schooling for that rank, he retired in 2005 at the rank of master sergeant.\n\nIn part, he says, because he wanted to speak freely about political injustices, including the Iraq War. The following year, he was one of more than 60 anti-war veterans running for Congress as the \"Fighting Dems,\" a group that included Sen. Tammy Duckworth, now former Sen. Jim Webb and now former Rep. Patrick Murphy.\n\nFollowing his surprise victory in a traditionally conservative district, Walz became the highest-ranking enlisted soldier ever to serve in Congress. There he worked to help end the military's anti-gay \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy.\n\nAfter Donald Trump was elected president, Walz became the ranking Democrat on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, where he fought the White House over privatizing veterans' health care. He also used his own experiences with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to help other veterans get their benefits.\n\nWalz's experience in the armed forces is an atypical one for most Americans, and particularly for politicians. There's literally no one like him.\n\nBut now that Walz is running with Vice President Kamala Harris against Trump and Vance, Republicans are trying to \"Swift-boat\" him -- denigrating his service the way they did with Vietnam veteran John Kerry 20 years ago.\n\nThey claim Walz stole valor and left the Army to avoid going to Iraq. It's a playbook Republicans also used against Walz when he ran for governor of Minnesota.\n\nAnd it failed then. As it turns out, when voters hear about the quarter century Walz spent as a citizen soldier and the time he has spent since, fighting for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans to get the benefits they deserve, they don't see what Republicans do.\n\nInstead, they see a rare kind of veteran in politics who can cut through the self-serving B.S., rather than adding to it.", "source": {"uri":

Tim Walz claiming that he carried weapons of war into actual war has surfaced. A Minnesota National Guard response to Fox News disputes the fact that Walz actually went into battle, but rather he skirted any skirmishes and retired instead, leaving his troops behind.\n\nWalz, who's the chosen vice presidential candidate for Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, served a quarter of a century in the National Guard.\n\nA video of Walz making the controversial statement can be seen on X.\n\n\"I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt. I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" Walz said in his speech, aiming toward voters who don't want guns on the streets.\n\nVETERAN WHO SERVED IN TIM WALZ'S BATTALION ADDRESSES STOLEN VALOR ACCUSATIONS: 'FAR DARKER THAN PEOPLE THINK'\n\nRetired Command Sgt. Maj. Thomas Behrends, who said he was a member of Walz's battalion, blasted the governor's comments.\n\n\"To most people, that would mean that he was actually in combat, carrying a weapon in a combat zone and getting combat pay and in a dangerous and hostile environment where he is getting shot at,\" Behrends told the 'Ingraham Angle' on Wednesday.\n\nWalz never said which war he fought. During his time in the Guard, there were two wars in Iraq and one in Afghanistan, neither of which show on his military record.\n\nJD VANCE ACCUSES TIM WALZ OF 'LYING' ABOUT MILITARY SERVICE: 'STOLEN VALOR GARBAGE'\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard told Fox News that Walz was part of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) while he was stationed in Italy with his unit in 2005, but that he retired before his unit went into battle.\n\n\"Walz left the National Guard in May 2005 after 24 years of service. His unit was not given deployment orders to Iraq until July. He had put his retirement papers in 5-7 months prior to his retirement in May,\" the Minnesota National Guard said.\n\n\"Second, there are questions about whether he served in OEF. His battalion was sent to Europe, in his case Vicenza to train units in artillery - his specialty was artillery. If you are deployed overseas in support of OEF according to the National Guard you officially served in OEF, whether you touched foot in Afghanistan or not. That is in his official military service record below.\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Walz's office for comment and received an automated response.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWalz was named this week as the running mate with Kamala Harris on the Democratic national ticket. Harris, the current vice president, will look to fill the shoes of President Biden and take on former President Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nTrump's running mate is J.D. Vance, who served four years in the U.S. Marine Corps. While speaking at an event Wednesday in Michigan, Vance said that Walz deserted his fellow soldiers who were heading off to war.\n\n\"You abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq,\" Vance said.\n\nFox News reporter Jennifer Griffin contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_mcdonald@foxnews.com", "name": "Scott McDonald", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Second Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz's claims about his military service, saying he did not retire as a command sergeant major as he has said.\n\nIn a statement to Just The News, a spokesperson for the Minnesota National Guard confirmed that Walz retired as a master sergeant \"in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\"\n\nWalz claimed he retired from the National Guard as a command sergeant major; the claim even appears in his official biography on the Minnesota government's website (archived here). Yet other veterans have called out Walz's story, saying he \"embellished and selectively omitted facts\" about his military career. Walz retired shortly after his unit was told it could be deployed to Iraq, but he didn't adhere to his agreements as part of joining the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy. One of the stipulations for joining was that he served a specific time after his conditional promotion to command sergeant major, which Walz failed to do, thus resulting in him reverting to his lower rank of master sergeant.\n\nWalz's lower rank was valid from the moment he retired, meaning he retired as a master sergeant and not as a command sergeant major as he has claimed.\n\nArmy Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, Minnesota National Guard's State Public Affairs Officer, gave Just The News a corrected biography for Walz's military service.\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER FOR 'AM I RACIST?' -- A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI\n\n\"Governor Tim Walz served from April 8, 1981, to May 16, 2005. Governor Walz served in the Minnesota National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery after transferring from the Nebraska National Guard in 1996. While serving in Minnesota, his military occupational specialties were 13B - a cannon crewmember who operates and maintains cannons and 13Z -field artillery senior sergeant. In Nebraska, he served as a 11Z - infantry senior sergeant, and a 71L - administrative specialist. He held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant, and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion,\" she told the outlet.\n\nIn an open letter posted to Facebook in 2018, retired Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr wrote that Walz retired just a few months after receiving a warning order that his battalion would be deployed to Iraq - even though he told military personnel he would be going on the mission.\n\n\"On May 16, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125 Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" Behrends and Herr wrote.\n\nWalz's sudden retirement complicated his selection to the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy, Behrends and Herr wrote. Once someone accepts enrollment, they agree to three stipulations: to serve two years after graduation from the academy or promotion, that failing the course could result in being kicked out of the military, and that they will be reduced to master sergeant if they don't complete the course.\n\nWalz wasn't promoted to command sergeant major until September 17, 2004. A month earlier, he was photographed holding a protest sign outside a rally for President George W. Bush's re-election campaign, though it doesn't seem as though the military noticed or disciplined him.\n\nLess than a year after his promotion, Walz retired, meaning his promotion was nullified since he broke the agreement he signed when entering the academy.\n\nOn September 10,2005, Walz was reduced to master sergeant. As Behrends and Herr wrote, \"It took a while for the system to catch up to him as it was uncharted territory, literally no one quits in the position he was in, or drops out of the academy.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Sergeants_Major_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Sergeants Major Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_occupation_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States military occupation code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artillery battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_colonel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant colonel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-commissioned officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

I did what they asked me to do and I did it honorably, and I'm very proud of that service,\" Vance said.\n\n'Like denigrating the worth of a woman's citizenship...'\n\nTransport secretary Pete Buttigieg said denigrating the worth of a soldier's service based on whether he deployed to a war zone is like denigrating the worth of a woman's citizenship based on whether she happens to have children.\n\n\"Come to think of it, denigrating the worth of a soldier's service based on whether he deployed to a war zone is... kind of like denigrating the worth of a woman's citizenship based on whether she happens to have children,\" Pete wrote.\n\nDid Tim Walz serve in military or not?\n\nYes, Minnesota governor Tim Walz was in the military for 24 years but he was never sent to the war zone. But in old videos that resurfaced in the past two days, Tim Walz could be heard claiming that he carried weapons in war, which has been fact-checked and labeled as false.\n\nWalz retired from the National Guard in 2005 and never served in a combat zone.\n\n\"Walz did make a comment speaking to a group, he's done it a couple of times, where he has used language that has suggested that he carried weapons in a fighting situation,\" CNN's Jake Foreman said. \"I know from coming from a military family there is a difference between being in a combat area, being involved at a time of war, and actually being in a position where people are shooting at you,\" he added.\n\nHarris campaign defended Tim Walz's past claim and said Walz carried, fired and trained other on how to use \"weapons of war innumerable times.\"\n\n\"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country,\" the statement said.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

Vance also appeared to reference previous comments from Walz in which the governor said, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons were at.\"\n\n\"Well, I wonder Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?\" Vance said. \"What was this weapon that you carried into war given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone?\"\n\nVance himself served in the Marine Corps for four years, and he also never saw combat. He worked as a combat correspondent in Iraq between August 2005 and February 2006. The senator has now been widely condemned for attacking Walz's military record as his own background is scrutinized.\n\nAlexander Vindman, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"Vance enlisted & served 4 yrs, including 6 months in Iraq in 2005 as a reporter w/ a Public Affairs section of a Marine Aircraft Wing.\n\n\"Walz served 24 yrs earning 8 promotions & ending as a Command Sergeant Major, the highest NCO position. I don't think JD wants to compare records but if he insists.\"\n\nJake Broe, a U.S. Air Force veteran who served as a nuclear and missile operations officer, wrote: \"Tim Walz retired from military service after 25 years of honorable service. He retired an E-9 Command Sergeant Major. JD Vance went to Iraq for six months and wrote press releases from an air conditioned office.\"\n\nAdam Kinzinger, a former Republican congressman who served in the Air Force, said while sharing Vance's comments on Walz: \"OK. JD served honorably, but he wasn't kicking down doors. He was in public affairs.\n\n\"Which again, is fine and honorable. Tim, after he was eligible for retirement, retired. People do that. If it was a real problem he would have been 'stop lossed' and prevented from retiring.\"\n\nNavy veteran Jax Persists added: \"Vance served 4 years and spent 6 months in Iraq escorting civilian press and writing stories. Walz served 24 years and retired when he ran for office.\"\n\nNewsweek has contacted Vance's office for comment via email.\n\nVance has said he never saw real combat during his time in the Marine Corps, and he wrote about his experiences in his bestselling memoirs Hillbilly Elegy.\n\n\"As a public affairs marine, I would attach to different units to get a sense of their daily routine,\" Vance wrote. \"Sometimes I'd escort civilian press, but generally I'd take photos or write short stories about individual marines or their work.\"\n\nLuis Agostini, a combat veteran and public information officer for the Drug Enforcement Administration's Chicago field division, defended Vance and dismissed those who suggest his service amounted to a \"cushy\" public relations job where \"combat is avoided and A/C is enjoyed.\"\n\nIn a series of posts on X, Agostini paid tribute to those who have been killed while working such jobs during wartime.\n\n\"There are also the invisible injuries suffered by combat correspondents, photographers and videographers that weigh heavily long after the deployment, as with so many others in different fields,\" he wrote.\n\nCNN's Brianna Keilar suggested that Vance was an \"imperfect messenger\" to attack Walz's military history given the senator also never saw combat and was more of a \"public affairs specialist.\"\n\nIn reply, Vance wrote on X: \"It's easy to sit in the comfort and safety of a CNN studio and trivialize the service of countless men and women who risked their lives.\n\n\"I served with some of the people mentioned in this thread. I miss them all very much. Shameful of Keilar to slander an entire [military occupational specialty].\"\n\nLuke Schroeder, a spokesperson for Vance, previously told Newsweek: \"Tim Walz lied about carrying a weapon in a war and abandoned his unit as they prepared to actually deploy for war -- he said he would answer the call, but when the call came, he ran for office instead.\n\n\"There's nothing more insulting to veterans who do answer the call to serve in a combat zone like Senator Vance did than those who engage in stolen valor to benefit their political career -- which is exactly what Walz appears to have done.\"",

Tim Walz, Democrat presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate, claiming he served in war despite never seeing combat while serving in the military.\n\nThe clip, which the Kamala HQ account on X originally shared, featured Walz touting gun control before saying he carried a weapon of war in war:\n\nI spent 25 years in the Army, and I hunt ... I've been voting for common-sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can do CDC research ... We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at. [Emphasis added]\n\nThe Kamala HQ account repeated his claim in the post sharing the clip.\n\nGov. @Tim_Walz: I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt. I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war,... pic.twitter.com/3IVaXi2RP2\n\n-- Kamala HQ (@KamalaHQ) August 6, 2024\n\nWhile Walz served in the U.S. military before becoming a school teacher, his military record shows he never served in combat. The prominent X account Stolen Valor, which tracks false claims about military service, pointed out the error:\n\nTo answer everyone's questions about the video being shared. Governor Tim Walz's service record indicates that he did not deploy to a combat zone. Instead, he was stationed in Italy to support combat operations. While all Soldiers carry an M4/M16 rifle during training, qualifications, and other exercises, there is no evidence to suggest that he \"carried a weapon of war in war\" as stated in the video.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Walz has faced accusations of \"stolen valor\" over his military record, with claims that he \"listed on his official biography a higher military rank than the one he ultimately retired with, drawing criticism from some veterans\":\n\nWalz served in the Minnesota Army National Guard and retired at the rank of master sergeant, or an E-8. However, on his official website bio, he lists a higher rank that he served at for a short period that ultimately was rescinded, as he did not complete all the requirements to serve at that rank. However, his bio implies that he retired at the rank of command sergeant major, or an E-9.\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (OH) also took issue with some of Walz's claims during a press conference on Wednesday:\n\nWhen the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq, to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably. And I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType":

Gen. Mark Hertling praised Walz on social media, stating that those who attain the rank of command sergeant major \"know what they're doing\" and \"uphold standards.\"\n\nThis narrative is being challenged by those who served alongside Walz, however.\n\nAlpha News reported that retired Command Sgt. Maj. Doug Julin, who spent 35 years in the Minnesota National Guard, alleges that Walz \"abandoned his soldiers\" in 2005.\n\nJulin claims Walz orchestrated a \"backdoor deal\" to avoid deploying to Iraq with his unit.\n\nHe added that Walz had initially confirmed his commitment to the deployment in early 2005, despite rumors of a potential congressional run.\n\n\"Then out of nowhere in June of 2005, Tom Behrends is there as the new CSM,\" Julin recounted.\n\nHe expressed disappointment in Walz's handling of the situation, stating, \"He went around my authority to get out of the position. I probably would have told him, 'No, you're going on the deployment.'\"\n\nJulin argues that Walz's actions had a demoralizing effect on the troops. \"Soldiers are thinking, 'What does he know that I don't know?' That's the kind of message it sends,\" he explained.\n\nThe retired sergeant major questioned Walz's leadership, asking, \"How can you be entrusted to be the governor of Minnesota when if something is not to your liking, you quit or you serve yourself and not others?\"\n\nTom Behrends, who replaced Walz for the deployment, corroborated these claims in recent interviews.\n\nBehrends stated that Walz was conditionally promoted to command sergeant major in September 2004 but \"quit in May of 2005\" after being notified of the impending deployment.\n\n\"As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way and hung his hat up and quit,\" Behrends asserted, going so far as to label Walz's actions as \"stolen valor.\"\n\nWhen confronted with these allegations during a 2022 Medal of Honor memorial dedication, Walz dismissed them, suggesting political motivations might be at play.\n\n\"I don't know if Tom [Behrends] just disagrees with my politics or whatever, but my record speaks for itself, and my accomplishments in uniform speak for itself,\" Walz responded, as highlighted by Alpha News.\n\nAs the controversy unfolds, questions arise about the vetting process for vice presidential candidates and the potential impact on the Harris campaign.\n\nWith national security and military experience often key factors in presidential elections, this developing story could have significant implications for the Democratic ticket.\n\nThe allegations against Walz highlight the complex intersection of military service and political ambition.\n\nVoters will undoubtedly

Tim Walz says that Walz was aware his unit would deploy to Iraq before he decided to retire in 2005 despite some claiming that he had no idea about the upcoming deployment.\n\nAllan Bonnifield, who supports the Democrat vice presidential pick, has told multiple reporters that Walz's decision to retire weighed heavily on him because he knew his unit was going to deploy.\n\nAccording to MPR News, Bonnifield, who met Walz in 1999, said in a 2018 interview that Walz debated focusing on a run for Congress or staying in the National Guard.\n\nMPR News reported:\n\n\"He weighed that decision to run for Congress very, very heavy,\" Bonnifield said. \"He loved the military, he loved the Guard, he loved the soldiers that he worked with, and making that decision was very tough for him. Especially knowing that we were going on another deployment to Iraq. He didn't take that decision lightly at all.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nBonnifield also told a News Nation reporter on Thursday that accusations that Walz retired to avoid a deployment were \"bullshit\" but then confirmed that Walz knew an upcoming deployment for the unit was an \"inevitability\":\n\nBonnifield says the entire unit was convinced it was an inevitability that they WOULD be deployed to Iraq soon. They hadn't been given the orders to deploy yet. But Bonnifield says they, Walz included, assumed it was coming:\n\n\"He told us that he wanted to run for Congress, and he was in a tough spot, because he was pretty sure we were going to Iraq. We didn't have orders. We didn't have any kind of orders at all. At this time, he was pretty sure we were going, and he was in a position that pretty sure meant we were going.\"\n\nSupporters of Walz note that he retired from the National Guard in May 2005, and his unit received an alert order for deployment in July 2005 and official orders in August 2005. However, troops -- particularly leaders, which Walz was at the time -- typically know about official notifications months in advance.\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard acknowledged in an email sent to reporters that there are \"unofficial alerts\" and notices and told Breitbart News it did not have any information on when an unofficial notice may have been given to Walz's unit.\n\nJoel Berry, Marine veteran and managing editor of the Babylon Bee, noted that units receive \"warning orders\" before \"alert orders\" to deploy.\n\nHe posted on X:\n\nThe media is trying to report that Tim Walz retired before he knew his unit was deploying, since he retired 2 months before his unit received \"alert orders\" to deploy. What they're not telling you is that units also receive something called \"warning orders\" much earlier -- months, sometimes years in advance. Tim Walz knew his unit was deploying to Iraq, which is why he quit.\n\nEven according to Walz himself, he was acutely aware of the likelihood of a deployment by at least March.\n\nWalz had filed as a candidate for Congress on January 5, 2005, according to a Federal Election Commission document, and, in March 2005, his campaign sent out a press statement that said the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced a \"possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard.\"\n\n\"The announcement from the National Guard PAO specified that all or a portion of Walz's battalion could be mobilized to serve in Iraq within the next two years,\" Walz's campaign said in the statement. In the statement, Walz said he did not know if his unit would be part of the mobilization but acknowledged that, as the top enlisted leader of his unit, he had a \"responsibility\" to \"ready my battalion for Iraq\" and \"serve if called on.\"\n\nHe said, \"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq.\"\n\nDespite this statement, he retired two months later.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristina_wong@breitbart.com", "name": "Kristina Wong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Public_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Public Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/Tim-Walz-3.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-01-05", "textStart": 2996, "textEnd": 3011}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-", "textStart": 1817, "textEnd": 1825}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-07-", "textStart": 1882, "textEnd": 1891}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-08-", "textStart": 1915, "textEnd": 1926}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-03-", "textStart": 3074, "textEnd": 3084}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

'You know what, the courts are going to handle that part of it. What we're going to do is beat him in November.'\n\nTrump faces several charges on the state and federal level tied to his business dealings, his handling of classified documents, and his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nThe former president made the 'lock her up' chant famous during the 2016 campaign when he encouraged his supporters to shout it about his then-rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nMeanwhile, Walz bragged about his shooting skills when he spoke to the crowd. After talking about his support for the second amendment, the Minnesota governor noted he was an excellent shot.\n\n'When I was in Congress, I was the top gun at the trap shooting three years in a row. I can outshoot them too. I can outshoot these guys,' Walz said.\n\nHis comments came after Trump was shot at a rally on July 13th in Pennsylvania and Taylor Swift canceled a series of concerts in Austria due to threats.\n\nTrump came within a hair of being struck by a bullet from the AR-15. It nicked his right ear.\n\nWisconsin was crowded with politicians on Wednesday.\n\nHarris and Walz were there as part of their tour of battleground states. J.D. Vance, Trump's running mate, was in the same town to counter their message with his own.\n\nThe uptick in political activity came as a new poll showed Harris was essentially tied with Trump in Wisconsin. The Marquette poll showed that among registered voters, Trump lead 50 to 49 but, among likely voters, Harris led 50 to 49.\n\nAt her rally Harris focused on introducing Walz as her running mate and attacking Trump on his conservative record.\n\nThere were 12,000 people in the crowd, per the campaign.\n\nThe indie band Bon Iver entertained the crowd before the politicians took the stage. They ended their set with 'Battle Cry of Freedom,' which was during the Civil War in support of the Union and abolitionism.\n\nLead singer Justin Vernon said it's 'a nice, old patriotic song that's been rolling around my head these past months.'\n\nAfter the rally, the band joined Harris and Walz at The Local store, a general store for locally made goods.\n\nVernon wore a Harris-Walz camo hat. Walz's daughter, Hope, was also there and wearing the hat.\n\nHarris bought raw honey and cheese curds. Walz purchased a reusable water bottle and a record - Break Me Open by S. Carey from Eau Claire. He is the drummer and supporting vocalist of Bon Iver.\n\nMeanwhile, during the trip Walz refused to answer questions related to 'stolen valor charges.'\n\nThe Minnesota governor was accused of quiting his National Guard unit after it was informed it was being deployed for Iraq.\n\nWalz ignored questions on the subject from reporters traveling with him and Harris.\n\nHe served for more than two decades in the Army National Guard, and that was part of his appeal to Harris, who has no military experience.\n\nIn fact, Harris, during the rally, bragged about Walz's service record.\n\n'To his fellow veterans he is Sergeant Major Walz,' she said.\n\nThe timing of his separation from the military surfaced during his 2018 campaign for governor.\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends of the Minnesota National Guard accused Walz of having 'embellished' his record and of having abandoned his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress.\n\nWalz dismissed the charges, calling them a 'bipartisan political attack.'\n\n'After completing 20 years of service in 2001, I re-enlisted to serve our country for an additional four years following Sept. 11 and retired the year before my battalion was deployed to Iraq in order to run for Congress,' he wrote at the time.\n\nWalz, 60, enlisted in the Guard at the age of 17. He became the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to serve in Congress.\n\nVance slammed Walz about the report.\n\nVance, who served with the U.S. Marines in Iraq, said it was 'shameful' if Walz had retired in 2005 just as his battalion was preparing to go to war.\n\n'I mean, your job as a senior enlisted guy in a unit is to keep your people safe. That's not a job you can switch out of on a moment's notice,' Vance told DailyMail.com during an exclusive interview aboard his campaign plane.\n\n'So if he abandoned his troops before they went to Iraq or wherever ... absolutely shameful.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eau_Claire,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eau Claire, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eau Claire, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Vernon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Vernon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

When he was called to serve, and protect our country he didn't.\n\n'To publicly present false prestige of his unearned rank an inaccurate representation, is a falsehood of who he truly is.\n\n'My son stepped up to the plate. All our sons stepped up.\n\n'My son wasn't even 21 years old. He couldn't even buy alcohol. Yet he took the step to serve our country while Walz found the best way to run away.'\n\n'It was the coward's way out.'\n\nWhen American soldier Kyle Miller was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq on June 29, 2006, the man expected to lead them into combat was not there\n\n'It makes you wonder if he will bow out in some manner, and not accomplish the job he is supposed to get done.'\n\nWalz served for 24 years and became master sergeant in the Minnesota Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery.\n\nHe retired in 2005 and his rank was reduced from command sergeant major because he didn't complete the coursework for the U.S. Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nMrs Miller said Walz's 'surprising' decision to retire from the military to pursue his political career was so he 'wouldn't have to go' the frontlines of the War on Terror.\n\nShe described how when her son's body was returned from Iraq the town of Willmar, Minnesota fell silent as his casket was driven through the streets in a silver hearse.\n\nMembers of the Minnesota National Guard, past and present, lined up to salute as his remains were taken to the town's civic center.\n\nOne thousand mourners attended his funeral, where friends remembered how he could raise a smile with his one-line jokes.\n\nBut Mrs Miller never heard from Walz, or even his office.\n\nIf she had, the Gold Star Mother would have asked the future vice-presidential nominee why he abandoned his men before they went into a warzone.\n\nMiller was killed when his convoy ran over an IED south of Baghdad. He was 19 years old and this image was taken the night before he was killed\n\nKyle told his military chaplain about a recurring dream in which he was blown up in an explosion in Iraq.\n\nThe visions were disrupting the National Guard soldier's sleep while he was stationed just south of Baghdad with the 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery unit in 2006 - when U.S. forces were experiencing heavy combat.\n\nThe chaplain offered him an out: someone else could go on operations instead.\n\nBut Miller refused and said he couldn't bear someone dying in his place.\n\nDays later, the specialist was in a convoy that hit an IED, and he died on the way to hospital.\n\nHe was serving in the same unit Walz retired from as its leader two months before.\n\nHarris emphasized Walz' military record when she introduced him as her running mate at a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday.\n\nHe served for more than two decades in the Minnesota National Guard, responded to natural disasters, and was deployed to Italy and Norway.\n\nIn 2005 he retired so he could run for Congress and the Harris campaign has called him a 'tireless advocate' for veterans.\n\nBut the timing of his retirement is under intense scrutiny and he's facing allegations of exaggerating his record.\n\nVeterans who served in his unit have accused him of abandoning them before they went overseas.\n\nIn an emotional interview with DailyMail.com, nearly two decades after 19-year-old Kyle's death, Kathy Miller said: 'I don't think it's fair that (Walz) takes credit when he didn't step up to the plate'\n\nMiller's legacy lives on in The North Star State in the form of a life-size bronze statue in Brewster, Minnesota. Kyle is kneeling in the center of a pentagon pedestal memorial to fallen soldiers\n\nKyle's name sits below her mother's at the memorial to fallen soldiers\n\nDailyMail.com has spoken to two men who served in Walz's unit.\n\nThe commander who took over as the leader has called Walz a 'traitor' who has boasted about a rank he was never given.\n\nMrs Miller said Walz's 'surprising' decision to retire from the military to pursue his political career was so he 'wouldn't have to go' and fight\n\nRetired command sergeant major Thomas Behrends told DailyMail.com: 'If a person is a liar and they embellish their record for political gain, then I think that the vote should be against them.\n\n'If the Twin Towers were burning and the firefighters were running down the street, he'd be running the other direction,' Behrends added.\n\nJon Erickson, a Battalion Targeting Officer in Walz's unit, told DailyMail.com he was relieved Walz didn't go to Iraq because Behrends, his replacement, was an exceptional leader.\n\nHe also suggested that a combat tour may have better prepared Walz to deal with the chaos that engulfed his state in 2020.\n\nDonald Trump has called Walz a 'disgrace to our country' and J.D. Vance says his rival running mate is guilty of 'stolen valor' - one of the biggest sins in the military.\n\nVance, a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, told DailyMail.com on Wednesday: 'Your job as a senior enlisted guy in a unit is to keep your people safe. That's not a job you can switch out of on a moment's notice'.\n\nWalz's gun control comments in 2018 saying 'we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets' have also raised eyebrows because he didn't see combat.\n\nThe Harris campaign have strenuously denied the allegations and insist the former teacher had decided to pursue a career on Capitol Hill long before he left the military, and point to fellow soldiers who have praised his leadership.\n\nMiller loved to make paper roses. It's one of the many things his mother misses about him every day\n\nIn response to Mrs Miller's claims, Walz spokesperson Lauren Hitt told DailyMail.com: 'The Governor honors Kyle Miller's service and mourns him and all those fellow guardsmen and service members who made the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n'After 24 years of service, Governor Walz retired from the Guard to run for Congress, where he was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform and their families - speaking out about the unacceptable human cost of these wars and increasing funding and mental health resources for the military members who served in them.'\n\nBut those he served with say he stepped aside just as rumors started to circulate that they could be deployed.\n\nMrs Miller still has immense pride for her son 20 years later, but her resentment for Walz lingers.\n\nShe said Kyle truly believed in his duty to serve and keep Americans free and safe.\n\nHe signed up for the National Guard during high school and had dreams of going to college.\n\nHe was three months into his Iraq tour working primarily in communications when he volunteered for an operation on June 29, 2006.\n\nMiller says her son Kyle would keep her on her toes and was 'smart' even as a child. She remembers how he would make her blush every day, his sense of humor and how he was a flirt with the ladies\n\nMinnesota National Guard soldiers pay their respects to Kyle after he was killed by the roadside bomb in Iraq in 2026\n\nHe was a passenger in the first vehicle of seven in a convoy when it ran over a roadside bomb.\n\nThe explosion blew in the doors of his Humvee and he suffered catastrophic injuries.\n\nColleagues rushed to get him to hospital, but their efforts were in vain.\n\nAt the same time, Walz was running his Congressional campaign for Minnesota's 1st District. He won the election less than five months later.\n\nKyle's mother found out when her daughter called her crying with the news. Then she got that knock on the door every military family dreads.\n\nIt took a week for Mrs Miller to get her son's body back to Minnesota.\n\nMrs Miller was amazed by the respect shown at his funeral by those who had grown up around her son.\n\nHis legacy lives on in The North Star State in the form of a life-size bronze statue in Brewster, south west Minnesota.\n\nKyle is kneeling in the center of a pentagon pedestal memorial to fallen soldiers.\n\nTwenty-one footprints made from the boots work by Ryane Clark - a Minnesota native killed in Afghanistan in 2010 - lead to the center.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz is accused of skipping out on his National Guard unit just before it deployed to Iraq in 2005 to begin his political career\n\nVance added he was astonished that the Harris campaign had not checked out Walz's military record and accused him of lying to make a political point. Walz is pictured right while serving with the U.S. Army National Guard in 1992\n\nMrs Miller misses her son every day and with Gold Star families helps keep his memory alive with events such as the Fallen Heroes high school football game every fall.\n\nShe remembers how he would make her blush every day, his sense of humor and how he was a flirt with the ladies.\n\n'He kept me on my toes. He was a smart kid.'\n\nTwo-year-old Kyle had already mastered part of the alphabet and was driving round his yard in a John Deere lawn tractor.\n\nWhen he was five years old he was doing the foxtrot and lighting up the dance floor in a little tuxedo and tails.\n\nKathy Miller (second from left) stands with Gold Star Moms at a memorial ride for veterans.

Please try again later.\n\nRepublicans have rummaged through their vast library of dirty tricks and pulled out a 20-year-old playbook to attack Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the newly minted running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris. Pushback from Democrats should be fast, hard and unrelenting.\n\nThe accusation of \"stolen valor\" leveled against Walz by GOP vice-presidential nominee JD Vance should sound familiar to voters of a certain age. It is the same kind of smarmy innuendo that Republicans used to defame then-Sen. John F. Kerry when he was running to unseat George W. Bush in 2004. And in the middle of this new smear campaign is the same guy.\n\nChris LaCivita, a longtime GOP strategist, is one of the two co-managers of the Donald Trump campaign, which is struggling to slow Harris's momentum. Two decades ago, LaCivita helped write and produce television ads for Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a group that falsely claimed Kerry was misrepresenting his service as a Swift boat captain in the Vietnam War -- for which Kerry was awarded three Purple Hearts, a Silver Star and a Bronze Star.\n\nVance and other Republicans are now trying to discredit Walz's 24 years of service in the National Guard. Their claims are that Walz retired from the Guard in 2005 to avoid being sent to fight in Iraq, which is false; that Walz has no right to say he attained the rank of command sergeant major, which is also false; and that Walz was wrong in the past to refer to assault rifles as weapons \"that I carried in war,\" which Walz should acknowledge and clarify.\n\nFollow Eugene Robinson\n\nFollow\n\nAll of this has been aired by Walz's GOP opponents in the past, to no avail. I see how it might be tempting for the Harris-Walz campaign to shrug and move on, but I believe that would be a mistake.\n\nDemocrats should recall that Kerry tried remaining above the fray. He was, after all, a war hero, with the medals to prove it. His military record was defended by other heroes, including then-Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, who called LaCivita's ads for Swift Boat Veterans for Truth \"dishonest and dishonorable.\"\n\nYet some of the mud stuck to Kerry. He said in a 2018 interview with NPR's Terry Gross that his campaign answered the false allegations about his valor and his medals \"as forcefully as we could.\" But the response was not forceful enough -- as evidenced by the fact that \"swiftboating\" is now a widely used term for the kind of attack Republicans have launched at Walz.\n\nSurely the Harris-Walz team has enough staff, money and brainpower to do two things at once. They should push full speed ahead with a campaign whose huge crowds and joyful enthusiasm have reshaped the presidential contest practically overnight. And they should push back -- hard -- against the Republicans' attempt to do to Walz what they did to Kerry.\n\nThat pushback begins by ensuring that the facts are trumpeted as loudly as the lies.\n\nThe standard period of enlistment for the National Guard is eight years. Walz served for 24 years -- much longer than the four years Vance served in the Marine Corps. Trump, of course, famously avoided military service entirely during the Vietnam era because a podiatrist, whose office was in a building owned by Trump's father, diagnosed the strapping young man as unfit, due to supposed bone spurs in his heels.\n\nWalz left the Guard in May 2005 because he had decided to run for Congress. His unit did not receive a mobilization order until August of that year, and it did not deploy to Iraq until March 2006.\n\nAs he approached retirement, Walz indeed served as a command sergeant major -- though he held that rank in an \"acting\" status, having not completed all the coursework required for permanent promotion.\n\nDid he carry a weapon \"in war?\" Not as most people understand those words. Walz was deployed in 2003 when U.S. forces were fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, but his unit was sent to Italy to protect U.S. assets there. Like Vance's noncombat role in Iraq, this counts as wartime service. But Walz was not in a war zone. He should make that plain.\n\nWalz is rightly proud of his military record. Democrats should sing his praises from the rooftops -- while hammering on the issues that Republicans are trying to drown out, such as reproductive rights and Project 2025. Harris and Walz have seized the initiative. They will need to play both offense and defense to keep it.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eugene_robinson@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Eugene Robinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_LaCivita", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris LaCivita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrol_Craft_Fast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrol Craft Fast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smear campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Vets_and_POWs_for_Truth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swift Vets and POWs for Truth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Trump, who got out of service in Vietnam by claiming to have bone spurs, has frequently mocked P.O.W.s, denigrated wounded veterans and called those interred at Arlington National Cemetery (including members of my family) \"losers.\"\n\nNow the Trump campaign is once again demonstrating its lack of respect for military service as Trump's running mate, a former Marine, denigrates Gov. Tim Walz's 24 years of duty in the National Guard, during which he served as a command sergeant major. In remarks in Michigan on Wednesday, Senator JD Vance accused Walz -- with little evidence -- of \"stolen valor,\" saying he lied about seeing combat \"in war.\" And then Vance drew a comparison between his four years of service, during which he was a combat correspondent, and Walz's 24.\n\n\"When the U.S. Marine Corps asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,\" Vance said. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nFor the most part, these claims, repeated uncritically by the internet's MAGA faithful, don't pass muster. It took precisely no time to figure out that Walz filed the paperwork to run for Congress and submitted his request to retire months before any official order to deploy to Iraq was received. According to a Guardsman who served under Walz, he had been weighing the decision to run for Congress for quite a while.\n\nLike many National Guardsmen in the early 2000s, Walz was deployed overseas. His unit went to Italy as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. He did not see combat; however, he did say, in comments supporting a ban on assault weapons, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\" Walz should clarify the record on this point at the earliest opportunity, lest someone assume -- to be frank, fairly -- that he intended to claim that he had seen combat.\n\nFalsehoods can be debunked and records can be corrected, but Vance's insidiously clever accusation will linger. For one, many people won't care to parse the details of Vance's spurious claims and the facts of Walz's record, but they may remember some vague idea that Walz lied about his service. Vance's line of attack was also perfectly calibrated to undermine Walz's gentle masculinity, by not so subtly implying that his combatless service record somehow makes him less of a soldier and, by extension, less of a man.\n\nTo be clear: Neither Walz nor Vance has seen, as Vance says, \"any real fighting.\" In either case, their choice to serve was commendable. Should Vance wish for anyone to take seriously his lectures about honoring members of the armed services, he ought to start by giving one to the draft dodger at Mar-a-Lago.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_National_Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington National Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_correspondent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War correspondent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assault weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Weapons and Equipment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/01/26/opinion/The-Point-Promo-Image/The-Point-Promo-Image-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Tim Walz's candidacy into question centering on his military record.\n\nOn Wednesday, Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate, accused Walz of \"lying\" about serving in a combat zone and claiming he \"dropped out\" of the Army after learning his unit was set to be deployed to Iraq. (The governor has said he filed for retirement months before his battalion got its tour order.)\n\nVance's criticisms are regurgitations of similar allegations first made in 2006, the year after he retired from the military to run for Congress, according to CNN.\n\nThe network's KFile unit reported on Thursday that at least two people wrote in to Walz's local paper, the Mankato Free Press, that year to accuse him of embellishing his record, claims Walz refuted at the time as defamatory and false. The local paper's letters to the editor also prompted a subsequent flurry of letters in support of the congressional hopeful.\n\nWalz served honorably for more than 24 years in the Army National Guard before retiring, according to CBS News.\n\nIn 2003, he deployed to Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n\nHis official candidate biography in 2006 used the same wording, saying that he \"served overseas with his battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" but made no mention of where he served. Several campaign ads also featured his military service prominently, but did not mention any specifics of that service, according to CNN.\n\nDespite those omissions, Walz never sought to hide his record, speaking openly in several interviews during his 2006 congressional run about his experience in Italy. He told the local alt-weekly, CityPages, that it was only the \"luck of the draw\" that allowed him to serve in Europe rather than in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nWalz has never explicitly claimed to have been in active combat, but Republicans have fixated on a single 2018 clip of Walz referring to \"weapons of war, that I carried in war\" as a deliberate misrepresentation of his record.\n\nThe Harris/Walz campaign disputed that characterization in a statement this week, writing: \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nThe Minnesota governor had another high-profile defender Thursday in Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ), herself a Navy veteran, who went on CNN to declare Republicans' attacks on Walz's service record as \"so incredibly offensive.\"\n\n\"It's reminiscent of the swift boat bulls--t that Sen. John Kerry faced during his election [in 2004],\" she told host Kaitlan Collins. \"It's even more offensive because these accusations are being launched by another veteran.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mankato,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mankato, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mankato, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikie_Sherrill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mikie Sherrill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_4480,w_7964,x_0,y_563/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1723174047/GettyImages-2164175988_o0b00d", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Because, unlike the Harris campaign, people are actually vetting him. Especially the vet part. And he's about to become unburdened of the biggest highlight on his resum\u00e9, meaning his military service with the Army National Guard. As noted by the Washington Free Beacon, when Walz first ran for Congress in 2006, his campaign described him as a \"veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" which typically applies to someone who served on the ground in Afghanistan during the War on Terror. But for him, it was more like Operation Enjoying Freedom, in Italy, not Afghanistan. Here he is in 2007, after he was elected to Congress, talking about his time during that operation.\n\nTIM WALZ: I spent 24 years in the National Guard, some of that full-time. I was an artillery man. I deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. My battalion provided base security throughout the European theater from Turkey to England, in the early stages of the war in Afghanistan. And that same battalion is now in Iraq at this time.\n\nNow it sounds like he was a lot closer to the battlefield than he actually might be. He was, in fact, deployed to a base in Italy. He wasn't taking live fire in Operation Enduring Freedom, it was more like Operation Enduring Pasta. I kid. And in 2009, a local veteran went to his Minnesota office and asked the staffer if it's possible to mistakenly assume that he served in Afghanistan based on his website bio. And the staffer said perhaps.\n\nSo the vet suggests, hey, maybe you should change it to say that Walz served in Italy instead. But Walz's office did nothing, though they did offer the vet a case of military-grade tampons.\n\nThen there's the two fellow National Guardsmen who said in 2022 that Walz reached the rank of command sergeant major but didn't complete the coursework to maintain that rank before he retired at a lower rank, which the Minnesota National Guard confirmed. Yet, even on his own website, he still calls himself command sergeant major. Apparently, his resume has more padding than Joy Behar's toilet seat.\n\nSo, did he lie about his rank to fuel his political aspirations, just as he managed to avoid a war? Does it matter? When your job is to lead young men in battle but your desire to dine with Barrack and Michelle matters more, you probably had no business leading anyone to begin with. And yet, the Harris campaign just posted this video of Walz talking about how the weapons he carried in war shouldn't be allowed anywhere but the battlefield.\n\nTIM WALZ: I spent 25 years in the Army, and I gave the money back. And I'll tell you what I have been doing. I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment. But we can do background checks. We can do CDC research. We can make sure we don't have reciprocal carry among states, and we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons work.\n\nNext he'll tell us he used his bayonet to do butter carving. But if Tim Walz said we should ban the very weapons he carried in war and he didn't carry any weapons, doesn't that mean we can keep all of our weapons? Great. I want an Abrams tank. Again, he's never been to a war zone unless you count his state during the George Floyd riots. In reality, when his unit got called for deployment to Iraq after he'd been appointed to acting senior enlisted leader, he bailed to run for Congress. But now even CNN is calling him out.\n\nCNN GUEST: Walz did make a comment speaking to a group, he's done it a couple of times where he has used language that has suggested that he carried weapons in a fighting situation. There is a difference between being in a combat area, being involved at a time of war, and actually being in a position where people are shooting at you. There is no evidence that at any time, Governor Walz was in a position of being shot at, and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest that he was. So that is absolutely false.\n\nHoly -- - that's CNN! I know. Wow. Who did Walz piss off? Did he steal one of Jake Tapper's copies of Juggs Magazine? Meanwhile, listen to Minnesota Senator Tina Smith comparing Walz to JD Vance.\n\nSEN TINA SMITH: Well, here is Tim Walz, who enlisted when he was 17 years old. He served in the National Guard for 24 years. And I'm not aware of any military service that JD Vance has ever served. So let's just make the comparison there.\n\nLet's not, Tina. First, you're leaving out the main point. No one is accusing Vance of lying, and it's kind of hard to believe you're not aware of any military service Vance served. What else are you not aware of? That you stole John Denver's haircut? The fact is, lies like this got Brian Williams demoted and the closest he came to combat was being near Matt Lauer's office. But apparently, the new tactic here is to muddy the waters. Right, Nance?\n\nMSNBC'S ANDREW MITCHELL: JD Vance has criticized him as never having been in combat.\n\nI think. Wow, these are just some journalists. Now, Nance, JD never said he was in combat, unlike Walz, which you would have clearly heard if your last face lift hadn't blocked your ears. The oddest take, though, comes from Mayor Pete, who wrote, \"denigrating a soldier's service based on whether he deployed to a war zone is kind of like denigrating a woman's citizenship based on whether she happens to have children.\" So I guess two months of paternity leave makes him an expert on childbirth? It's the worst analogy ever. A non-deployed soldier is like a childless woman?\n\nMaybe if the childless woman tells people if she has kids to get benefits. Mayor Pete manages to derail trains and conversations. So it seems the Dems only fight when it's political, then they circle the wagons. The problem is what they're defending for many Americans is indefensible. You can lie about stolen valor, but you can't make veterans forget about it.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

According to some of those who served with him, his claims about his rank and experience are quite different from what they recall about his service. Those questions can be resolved with a glance at his NGB Form 22, National Guard Report of Separation and Record of Service.\n\nNGB Form 22 must be signed by the servicemember when he/she is discharged. By signing the document, the retiring soldier acknowledges his/her retirement rank, military education, places of service and any decorations. A copy of Walz's NGB Form 22 can be obtained by contacting the National Guard Adjutant's office for Minnesota.\n\nEvidently, based on press statements, Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance alleges that Walz is guilty of \"stolen valor.\" That allegation has legal ramifications because it is against federal law to lie about military service with the intent to defraud.\n\nThere are a couple of issues here. Walz allegedly has claimed to be a retired command sergeant major and that he carried a gun \"in war.\" However, the Harris-Walz campaign pushed back stating \"the governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times.\" That statement sidesteps the issue.\n\nBy 2005, Walz had 24 years of service with the Army National Guard, at which time his unit was tapped to deploy to Iraq. For a number of reasons given -- being a critic of the Bush administration's Iraq war, a young daughter at home and his desire to run for public office -- Walz decided to retire rather than deploy to combat with his unit.\n\nSenator Vance takes issue with Walz's retirement decision. \"I think it's shameful to prepare [a] unit to go to Iraq to make a promise that you're going to follow through and then to drop out right before you actually have to go. I also think it's dishonest,\" Vance said.\n\nIn my generation, future political leaders like Bill Clinton evaded going to war through a variety of draft deferments and by reneging on his commitment to join the ROTC. Meanwhile, others joined the National Guard to avoid being drafted as well. That was often the preferred alternative to deserting the country, which was an out for hundreds of thousands of young men.\n\nOf course, Walz won't be the first politician to misrepresent his military service. Recall that Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal \"made a handful of false and misleading statements about having served in Vietnam during the period of American involvement in the war there.\"\n\nEvidently, Walz joined the National Guard to earn money for college under the GI Bill. That has been a common practice for many and it should be encouraged, especially today when recruitment is in the toilet.\n\nWhat is not acceptable is making false claims about your rank and type of service. That is part of the federal record vis-\u00e0-vis NGB Form 22. That official form, which was signed by Walz before leaving service, will lay to rest his retired rank, any claimed awards, his military education and where he served -- in combat or not.\n\nHas the governor been dishonest about his service, as Vance claims? Should he have deployed to Iraq with his unit rather than retire? The answer to the first question is a matter of public record. The second question goes to Walz's loyalty to the soldiers he led and ultimately to the voters this fall.\n\nWe ought to thank those who volunteer to serve in the armed forces. However, we should not overlook false claims about service and what some contend is the abandonment of a unit heading to war. Ultimately, the American voters will have to decide whether Tim Walz has the character to become a leader that is one heartbeat away from serving as the commander in chief of America's armed forces.", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_Bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard Bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjutant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adjutant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

He told reporters that Walz, who retired from the Minnesota guard after 24 years of service to run for Congress in the 2006 election, had \"dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go [to Iraq] without him.\"\n\nVance also accused Walz of falsely claiming to have seen combat, citing comments the Minnesotan had made about not wanting \"weapons of war\" to be available on American streets.\n\nThe Ohio senator's accusation that his opponent ditched his guard unit rather than deploy to combat is patently false.\n\nAccording to military records, Walz officially retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005, two months before his unit received word that it would be deployed, four months before deployment preparations began and ten months before the unit deployed.\n\nIn a statement, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson strongly pushed back against Vance's claim that Walz had \"dropped out\" rather than deploy with the men he led, instead accurately describing the governor's separation from service as a normal retirement after nearly a quarter-century in uniform.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" they said.\n\nAccording to Army records, Walz's nearly two and a half decades in the Minnesota Guard began at age 17 and ended with him holding the rank of Command Sergeant Major, the highest possible rank for an enlisted soldier.\n\nLike most National Guard soldiers, he was frequently deployed in response to national disasters, but he also was sent overseas to Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the US mission to Afghanistan that toppled the Taliban in the wake of the September 11 attacks.\n\nThe campaign spokesperson also pushed back on Vance's claim that Walz had falsely claimed to have carried arms against the enemy by noting that he never claimed to have seen combat.\n\n\"The Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" they said, including by specializing in heavy artillery to the point of suffering hearing damage as a result of exposure to decades of heavy gun blasts. They added that Walz \"would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country\" and said he thanks Vance for having \"put his life on the line\" by deploying to Iraq as a public affairs specialist with the US Marine Corps.\n\nThe attacks against the governor appear to be the brainchild of Chris LaCivita, one of the two GOP operatives who run former president Donald Trump's 2024 campaign. Twenty years ago, he was one of the consultants who orchestrated a smear campaign against John Kerry, then a Massachusetts senator and the Democratic challenger who sought to deny Bush a second term in the White House.\n\nThe campaign was the work of a GOP group called \"Swift Boat Veterans for Truth,\" ostensibly made up of Vietnam veterans who served with Kerry, a US Navy veteran who earned a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star while commanding small riverine craft in the Vietnamese jungles.\n\nIt was 2004, just three years removed from the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, and Kerry was running against Bush -- and in opposition to the US-led war in Iraq -- by invoking his military service. Opinion polls at the time showed that Americans saw Kerry's record as a positive and put him ahead of Bush after the party nominating conventions that year.\n\nThe \"Swift Boat Veterans\" group responded by airing television ads in which purported veterans who claimed to have served with Kerry criticized him and accused him of being dishonest about his service record.\n\nIt wasn't true. Only one of the people in the ad had actually served alongside Kerry, and the claims they made about Kerry's alleged dishonesty didn't hold up to independent fact-checking. But the damage was done, and Kerry would go on to lose the 2004 election to Bush.\n\nTwo decades later, with Trump foundering in the polls against Harris and Walz, LaCivita began telegraphing his intention to dust off his \"Swift Boat\" playbook just minutes after Walz was announced as Harris's running-mate.\n\nIn response to a post on X (formerly Twitter) noting that Walz -- a former Command Sergeant Major in the Minnesota guard -- was the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in the US Congress during his decade in the House of Representatives, LaCivita wrote that the would-be vice president \"deserted his men and quit before they went to combat.\"\n\nA person close to the Harris-Walz campaign told The Independent that the vice president and a host of surrogates plan to push back hard against any attempt to \"swift boat\" the Minnesota governor and said LaCivita's playbook \"will not work this time.\"\n\n\"It's a tired, old strategy and the American people are too smart to fall for that, especially from anyone allied with a draft dodger like Donald Trump,\" they said.\n\nRick Wilson, a former GOP operative who founded and runs the anti-Trump Lincoln Project super PAC, told The Independent that LaCivita's decision to go after Walz's military record is a sign that he's increasingly desperate and trying to keep from being fired by Trump as the ex-president loses ground to Harris and Walz.\n\n\"Chris is worried about getting fired right now, so obviously he's going to do everything and can to play the LaCivita greatest hits album. If Donald Trump wasn't bunkered down in Mar-a-Lago hiding like a f*****g psychopath, it might be more effective,\" Wilson said.\n\nHe added that the attacks against Walz have \"a fat Elvis imitator vibe\" from \"some guy playing in a casino/gas station 27 miles out of Elko, Nevada.\"\n\n\"Chris and Susie are in real trouble in Trump world, and it's not getting any better,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Tim Walz of Minnesota was guilty of \"stolen valor\" Thursday, accusing Republicans of trying to \"Swift boat\" the presumptive Democratic nominee for vice president.\n\nQuestions about Walz's 2005 retirement from the Minnesota National Guard arose after a 2018 Facebook post by retired Army Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends resurfaced in the wake of Walz's selection as Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate. After airing a video segment from MSNBC host Chris Hayes, Brzezinski then cited a Minnesota Public Radio report as she attempted to \"fact check\" the stolen valor allegations directed at Walz, comparing them to the criticism of then-Democratic Sen. John Kerry from Vietnam War veterans during the 2004 presidential campaign, highlighted by a group known as Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.\n\n\"A medical board considered dismissing Walz in 2002 due to hearing problems he developed while working with high-powered weapons during his more than two decades in the National Guard. At that point, a guardsman who served under Walz says he was already openly discussing retiring in order to run for Congress,\" Brzezinski claimed. \"Records show that in January of 2005, he did, indeed, take that step and filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. Two months later, Walz acknowledged in a campaign statement that there were talks about units potentially being deployed but wrote, quote, 'I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization.'\"\n\nIn the statement, dated March 20, 2005, Walz, then running against Republican Rep. Gil Gutknecht of Minnesota, said that \"as Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on.\"\n\n\"In May of that year, documents show he officially retired from the military, meaning he likely had to inform the National Guard of his plans many months earlier,\" Brzezinski continued. In July of 2005, six months after Walz declared his intent to run for Congress, his former battalion received a mobilization alert. Then the following month, the order to deploy. Vance also accused Walz yesterday of lying about his rank of command sergeant major. But in a statement, the National Guard says the governor did, indeed, reach that level. Though he, quote, retired as a master sergeant for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, the GOP nominee for vice-president, accused Walz of \"dishonesty\" Wednesday while speaking at a campaign event in Wisconsin. Walz claims in his official page that he retired as a Command Sergeant Major, but the Harris campaign later said Walz earned the title, but admitted he retired as a master sergeant, according to Politico.\n\n\"Jonathan Lemire, again, different people do different types of service, and J.D. Vance is going after Tim Walz and lining it with untruths, but also, I feel like a service member denigrating another service member for his service is just, I don't know, I'm not sure how that's going to play,\" Brzezinski said to \"Morning Joe\" co-host Lemire. \"That may go in the JV Vance category, as well.\"\n\nCo-host Lemire claimed the Trump campaign was trying to attack Walz's service record, comparing it to the criticism Kerry received from fellow Vietnam War veterans during the 2004 campaign.\n\n\"The overall argument as you just laid out in the fact-check, and our colleague Chris Hayes did last night, it simply doesn't hold water, the idea of stolen valor, that he bailed on his unit to avoid combat deployment. These are attacks that don't seem particularly honest, and it's unclear whether they will resonate,\" Lemire said. \"Charlie Sykes, I think it is a couple other things that need to be noted here. First of all, this just shows how the Trump team has really struggled to come up with any sort of effective attack lines against Vice President Harris and now, in these early days, her running mate, so they're seizing upon this.

As she pointed out, an X account belonging to the Harris campaign posted some video of Tim Walz pushing for gun control and talking about weapons of war. Here's the clip again:\n\n\"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" he said. Anyone listening to that would assume that Walz carried military grade weapons during wartime. But as Beege pointed out, Walz never served in a combat zone. He apparently did deploy to Italy at one point but there was no combat going on anywhere near him. When his unit was notified that they were going to be deployed to Iraq, Walz quit and ran for office.\n\nJD Vance clearly noticed the discrepancy and brought it up on the campaign trail, comparing this specific statement by Walz to stolen valor:\n\nHere's the last bit of what Vance said:\n\nHe said 'We shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets.' Well I wonder Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq and he has not spent a day in a combat zone. What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\n\nThis obviously creates a big problem for the Harris camp and for most of the national media that is currently acting as boosters for her campaign. NBC News was quick to come out with an article titled \"Republicans start tearing down Walz by going after his military record.\" Those evil Republicans, always pouncing on poor Democrats. But if you actually read through the story you do learn that Walz actually did say this thing that Republicans are talking about. The entire story is 29 paragraphs long and we get this in paragraphs 21 and 22:\n\nIn a Tuesday post on X that highlighted Walz's hunting and military background, the Harris campaign shared undated video footage that featured the governor talking about gun control.\n\n\"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz is seen and heard saying in the brief clip.\n\nThis is standard operating procedure for the media. If the news is bad for Democrats then don't talk about the story, talk about Republicans seizing on the story and make their reaction the story instead.\n\nNevertheless in the very last two paragraphs we finally get a response from the Harris camp which includes an admission that Tim Walz lied. NBC News literally could not have buried this admission any deeper.\n\nAsked about the video, a Harris campaign spokesperson did not deny that Walz had embellished when he spoke of carrying weapons in war.\n\n\"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" the spokesperson said. \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nSo there it is, an admission that Walz lied, er...embellished his own record by suggesting he carried military weapons \"in war\" when in fact he never entered a combat zone.\n\nThis rest of this lame effort at spin is a complete non sequitur. The issue, as even NBC seems to understand, is that Walz said he carried weapons of war \"in war.\" Saying that he \"carried, fired and trained others\" is non-responsive. No one doubts that Walz has fired a military weapon many times in a training situation, only that he never did it in a war as he left the military just in time to avoid deployment.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_sexton@hotair.com", "name": "John Sexton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/POW-MIA", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/POW-MIA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/220/5643eb66-94ff-444f-a32e-3a08c6c52b72.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Tim Walz (D), who is facing accusations of stolen valor, allegedly falsely claimed in a previous press release that he was a veteran of Afghanistan.\n\nIn a 2006 press release issued by his campaign, Walz was described as being a \"veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom.\"\n\nThe war in Afghanistan, which began on October 7, 2001, was called Operation Enduring Freedom, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command website. The operation's start came after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\n\"Democrat Tim Walz will spend Sunday, Feb. 19th and Monday, Feb. 20th traveling across Minnesota's 1st Congressional District as he formally announces his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives,\" the press release said. \"Walz, a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom and longtime Mankato educator is unopposed for the DFL endorsement and is slated to challenge Rep. Gil Gutknecht in November of 2006.\"\n\nIn a photo posted to X, Walz can be seen holding a sign that says, \"Enduring Freedom Veterans for Kerry,\" in protest of former President George W. Bush visiting Minnesota in 2004.\n\nThe Washington Free Beacon reported that David Thul, a veteran of the Iraq war, addressed the issue that Walz was claiming to be a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom with his aides in 2009.\n\nOne staffer reportedly claimed she was \"not aware\" that Walz had served in Afghanistan, while another aide reportedly \"acknowledged that constituents could get the false impression,\" according to the outlet.\n\nOn Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris announced that she was picking Walz to be her running mate in the 2024 presidential election. Since then, Walz has faced accusations of stolen valor and criticism from veterans\n\nIn a viral video, Walz can be heard claiming he had served in war, although he had never seen combat during his time serving in the United States military:\n\nI spent 25 years in the Army, and I hunt ... I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can do CDC research ... We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\n\nWalz admitted in a 2018 interview with MPR News that he had not seen combat, adding that he had \"got far more out of the military\" than \"they got out of\" him.\n\n\"I know that there are certainly folks that did far more than I did,\" Walz said. \"I know that. I willingly say that I got far more out of the military than they got out of me, from the GI Bill to leadership opportunities to everything else.\"\n\nIn Walz's biography on his website, he lists having a higher rank than the one he had when he retired from the U.S. military.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nWalz served in the Minnesota Army National Guard and retired at the rank of master sergeant, or an E-8. However, on his official website bio, he lists a higher rank that he served at for a short period that ultimately was rescinded, as he did not complete all the requirements to serve at that rank. However, his bio implies that he retired at the rank of command sergeant major, or an E-9.\n\nOn Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre avoided a question related to accusations of Walz's stolen valor.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_weibel@breitbart.com", "name": "Elizabeth Weibel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota's_1st_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota's 1st congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mankato,_Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mankato, Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mankato, Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Gutknecht", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gil Gutknecht"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Free_Beacon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Free Beacon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Vance his running mate but in that time, the Ohio Senator has been a lightning rod for criticism. Like Walz, Vance is a military veteran, but still felt the need to attack the Minnesota Governor today.\n\nVance told reporters:\n\n\"Now, what really bothers me about Tim Walz isn't even the positions he's taken, though certainly he has been a far-left radical. What really bothers me about Tim Walz, as a Marine who served his country in uniform, is when the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it.\n\nI did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably and I'm very proud of that service.When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact he's been criticized for aggressively by many of the people he served with.

Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) was the campaign that put boots on the ground in Iraq. Additionally, Walz never deployed to Iraq at all -- and numerous reports state that he took a conditional promotion to the rank of Command Sergeant Major only to back out and abruptly retire altogether shortly after being informed that his unit was scheduled to deploy to Iraq. Prior to that, he was briefly assigned to a post in Italy -- in support of OEF -- but never served in a combat zone.\n\nIngersoll also pointed out that it mattered whether Green had simply gotten his report wrong or had been \"misled\" by Walz.\n\n\"Wow, this is wild. (Also OEF was Afghanistan, NOT Iraq.) Walz should be forced to confirm or deny whether he misled Bloomberg's @JoshuaGreen, who is still reporting to this day that Walz did a tour in Iraq. And Green should come out and say whether he was misled. This is false then and it's false now.\"\n\nAt some point on Wednesday, Bloomberg updated the article -- noting at the top of the page that the piece was \"corrected August 7, 2024 at 3:46 PM CDT\" -- to correctly state that Walz had served in Italy rather than Iraq.\n\nWATCH BEN SHAPIRO'S 'SCAMALA: KAMALA HARRIS UNMASKED' ON DAILYWIRE+\n\nGreen also posted the correction on X himself, taking responsibility for the error and saying, \"My Walz newsletter yesterday wrongly stated he'd served in Iraq -- he didn't. He served in Italy. My error. Story has been corrected online and on the terminal.\"\n\nBut the reason the story grew legs so quickly is that Walz has, in the past, been accused of embellishing his military career and using those embellishments to push a political agenda. In order to push for an \"assault weapons\" ban, for example, Walz has suggested that his experience carrying such weapons \"in war\" makes him qualified to tell civilians what they should not carry anywhere else.\n\n\"I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt,\" Walz said at a campaign event. \"I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can do CDC ... We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are carried.\"\n\nEven CNN was forced to fact-check Walz on that comment, saying that \"there is a difference between being in a combat area, being involved in a time of war, and actually being in a position where people are shooting at you. There is no evidence that any time that Governor Walz was in the position of being shot at and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest that he was.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Businessweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg Businessweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Caller", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Caller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/08/GettyImages-2165255614.jpg?w=1200&h=800&ixlib=react-9.3.0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Typically, it comes in the form of some two-beers blowhard in the bar who says, \"You were in the Marines? I was too. I was Force Recon.\" (Anyone else out there wish you had a dollar for every clown who told you he \"almost\" \"joined\" \"the SEALs\"?)\n\nBut it's different when we're talking about our elected representatives. After all, these are the people whom our Constitution entrusts to vote us into war. Which is why Walz should've known better than to spin yarns among the American people that he wouldn't have dared to utter in any E-Club on any base in any remote corner of our nation.\n\nWe might laugh at Eddie Murphy's \"Agent Orange\" character in \"Trading Places.\" We might bust a gut when he says he was \"special unit battalion's commando airborne tactics specialist tactics unit battalion,\" and that it was \"real hush-hush.\" But Tim Walz's lies are no laughing matter, and they're no longer hush-hush. And he won't be able to run away from them forever.\n\nYesterday, we focused mainly on how Walz ditched his National Guard unit right before it deployed. But a Marine Corps brother, JD Vance, has rightly latched onto the matter of stolen valor. Here's what he said in the Detroit suburb of Macomb County, the home of the Reagan Democrats:\n\n[Walz] said -- and he was making a point about gun control -- that we shouldn't allow weapons that [he] used in war to be on America's streets. Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. ... I'd be ashamed if I were him and I lied about my military service like he did.\n\n[Checks notes: Any day now, mainstream media. Any day.]\n\nTo be fair, and as our Mark Alexander pointed out yesterday, Walz did serve with the Nebraska and Minnesota Army National Guard. But at some point, he must've realized the Minnesota Guard isn't exactly the 82nd Airborne. Which was a mistake made out of obvious insecurity, because all military service, whether in the Guard or the Reserves or on active duty, and whether in admin or logistics or infantry, is honorable.\n\nSo when Walz said during a gun-grabbing rant, \"We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is [sic] the only place where those weapons are at,\" he was lying.\n\nAnd it wasn't his only lie. As The Washington Free Beacon reports: \"As a first-time congressional candidate in 2006, Walz's campaign announcement described him as 'a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,' an archived version of the press release shows. Two years earlier ... Walz organized a protest against then-President George W. Bush [and carried] a sign reading 'Enduring Freedom Veterans for Kerry.'\"\n\nHow appropriate. Tim Walz and John Kerry. Two peas in a stolen-valor pod: Walz with his Walter Mitty-ism, and Kerry with his improbable haul of Purple Hearts and his duplicitous claims of having spent \"Christmas in Cambodia.\"\n\nAs the Free Beacon adds: \"Two Minnesota National Guardsmen said in 2022 that Walz falsely claimed he reached the rank of command sergeant major. But Walz did not fulfill the duties required to maintain that rank before he quit the service in 2005.\"\n\nStolen valor is deadly serious stuff. Admiral Mike Boorda, an enlisted man who rose through the ranks to become the U.S. Navy's Chief of Operations, committed suicide over a matter of stolen valor.\n\nFor Walz, these are, at the very least, disqualifying lies. After all, he aspires to be a heartbeat away from the presidency. Of course, as we noted yesterday, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal has gotten away with it, so perhaps the thinking goes, Why not me?\n\nIn any case, what must the Harris campaign have been thinking when it vetted this guy?", "source": {"uri": "patriotpost.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Patriot Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz",

Tim Walz's military biography, maintaining that the Democrat nominee for vice president did not hold the rank of command sergeant major at the time of his retirement like he has claimed, Newsweek reported.\n\nAccording to the state of Minnesota's official website, Walz's official biography as governor reads, \"Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005.\" However, the governor retired as a Master Sergeant \"because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" according to Army Lt. Col. Army Kristen Aug\u00e9, the state public affairs officer for the Minnesota National Guard, who made the announcement on Wednesday.\n\nA soldier who fails to finish the requisite coursework required will be demoted automatically, according to Army standards.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Walz's military service, which began during his first run for governor in 2018, has been highlighted once again, but this time, by detractors of Vice President Kamala Harris, who named him her vice presidential pick as the Democrat nominee in the November election earlier this week.\n\nThe widely recognized notion of stolen valor entails lying about the extent of one's military experience. Command Sgt. Maj. Tom Behrends, who succeeded Walz and ultimately deployed to Iraq in his place, asserted that it is a true reflection of his morality and character, saying, \"The public needs to know how pathetic his leadership was as a National Guardsman.\"\n\nAnother retired command sergeant major in the Minnesota National Guard, Paul Herr, similarly criticized Walz for abandoning his battalion right before their deployment to Iraq.\n\nWalz was chosen in 2004 to lead the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion as command sergeant major. By September of the same year, he was given a conditional promotion to the rank, according to the letter Behrends and Herr shared on Facebook.\n\nHowever, Walz's unit received orders to prepare for an active-duty deployment to Iraq at the beginning of 2005. Walz then abruptly \"quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior non-commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" the letter reads.\n\n\"When your country calls, you are supposed to run into battle -- not the other way,\" Behrends told the New York Post on Tuesday. \"He ran away. It's sad. He had the opportunity to serve his country and said, 'Screw you' to the United States. That's not who I would pick to run for vice president.\"\n\n\"He abandoned us. What the hell kind of leader does that? As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way and hung his hat up and quit,\" Behrends added.\n\nRepresentative Jack Bergman, a Republican from Michigan who was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the Marine Corps, told reporters on Wednesday that he intends to investigate further into Walz's time served with the National Guard. Bergman is a member of the Military Personnel Subcommittee and the House Armed Services Committee.\n\n\"I'm a Marine, and you either go to the sound of the guns or you run from the sound of the guns,\" Bergman said. \"My staff is doing a deep dive into all the details of Walz's service to make sure that the portrait that's being presented of his service is accurate.

Tim Walz as her presidential running mate, it didn't take long for Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) and other far-right MAGA Republicans long to start attacking him.\n\nOne of Vance's lines of attack has been disparaging Walz's military service, and he's being called out for it by conservative former Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Illinois) as well as progressive ex-MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan.\n\nThe Minnesota governor and former congressman spent 24 years in the U.S. Army National Guard before retiring from the military as a command sergeant major.\n\nREAD MORE: Trump responds to 'joyful warriors' Harris and Walz by amping up lies and fear-mongering\n\nIn a January 7 post on X, formerly Twitter, Vance wrote, \"You know what really bothers me about Tim Walz? When the US Marine Corps asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that's shameful.\"\n\nIn response, the 46-year-old Kinzinger -- who served as a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard -- tweeted, \"Ok. JD served honorably, but he wasn't kicking down doors. He was in public affairs. Which again, is fine and honorable. Tim, after he was eligible for retirement, retired. People do that. If it was a real problem he would have been 'stop lossed' and prevented from retiring.\"\n\nA Never Trump conservative, Kinzinger is still a Republican but has endorsed Harris for president in the 2024 election.\n\nOne of the key figures on Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign is Chris LaCivita, a veteran GOP strategist who engineered the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign against 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry.\n\nREAD MORE: How JD Vance's 'underwhelming' Philly speech missed the mark badly: analysis\n\nIn a biting August 7 tweet, Hasan posted, \"1.

On the social media platform Bluesky, Spiers argued: \"Vance suggesting that Walz isn't veteran enough because he didn't see combat is pretty rich given that Walz served in the military for 24 years and Vance served for 4, and is also a running mate to a draft dodger.... Also, Vance was a military correspondent/desk jockey. Anytime he complains that Walz wasn't in combat, someone should respond 'neither were you.'\"\n\nAnd Bouie wrote, \"It's wild because the argument also seems to be that because Walz 'deserted his unit' because the guard gave him his retirement at the start of 2005 and his unit deployed at the end of the year, when Walz almost certainly put in for retirement in 2004.\"\n\nBouie also posted: \"My dad was a W-3 in the navy, offered a promotion to W-4, decided he didn't want to move to Okinawa with one kid about to go to college and the other about to start high school, and put in for retirement!\"", "source": {"uri": "alternet.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Alternet.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kinzinger", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Kinzinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Ignoring the fact that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz (D) lied about going to war and carrying a weapon there, Cuomo presented a misleading timeline of Walz's retirement and openly suggested it was an important issue.\n\n\"Now, the first allegation that's getting the most attention is about his character. I believe it means the least to your daily life. But it is getting all the buzz because the media prefers the personal attacks,\" he flippantly declared.\n\nCuomo falsely suggested the allegation was that, \"Walz did not serve honorably.\"\n\nThat suggestion was inaccurate. No one had accused Walz of being dishonorably discharged or receiving anything less than an honorable discharge. The accusation was that he lied about going to war and retired just before his unit was deployed, thus avoiding getting shipped off to Iraq.\n\nCuomo paid lip service to Senator J.D. Vance's (R-OH) deployment with the Marines and defended his service as a war reporter. But he presented a misleading timeline of events regarding Walz's retirement:\n\nAlright, Vance served in Iraq. He deserves respect. I hear the criticism that 'Vance wasn't really a warrior. He was a reporter.' Look, the service stands. Okay? I reported in Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, other bad places. I wish it on no one. And he did it a lot more than I did.\n\nBut Governor Walz has a pretty impressive service record. He was in for way longer than Vance, to the extent that that is relevant. He retired at over age 40 before there was word of deployment to Iraq for his troops. Of course, the war was going on. Troops were being sent regularly. So, it is fair to suspect that he could have assumed he was going to go.\n\n\"Now I qualify it that many layers. Why? Because he hasn't said that. And there's no proof he left to avoid war,\" he proclaimed in Walz's defense.\n\nBut there was more information publically available at the time that Cuomo was admitting. According to a press release from the fledgling Walz congressional campaign in March 2005, two months before his retirement, Walz was aware that \"roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard\" were going to be mobilized and deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,\" Walz said in the statement.\n\nBefore proclaiming \"my answer is better than his,\" Cuomo offered one more desperate defense for Walz's abandonment of his unit: crying 'but Trump.' \"And even if Walz had left early at over age 40 because he didn't want to go to war that age and stage. Didn't former President Trump avoid service altogether in a less than honorable way? So, I'm not impressed by this line of attack,\" he scoffed, ignoring how Democrats were find with Bill Clinton's draft dodging.\n\nCHRIS CUOMO: Now, the first allegation that's getting the most attention is about his character. I believe it means the least to your daily life. But it is getting all the buzz because the media prefers the personal attacks. So, the allegation is this: Walz did not serve honorably. Here's J.D. Vance.\n\nSEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH): When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know, he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\n\nCUOMO: Alright, Vance served in Iraq. He deserves respect. I hear the criticism that 'Vance wasn't really a warrior. He was a reporter.' Look, the service stands. Okay? I reported in Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, other bad places. I wish it on no one.

So, I'm not impressed by this line of attack.\n\nBut here's the problem for Walz: my answer is better than his. \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American service to this country. In fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\" The problem with that is. He ducked the allegation. Not good.

Vance slams Tim Walz for 'abandoning' unit before deployment", "body": "By Rob Crilly, Chief U.S. Political Correspondent For Dailymail.Com Aboard Trump Force Two\n\nDonald Trump's running mate Sen. J.D. Vance slammed Kamala Harris's V.P. pick on Wednesday amid reports that Gov. Tim Walz had skipped out on being deployed to Iraq with the Minnesota National Guard.\n\nVance, who served with the U.S. Marines in Iraq, said it was 'shameful' if Walz had retired in 2005 just as his battalion was preparing to go to war. 'I mean, your job as a senior enlisted guy in a unit is to keep your people safe. That's not a job you can switch out of on a moment's notice,' Vance told DailyMail.com during an exclusive interview aboard his campaign plane, nicknamed Trump Force Two. 'So if he abandoned his troops before they went to Iraq or wherever ... absolutely shameful.'\n\nWalz, the governor of Minnesota , was named by Harris as her running mate on Tuesday. He appeared alongside her at a campaign rally in Philadelphia later that day. But reports quickly resurfaced of anger among his former brothers in arms who accused him of 'betraying' his country just as they were preparing for deployment\n\nRetired Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends of the Minnesota National Guard accused Walz of having 'embellished' his record and of having abandoned his unit when he left the Guard to run for Congress. 'In early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq,' he wrote on Facebook in 2018.\n\n'On May 16th, 2005, he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,' Behrends continued.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Vance was on his way to Michigan for a campaign event hours before Harris was due to arrive in the same spot. He said his role was to remain 'laser-focused' on scrutinizing her policy failures on immigration, energy and manufacturing.\n\nBut he added he was astonished that the Harris campaign had not checked out Walz's (pictured right) military record and accused him of lying to make a political point. 'There was a clip the Kamala campaign posted about him where he's making a gun control argument,' said Vance. 'He said, Look, you should not be able to carry the weapons that I carried in war.'\n\n'And I'm, I'm thinking to myself, well, when did you go to war? What weapon did you carry in the war, Tim, because apparently you skipped out on your unit before they went to Iraq. I know he didn't go to a combat zone, so why is he lying to make a political point?'\n\nVance, who grew up in Ohio, is seen by the Trump campaign as key to eating into the Democrats' so-called 'blue wall' of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nOn Wednesday, he will first be in Shelby Township, Michigan, and at 2 p.m. in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The aim is to keep pressure on Harris, who is due in both places a few hours later.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Tim Walz's military service has been called into question after he was straight-up busted for embellishing his record. The phrase \"stolen valor\" has been tossed around, especially since it's been revealed that Walz told Business Insider that he deployed to Iraq. In reality, he fled, abandoning his National Guard unit before it deployed to Iraq.\n\nOur friends at RedState had it first:\n\nA bombshell report from Jordan Schachtel dropped on Wednesday afternoon has blown this scandal wide open.\n\nAs Schatchel notes in his piece, the first mention of Walz going to Iraq could have just been Joshua Green, the reporter who did the profile, making an assumption. That would be unusual given the editorial standards at play at such an outlet, but it is at least possible that Walz himself didn't tell Green that he served in Iraq.\n\nThat second mention, though? That one isn't explained away by assuming an overzealous reporter just got out over his skis. Green is clearly describing what Walz told him regarding his supposed denial of entry to a George W. Bush rally in 2004 (that claim also appears to be largely made up, but that's another story). There is no other logical explanation.\n\nFurther, Green, who now works for Bloomberg is still under the impression that Walz served in Iraq, making the same claim on the day the governor was made Harris' running mate. Again, the way this reads doesn't seem like a professional reporter just making an assumption. Green appears to have been told this by Walz himself.\n\nIt gets worse -- Walz claimed he was a veteran of the Afghanistan War:\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz has described himself as \"a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the official name of the U.S. government's war in Afghanistan following the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nBut Walz never deployed to the Middle East. And, when an Iraq War veteran confronted Walz's aides with evidence of what he called \"stolen valor,\" his aides didn't do much to address his concerns.\n\nAs a first-time congressional candidate in 2006, Walz's campaign announcement described him as \"a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" an archived version of the press release shows. Two years earlier, in 2004, Walz organized a protest against then-President George W. Bush in Mankato, Minn. A photo of the rally shows Walz carrying a sign reading \"Enduring Freedom Veterans for Kerry.\"\n\nEven CNN couldn't pivot from this obvious lie, yet some on this anti-Trump network did try to defend Walz:\n\nThis issue isn't going away, and some are even suggesting that Walz might get dumped.

Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, the Minnesota National Guard's State Public Affairs Officer, added detail to an emerging picture when she confirmed to Just the News that Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, tabbed on Tuesday as Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 running mate and currently embroiled in a \"stolen valor\" scandal, did not retire from the Minnesota National Guard as a command master sergeant -- a rank he has since claimed on many occasions.\n\nAccording to Aug\u00e9, Walz \"retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\"\n\nNonetheless, in a 2006 press release Walz's congressional campaign referred to him as \"retired Command Sgt. Major Tim Walz.\"\n\nBad as they are, however, accusations of stolen valor do not even tell the whole story of Walz's service record.\n\nIn September 2022, for instance, retired Command Sgt. Maj. Doug Julin accused Walz of \"abandoning his soldiers.\"\n\nFacing deployment to Iraq in 2005, Walz benefited from what Julin called a \"backdoor deal.\" In fact, Walz secured this \"deal\" without even consulting Julin, who at the time served as Walz's brigade command sergeant major.\n\n\"He went around my authority to get out of the position. I probably would have told him, 'No, you're going on the deployment,\" Julin said.\n\nMeanwhile, retired Command Sgt. Maj. Tom Behrends, who replaced Walz and served a two-year deployment in Iraq, blasted his predecessor as a coward.\n\n\"If he would've went to Iraq, he'd still be hiding under his desk over there,\" Behrends said.\n\nIn other words, Walz, Harris and the Democrats have a serious problem on their hands. And the scandal appears unlikely to go away anytime soon.\n\nRepublican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, an Iraq War veteran and former President Donald Trump's 2024 running mate, has called out Walz for stolen valor.\n\nLikewise, in a shocking twist, even CNN has fact-checked Walz for an \"absolutely false\" statement about carrying weapons in war. Something unusual is definitely afoot when even the establishment media has to acknowledge a Democrat's lies.\n\nIndeed, Democrats and the establishment media will lie to the public about anything, from Russian collusion to fake insurrections. They will call men women and vice versa.

Nor was mention of firearms barely uttered during the Republican National Convention or in the early days of the campaign as well. What a change in a candidate makes as the issue is now front and center with the ascension of the left-leaning Kamala Harris as the Democratic presidential nominee and her selection of even lefter-leaning Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.\n\nBarely had the sweat dried on his hand from holding Harris's mitt so tightly after she named him her vice-presidential choice, than an old video of the guv was shared on social media with him waddling in front of a crowd and crowing about how he was going to ban AR-style weapons.\n\nUsually when an old video clip appears of a candidate openly lying to constituents it is leaked by the opposing party. But Harris and Walz's campaign team are actually making it easy for everyone to see the lies...and to see what these people really stand for.\n\nIn the video from a 2018 gubernatorial stump speech Walz gave and that Harris's campaign posted on X Tuesday, shows the turncoat politician talking about how he gave money back to NRA after he gladly took it to get elected in his first run for office.\n\n\"I'll take my kick in the butt for the NRA. I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt and I gave the money back and I'll tell you what I have been doing: I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks, we can do CDC research, we can make sure we don't have reciprocal carry among states and we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz says in the video.\n\nSo many lies in one statement. But, then what would anybody expect from a politician who began his political career on a lie.\n\nAccording to Forbes, before becoming governor, Walz got elected to Congress representing a rural district in Minnesota in which he hyped his support for the Second Amendment, talked about how he liked to hunt so of course, that meant he was all about guns, and was also in the military so of course, he was naturally all about guns for that reason, too. He presented that fa\u00e7ade to get elected in a district made up of mostly God-fearing, gun-owning stand-up Americans with morals and a strong sense of self-reliance, a common characteristic among our rural communities. He even earned an \"A\" rating from the NRA, something some Democrats, typically those from rural districts, once routinely earned. It has become increasingly rare, however, for a Democrat to earn a positive rating from the organization in today's political climate.\n\nIt was when Walz ran for governor of Minnesota in 2018 that his stance suddenly changed. For he then had to appeal to urbanites in the Twin Cities, and suddenly his true colors shined through...and the real lies began.\n\nOf the biggest lie garnering attention from the resurfaced video, Walz states, \"we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\" Walz did serve honorably in the military for 24 years, initially in the Nebraska Army National Guard and then in the Minnesota Army National Guard. But the problem is, he never saw combat.\n\nIn fact, since he was chosen as the Democratic Party vice presidential nominee, a number of his fellow service members have spoken critically of Walz because the fact is, not only did he never serve in combat as he has claimed, but he actually retired early allegedly to avoid having to go to Iraq with his unit, which was set to be deployed in 2005.\n\n\"We all did what we were supposed to do, we did the right thing, and it's dishonorable what he did,\" Tom Schilling, who was a member of Walz's unit told Fox News. \"He left somebody else to take over his spot. He just ditched us.\"\n\nFellow service member, Ret. Command Sgt. Maj. Thomas Behrends was even more critical when interviewed on \"The Ingraham Angle.\"\n\nBehrends noted that not only did Walz never see combat as he has claimed, but he also was not a command sergeant major as his governor's website states in his biography.\n\n\"To most people, that would mean that he was actually in combat, carrying a weapon in a combat zone and getting combat pay and in a dangerous and hostile environment where he is getting shot at,\" Behrends told host Laura Ingraham.\n\nIn fact, Walz would have been a command sergeant major, but he never deployed and he retired before completing the work to hold on to that rank so was administratively demoted as a master sergeant.\n\nTrump vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance, who did serve Iraq as a U.S. Marine, has also been vocal about Walz's embellishments.\n\n\"As a Marine who served his country in uniform when the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do, and I did it honorably,\" Vance said. \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.\"\n\nBeyond spicing up his military record to make him sound like more of an authority on firearms and earn the respect often reserved for true combat veterans, Walz and his statements offer a host of additional problems for gun owners and a glimpse into a man with an apparently flawed character for the rest of America:\n\n* In the video, he uses the perpetual Democratic buzzword every politician uses when they talk about passing \"gun legislation\" and that buzzword is \"common sense.\" Unfortunately, when a Democrat uses the words \"common sense\" in conjunction with gun legislation, it means anything but common sense. More often than not, it means \"ill- or uninformed\" legislation that will serve more to restrict people who committing the majority, if any, crimes, leave citizens more helpless to defend themselves, make the shooting sports and hunting more costly and difficult to enjoy and will undeniably take another step in eroding the Second Amendment freedoms of Americans. Common sense is a buzzword intended for the portion of our nation's electorate that doesn't have any. Democrats say the words trusting that most people are uninformed and don't care and will take what they say at face value...and then will vote accordingly.\n\n* In addition to misleading the audience on his military service, Walz also makes sure to say he \"hunts.\" As if that gives him some sort of pass or puts him on a moral high ground to speak knowledgeably about firearms. Whether he actually hunts or not, and as wonderful an American tradition as hunting is, enjoyed by millions (including myself), the Second Amendment was not put in place by the framers of the constitution so Americans would be permitted to hunt. When a politician emphasizes that he hunts in the same breath he begins talking about gun legislation, that is his or her way of saying, \"I'm one of you and I know all about guns and use them myself, and I'm not afraid to restrict the use of guns, so why should you be?\" It's disingenuous and condescending and every American sportsman and gun owner should be offended when a politician makes such statements.\n\n* The only lies Walz didn't deliver in that brief video clip was his feeling toward firearms...he wants to restrict them. He was clear he wants universal background checks, a well-meaning sounding, but ineffective, costly and even nefarious effort to restrict guns from those who pose the least risk to others; he wants to fund research through the CDC that has historically been used to attack gun ownership, research that time and again has been found to be politically motivated and flawed in its methodology; and he's even against reciprocity among states, which allows people with concealed carry permits from one state to carry and keep themselves safe when traveling in other states. The last one is the biggest headscratcher as permit holders have already been vetted by the government in order to get a permit. In opposing reciprocity or seeking to eliminate it, a legislator isn't creating a law that will stop a criminal (a criminal isn't worried about a permit), he or she is merely attacking law abiding gun owners and legal gun ownership. If anything, you are trying to turn a class of citizens who do everything to follow the law into criminals you can go after. It's government overreach in its most blatant and zealous form.\n\nTim Walz clearly hates guns or at the very least legal gun ownership, and in him Harris has found the perfect bedfellow as together they will likely continue to construct a campaign built on lies and increased attacks on legal gun ownership.\n\nBut the Democrats are right about one thing.\n\nIn attacking Donald Trump as the Republican candidate for presidency, they have repeatedly invoked the specter that \"democracy is under threat like never before.\"\n\nIt is under threat. But it is not Donald Trump America needs to fear.\n\nWith the selection of Harris and Walz for the 2024 ticket, Democrats have signaled politically that they are going all in on the destruction of America. They have enthusiastically chosen two candidates that will solidify the progressive stranglehold on the party and strive to build even more division among our nation's citizens.\n\nNo, the real threat to democracy is clear. The real threat is the Democratic Party. The real threat is Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.", "source": {"uri": "thetruthaboutguns.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Truth About Guns"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_howlett@thetruthaboutguns.com", "name": "Doug Howlett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Second Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rifle_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Rifle Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Firearm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buzzword", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buzzword"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska_Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Ingraham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laura Ingraham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz: his departure two decades ago from the Army National Guard.\n\nWalz, introduced Tuesday as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, ended his 24-year military career to run for public office in 2005 -- just before the unit he led deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,\" Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate and a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, said Wednesday at a news conference in Michigan.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" Vance added.\n\nThe strategy, which Trump amplified Wednesday by calling Walz a \"DISGRACE\" in a Truth Social post, is a throwback to 2004, when Republicans attacked Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry's record as a Navy officer in Vietnam. Chris LaCivita -- who served as a consultant to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth group that helped sink Kerry's bid -- is a senior adviser to Trump's campaign and has signaled an eagerness to reopen the playbook on Walz.\n\n\"And when his men needed him the most ... as they headed into the Crucible that is combat ... he deserted them ... left them,\" LaCivita posted Tuesday on X, shortly after Harris selected Walz to join her on the Democratic ticket. \"Why? So he could run for Congress.\"\n\nIn introducing Walz, 60, to a wider audience beyond Minnesota, the Harris campaign has emphasized his military record, as well as his experience as a football coach. Campaign officials frame his decision to leave the National Guard and pursue a career in politics as a path that offered him new and meaningful opportunities to help service members and veterans.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement for this article.\n\nWalz has faced these attacks before, including in his 2022 re-election campaign, when his GOP opponent questioned the governor's decision to leave the service in 2005. Walz's campaign responded with a letter signed by 50 veterans praising his record and leadership.\n\n\"Governor Walz secured additional funding for new veterans homes,\" read the letter, a copy of which the Harris campaign shared Wednesday with NBC News. \"In his first term, Minnesota was one of just seven states initially selected by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to participate in the 'Governor's Challenge' to eliminate veteran deaths by suicide.\"\n\nErick Erickson, a prominent conservative commentator, drew attention Tuesday to a paid letter to the editor that scrutinized Walz's service and was published by a local newspaper in 2018, days before he won his first term as governor. Erickson also called for a return of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, prompting LaCivita's initial social media post. Other posts followed.\n\n\"He deserted his men and quit before they went to combat,\" LaCivita wrote of Walz in response to a complimentary post from Alyssa Farah Griffin, a co-host of the daytime talk show \"The View\" and a former Trump White House aide who has since denounced the former president.\n\nLaCivita's previous work with Swift Boat Veterans for Truth stands as one of the most aggressive and potentially consequential political attacks of the modern era.\n\nKerry -- who was awarded a Silver Star, a Bronze Star and, for wounds sustained in battle, three Purple Heart medals -- had drawn the ire of many veterans for his advocacy against the war after returning home. And as he sought the presidency in 2024, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ran ads accusing Kerry of lying about his service on 50-foot aluminum crafts that ran dangerous missions in the Mekong Delta waterways of South Vietnam. Some of the veterans featured in the ads said that he had won awards under false premises.\n\nThen-Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who spent years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam before becoming friends with Kerry in the Senate, criticized the ads and noted that the veterans making claims against Kerry did not serve on his boat. Some of those who did supported Kerry's accounts. The allegations, which Kerry did not immediately counter, muddied the picture he presented of himself as a war hero -- which appeared to be the group's aim from a political perspective. Swift Boat Veterans for Truth may not have proved its case, but it sowed doubt about a perceived strength of Kerry's -- his war service -- and about his credibility.\n\nAs FactCheck.org concluded after exhaustive research, \"at this point, 35 years later and half a world away, we see no way to resolve which of these versions of reality is closer to the truth.\" Kerry lost to then-President George W. Bush.\n\nWalz joined the National Guard in 1981, just after his 17th birthday. After transferring from the Nebraska National Guard in 1996, he served in the Minnesota National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery, said Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, public affairs officer for the Minnesota National Guard. Walz, Aug\u00e9 added, \"culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion\" and \"retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nDuring Walz's nearly quarter-century of service, he was part of flood fights, responded to tornadoes and spent months on active duty in Italy, according to the Harris campaign. Walz \"was deployed to Italy in 2003 to protect against potential threats in Europe while active military forces were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan,\" the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported in 2022, attributing the information to Walz in an article about the scrutiny of his military service.\n\nWalz and Vance are the first veterans on a national ticket for either major party since McCain was the GOP presidential nominee in 2008. Vance, 40, briefly chronicled his experiences in Iraq in his 2016 memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" recalling his work as a public affairs marine.\n\n\"Sometimes I'd escort civilian press, but generally I'd take photos or write short stories about individual marines or their work,\" he wrote. \"Early in my deployment, I attached to a civil affairs unit to do community outreach. Civil affairs missions were typically considered more dangerous, as a small number of marines would venture into unprotected Iraqi territory to meet with locals.\"\n\nIn a Tuesday post on X that highlighted Walz's hunting and military background, the Harris campaign shared undated video footage that featured the governor talking about gun control.\n\n\"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz is seen and heard saying in the brief clip.\n\nVance alluded to the video at campaign stops Wednesday, accusing Walz of misrepresenting his military service and asserting that the governor never spent time in a combat zone.\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq?\" Vance asked at an event near Detroit. \"What bothers me about Tim Walz is this stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not. ... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nLater, after arriving for an event in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Vance told reporters that he had \"served in a combat zone\" and \"never said that I saw a firefight myself, but I've always told the truth about my Marine Corps service.\"\n\nTrump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt also alluded to the video in a statement, telegraphing the campaign's intentions to keep pressing on Walz's military record.\n\n\"Tim Walz is a fraud who wants to ban firearms like the ones he claimed to carry in war -- except Tim Walz never deployed to a combat zone and lied about his record of service in the National Guard,\" Leavitt said. \"If Walz won't tell voters the truth, we will: just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz is a dangerously liberal extremist, and the Harris-Walz California dream is every American's nightmare.\"\n\nAsked about the video, a Harris campaign spokesperson did not deny that Walz had embellished when he spoke of carrying weapons in war.\n\n\"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" the spokesperson said. \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)",

At least, we suspect he's viewed that way among the voters he hopes to court.\n\nHe made headlines a few weeks ago when he began attacking Donald Trump and JD Vance with that same word. The poll-tested insult caught on, and Democrats have been trotting it out ever since.\n\nAnd just yesterday, Walz doubled down: \"I just have to say it,\" he said to a raucous Philly crowd. \"You know it. You feel it. These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell.\"\n\nWhoa, there, fella. Like I always say: Weirdos who live in weird houses shouldn't throw weird stones. Let's go to the tape.\n\nA few weeks ago, Walz watched Joe Biden poop his pants on the debate stage with Donald Trump and thereafter declared, like Kevin Bacon in Animal House, \"All is well!\" He fought tooth and nail for the genital mutilation of children, and he ordered that tampons be placed in grade school boys' bathrooms. He decries racism and promotes \"equity and inclusion,\" and yet he took part in a racist fundraising campaign called \"White Dudes for Harris,\" in which he told his fellow beta males, \"Don't ever shy away from our progressive values. One person's socialism is another person's neighborliness.\" And, finally, he scolded Republicans to \"mind your own damn business\" yesterday while conveniently ignoring the fact that he encouraged his fellow Minnesotans to pick up the phone and snitch on their neighbors if they dared leave the house without a face diaper.\n\nWeird, huh?\n\nEven weirder, Governor Snitchy McTampon has, by his own admission, taken more than 30 trips to Communist China. Does that seem perhaps a bit excessive, especially on the salary of a public school teacher? Heck, he even honeymooned in China, kinda like ol' Bernie Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union. Why, it's almost as if socialist Bernie and social-studies Timmy were fellow travelers. Almost as if Walz were being groomed. Far be it from us to suggest that Kamala's colleague is a useful idiot, or commie-symp stooge, or, worse, a Manchurian candidate. But if the Mao suit fits, he should wear it.\n\nBut perhaps weirdest and most infuriating of all, Walz has been bragging about his service in the Army National Guard. And he's been doing so despite the fact that when his unit got orders to Iraq in 2005, he ditched them, retiring before they deployed, even though he was a senior NCO.\n\nIn a 2018 letter, a group of retired Command Sergeants Major of the Minnesota National Guard tried to set the record straight, writing, \"Tim Walz has embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances of his military career for years,\" adding, \"He makes it sound like he 'retired' a year before his battalion deployed to Iraq; when in reality he knew when he 'retired' that the battalion would be deployed to Iraq.\" The command sergeants majors concluded:\n\nThe bottom line in all of this is gut wrenching and sad to explain. When the nation called, he quit. He failed to complete the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy. He failed to serve for two years following completion of the academy, which he dropped out of. He failed to serve two years after the conditional promotion to Command Sergeant Major. He failed to fulfill the full six years of the enlistment he signed on September 18th, 2001. He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers. And he failed to lead by example. Shameful.\n\nPerhaps the artful dodger didn't want to find himself, in John Kerry's words, \"stuck in Iraq.\"\n\nTo be fair, Walz never petitioned his commanding officer for a Purple Heart when he got a little sliver in his arm, but he did make an interesting comment recently about gun control. As The Washington Free Beacon reports, Walz says he supports what all leftists support -- so-called \"common sense legislation\" that \"protects the Second Amendment,\" in addition to \"extensive background checks.\" But in arguing for this, he stepped into the slime of stolen valor: \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is [sic] the only place that those weapons are at.\"\n\nAs JD Vance noted of his vice-presidential counterpart in the Detroit suburb of Macomb County this morning:\n\nHe said -- and he was making a point about gun control -- that we shouldn't allow weapons that [he] used in war to be on America's streets. Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq, and he has not spent a day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. ... I'd be ashamed if I were him and I lied about my military service like he did.\n\nThese are good questions, and we'd say Walz has some 'splaining to do. Gun-grabbing is a disqualifying issue to many Americans, and stolen valor is a very serious charge. Perhaps Walz could ask his fellow Democrat, Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, about this.\n\nIn any case, we'd say Walz owes the American people some answers most ricky-tick, as early voting in the swing state of North Carolina begins in just four weeks.", "source": {"uri": "patriotpost.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Patriot Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tim Walz says that Walz was aware his unit would deploy to Iraq before he decided to retire in 2005 despite some claiming that he had no idea about the upcoming deployment.\n\nAllan Bonnifield, who supports the Democrat vice presidential pick, has told multiple reporters that Walz's decision to retire weighed heavily on him because he knew his unit was going to deploy.\n\nAccording to MPR News, Bonnifield, who met Walz in 1999, said in a 2018 interview that Walz debated focusing on a run for Congress or staying in the National Guard, knowing there was an upcoming deployment to Iraq.\n\nMPR News reported:\n\n\"He weighed that decision to run for Congress very, very heavy,\" Bonnifield said. \"He loved the military, he loved the Guard, he loved the soldiers that he worked with, and making that decision was very tough for him. Especially knowing that we were going on another deployment to Iraq. He didn't take that decision lightly at all.\" [Emphasis added]\n\nBonnifield also told a News Nation reporter on Thursday that accusations that Walz retired to avoid a deployment were \"bullshit\" but then confirmed that Walz knew an upcoming deployment for the unit was an \"inevitability\":\n\nBonnifield says the entire unit was convinced it was an inevitability that they WOULD be deployed to Iraq soon. They hadn't been given the orders to deploy yet. But Bonnifield says they, Walz included, assumed it was coming:\n\n\"He told us that he wanted to run for Congress, and he was in a tough spot, because he was pretty sure we were going to Iraq. We didn't have orders. We didn't have any kind of orders at all. At this time, he was pretty sure we were going, and he was in a position that pretty sure meant we were going.\"\n\nAnd according to the Washington Post, Bonnifield said Walz \"confided he was considering whether to leave their unit even though it was preparing to go to war so he could run for Congress.\"\n\nThe Post reported:\n\n'It was a very long conversation behind closed doors,' Bonnifield said. 'He was trying to decide where he could do better for soldiers, for veterans, for the country. He weighed that for a long time.'\n\nSupporters of Walz argue Walz's retirement had nothing to do with the upcoming deployment, since he retired from the National Guard in May 2005, and his unit received an alert order for deployment in July 2005 and official orders in August 2005. However, troops -- particularly leaders, which Walz was at the time -- typically know about official notifications months in advance.\n\nHowever, as Joel Berry, Marine veteran and managing editor of the Babylon Bee, noted that units receive \"warning orders\" before \"alert orders\" to deploy.\n\nHe posted on X:\n\nThe media is trying to report that Tim Walz retired before he knew his unit was deploying, since he retired 2 months before his unit received \"alert orders\" to deploy. What they're not telling you is that units also receive something called \"warning orders\" much earlier -- months, sometimes years in advance. Tim Walz knew his unit was deploying to Iraq, which is why he quit.\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard acknowledged in an email sent to reporters that there are \"unofficial alerts\" and notices and told - News it did not have any information on when an unofficial notice may have been given to Walz's unit.\n\nEven according to Walz himself, he was acutely aware of the likelihood of a deployment by at least March.\n\nWalz had filed as a candidate for Congress on January 5, 2005, according to a Federal Election Commission document, and, in March 2005, his campaign sent out a press statement that said the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced a \"possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard.\"\n\n\"The announcement from the National Guard PAO specified that all or a portion of Walz's battalion could be mobilized to serve in Iraq within the next two years,\" Walz's campaign said in the statement. In the statement, Walz said he did not know if his unit would be part of the mobilization but acknowledged that, as the top enlisted leader of his unit, he had a \"responsibility\" to \"ready my battalion for Iraq\" and \"serve if called on.\"\n\nHe said, \"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq.\"\n\nDespite this statement, he retired two months later.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Public_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Public Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Election_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Election Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Retirement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Retirement", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement Planning", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-01-05", "textStart": 3530, "textEnd": 3545}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-", "textStart": 2347, "textEnd": 2355}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-07-", "textStart": 2412, "textEnd": 2421}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-08-", "textStart": 2445, "textEnd": 2456}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-03-", "textStart": 3608, "textEnd": 3618}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

JD Vance's accusation that Walz is guilty of \"stolen valor,\" the National Guard veteran told Fox News host Laura Ingraham that it's \"far darker than a lot of people think.\"\n\n\"He's used the rank that he never achieved in order to advance his political career,\" he said. \"I mean, he still says he's a retired command sergeant major to this day, and he's not. He uses the rank of others to make it look like he's a better person than he is.\"\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nQuestions emerged about Walz's rhetoric surrounding his time in the service after Vice President Kamala Harris announced him as her running mate on the 2024 Democratic ticket.\n\nWalz is described as a retired \"command sergeant major\" in his governor's website biography and has also claimed he carried a gun \"in war,\" despite never experiencing active combat.\n\nIngraham, however, said the Minnesota National Guard told the \"Angle\" he retired as a master sergeant.\n\n\"To most people, that would mean that he was actually in combat, carrying a weapon in a combat zone and getting combat pay and in a dangerous and hostile environment where he is getting shot at,\" Behrends said.\n\n\"I mean, if he thinks Italy was a combat zone or a war zone, and he was carrying that in war, he's delusional,\" he added.\n\nBehrends said Walz had been promoted to command sergeant major in 2004, but claimed he was required to serve two additional years or the promotion would be void.\n\nHis early retirement terminated the promotion, reducing his rank to master sergeant, Behrends said.\n\nVP KAMALA HARRIS PICKING GOV. TIM WALZ AS RUNNING MATE MET WITH MEDIA SCORN: 'SUCH A WEIRD CHOICE'\n\n\"What he did, basically, was he quit. He didn't complete that condition of doing two years after graduation, so he gets reduced to a master sergeant, and that's what he is right now, is a retired master sergeant.\"\n\nIn statement to Fox News, Army Lt. Col. Ryan Rossman, Minnesota National Guard's director of Operations, explained Walz's rank at the time of his retirement:\n\n\"He was technically a Command Sgt Major when he deployed to Europe with his battalion but to RETIRE as a CSM you have to go through a final course which he had not completed so from a benefits perspective the Army retired him as a Master Sgt (lower enlisted rank.) But according to National Guard records he was a Command Sgt Major technically when deployed. The lower rank was as a result of benefit requirements and a technicality.\"\n\nThe campaign issued a statement on the matter: \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as our Vice President of the United States, he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nThe response didn't sit well with Behrends.\n\n\"From what I get from the soldiers that I went to Iraq with, probably 98% of them are completely against him embellishing his record,\" he said. \"Don't try to make it look like you were a command sergeant major. Don't try to make it look like you were going to some place that was in support of Operation Enduring Freedom... that's just all embellishment and lies to try to make things look better.\"\n\nTom Schilling, who also said he was a member of Walz's battalion, slammed his actions as \"dishonorable\" during an interview on \"Jesse Watters Primetime.\"\n\n\"I have my stories about what he did to the military, when he left us like that, and I was kind of like, 'Are you kidding me?'\" Schilling said, recalling his reaction when he heard Harris tapped Walz as her running mate.\n\n\"We all did what we were supposed to do, we did the right thing, and it's dishonorable what he did,\" Schilling said. \"He left somebody else to take over his spot.

Tim Walz of Minnesota was guilty of \"stolen valor\" Thursday, accusing Republicans of trying to \"Swift Boat\" the presumptive Democratic nominee for vice president.\n\nQuestions about Walz's 2005 retirement from the Minnesota National Guard arose after a 2018 Facebook post by retired Army Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends resurfaced in the wake of Walz's selection as Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate. After airing a video segment from MSNBC host Chris Hayes, Brzezinski then cited a Minnesota Public Radio report as she attempted to \"fact check\" the stolen valor allegations directed at Walz, comparing them to the criticism of then-Democratic Sen. John Kerry from Vietnam War veterans during the 2004 presidential campaign, highlighted by a group known as Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.\n\n\"A medical board considered dismissing Walz in 2002 due to hearing problems he developed while working with high-powered weapons during his more than two decades in the National Guard. At that point, a guardsman who served under Walz says he was already openly discussing retiring in order to run for Congress,\" Brzezinski claimed. \"Records show that in January of 2005, he did, indeed, take that step and filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission. Two months later, Walz acknowledged in a campaign statement that there were talks about units potentially being deployed but wrote, quote, 'I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization.'\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nIn the statement, dated March 20, 2005, Walz, then running against Republican Rep. Gil Gutknecht of Minnesota, said that \"as Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on.\"\n\n\"In May of that year, documents show he officially retired from the military, meaning he likely had to inform the National Guard of his plans many months earlier,\" Brzezinski continued. In July of 2005, six months after Walz declared his intent to run for Congress, his former battalion received a mobilization alert. Then the following month, the order to deploy. Vance also accused Walz yesterday of lying about his rank of command sergeant major. But in a statement, the National Guard says the governor did, indeed, reach that level. Though he, quote, retired as a master sergeant for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, the GOP nominee for vice president, accused Walz of \"dishonesty\" Wednesday while speaking at a campaign event in Wisconsin. Walz claims on his official page that he retired as a Command Sergeant Major, but the Harris campaign later said Walz earned the title, but admitted he retired as a master sergeant, according to Politico.\n\n\"Jonathan Lemire, again, different people do different types of service, and J.D. Vance is going after Tim Walz and lining it with untruths, but also, I feel like a service member denigrating another service member for his service is just, I don't know, I'm not sure how that's going to play,\" Brzezinski said to \"Morning Joe\" co-host Lemire. \"That may go in the JV Vance category, as well.\"\n\nCo-host Lemire claimed the Trump campaign was trying to attack Walz's service record, comparing it to the criticism Kerry received from fellow Vietnam War veterans during the 2004 campaign.\n\n\"The overall argument as you just laid out in the fact-check, and our colleague Chris Hayes did last night, it simply doesn't hold water, the idea of stolen valor, that he bailed on his unit to avoid combat deployment. These are attacks that don't seem particularly honest, and it's unclear whether they will resonate,\" Lemire said. \"Charlie Sykes, I think it is a couple other things that need to be noted here. First of all, this just shows how the Trump team has really struggled to come up with any sort of effective attack lines against Vice President Harris and now, in these early days, her running mate, so they're seizing upon this. We should say perhaps it's not too surprising, Chris LaCivita, one of the top Trump aides, he was the architect of the Swift Boat attacks against John Kerry back in 2004. This is a familiar playbook with him.\"\n\nLaCivita did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Bush where he held up a sign that read \"Operation Enduring Freedom Veteran 4 Kerry\" -- referencing the US fight against terrorists in Afghanistan.\n\nThe trouble is, in his 24 years in the Minnesota National Guard, Walz never deployed to combat zones in Afghanistan or Iraq. The closest he got was thousands of miles away in Italy. But it's a label he used again and again -- including in his official biography when he ran for Congress two years later in 2006.\n\nThat photo shows just one way that Walz, Kamala Harris' VP pick, has repeatedly exaggerated and embellished his military record. Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq, accused the second-term governor of Minnesota of \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\nAt least one former member of Walz's National Guard unit who was deployed to Iraq took a dim view of the haphazard way in which the VP candidate has spoken about his service.\n\n\"It's stolen valor,\" said the former guardsman, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"He used very specific phrases on his website that would suggest to a civilian that he had been to Afghanistan. He carried signs protesting at a rally for George W. Bush saying he was part of Operation Enduring Freedom, which would signal that he had seen combat in Afghanistan when he hadn't.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign seemed to acknowledge the critics on Thursday when it scrubbed another contested claim about his service record from his official biography on its website -- that Walz had retired as a command sergeant major.\n\n(In fact, Walz actually retired from the military with the rank of master sergeant because he hadn't completed the required additional coursework, the military said.)\n\nThat, too, was a claim he made repeatedly. A newly surfaced video from 2009 shows then-Congressman Walz delivering a televised farewell message to a group of soldiers deploying for Iraq in which he calls himself a \"retired Command Sergeant Major.\"\n\nWhile far from the worst elision, it demonstrates how the questions being asked are forcing the campaign to do some editorial damage control.\n\nThe most egregious -- which CNN's own fact check labeled \"absolutely false\" -- came during a 2018 campaign appearance when Walz was running for governor.\n\nWhile trying to burnish his pro-gun control bona fides before a small crowd at a campaign event, Walz said, \"We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nWhen pressed, Walz conceded later that year that he did not \"carry weapons of war\" in the field of battle.\n\nIraq vet and former Republican congressman from Michigan Peter Meijer also criticized Walz's choice of words, but stopped short of agreeing fully with Vance's assessment that he was guilty of \"stolen valor\" -- lying about military service or achievements to get ahead in civilian life.\n\n\"I think Walz played fast and loose with his military bio to stay above water as his congressional district drifted right,\" Meijer wrote in a thread on X addressing the accusations against Walz.\n\n\"He let audiences paint in their minds a deceptive picture. It was shady, but not stolen valor.\"\n\nAlex Plintsas, a decorated Iraq War army veteran and Atlantic Council fellow, called Walz's choice of words about being a veteran of \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" \"true but misleading\" -- indicating they deliberately lack context in an attempt to make people believe he fought in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Why misleading? When you ask a fellow veteran where they deployed or if they offer first, it's 'Iraq,' 'Afghanistan,' 'Syria' etc. No one says 'Operation Enduring Freedom Veteran.' That goes on the hats you wear to the VA for doctors appointments. I don't make the rules,\" he wrote on X.\n\nIn 2009, David Thul, a National Guard veteran and constituent of Walz, marched the protest photo into his campaign office to confront a staffer about the \"Operation Enduring Freedom\" claim.\n\n\"Is there any question in your mind what Enduring Freedom is?\" the veteran asks in a viral video of the encounter.\n\n\"No,\" the staffer said.\n\n\"Ok, so I guess most people, yourself included, associate Enduring Freedom with Afghanistan?\" he pressed.\n\n\"Right, I think his audience understands it encompasses a great deal,\" the staffer offered.\n\nThe veteran then asked, \"My concern, other than this picture, is that the congressman's website, his official biography, says simply that he [was a veteran] in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. Without any other details, don't you think it's reasonable people might assume he served in Afghanistan?\"\n\nThe staffer muttered in reluctant response, \"perhaps, I guess.\"\n\nThe vet than said the photograph \"could get the congressman probably thrown in jail for a violation of the [2005] Stolen Valor Act,\" which made it \"a federal misdemeanor to falsely represent oneself as having received any U.S. military decoration or medal.\"\n\nIn fact, Walz has also been criticized for putting in for retirement from the Minnesota National Guard before his unit deployed to Iraq for the first time in 2005. Two men in his unit -- Sgt.

Only a tiny fraction of those thought to stay in the service after being disabled on the job, and one of them is Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. An enlisted soldier in the National Guard for nearly a quarter of a century, a journey that began on a Nebraska farm as soon as he was eligible to join.\n\nTIM WALZ: My father served during the Korean War and the day after I turned 17, he took me down to an Army National Guard recruiter and I raised my hand and signed up.\n\nHAYES: That was in 1981. Ronald Reagan was president. Now Walz continued to serve for the next 24 years, under four Commanders-in-Chief. He spent most of that time as an artillery soldier, and it took a toll on his hearing. In fact, in 2002 after he'd already done 20 years he qualified for retirement. A medical board considered discharging him because of his hearing impairment. Instead he convinced them to let him complete his final enlistment, which began after 9/11. Walz achieved the highest enlisted rank in the army, Command Sergeant Major, but rather than stay in and complete the schooling for the rank, Walz retired in 2005 at the rank of Master Sergeant. In part, he says, because he wanted at that point to speak freely about political injustice, specifically, the Iraq war. The following year, he was one of more than 60 anti war veterans running for Congress, the Fighting Dems, a group that included Jim Webb, Patrick Murphy and Tammy Duckworth.\n\nOne has to laugh at the prospect of Acela Media elite now pretending to care about service members generally, and about the arcane details of promotions and billeting, and E-9 command splits specifically. The fact is that they don't, but must pretend to do so in order to defend the Regime and its new prospective deputy figurehead.\n\nNothing in Hayes' four minute-plus segment addressed the specific claims made against Walz, or debunked any of what is already on the record. At most, Hayes presents an alternate version of events, without evidence: that of the brave dissident sacrificing promotion in order to fight \"political injustice\", as opposed to the man who ditched his unit in order to avoid deployment to Iraq.\n\nBut as more details become available Walz becomes harder to spin, and the media begin to look more ridiculous and servile. From Walz's archived website:\n\nOn Thursday, March 17 the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced a possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard. First District congressional candidate Tim Walz currently holds the rank of Command Sergeant Major in the 1-125th Battalion, which is based in New Ulm and largely composed of men and women from southern Minnesota. The announcement from the National Guard PAO specified that all or a portion of Walz's battalion could be mobilized to serve in Iraq within the next two years. Walz, who teaches Global Geography at Mankato West High School, has been an active member of the National Guard since 1981. He has been previously deployed during his 23 years in the National Guard, including an eight month deployment during Operation Enduring Freedom. When asked about his possible deployment to Iraq Walz said, \"I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment.\"\n\nWalz knew his unit might deploy well before his decision to retire. Just to put a really fine point on it, the item, dated March 20th,2005 is titled, Walz Still Planning to Run for Congress Despite Possible Call to Duty in Iraq.\n\nIt increasingly looks like Walz chose his Congressional run over his unit. That, combined with other embellishments, such as his claims of serving in Operation Enduring Freedom, and his wearing of a Special Forces ballcap despite never serving in such a unit, becomes increasingly hard to defend. Good luck with that.\n\nClick \"expand\" to view the full transcript of the aforementioned segment as aired on MSNBC's All In With Chris Hayes on Wednesday, August 7th, 2024:", "source": {"uri": "newsbusters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://newsbusters.org/"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Enlisted rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wildfire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_Dems", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fighting Dems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_In_with_Chris_Hayes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All In with Chris Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Murphy_(Pennsylvania_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Murphy (Pennsylvania politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammy_Duckworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tammy Duckworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Webb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Webb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

Tim Walz: his departure two decades ago from the Army National Guard.\n\nWalz, introduced Tuesday as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, ended his 24-year military career to run for public office in 2005 -- just before the unit he led deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,\" Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate and a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, said Wednesday at a news conference in Michigan.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" Vance added.\n\nThe strategy, which Trump amplified Wednesday by calling Walz a \"DISGRACE\" in a Truth Social post, is a throwback to 2004, when Republicans attacked Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry's record as a Navy officer in Vietnam. Chris LaCivita -- who served as a consultant to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth group that helped sink Kerry's bid -- is a senior adviser to Trump's campaign and has signaled an eagerness to reopen the playbook on Walz.\n\n\"And when his men needed him the most ... as they headed into the Crucible that is combat ... he deserted them ... left them,\" LaCivita posted Tuesday on X, shortly after Harris selected Walz to join her on the Democratic ticket. \"Why? So he could run for Congress.\"\n\nIn introducing Walz, 60, to a wider audience beyond Minnesota, the Harris campaign has emphasized his military record, as well as his experience as a football coach. Campaign officials frame his decision to leave the National Guard and pursue a career in politics as a path that offered him new and meaningful opportunities to help service members and veterans.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement for this article.\n\nWalz has faced these attacks before, including in his 2022 re-election campaign, when his GOP opponent questioned the governor's decision to leave the service in 2005. Walz's campaign responded with a letter signed by 50 veterans praising his record and leadership.\n\n\"Governor Walz secured additional funding for new veterans homes,\" read the letter, a copy of which the Harris campaign shared Wednesday with NBC News. \"In his first term, Minnesota was one of just seven states initially selected by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to participate in the 'Governor's Challenge' to eliminate veteran deaths by suicide.\"\n\nErick Erickson, a prominent conservative commentator, drew attention Tuesday to a paid letter to the editor that scrutinized Walz's service and was published by a local newspaper in 2018, days before he won his first term as governor. Erickson also called for a return of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, prompting LaCivita's initial social media post. Other posts followed.\n\n\"He deserted his men and quit before they went to combat,\" LaCivita wrote of Walz in response to a complimentary post from Alyssa Farah Griffin, a co-host of the daytime talk show \"The View\" and a former Trump White House aide who has since denounced the former president.\n\nLaCivita's previous work with Swift Boat Veterans for Truth stands as one of the most aggressive and potentially consequential political attacks of the modern era.\n\nKerry -- who was awarded a Silver Star, a Bronze Star and, for wounds sustained in battle, three Purple Heart medals -- had drawn the ire of many veterans for his advocacy against the war after returning home. And as he sought the presidency in 2004, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ran ads accusing Kerry of lying about his service on 50-foot aluminum crafts that ran dangerous missions in the Mekong Delta waterways of South Vietnam. Some of the veterans featured in the ads said that he had won awards under false premises.\n\nThen-Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who spent years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam before becoming friends with Kerry in the Senate, criticized the ads and noted that the veterans making claims against Kerry did not serve on his boat. Some of those who did supported Kerry's accounts. The allegations, which Kerry did not immediately counter, muddied the picture he presented of himself as a war hero -- which appeared to be the group's aim from a political perspective. Swift Boat Veterans for Truth may not have proved its case, but it sowed doubt about a perceived strength of Kerry's -- his war service -- and about his credibility.\n\nAs FactCheck.org concluded after exhaustive research, \"at this point, 35 years later and half a world away, we see no way to resolve which of these versions of reality is closer to the truth.\" Kerry lost to then-President George W. Bush.\n\nWalz joined the National Guard in 1981, just after his 17th birthday. After transferring from the Nebraska National Guard in 1996, he served in the Minnesota National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery, said Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, public affairs officer for the Minnesota National Guard. Walz, Aug\u00e9 added, \"culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion\" and \"retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nDuring Walz's nearly quarter-century of service, he was part of flood fights, responded to tornadoes and spent months on active duty in Italy, according to the Harris campaign. Walz \"was deployed to Italy in 2003 to protect against potential threats in Europe while active military forces were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan,\" the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported in 2022, attributing the information to Walz in an article about the scrutiny of his military service.\n\nWalz and Vance are the first veterans on a national ticket for either major party since McCain was the GOP presidential nominee in 2008. Vance, 40, briefly chronicled his experiences in Iraq in his 2016 memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" recalling his work as a public affairs marine.\n\n\"Sometimes I'd escort civilian press, but generally I'd take photos or write short stories about individual marines or their work,\" he wrote. \"Early in my deployment, I attached to a civil affairs unit to do community outreach. Civil affairs missions were typically considered more dangerous, as a small number of marines would venture into unprotected Iraqi territory to meet with locals.\"\n\nIn a Tuesday post on X that highlighted Walz's hunting and military background, the Harris campaign shared undated video footage that featured the governor talking about gun control.\n\n\"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz is seen and heard saying in the brief clip.\n\nVance alluded to the video at campaign stops Wednesday, accusing Walz of misrepresenting his military service and asserting that the governor never spent time in a combat zone.\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq?\" Vance asked at an event near Detroit. \"What bothers me about Tim Walz is this stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not. ... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nLater, after arriving for an event in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Vance told reporters that he had \"served in a combat zone\" and \"never said that I saw a firefight myself, but I've always told the truth about my Marine Corps service.\"\n\nTrump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt also alluded to the video in a statement, telegraphing the campaign's intentions to keep pressing on Walz's military record.\n\n\"Tim Walz is a fraud who wants to ban firearms like the ones he claimed to carry in war -- except Tim Walz never deployed to a combat zone and lied about his record of service in the National Guard,\" Leavitt said. \"If Walz won't tell voters the truth, we will: just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz is a dangerously liberal extremist, and the Harris-Walz California dream is every American's nightmare.\"\n\nAsked about the video, a Harris campaign spokesperson did not deny that Walz had embellished when he spoke of carrying weapons in war.\n\n\"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" the spokesperson said. \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tim Walz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portrayal of his military service on \u00e2\u0080\u0098Gutfeld!\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSo, we're finding out that much like a monkey's cage, Tim Walz is full of crap. Because, unlike the Harris campaign, people are actually vetting him. Especially the vet part. And he's about to become unburdened of the biggest highlight on his resum\u00c3\u00a9, meaning his military service with the Army National Guard. As noted by the Washington Free Beacon, when Walz first ran for Congress in 2006, his campaign described him as a \"veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" which typically applies to someone who served on the ground in Afghanistan during the War on Terror. But for him, it was more like Operation Enjoying Freedom, in Italy, not Afghanistan. Here he is in 2007, after he was elected to Congress, talking about his time during that operation.\n\nTIM WALZ: I spent 24 years in the National Guard, some of that full-time. I was an artillery man. I deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. My battalion provided base security throughout the European theater from Turkey to England, in the early stages of the war in Afghanistan. And that same battalion is now in Iraq at this time.\n\nWHERE DOES TIM WALZ STAND ON ISRAEL?\n\nNow it sounds like he was a lot closer to the battlefield than he actually might be. He was, in fact, deployed to a base in Italy. He wasn't taking live fire in Operation Enduring Freedom, it was more like Operation Enduring Pasta. I kid. And in 2009, a local veteran went to his Minnesota office and asked the staffer if it's possible to mistakenly assume that he served in Afghanistan based on his website bio. And the staffer said perhaps.\n\nHARRIS CAMPAIGN WALKS BACK WALZ BIO AMID \u00e2\u0080\u0098STOLEN VALOR\u00e2\u0080\u0099 CONTROVERSY AS QUESTIONS SWIRL\n\nSo the vet suggests, hey, maybe you should change it to say that Walz served in Italy instead. But Walz's office did nothing, though they did offer the vet a case of military-grade tampons.\n\nThen there's the two fellow National Guardsmen who said in 2022 that Walz reached the rank of command sergeant major but didn't complete the coursework to maintain that rank before he retired at a lower rank, which the Minnesota National Guard confirmed. Yet, even on his own website, he still calls himself command sergeant major. Apparently, his resume has more padding than Joy Behar's toilet seat.\n\nSo, did he lie about his rank to fuel his political aspirations, just as he managed to avoid a war? Does it matter? When your job is to lead young men in battle but your desire to dine with Barrack and Michelle matters more, you probably had no business leading anyone to begin with. And yet, the Harris campaign just posted this video of Walz talking about how the weapons he carried in war shouldn't be allowed anywhere but the battlefield.\n\nTIM WALZ: I spent 25 years in the Army, and I gave the money back. And I'll tell you what I have been doing. I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment. But we can do background checks. We can do CDC research. We can make sure we don't have reciprocal carry among states, and we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons work.\n\nNext he'll tell us he used his bayonet to do butter carving. But if Tim Walz said we should ban the very weapons he carried in war and he didn't carry any weapons, doesn't that mean we can keep all of our weapons? Great. I want an Abrams tank. Again, he's never been to a war zone unless you count his state during the George Floyd riots. In reality, when his unit got called for deployment to Iraq after he'd been appointed to acting senior enlisted leader, he bailed to run for Congress. But now even CNN is calling him out.\n\nCNN GUEST: Walz did make a comment speaking to a group, he's done it a couple of times where he has used language that has suggested that he carried weapons in a fighting situation. There is a difference between being in a combat area, being involved at a time of war, and actually being in a position where people are shooting at you. There is no evidence that at any time, Governor Walz was in a position of being shot at, and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest that he was. So that is absolutely false.\n\nHoly -- - that's CNN! I know. Wow. Who did Walz piss off? Did he steal one of Jake Tapper's copies of Juggs Magazine? Meanwhile, listen to Minnesota Senator Tina Smith comparing Walz to JD Vance.\n\nSEN TINA SMITH: Well, here is Tim Walz, who enlisted when he was 17 years old. He served in the National Guard for 24 years. And I'm not aware of any military service that JD Vance has ever served. So let's just make the comparison there.\n\nLet's not, Tina. First, you're leaving out the main point. No one is accusing Vance of lying, and it's kind of hard to believe you're not aware of any military service Vance served. What else are you not aware of? That you stole John Denver's haircut? The fact is, lies like this got Brian Williams demoted and the closest he came to combat was being near Matt Lauer's office. But apparently, the new tactic here is to muddy the waters. Right, Nance?\n\nMSNBC'S ANDREW MITCHELL: JD Vance has criticized him as never having been in combat.\n\nI think. Wow, these are just some journalists. Now, Nance, JD never said he was in combat, unlike Walz, which you would have clearly heard if your last face lift hadn't blocked your ears. The oddest take, though, comes from Mayor Pete, who wrote, \"denigrating a soldier's service based on whether he deployed to a war zone is kind of like denigrating a woman's citizenship based on whether she happens to have children.\" So I guess two months of paternity leave makes him an expert on childbirth? It's the worst analogy ever. A non-deployed soldier is like a childless woman?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMaybe if the childless woman tells people if she has kids to get benefits. Mayor Pete manages to derail trains and conversations. So it seems the Dems only fight when it's political, then they circle the wagons. The problem is what they're defending for many Americans is indefensible. You can lie about stolen valor, but you can't make veterans forget about it.", "source": {"uri": "foxwilmington.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "foxwilmington.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Tim Walz's biography on Thursday to remove a reference to him as a \"retired command sergeant major.\"\n\nWalz has fallen under scrutiny from Republicans for referring to himself as a retired command sergeant major when, in reality, he was only conditionally promoted to the rank but failed to perform the training necessary to permanently obtain it before retiring as a master sergeant in 2005, according to a statement provided by the Minnesota National Guard to Just the News on Wednesday. Harris' website referred to Walz as a \"retired command sergeant major\" until at least Thursday morning, according to an archived copy of the page, but has since clarified its description to note that he once served as command sergeant major without stating that he retired as one.\n\n\"[Walz] retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, a Minnesota National Guard's State public affairs officer, told Just the News. \"The Soldier must complete the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Course as a condition of this promotion. Failure to meet the condition will cause demotion per AR 600 - 8 - 19,\" according to Army rules. (RELATED: Tim Walz Appears To Ignore Shouted Questions About 'Stolen Valor' Accusation)\n\nWalz's original biography on Harris' campaign website called him \"the son of an Army veteran and a retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard himself,\" according to an archived version of the page. The current version of the website, however, calls him \"the son of an Army veteran who served as a command sergeant major.\"\n\nWalz is also facing allegations that he retired from the Minnesota National Guard early to avoid deployment to Iraq, claims Democratic operatives have denied. Walz, however, knew his battalion was likely to be deployed to Iraq when he retired as he mentioned the possibility in congressional campaign materials published before his retirement, the Washington Free Beacon reported Wednesday.\n\n\"When your country calls, you are supposed to run into battle -- not the other way,\" retired command sergeant major Thomas Behrends, who took Walz's place after his retirement and was deployed to Iraq, told the New York Post on Tuesday. \"He had the opportunity to serve his country, and said 'Screw you' to the United States. That's not who I would pick to run for vice president.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He then transferred to the Minnesota National Guard, where he served from 1996-2005 -- bringing his total time in service to just over 24 years. In that time, he earned the rank of master sergeant (E-8).\n\nBut Walz, according to numerous reports, has repeatedly \"embellished\" his military service. His official Capitol Hill biography -- which he made no move to correct -- stated that he retired at the rank of command sergeant major. However, the Minnesota National Guard disputes that and says that Walz, though conditionally promoted to CSM just prior to his retirement, failed to meet the conditions and was returned to his previous rank. In the Army, such a move might earn him the nickname \"PX Ranger\" -- someone who bought his rank rather than earning it.\n\nOther reports -- some from the Minnesota National Guard soldiers who ultimately deployed without him -- state that Walz backed out of those conditions and forfeited his promotion only after learning that his unit was set to deploy to Iraq. A move like that, leaving his men high and dry, would earn him the slightly less attractive code name Blue Falcon -- translated: \"Buddy f***er.\"\n\nDespite all that, in the time since, Walz has often referenced his service in more generous terms than perhaps it warrants. He's said on a number of occasions that he \"deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)\" without offering any sort of clarification unless he was directly asked. When most people hear OEF referenced that way, they would likely assume Walz had deployed to Afghanistan -- and Walz was undoubtedly aware of that.\n\nIn his efforts to promote stricter gun control, Walz has claimed that he just wants to make sure that \"weapons of war, that I carried in war\" cannot be owned and carried by civilians outside of combat. The obvious problem with that statement is that Walz never carried such weapons in combat because he never served in a combat zone.\n\nOver the last 48 hours, since Harris named Walz as her running mate, the stories have come spilling out -- and Democrats have scrambled to protect Walz and attack anyone who dares to suggest that he's done anything less than honorable.\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER FOR 'AM I RACIST?' -- A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, also an Army veteran, jabbed at the Republican vice presidential nominee -- Ohio Senator and Marine Corps veteran JD Vance -- in a post on X, saying, \"Come to think of it, denigrating the worth of a soldier's service based on whether he deployed to a war zone is... kind of like denigrating the worth of a woman's citizenship based on whether she happens to have children.\"\n\nFormer Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) used the opportunity to denigrate Vance's service, saying, \"Ok. JD served honorably, but he wasn't kicking down doors. He was in public affairs. Which again, is fine and honorable. Tim, after he was eligible for retirement, retired. People do that. If it was a real problem he would have been 'stop lossed' and prevented from retiring.\"\n\nBut the reality is that no one has denigrated Walz's service more than he did himself. He was the one who decided that 24 years and one month was not enough (he often claims he served 25 years). He was the one who decided that a deployment to Italy -- in support of troops on the ground in Afghanistan (OEF) -- was not as glamorous as letting people assume that he'd been in combat himself. He was the one who decided there was no real need to correct the record when his official congressional biography reflected a higher rank than his retirement records. And he is the one who, to sell gun control, continues to insinuate that he served in a combat zone.\n\nWhat's truly insulting to his service is that, in most cases, he has stopped just short of telling the actual lie himself. He simply left the statements open to interpretation -- \"I deployed in support of OEF\" -- knowing how the statements were likely to be interpreted and letting others do the real heavy lifting when it came to inflating his resume.\n\nThe Army has a list of core values that are taught in the form of an acronym: LDRSHIP. Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity, and Personal Courage. Walz's carefully cultivated statements -- and equally cultivated omissions -- fly in the face of nearly all of them.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily

When Tim Walz was asked...he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\" he lashed out, adding, \"What's bothers me about Tim Walz is this stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\"\n\nCue for Walz supporters to dig into Vance's deployment, which showed that much of his service in the Marine Corps, including six months in Iraq, was as a media relations officer. \"Talk about Stolen Valor. JD Vance was a combat correspondent who created Marine press releases and spent his 6 months in Iraq, in a NON COMBAT role, babysitting journalists,\" one critic wrote. Others cited his comments that service \"taught me how to live like an adult\" and that he was \"lucky to escape any real fighting.\"\n\nVance supporters in turn accused Walz of misrepresenting his service to suggest he had been deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan in active combat, and producing footage of veterans confronting his staff on the matter when he was running for Congress. Walz supporters say he had quit the National Guard to run for office before the deployment was announced and he never directly claimed to have been in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nLost in this war of words were voices calling for respecting service in the military and honoring veterans regardless of how and where they served.\n\nMilitary service was a big deal in the US, and in American politics in particular. Two-thirds of American Presidents -- 31 out of 46 by one estimate -- have served in the military in some capacity. The salience of military service has decreased in recent years. Four of last five presidents, Clinton, Obama, Trump, and Biden, did not serve in the military.\n\nThe last President to do so was George W. Bush who had a sketchy stint with the Air National Guard. Like Vance and Walz, he too appeared to be a reluctant serviceman, writing in his memoir that he was willing to serve his country but preferred to do so as a combat pilot rather than \"an infantryman wading across a paddy-field.\"\n\nPolitical scientists say American voters are now comfortable with electing people who haven't served in the military, and point to John Kerry (Democrat), John McCain, and Bob Dole (both Republicans), all of whom failed to win the presidential election despite a sterling record of active military service. Some of this, they surmise, has to do with the decline in the importance of foreign policy, particularly for MAGA voters whose \"America First\" approach disdains fighting wars abroad.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chidanand_rajghatta@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Chidanand Rajghatta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivy League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_correspondent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War correspondent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_First_(policy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "America First (policy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dole", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George W.

When a Local Vet Called Him Out, His Office Did Nothing.", "body": "Walz launched his first congressional campaign as 'a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom'\n\nDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz has described himself as \"a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the official name of the U.S. government's war in Afghanistan following the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nBut Walz never deployed to the Middle East. And, when an Iraq war veteran confronted Walz's aides with evidence of what he called \"stolen valor,\" his aides didn't do much to address his concerns.\n\nAs a first-time congressional candidate in 2006, Walz's campaign announcement described him as \"a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" an archived version of the press release shows. Two years earlier, in 2004, Walz organized a protest against then-President George W. Bush in Mankato, Minn. A photo of the rally shows Walz carrying a sign reading \"Enduring Freedom Veterans for Kerry.\"\n\nTim Walz Protests Outside of a Bush Rally in 2004 (@mbrodkorb / X)\n\nSuch a title historically applies to someone who served on the ground in Afghanistan during the Global War on Terrorism. Walz, a 24-year veteran of the Army National Guard, spent time in Norway in support of NATO forces and in Italy working in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. He had never seen combat, he told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018.\n\nWalz's claims spurred Iraq war veteran David Thul, a sergeant in the Minnesota National Guard, to approach Walz's aides at the Democrat's Mankato office in 2009. Thul filmed the encounter, in which a staffer told Thul she was \"not aware\" of Walz serving in Afghanistan. Thul went on to present the 2004 photo of Walz, as well as Walz's website, to another aide, who acknowledged that constituents could get the false impression that Walz served in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Operation Enduring Freedom is limited to Afghanistan and the airspace directly above,\" Thul told the aide. \"Congressman Walz is clearly claiming ... to be an Enduring Freedom veteran. Nobody disputes the fact that he is not an Afghanistan or Enduring Freedom veteran. So this represents a fairly serious issue.\" Asked whether he understood how constituents could falsely \"assume that means [Walz] served in Afghanistan,\" the aide responded, \"Perhaps, I guess.\"\n\nThe aide did not dispute that Walz was pictured in the 2004 photograph, and, indeed, a 2006 Atlantic article describes the spectacle of the future governor protesting the Bush visit with a group of high school students. The aide told Thul he would follow up with him. A source familiar with the situation said neither Walz nor his staffers followed through with that pledge.\n\nWalz, who has called himself a \"citizen soldier,\" has been accused before of embellishing his military service. Two Minnesota National Guardsmen said in 2022 that Walz falsely claimed he reached the rank of command sergeant major. But Walz did not fulfill the duties required to maintain that rank before he quit the service in 2005.\n\nAnd Walz, in a video posted this week by the Harris campaign, called for a ban on the kind of guns \"that I carried in war,\" the Washington Free Beacon reported.\n\nWalz served in the Nebraska National Guard from 1981 to 1996 and the Minnesota National Guard from 1996 to 2005. He resigned that year, quit his teaching job at Mankato West High School, and ran for Congress.\n\nThe photo Thul cited in the meeting was taken by Minnesota political consultant Michael Brodkorp. Brodkorp, who has identified Walz in the photo, endorsed the Democrat in his 2022 reelection campaign for governor.\n\nThe Harris campaign defended Walz's military record, citing his deployment overseas during the Afghanistan war. \"Governor Walz was deployed to Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom while serving in the National Guard,\" said Harris campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt. Walz's aide gave a similar defense in 2009, which Thul rejected.\n\n\"We appreciate his service and we appreciate his being deployed, but there's a huge difference between being deployed to a base in Italy and being in a combat zone in Afghanistan,\" Thul told the Walz aide in the 2009 encounter.\n\nWalz retired from the National Guard in 2005 and launched his congressional campaign the following year, as his unit was sent to Iraq.\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" two retired Command Sergeants Major wrote in a 2018 Facebook post during Walz's first gubernatorial bid. That post was recently unearthed by the Daily Wire.\n\nA source who served in the Minnesota National Guard at the time told the Free Beacon that Walz's retirement \"left a bad taste in a lot of peoples' mouths.\"", "source": {"uri": "freebeacon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Free Beacon"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chuck_ross@freebeacon.com", "name": "Chuck Ross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "George W.

I'm thinking about running for Congress,\" Mr. Eustice recalled.\n\n\"I said, 'What the hell's wrong?'\" he added. \"I mean, why would you want to do such a thing?\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign did not provide any new details about the timeline of Mr. Walz's decision to retire. Instead, it pointed to other past comments from fellow guardsmen who said that Mr. Walz had been considering running for office for some time and that the decision to retire from the military had weighed heavily on him.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform,\" said Ammar Moussa, a campaign spokesman, \"and as vice president of the United States, he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Vance also seized on a remark by Mr. Walz in a video clip that the Harris campaign had promoted on social media on Tuesday, in which the governor told a crowd about support for gun control, saying that \"we can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\"\n\nMr. Walz never served in combat, however, which prompted Mr. Vance to accuse him of \"stolen valor.\"\n\n\"I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did,\" Mr. Vance said.\n\nMr. Walz was deployed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, but not in a combat zone.\n\n\"The governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" Mr. Moussa said. \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nMr. Vance assailed Mr. Walz over his military record in response to a reporter's question about Mr. Walz's suggestion, in his debut speech alongside Ms. Harris the previous night, that Mr. Vance had misrepresented himself as a voice of the working class.\n\n\"Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires and wrote a best seller trashing that community,\" Mr. Walz had said. \"Come on. That is not what Middle America is.\"\n\nBut Mr. Vance's comments were also reminiscent of the \"Swift boat\" attacks in 2004 that effectively cast doubt on the military exploits of Senator John Kerry, then the Democratic presidential nominee. A key strategist behind those attacks, which helped doom Mr. Kerry's bid for the White House, was Chris LaCivita, who is a senior strategist for the Trump campaign.\n\nMr. Walz's long years in uniform began when he enlisted as an infantryman in the Nebraska Army National Guard in 1981, a few days after his 17th birthday. When he transferred to the Minnesota National Guard in the 1990s, his job changed to artillery.\n\nHe retired in 2005 as a master sergeant but had served earlier as a command sergeant major, one of the Army's highest enlisted ranks.\n\nThe accusation also recalled similar criticisms that former President Donald J. Trump has faced about avoiding military service. The three-time Republican presidential nominee sidestepped the war in Vietnam thanks to a deferment related to bone spurs in his heel, a medical assessment that was made as a favor for Mr. Trump's father, the doctor's daughter told The New York Times in 2018.\n\nPatrick Murphy, a former U.S. Army captain who was a roommate of Mr. Walz's when both served in the U.S. House, said he was dismayed by the attacks on Mr. Walz's military record.\n\n\"Anyone who tries to criticize his record but looks the other way at Donald Trump's six deferments to Vietnam is beyond the pale,\" said Mr. Murphy, a Pennsylvania Democrat.\n\nMr. Vance was on active duty with the Marine Corps from 2003 to 2007 during the Iraq war.\n\nMr. Vance, who then went by the name James D. Hamel, was assigned to the Second Marine Aircraft Wing, one of the Marine Corps' largest subordinate commands that oversees aircraft such as fighter jets and helicopters. He was deployed to Iraq in 2005 and 2006 with the aircraft wing but did not see combat as a frontline combatant.\n\nHis official military occupation, known as a combat correspondent, meant he was tasked with basic communication roles such as writing articles about the happenings in his unit.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [],

Tim Walz is an unknown to whom the media is already referring as an \"America's dad.\" How sweet. But the picture most of the media is drawing of Walz does not match the opinion of some soldiers in his National Guard command. They think he has embellished his career with the Guard and \"slithered out the door\" before his unit was deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"On May 16th, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" retired Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr wrote on Facebook in 2018. Walz was preparing for his first congressional campaign in 2005 when he retired.\n\nHerr and Behrends say Walz promised his unit he would join them in Iraq before backing out. The two retired command sergeants say that Walz could have asked the Pentagon to run for office while on active duty. Instead, he chose to quit.\n\nNew York Post:\n\nWalz further dodged the necessary paperwork to ensure a smooth transition out of military service and \"instead ... slithered out the door,\" the pair added, with his retirement filing showing \"soldier not available for signature.\"\n\nThe National Guard members also accused the now-two-term Minnesota governor of having \"embellished and selectively omitted facts of his military career for years.\"\n\nThe letter was first unearthed by the Daily Wire.\n\nStill, Walz has said he has \"an honorable record.\"\n\n\"We all do what we can. I'm proud I did 24 years,\" Walz said about his service.\n\nHerr and Behrends weren't the only members of Walz's unit to call him out for his \"disturbing\" retirement. Tom Hagen, an Iraq war veteran, wrote a letter to the Winona Daily News, framing Walz's retirement as an abandonment of his comrades.\n\n\"But even more disturbing is the fact that Walz quickly retired after learning that his unit -- southern Minnesota's 1-125 FA Battalion -- would be sent to Iraq,\" Hagen wrote in the letter, according to Behrends and Herr. \"For Tim Walz to abandon his fellow soldiers and quit when they needed experienced leadership most is disheartening. It dishonors those brave American men and women who did answer their nation's call and who continue to serve, fight and unfortunately die in harm's way for us.\"\n\n\"The bottom line in all of this is gut-wrenching and sad to explain,\" Behrends and Herr concluded. \"When the nation called, he quit.\"\n\nBehrends added to his Facebook Post: \"We are the land of the free, because of the brave. We are not the land of the free, because of those who ran.\"\n\n\"The citizens of the state of Minnesota deserve to hear this side of the story, not just a slithery politician's version of what he wants people to hear.\"\n\nRelated: Walz's Response to the George Floyd Riots Shows His Unfitness For Vice President\n\nIt's not likely that any of this will become a major issue, and that's a shame. It shouldn't disqualify Walz from running as Harrais's vice president, but it's information that voters should have available to them.\n\nHelp PJ Media remain a vital part of the conservative conversation by becoming one of our VIP or VIP Gold supporters.

He uses the rank of others to make it look like he's a better person than he is.\"\n\nQuestions emerged about Walz's rhetoric surrounding his time in the service after Vice President Kamala Harris announced him as her running mate on the 2024 Democratic ticket.\n\nWalz is described as a retired \"command sergeant major\" in his governor's website biography and has also claimed he carried a gun \"in war,\" despite never experiencing active combat.\n\nIngraham, however, said the Minnesota National Guard told the \"Angle\" he retired as a master sergeant.\n\n\"To most people, that would mean that he was actually in combat, carrying a weapon in a combat zone and getting combat pay and in a dangerous and hostile environment where he is getting shot at,\" Behrends said.\n\n\"I mean, if he thinks Italy was a combat zone or a war zone, and he was carrying that in war, he's delusional,\" he added.\n\nBehrends said Walz had been promoted to command sergeant major in 2004, but claimed he was required to serve two additional years or the promotion would be void.\n\nHis early retirement terminated the promotion, reducing his rank to master sergeant, Behrends said.\n\nVP KAMALA HARRIS PICKING GOV.

He didn't complete that condition of doing two years after graduation, so he gets reduced to a master sergeant, and that's what he is right now, is a retired master sergeant.\"\n\nIn statement to Fox News, Army Lt. Col. Ryan Rossman, Minnesota National Guard's director of Operations, explained Walz's rank at the time of his retirement:\n\n\"He was technically a Command Sgt Major when he deployed to Europe with his battalion but to RETIRE as a CSM you have to go through a final course which he had not completed so from a benefits perspective the Army retired him as a Master Sgt (lower enlisted rank.) But according to National Guard records he was a Command Sgt Major technically when deployed. The lower rank was as a result of benefit requirements and a technicality.\"\n\nThe campaign issued a statement on the matter: \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform \u00e2\u0080\" and as our Vice President of the United States, he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\n\"From what I get from the soldiers that I went to Iraq with, probably 98% of them are completely against him embellishing his record,\" he said. \"Don't try to make it look like you were a command sergeant major. Don't try to make it look like you were going to some place that was in support of Operation Enduring Freedom\u00e2\u0080| that's just all embellishment and lies to try to make things look better.\"\n\nTom Schilling, who also said he was a member of Walz's battalion, slammed his actions as \"dishonorable\" during an interview on \"Jesse Watters Primetime.\"\n\n\"I have my stories about what he did to the military, when he left us like that, and I was kind of like, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Are you kidding me?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\" Schilling said, recalling his reaction when he heard Harris tapped Walz as her running mate.\n\n\"We all did what we were supposed to do, we did the right thing, and it's dishonorable what he did,\" Schilling said. \"He left somebody else to take over his spot.

Tim Walz's military record has come under scrutiny since he was named as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democratic presidential ticket. Republicans are questioning both Walz's characterization of his time in uniform and his departure from service. Walz served a total of 24 years in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005. As he ramped up for a congressional bid in 2005, Walz's campaign in March issued a statement saying he still planned to run despite a possible mobilization of Minnesota National Guard soldiers to Iraq. Walz retired from service in May of that year, according to the Guard. A mobilization order for his unit was issued in August 2005. The unit mobilized in October and was deployed to Iraq in March 2006.", "source": {"uri": "messenger-inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@messenger-inquirer.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/messenger-inquirer.com/content/tncms/custom/image/a2a4b15c-9ead-11ee-847f-2b2be1350ebd.jpg?resize=600%2C338", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-08-", "textStart": 780, "textEnd": 791}, {"amb": false, "date": "2006-03-", "textStart": 851, "textEnd": 861}], "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nPatrick Murphy, an Army veteran who was Walz's roommate when they were both freshmen in Congress, called Walz a \"soldier's soldier.\"\n\n\"The two largest federal agencies are DoD and the VA, so someone who has intimate knowledge of both is incredibly important,\" Murphy, who served as Army undersecretary during the Obama administration, said in a phone interview with Military.com. \"He was a field artilleryman who has tinnitus as diagnosed by the VA, so he understands the plight of our brother and sister veterans.\"\n\nWalz enlisted in the Army National Guard in Nebraska in 1981 and retired honorably in 2005 as the top enlisted soldier for 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery Regiment, in the Minnesota National Guard, according to a copy of his records provided by the Minnesota Guard.\n\nHe reached the rank of command sergeant major and served in that role, but he officially retired as a master sergeant for benefits purposes because he didn't finish a required training course, according to the records and a statement from the Minnesota Guard.\n\nHis Guard career included responding to natural disasters in the United States, as well as a deployment to Italy to support US operations in Afghanistan, according to a 2018 article by Minnesota Public Radio. Walz earned several awards, including the Army Commendation Medal and two Army Achievement Medals, according to his military records.\n\nWorking a civilian job as a high school teacher and football coach, the Nebraska native was also named that state's Citizen Soldier of the Year in 1989, according to official biographies.\n\nDuring the 2022 Minnesota governor's race, Walz's opponent accused him of leaving the Guard when he did in order to avoid a deployment to Iraq, though Walz maintained he retired in order to focus on running for Congress, according to the Star Tribune newspaper.\n\nFar-right commentators and media resurfaced those allegations and knocked him for never serving in combat -- something he has never claimed to do -- in contrast with Vance's deployment to Iraq as a combat correspondent.\n\n\"Looks like it is time to bring back Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. Oof. Walz is a really unforced error. He bailed on the military when they decided to send him to Iraq. JD Vance actually served,\" conservative talk radio host Erick Erickson posted on social media Tuesday.\n\nWalz was first elected to the House of Representatives in 2006, becoming the highest-ranking retired enlisted soldier to serve in Congress.\n\nHis tenure in Congress included sitting on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, rising to be its ranking member in 2017.\n\n\"Walz' leadership on behalf of his fellow veterans when he was in the US House of Representatives is notable at a time when our all-volunteer force continues to struggle to recruit,\" Allison Jaslow, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said in a statement praising the choice of a veteran to be vice presidential nominee. \"How we care for our veterans is as important to our national security as how we care for our troops, and Walz has a record to prove that he understands that imperative.\"\n\nAs the top Democrat on the committee, Walz was a chief adversary for the Trump administration's Department of Veterans Affairs. He battled with then-acting VA Secretary Peter O'Rourke in 2018 during a standoff over O'Rourke's handling of the inspector general's office and pushed for an investigation into the influence of a trio of informal VA advisers who were members of Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.\n\nAn investigation by House Democrats completed after Walz left Congress concluded that the so-called Mar-a-Lago trio \"violated the law and sought to exert improper influence over government officials to further their own personal interests.\"\n\nWalz also opposed the Mission Act, the bill that expanded veterans' access to VA-funded care by non-VA doctors that Trump considers one of his signature achievements. Walz said in statements at the time that, while he agreed the program for veterans to seek outside care needed to be fixed, he believed the Mission Act did not have sustainable funding. VA officials in recent years have said community care costs have ballooned following the Mission Act.\n\nWalz supported another bill that Trump touts as a top achievement, the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which sought to make it easier for the VA to fire employees accused of misconduct or poor performance. But the implementation of that law was later part of Walz's fight with O'Rourke. The law also faced legal challenges that prompted the Biden administration to stop using the expedited firing authorities granted by the bill.\n\nWalz was also an early proponent of doing more for veterans exposed to toxins during their military service, sponsored a major veterans suicide prevention bill, and advocated for the expansion of GI Bill benefits. And he repeatedly pushed the VA to study marijuana usage to treat PTSD and chronic pain, something that could come up in a future administration if the Department of Justice finalizes reclassifying marijuana into a category of drugs considered less dangerous.\n\nWalz's time in Congress also included a stint on the House Armed Services Committee, a perch he used to advocate for benefits for members of the National Guard.\n\nWalz consistently voted in support of the annual defense policy bill, as well as advocated for repealing the \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" policy that effectively banned gay and lesbian service members.\n\n\"He was my battle buddy in the fight to repeal 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell,' and it wouldn't have happened if we didn't have Command Sgt. Maj. Tim Walz helping lead the fight,\" Murphy said.\n\nSince becoming governor of Minnesota in 2019, Walz's role as commander in chief of the Minnesota National Guard has come under the spotlight several times.\n\nIn response to a request from the Minneapolis mayor, he activated the Guard in May 2020 to assist law enforcement when some protests over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd turned destructive. At the time, Minneapolis' mayor accused Walz of being too slow to order the deployment, a charge he denied.\n\n\"It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system, and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they're charged to protect,\" Walz said in a statement when he announced the activation.\n\nHe also activated the Guard to protect the Minnesota state Capitol in January 2021 amid fears that Trump supporters could riot at state houses as they did at the US Capitol that month. And he's used the Guard for missions that are more routine for the service, such as to help after heavy flooding earlier this summer.\n\nAs news broke Tuesday of Walz's selection, he quickly won praise from other Democratic veterans.\n\n\"Having a person who wore the uniform and who deployed around the world adds to the ticket someone who can connect with veterans and military families in a way that no one but a veteran can,\" Jon Soltz, chairman of liberal political action committee VoteVets, said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Tim Walz Accused of Cowardice and Embellishment of Army Service Record by Former Peers", "body": "The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, is being accused of cowardice and lying about his service record while he was serving in the Minnesota National Guard before his time as governor. In a letter to the editor of the West Central Tribune dated November 2, 2024, retired Command Sergeants Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr alleged that Walz lied or embellished his service record and shirked his duty as the senior enlisted leader of a Minnesota National Guard unit as it was about to be deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\nWe, retired Command Sergeants Major of the Minnesota National Guard, feel it is our duty and responsibility to bring forth the truth as we know it concerning his service record. So, we have put together a timeline of his service post 9/11. To the best of our knowledge, this information is completely true, having been verified by all those who served in positions with first hand knowledge of the facts and circumstances of his service and departure from the Minnesota National Guard. Many of the dates and time frames are from his official discharge document and the reduction order reducing him to Master Sergeant.\n\nGovernor Walz enlisted in the Minnesota National Guard in 1981 and served for 24 years, obtaining the rank of Sergeant Major. However, he was reduced in rank to Master Sergeant in September 2005 after failing to complete the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy. But that is just the end of his military career; according to Herr and Behrends, Tim Walz did other shameful things, and something far worse -- he abandoned his troops when they went to Iraq.\n\nIn September 2001, then First Sergeant Walz reenlisted in the Minnesota National Guard for six years and was selected to attend the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy (USASMA) in early 2003. Attending this course is mandatory for all senior enlisted members who intend to earn the promotion to the rank of Sergeant Major. The course consists of two years of correspondence coursework, followed by a two-week in-person phase at Fort Bliss, Texas. When a senior enlisted member accepts the invitation to the school, they agree to several stipulations, which include the possibility of being separated from the service if a person fails the course or that any failure to attend the course will result in an automatic reduction in rank to Master Sergeant. All participants must sign an agreement upon enrollment that they agree and abide by these stipulations. The USASMA is a college-level course and is funded by taxpayer money, so the military needs to ensure that the taxpayer gets a return on their investment.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, Walz deployed with the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom to Italy. The unit's mission was to augment the security forces of the United States Air Force Europe and take over responsibility for airbase security. However, the battalion did not replace any American unit or forces so they could deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan. After returning to Minnesota from that deployment in the spring of 2004, Walz was appointed to serve in the position of the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion Command Sergeant Major; however, he was not promoted to that rank. It is common for service members, especially in the Army and Marine Corps, to serve in positions of command without the associating rank. It is done either as a way to fill gaps until another member with the rank can assume the position or that individual will soon be promoted to the rank associated with the position.\n\nEven after being seen and photographed holding a sign at a protest outside of a President George W. Bush campaign rally in southern Minnesota in August 2004, Walz was selected to serve as the battalion's Command Sergeant Major.\n\nOn September 17th, 2004, Walz was conditionally promoted, or frocked, to Command Sergeant Major. When a service member is conditionally promoted or frocked, it means that while they rate the title of Command Sergeant Major and could wear that rank, they are not entitled to the pay yet. When Walz was given that promotion, he signed and initialed the Statement of Agreement and Certification for the USASMA, which meant that if Walz failed to comply with the conditions, his promotion would be null and void as if it never happened.\n\nWhen Walz and his battalion received warning orders that he, along with the battalion, would need to prepare for activation and mobilization for deployment to Iraq in early 2005, Walz committed the ultimate sin. He quit on his soldiers.\n\nOn May 16th, 2005 he quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war. His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for congress. Which is false, according to a Department of Defense Directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have. If he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academy. Instead he waited for the paperwork to catch up to him. His official retirement document states, SOLDIER NOT AVAILABLE FOR SIGNATURE.\n\nOn September 10th, Tim Walz was demoted and reduced in rank to Master Sergeant. He abandoned and walked away from his soldiers and his solemn responsibility to lead and take care of them. According to Behrends and Herr, Walz is hiding that part of the information from the public in an attempt to fool the electorate.\n\nThe 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion was deployed for 22 months in 2006 - 2007. During this time, they were restricted by Army regulations and could not speak out against a candidate for office. In November 2006 he was elected to the House of Representatives. He claims to be the highest-ranking enlisted service member ever to serve in congress. Even though he was conditionally promoted to Command Sergeant Major less than eight months, quit before his obligations were met, and was reduced to Master Sergeant for retirement. Yes, he served at that rank, but was never qualified at that rank, and will receive retirement benefits at one rank below.\n\nIn response to another letter to the editor of the West Central Tribune in 2006, Walz falsely claimed that he reenlisted for FOUR years and not six, and claimed he retired \"before his battalion was deployed to Iraq\" to run for Congress.\n\nAccording to his official Report of Separation and Record of Service, he re-enlisted for six years on September 18th, 2001. However, in his response he says that he re-enlisted for four years, conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq. Even if he had re-enlisted for four years following Sept.11, his retirement date would have been September 18th, 2005. Why then did he \"retire\" on May 16th, 2005, before his supposed four-year enlistment was up? And he makes it sound like he \"retired\" a year before his battalion deployed to Iraq; when in reality he knew when he \"retired\" that the battalion would be deployed to Iraq.\n\nAnother retired Command Sergeant Major corroborated the stories of Behrends and Herr. CSM (Ret) Douglas L. Julin was the 34th Infantry Division Command Sergeant Major and met with Walz, along with five other battalion CSM's, in early 2005 before they deployed to Iraq. According to Julin, Walz said he would be deploying with his battalion, even after mentioning that he was going to run for Congress.\n\n\"I'm going forward,\" Julin recalls Walz saying. \"Then out of nowhere in June of 2005, Tom Behrends is there as the new CSM.\" Julin said he was most upset with how it was handled because Walz didn't come to him as brigade command sergeant major, the position he held at the time. \"He went around my authority to get out of the position. I probably would have told him 'No, you're going on the deployment,'\" Julin said.\n\nRedState has reached out to Governor Walz for comment; however, we did not receive a reply prior to the publication of this article.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_funicello@redstate.com", "name": "Matt Funicello", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Sergeants_Major_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Sergeants Major Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military discharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enlisted rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Many of the comrades whom they shivved become angry about it.\n\nFor example, John Kerry in 2004.\n\nHe exaggerated his heroism in Vietnam, which came back to haunt him. That was only after he had made his bones by returning from Vietnam and slandering his fellow soldiers as torturers and sickos who taped electrodes to genitals and tortured the Vietnamese people, among other such claims. He made his name doing that.\n\nThen, he came around making statements such as, \"I liked serving in Vietnam with all my brothers.\"\n\nAnd all the Vietnam vets reacted: \"This jackass? This one?\"\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) was also involved in a stolen valor controversy. He was a Democrat from Connecticut running for the Senate who said that he served in Vietnam.\n\nHe didn't.\n\nThe long history of stolen valor continues. It turns out that Tim Walz is also a stolen valor guy, by all available evidence. He served in the National Guard for 24 years. But two separate claims about Walz also exist. One claim is that the minute he found out he was going to be deployed to Iraq, he quit. The minute that those rumors even began, he quit and then ran for Congress. So, a timeline is called into question.\n\nAnd then, he apparently claimed for years and years that he'd been deployed to war zones, though he never was. Now, there's nothing wrong with being in the military and not being deployed to a war zone. Plenty of members of the military were never deployed to a war zone, and we thank them for their heroic service.\n\nThere is a problem when you lie about it.\n\nIn a 2007 interview that aired on C-Span, Walz stretched some definitions to imply very strongly that he was in a war zone:\n\nI spent 24 years in the National Guard, some of that full-time; I was an artilleryman. I deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. My battalion provided base security throughout the European theater from Turkey to England in the early stages of the war in Afghanistan. And that same battalion is now in Iraq at this time.\n\nHe was talking about how his battalion ended up in Iraq. He was not in Iraq. He was talking about how he provided support for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, stretching some definitions at the very least. Somehow, almost every article from 2007 to 2018 about him included the lie he was actually in Afghanistan or Iraq. There are many, many of these. He actually endorsed a book that claimed he was in Afghanistan.\n\nAnd a lot of veterans are very, very angry about all of this.\n\nAnd then there's the question of the timeline because the claim from many of the members of his old battalion is that he quit on them the minute he found out they were going to Iraq. In 2018 after Walz first ran for governor, retired Command Sergeant Majors Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr wrote and posted a letter on Facebook:\n\nOn August 5th, 2004 he was photographed holding a sign at a protest outside a President Bush campaign rally in southern Minnesota.\n\nOn September 17th, 2004 he was conditionally promoted to Command Sergeant Major. The conditions had been outlined to him when he was counseled and he signed the Statement of Agreement and Certification. If the conditions are not met, the promotion is null and void, like it never happened.\n\nIn early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq. Between the time the warning order was given and his \"retirement\", he told the Brigade Command Sergeant Major not to worry, that he would be going on the mission. It appears that was a lie.\n\nOn May 16, 2005 he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war. His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for congress. Which is false, according to a Department of Defense Directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have. If he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academy. Instead he slithered out the door and waited for the paperwork ...\n\nThey added:\n\nOn September 10th, 2005 conditionally promoted Command Sergeant Major Walz was reduced to Master Sergeant. It took a while for the system to catch up to him as it was uncharted territory, literally no one quits in the position he was in, or drops out of the academy. Except him.\n\nIn November of 2005, while the battalion trained for war at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, it received an offer from retired Master Sergeant Walz. He offered to fund raise for the battalion's bus trip home over Christmas that year. The same Soldiers he had abandoned just months before, trying to buy their votes.\n\nOn November 1st, 2006, Tom Hagen, Iraq War Veteran, wrote a letter to the editor of the Winona Daily News about Walz, saying:\n\nBut even more disturbing is the fact that Walz quickly retired after learning that his unit -- southern Minnesota's 1-125 FA Battalion -- would be sent to Iraq. For Tim Walz to abandon his fellow soldiers and quit when they needed experienced leadership most is disheartening. It dishonors those brave Americans in his place.\n\nThis is a major scandal for Walz because when you exaggerate your military career, other veterans get angry.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnamese people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blumenthal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Blumenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Active duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-SPAN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "C-SPAN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Only a tiny fraction of those thought to stay in the service after being disabled on the job, and one of them is Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. An enlisted soldier in the National Guard for nearly a quarter of a century, a journey that began on a Nebraska farm as soon as he was eligible to join.\n\nTIM WALZ: My father served during the Korean War and the day after I turned 17, he took me down to an Army National Guard recruiter and I raised my hand and signed up.\n\nHAYES: That was in 1981. Ronald Reagan was president. Now Walz continued to serve for the next 24 years, under four Commanders-in-Chief. He spent most of that time as an artillery soldier, and it took a toll on his hearing. In fact, in 2002 after he'd already done 20 years he qualified for retirement. A medical board considered discharging him because of his hearing impairment. Instead he convinced them to let him complete his final enlistment, which began after 9/11. Walz achieved the highest enlisted rank in the army, Command Sergeant Major, but rather than stay in and complete the schooling for the rank, Walz retired in 2005 at the rank of Master Sergeant. In part, he says, because he wanted at that point to speak freely about political injustice, specifically, the Iraq war. The following year, he was one of more than 60 anti war veterans running for Congress, the Fighting Dems, a group that included Jim Webb, Patrick Murphy and Tammy Duckworth.\n\nOne has to laugh at the prospect of Acela Media elite now pretending to care about service members generally, and about the arcane details of promotions and billeting, and E-9 command splits specifically. The fact is that they don't, but must pretend to do so in order to defend the Regime and its new prospective deputy figurehead.\n\nNothing in Hayes' four minute-plus segment addressed the specific claims made against Walz, or debunked any of what is already on the record. At most, Hayes presents an alternate version of events, without evidence: that of the brave dissident sacrificing promotion in order to fight \"political injustice\", as opposed to the man who ditched his unit in order to avoid deployment to Iraq.\n\nBut as more details become available Walz becomes harder to spin, and the media begin to look more ridiculous and servile. From Walz's archived website:\n\nOn Thursday, March 17 the National Guard Public Affairs Office announced a possible partial mobilization of roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard. First District congressional candidate Tim Walz currently holds the rank of Command Sergeant Major in the 1-125th Battalion, which is based in New Ulm and largely composed of men and women from southern Minnesota. The announcement from the National Guard PAO specified that all or a portion of Walz's battalion could be mobilized to serve in Iraq within the next two years. Walz, who teaches Global Geography at Mankato West High School, has been an active member of the National Guard since 1981. He has been previously deployed during his 23 years in the National Guard, including an eight month deployment during Operation Enduring Freedom. When asked about his possible deployment to Iraq Walz said, \"I do not yet know if my artillery unit will be part of this mobilization and I am unable to comment further on specifics of the deployment.\"\n\nWalz knew his unit might deploy well before his decision to retire. Just to put a really fine point on it, the item, dated March 20th,2005 is titled, Walz Still Planning to Run for Congress Despite Possible Call to Duty in Iraq.\n\nIt increasingly looks like Walz chose his Congressional run over his unit. That, combined with other embellishments, such as his claims of serving in Operation Enduring Freedom, and his wearing of a Special Forces ballcap despite never serving in such a unit, becomes increasingly hard to defend. Good luck with that.\n\nClick \"expand\" to view the full transcript of the aforementioned segment as aired on MSNBC's All In With Chris Hayes on Wednesday, August 7th, 2024:\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Every year about 2 million Americans serve in the Armed Forces either full-time or one weekend a month. They come from all walks of life. All serve in different ways. Many serve as Senator JD Vance did. After high school, he signed up for a four-year enlistment in the Marines including six months in Iraq doing public affairs. He was then honorably discharged. We should say that's a bit of a rarity among politicians. Most politicians serve as officers after college. They don't enlist after high school because serving as an officer after college means better pay, better benefits, and there is a little bit of a division between officers and the enlisted Armed Forces. But there's an experience that is even rarer among the tiny fraction of Americans who enlist, a much smaller share make a career of it, serving 20 years or more with multiple, multiple deployments. Only a tiny fraction of those thought to stay in the service after being disabled on the job, and one of them is Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. An enlisted soldier in the National Guard for nearly a quarter of a century, a journey that began on a Nebraska farm as soon as he was eligible to join.\n\nTIM WALZ: My father served during the Korean War and the day after I turned 17, he took me down to an Army National Guard recruiter and I raised my hand and signed up.\n\nHAYES: That was in 1981.

The following year, he was one of more than 60 anti war veterans running for Congress, the Fighting Dems, a group that included Jim Webb, Patrick Murphy and Tammy Duckworth.\n\nWALZ: I spent 24 years in the Army National Guard. I spent the better part of two decades as a public school teacher. I'm a small business owner. I'm a father and I'm a husband. I intend to come here to Washington to provide authentic leadership and to truly represent the people of my district and the people of the United States.\n\nHAYES: After a surprise victory in a red district, Walz became the highest-ranking enlisted veteran ever to serve in Congress and worked to help end the military's anti-gay Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy.\n\nWALZ: I had students that I taught in the classroom, coached on the football field, trained in my Guard unit and they went off to Iraq to fight for this nation. They went off to Afghanistan to fight for this nation. Not once, not once in my career did the question of sexual orientation ever come up. It's time to erase this mistake for our security and for Americans, and I'll be with you every step of the way.\n\nHAYES: After Donald Trump was elected president, Walz became the ranking Democrat on the House Veteran Affairs Committee. He fought the Trump White House plan for privatizing veterans' healthcare while using his own experiences with the VA to help other veterans get their benefits. Walz's experience in the Armed Forces is an atypical one for most Americans, particularly for politicians at the national level. There really is literally no one like him. Now Walz is running with Kamala Harris against Donald Trump and JD Vance and perhaps not that surprisingly, Republicans are trying to swift boat Walz, denigrating his service the way they did with Vietnam vet John Kerry 20 years ago, saying he stole valor and left the Army to avoid going to Iraq. It's a playbook Republicans also used against Walz when he ran for governor of Minnesota and it failed then because they're lies. It turns out when voters hear about the quarter-century Walz spent as a citizen soldier, the time he spent since then fighting for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans to get the benefits they deserve, they don't see what Republicans do. They see a rare kind of veteran in politics who can cut through the self-serving BS, rather than adding to it.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enlisted rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

We didn't have any kind of orders at all.\"\n\nBonnifield added that Walz struggled with the decision, and talked with his fellow service member for 30 to 45 minutes about \"'what do I do? Where can I be a better person for the soldier? Where can I be a better person for Minnesota? Where can I be a better person for the United States?'\"\n\nOthers who served with Walz have said similar things.\n\nJoe Eustice, who served with Walz for years, told The Washington Post that while he disagreed with the governor's politics, he did not avoid combat duty and was a good soldier. At the time Walz left the unit, Eustice told the post there had only been speculation the unit could be deployed.\n\n\"Other than having a rumor, we were not notified that we were going to be deployed,\" Eustice told The Post.\n\nRepublicans on Wednesday attacked Walz, who served 24 years in the National Guard, for leaving the service before a deployment to Iraq.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did?\" Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), former President Trump's running mate, said at the Michigan campaign event. \"He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nBut Bonnifield vehemently pushed back on the assertion that Walz abandoned his unit, calling it \"wrong\" and \"bulls***t.\"\n\nAnd after Walz retired, Bonnifield said there was \"a little remorse\" in the unit, given he had trained many of them across a decade.\n\n\"He was our person to go to. He had the answers. He was also a father figure to us. If we had a problem we needed to talk to somebody, he was there.\"\n\nWalz would later reach out to Bonnifield and his brother and have the two sit down to discuss ways to better push veterans affairs issues in Congress, he said.\n\nWalz would later go on to become the top Democrat on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ellen_mitchell@thehill.com", "name": "Ellen Mitchell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_Veterans'_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Retirement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Retirement", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement Planning", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/d46325c4243444909201e41c4127d24f-e1722976274896.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Afterward, only the most deranged Trump haters could deny that they had witnessed what all human beings from the beginning of time have recognized as rare bravery.\n\nThen, little more than three weeks later, Vice President and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris chose as her running mate a man who, according to a former command sergeant major and fellow NCO in the Minnesota Army National Guard, would \"still be hiding under his desk\" had he not skipped out on deployment to Iraq nearly two decades ago.\n\nAccording to Retired Command Sgt. Maj. Tom Behrends, who served a two-year deployment to Iraq, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, whom Harris selected as her running mate on Tuesday, showed \"pathetic\" leadership and \"abandoned\" the men in his command -- all as a prelude to \"stolen valor.\"\n\nBehrends made those comments in a 2022 interview with Alpha News, posted to YouTube.\n\nIn sum, the Iraq veteran's charges against Walz -- if true -- involve both cowardice and dishonesty.\n\nDo American voters care about those things, or do they care about celebrity endorsements? Time alone might reveal that answer.\n\nIn the meantime, Behrends' interview painted a picture of an opportunist who shrank from duty.\n\n\"As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way and hung his hat up and quit,\" Behrends said of Walz.\n\nTo be clear, the current Minnesota governor never actually made it to Iraq.\n\nIn 2005, the Minnesota Army National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery, received a \"warning order\" to \"mobilize\" for Iraq. But Walz, who held a conditional command sergeant major rank, retired and ran for Congress before deployment. Behrends took Walz's place.\n\nThough he never satisfied the conditions required to retire as a command sergeant major, Walz nonetheless used that title.\n\nIn fact, in a letter to Walz, Behrends expressed concern.\n\n\"I would hope that you haven't been using the rank for political gain, but that is how it appears,\" the Iraq veteran wrote.\n\n\"It's stolen valor is really what it is,\" Behrends said in the 2022 interview.\n\nIndeed, Army records showed Walz as reduced in rank. Thus, he retired as an E-8 master sergeant, not an E-9 command sergeant major.\n\nOn the whole, Behrends described Walz as a liar and a coward.\n\n\"If he would've went to Iraq, he'd still be hiding under his desk over there, 'cause that's just the cowardice that I seen portrayed with him,\" Behrends said.\n\nWalz's alleged cowardice appears quite the contrast next to Trump's spontaneous courage.\n\nFurthermore, allegations of stolen valor will not sit well with voters who respect honest veterans, such as Trump's running mate, Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio.\n\nNonetheless, longtime observers of American politics surely must detect something strange afoot.\n\nAfter all, aside from ideological alignment with his fellow radical leftist Harris, Walz brings nothing valuable to the ticket.\n\nIn fact, he only amplifies Harris' most obvious weaknesses. For instance, just as Walz allegedly stole his retirement rank, Harris stole the Democratic nomination without winning a single presidential primary.\n\nIndeed, the contrasts between the two tickets could not be more striking. Surely voters still care about courage and merit, right?\n\nThus, one wonders what Democrats and the deep state have up their sleeves for the 2024 election.\n\nIn light of the Walz pick and the resurfaced Behrends interview, I would be lying if I claimed to know where any of this is heading.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_schwarz@westernjournal.com", "name": "Michael Schwarz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-commissioned officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Tim Walz Accused of Cowardice and Embellishment of Army Service Record by Former Peers\n\nA sure sign that the left's narrative was failing was when potentially friendly media started asking hard questions.\n\n[SPOILER ALERT: Yes, it is that black and white.]\n\nNaturally, when the intrepid huntin', shootin' veteran started looking more like a denser form of Elmer Fudd, they went directly to \"whataboutism.\"\n\nThis emerged in the sudden regurgitation of the \"bone spurs\" slur directed at former President Trump and claims that JD Vance's service just wasn't good enough. Here is an example from someone who was fired from MSNBC for being a Hamas simp.\n\nLet's look at the claims one by one.\n\n1. Yes. The Swiftboat Veterans remain American heroes for revealing and highlighting John Kerry's disgusting and self-serving war record.\n\n2. Yes. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard. He served right up to the point where the pay, benefits, and connections associated with Guard membership were outweighed by his fear of having his ass shot off. As Matt Funicello points out, he retired two years before the end of his enlistment contract. To retire early, he had to take a demotion. His retirement was driven by his desire to avoid service in Iraq. As a result, his battalion deployed into combat without Walz, the senior enlisted man in that battalion. His cowardice required a change in senior positions to replace him at the very time when the battalion should have been 100% focused on getting ready to fight.\n\n3. Yes. JD Vance was a military journalist. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know how the US Marine Corps assigns specialties, but it isn't like Vance had any special favors to call in. Every Marine is an infantryman first, so even his official job would not have prevented him from being pressed into service as a shooter if the occasion had demanded. He enlisted at the time of the Iraq invasion when he knew enlisting in the Marines would put him in a combat zone. He didn't enlist in the National Guard. Hasan elides right over one critical fact, which is that \"Vance went to Iraq.\" That, by itself, distinguishes him from Walz. Vance didn't desert his unit or get an early discharge to get out of going to Iraq. Vance's job took him \"outside the wire,\" but even if it had not, there were no safe areas as the insurgency ramped up. I'm not sure how any of that makes Vance look bad, particularly in comparison to Walz's cowardice.\n\n4. No. There is no evidence that Donald Trump faked a disability to dodge the draft. That allegation has floated around and was investigated in detail by the New York Times. As Hasan was one of the loud voices pushing the debunked Russia Hoax, I wouldn't expect him to be particularly persuaded by the truth. But, arguendo, let's concede that a friendly doctor got Trump out of the draft after his student deferments ran out in 1972. By 1972, American involvement in the Vietnam War was running down. Trump's birthday is June 14, giving him a lottery number of 113. The highest lottery number called up in Trump's year of eligibility was 95. Assuming further that Trump would have been drafted, even though we know he would not have been, Trump would've had to flee to Canada or desert his unit to be comparable to Walz.\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nTim Walz Goes Full Metal Stolen Valor in Anti-Gun Rant\n\nA Tale of Two Veterans: What the Service of Walz and Vance Tells Us About the Men\n\nThe bottom line is that there is no comparison between Walz's abandonment of his men and either JD Vance's honorable service in Iraq or Donald Trump having never been drafted. The fact that Walz continues to claim he is a combat veteran puts him in the unique category with Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal as a liar.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType":

Tim Walz's military record are channeling the \"swift boating\" campaign 20 years ago against John Kerry, which accused the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee of lying about his Vietnam service and decorations.\n\nThe common denominator in both efforts: Trump campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita.\n\nLaCivita played a key role in the political advocacy group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which ran the TV ad campaign questioning Kerry's military service. It's a playbook that the Trump campaign appears to be re-running after Vice President Kamala Harris tapped Walz, a 24-year veteran of the Army National Guard, as her running mate.\n\nNeither Harris nor Donald Trump ever served in the military. But Trump's running mate - Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who is a Marine veteran - quickly zeroed-in on Walz's military service, accusing him this week of abandoning his unit before it deployed to Iraq in 2006 and of falsely claiming he served in a war zone.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him,\" Vance said at a campaign stop Wednesday.\n\nWalz filed to run for Congress in February 2005 - before his unit was notified it could deploy to Iraq. He deployed with the Minnesota National Guard in August 2003 to Vicenza, Italy, as part of support for the US war in Afghanistan, according to a Minnesota Guard spokesperson, but not to a war zone.\n\nThe hits on Walz's military service align with Trump's penchant for personal attacks against his political opponents, while also harkening back to the effort to sully Kerry's military record two decades ago.\n\nLaCivita even connected the two in an interview with RealClearPolitics on Wednesday. \"Birds of a feather,\" he said of Walz and Kerry, \"will be tarred together.\"\n\nThere are key differences. For one, Walz is the vice-presidential nominee and not at the top of the ticket, meaning the attempts to undermine his service may not go as far with voters as the attacks on Kerry, which leaned on his activities protesting the Vietnam war after he came home. Military service also played a much more central role in the 2004 campaign when President George W. Bush's decision to invade Iraq was a key campaign issue.\n\nSwift Boat Veterans for Truth - a reference to the type of boat Kerry served on while in Vietnam - launched a series of ads in the summer of 2004, when Kerry was leading Bush in the polls. The ads featured Vietnam veterans accusing Kerry, who served as a Naval officer, of lying to win combat decorations, including the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.\n\nWhile the ads were \"riddled with inconsistencies,\" according to a New York Times report that summer, they went directly after what was perceived as a strength for Kerry and had an impact - launching the term \"swiftboating\" into the US political lexicon.\n\nSouthern Methodist University's Center for Presidential History wrote that the swift boat ads \"ushered in a period of decline\" for Kerry's campaign, with his summer polling lead evaporating. Bush went on to defeat Kerry that November.\n\n\"Most damaging of all, Kerry's Vietnam service had become controversial, rather than reassuring, and it was largely dropped from the remainder of his campaign,\" the university center wrote.\n\nThe ads stretched the boundaries of acceptable campaign tactics - at least for the time - and the group, classified then as a \"527,\" was allowed to collect unlimited contributions so long as it didn't coordinate with the Bush campaign. The organization was later renamed to Swift Vets and POWs for Truth.\n\nLaCivita was described as the group's \"chief strategist\" in a 2014 profile, and he told the Times in 2004 that he advised the group on media strategy, saying his role included providing advice and placing advertisements.\n\nIn addition to his 2004 work with Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, LaCivita has worked for a host of GOP campaigns, the Senate GOP political arm, the Republican National Committee and pro-Trump super PACs before he joined Trump's 2024 campaign. He's a Marine combat veteran who was injured during the first Gulf War in the 1990s.\n\nCNN has reached out to LaCivita for comment.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential campaign, the allegations related to military service aren't coming from an outside group but from the campaign directly - and one of its principals.\n\nVance, who is a Marine Corps veteran, has led the charge questioning Walz's military service. It's one of several lines of attack the campaign has trotted out to try to blunt Walz's perceived strengths with the critical Midwestern voters the Harris campaign is hoping he can reach.\n\nVance served four years as an enlisted combat correspondent, in public affairs, and deployed once to Iraq for roughly six months, according to his military record. He's accused Walz of \"stolen valor\" for language he used in a 2018 speech advocating for an assault weapons ban, which the Harris campaign has included in a video on social media. Walz at the time said he wanted to \"make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.\" Walz never deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq or a combat zone as part of his service.\n\nAsked about Vance's attacks, a Harris campaign spokesperson said in a statement: \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"\n\nWalz faced similar criticisms about portrayal of his overseas service when he first ran for Congress in 2006, as well as during his 2018 and 2022 gubernatorial campaigns.\n\n\"I'm proud of the 24 years I served our country in the Army National Guard. There's a code of honor among those who've served, and normally this type of partisan political attack comes only from one who's never worn a uniform,\" Walz wrote in 2006 in response to a letter to the editor in a local newspaper.\n\nIn a Thursday news conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump touched on Walz but did not amplify his running mate's attacks, instead criticizing the Minnesota governor on transgender issues and the border.\n\nBut Trump has posted about the matter on social media, sharing a video from Fox News' Sean Hannity with the caption: \"QUESTIONS SWIRL AROUND WALZ'S SERVICE RECORD.\"", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_herb@cnn.com", "name": "Jeremy Herb", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_Vets_and_POWs_for_Truth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Swift Vets and POWs for Truth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kerry", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Kerry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_LaCivita", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris LaCivita"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiftboating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swiftboating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy_group", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advocacy group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicenza", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vicenza"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vicenza"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2004 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Methodist_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southern Methodist University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Star_Medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze Star Medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Heart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Purple Heart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Because, unlike the Harris campaign, people are actually vetting him. Especially the vet part. And he's about to become unburdened of the biggest highlight on his resum\u00e9, meaning his military service with the Army National Guard. As noted by the Washington Free Beacon, when Walz first ran for Congress in 2006, his campaign described him as a \"veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" which typically applies to someone who served on the ground in Afghanistan during the War on Terror. But for him, it was more like Operation Enjoying Freedom, in Italy, not Afghanistan. Here he is in 2007, after he was elected to Congress, talking about his time during that operation.\n\nTIM WALZ: I spent 24 years in the National Guard, some of that full-time. I was an artillery man. I deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. My battalion provided base security throughout the European theater from Turkey to England, in the early stages of the war in Afghanistan. And that same battalion is now in Iraq at this time.\n\nWHERE DOES TIM WALZ STAND ON ISRAEL?\n\nNow it sounds like he was a lot closer to the battlefield than he actually might be. He was, in fact, deployed to a base in Italy. He wasn't taking live fire in Operation Enduring Freedom, it was more like Operation Enduring Pasta. I kid. And in 2009, a local veteran went to his Minnesota office and asked the staffer if it's possible to mistakenly assume that he served in Afghanistan based on his website bio. And the staffer said perhaps.\n\nHARRIS CAMPAIGN WALKS BACK WALZ BIO AMID 'STOLEN VALOR' CONTROVERSY AS QUESTIONS SWIRL\n\nSo the vet suggests, hey, maybe you should change it to say that Walz served in Italy instead. But Walz's office did nothing, though they did offer the vet a case of military-grade tampons.\n\nThen there's the two fellow National Guardsmen who said in 2022 that Walz reached the rank of command sergeant major but didn't complete the coursework to maintain that rank before he retired at a lower rank, which the Minnesota National Guard confirmed. Yet, even on his own website, he still calls himself command sergeant major. Apparently, his resume has more padding than Joy Behar's toilet seat.\n\nSo, did he lie about his rank to fuel his political aspirations, just as he managed to avoid a war? Does it matter? When your job is to lead young men in battle but your desire to dine with Barrack and Michelle matters more, you probably had no business leading anyone to begin with. And yet, the Harris campaign just posted this video of Walz talking about how the weapons he carried in war shouldn't be allowed anywhere but the battlefield.\n\nTIM WALZ: I spent 25 years in the Army, and I gave the money back. And I'll tell you what I have been doing. I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment. But we can do background checks. We can do CDC research. We can make sure we don't have reciprocal carry among states, and we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons work.\n\nNext he'll tell us he used his bayonet to do butter carving. But if Tim Walz said we should ban the very weapons he carried in war and he didn't carry any weapons, doesn't that mean we can keep all of our weapons? Great. I want an Abrams tank. Again, he's never been to a war zone unless you count his state during the George Floyd riots. In reality, when his unit got called for deployment to Iraq after he'd been appointed to acting senior enlisted leader, he bailed to run for Congress. But now even CNN is calling him out.\n\nCNN GUEST: Walz did make a comment speaking to a group, he's done it a couple of times where he has used language that has suggested that he carried weapons in a fighting situation. There is a difference between being in a combat area, being involved at a time of war, and actually being in a position where people are shooting at you. There is no evidence that at any time, Governor Walz was in a position of being shot at, and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest that he was. So that is absolutely false.\n\nHoly ---- that's CNN! I know. Wow. Who did Walz piss off? Did he steal one of Jake Tapper's copies of Juggs Magazine? Meanwhile, listen to Minnesota Senator Tina Smith comparing Walz to JD Vance.\n\nSEN TINA SMITH: Well, here is Tim Walz, who enlisted when he was 17 years old. He served in the National Guard for 24 years. And I'm not aware of any military service that JD Vance has ever served. So let's just make the comparison there.\n\nLet's not, Tina. First, you're leaving out the main point. No one is accusing Vance of lying, and it's kind of hard to believe you're not aware of any military service Vance served. What else are you not aware of? That you stole John Denver's haircut? The fact is, lies like this got Brian Williams demoted and the closest he came to combat was being near Matt Lauer's office. But apparently, the new tactic here is to muddy the waters. Right, Nance?\n\nMSNBC'S ANDREW MITCHELL: JD Vance has criticized him as never having been in combat.\n\nI think. Wow, these are just some journalists. Now, Nance, JD never said he was in combat, unlike Walz, which you would have clearly heard if your last face lift hadn't blocked your ears. The oddest take, though, comes from Mayor Pete, who wrote, \"denigrating a soldier's service based on whether he deployed to a war zone is kind of like denigrating a woman's citizenship based on whether she happens to have children.\" So I guess two months of paternity leave makes him an expert on childbirth? It's the worst analogy ever. A non-deployed soldier is like a childless woman?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMaybe if the childless woman tells people if she has kids to get benefits. Mayor Pete manages to derail trains and conversations. So it seems the Dems only fight when it's political, then they circle the wagons. The problem is what they're defending for many Americans is indefensible.

Tim Walz (D) -- the vice presidential candidate pick of Democrat presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris -- has listed on his official biography a higher military rank than the one he ultimately retired with, drawing criticism from some veterans and accusations of stolen valor.\n\nWalz served in the Minnesota Army National Guard and retired at the rank of master sergeant, or an E-8. However, on his official website bio, he lists a higher rank that he served at for a short period that ultimately was rescinded, as he did not complete all the requirements to serve at that rank. However, his bio implies that he retired at the rank of command sergeant major, or an E-9.\n\nHis official bio states:\n\nAfter 24 years in the Army National Guard, Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005. Tim won his first election to the United States House of Representatives in 2006 and was re-elected for another five terms serving Minnesota's First Congressional District in Southern Minnesota.\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard's State Public Affairs Officer, Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, confirmed to Breitbart News that Walz did not retire as an E-9. She said in an email:\n\nHe retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nTwo retired Army Command Sergeant Majors, Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, wrote in a letter published November 2, 2018, in the West Central Tribune, a local news outlet, that Walz on September 17, 2004, was \"conditionally promoted\" to Command Sergeant Major but then later failed to meet the conditions of the promotion, which they said was later nullified.\n\n\"On September 17th, 2004 he was conditionally promoted to Command Sergeant Major. The conditions had been outlined to him when he was counseled and he signed the Statement of Agreement and Certification. If the conditions are not met, the promotion is null and void, like it never happened,\" they wrote.\n\nThey then said that after his unit was issued orders to deploy to Iraq, he then quit. They wrote:\n\nIn early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq.\n\nOn May 16th, 2005 he quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war. His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for congress. Which is false, according to a Department of Defense Directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have. If he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academy. Instead he waited for the paperwork to catch up to him. His official retirement document states, SOLDIER NOT AVAILABLE FOR SIGNATURE.\n\nOn September 10th, 2005 conditionally promoted Command Sergeant Major Walz was reduced to Master Sergeant. It took a while for the system to catch up to him as it was uncharted territory, literally no one quits in the position he was in, or drops out of the academy. Except him.\n\nIn November of 2005, while the battalion trained for war at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, it received an offer from retired Master Sergeant Walz. He offered to fund raise for the battalions bus trip home over Christmas that year.\n\nThe 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion was deployed for 22 months in 2006 - 2007. During this time, they were restricted by Army regulations and could not speak out against a candidate for office. In November 2006 he was elected to the House of Representatives.\n\nThey wrote:\n\nHe claims to be the highest-ranking enlisted service member ever to serve in congress. Even though he was conditionally promoted to Command Sergeant Major less than eight months, quit before his obligations were met, and was reduced to Master Sergeant for retirement. Yes, he served at that rank, but was never qualified at that rank, and will receive retirement benefits at one rank below. You be the judge.\n\nBehrends has since spoken out about Walz on other occasions, including to Alpha News on September 6, 2022, when he slammed the governor for bailing on the deployment.\n\n\"As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way and hung his hat up and quit,\" Behrends said.\n\nBehrends said he replaced Walz on the deployment to Iraq after he quit.\n\n\"The public needs to know how pathetic his leadership was as a National Guardsman,\" he said. \"He abandoned us. What the hell kind of leader does that? As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way and hung his hat up and quit.\"\n\nBehrends went on to serve in Iraq on a nearly two-year deployment -- while Walz ran for Congress and began calling himself \"Command Sergeant Major.\"\n\nAccording to Alpha News, Behrends said he contacted Walz with his concerns before raising the issue publicly, sending letters to Washington in 2016, but that all the letters went unanswered.\n\nBehrends told the outlet: \"He was saying that and there were campaign letters coming in the mail saying that. They said, right on there, he's a retired command sergeant major. Just tooting his own horn, hanging on the coattails of people that actually are command sergeant majors that went through all the process and put all the time in.\"\n\nBehrends said, \"It's stolen valor is really what it is. I don't know of anybody else that's done what he's done.\"", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristina_wong@breitbart.com", "name":

Tim Walz's biography on Thursday to remove a reference to him as a \"retired command sergeant major.\"\n\nWalz has fallen under scrutiny from Republicans for referring to himself as a retired command sergeant major when, in reality, he was only conditionally promoted to the rank but failed to perform the training necessary to permanently obtain it before retiring as a master sergeant in 2005, according to a statement provided by the Minnesota National Guard to Just the News on Wednesday. Harris' website referred to Walz as a \"retired command sergeant major\" until at least Thursday morning, according to an archived copy of the page, but has since clarified its description to note that he once served as command sergeant major without stating that he retired as one.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, a Minnesota National Guard's State public affairs officer, told Just the News. \"The Soldier must complete the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Course as a condition of this promotion. Failure to meet the condition will cause demotion per AR 600 - 8 - 19,\" according to Army rules.\n\nWalz's original biography on Harris' campaign website called him \"the son of an Army veteran and a retired Command Sergeant Major in the Army National Guard himself,\" according to an archived version of the page. The current version of the website, however, calls him \"the son of an Army veteran who served as a command sergeant major.\"\n\nWalz is also facing allegations that he retired from the Minnesota National Guard early to avoid deployment to Iraq, claims Democratic operatives have denied. Walz, however, knew his battalion was likely to be deployed to Iraq when he retired as he mentioned the possibility in congressional campaign materials published before his retirement, the Washington Free Beacon reported Wednesday.\n\n\"When your country calls, you are supposed to run into battle -- not the other way,\" retired command sergeant major Thomas Behrends, who took Walz's place after his retirement and was deployed to Iraq, told the New York Post on Tuesday. \"He had the opportunity to serve his country, and said 'Screw you' to the United States. That's not who I would pick to run for vice president.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.\n\nThis story originally was published by the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Tim Walz's time in the military.\n\nMr. Vance, echoing many conservatives in social media and some of Mr. Walz's ex-comrades, had said that the Democratic vice-presidential pick had ducked service in Iraq.\n\n\"Hey @JDVance, did you forget what the USMC taught you about respect? Tim Walz spent DECADES in uniform,\" Mr. Kelly, Arizona Democrat, wrote Thursday on X.\n\n\"You both deserve to be thanked for your service. Don't become Donald Trump. He calls veterans suckers and losers and that is beneath those of us who have actually served,\" he said.\n\nBoth Mr. Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio, and Mr. Walz served in the military -- the Marines and National Guard, respectively. Mr. Kelly also was an officer in the Navy and retired as a captain.\n\nDespite the rebuke, Mr. Kelly did not say that Mr. Vance had said anything false.\n\nMr. Vance, Mr. Trump's running mate, questioned Mr. Walz's record Wednesday.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,\" Mr. Vance said to reporters.\n\nMr. Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, ended his military career to run for Congress in 2005. His battalion deployed to Iraq shortly after.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" Mr. Vance said.\n\nMr. Walz is also accused of gilding the lily on his service record in other ways, such as calling himself a veteran of the Afghanistan war and claiming to have wielded weapons in battle.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Vance's comments were sparked by an X post the Harris campaign made Tuesday that featured a video of Mr. Walz talking about gun control and claiming to have been in a war.\n\n\"We can do CDC research. We can make sure we don't have reciprocal carry among states,\" he said in the clip. \"And we can make sure that those weapons of war that I carry in war is the only place where those weapons are allowed.\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign specified Thursday that, \"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times. Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country.

So, he definitely had something to say about Democrat vice presidential candidate and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and his decades-long boasts about his service record; troublesome boasts as my colleague Matt Funicello has uncovered.\n\nGovernor Walz enlisted in the Minnesota National Guard in 1981 and served for 24 years, obtaining the rank of Sergeant Major. However, he was reduced in rank to Master Sergeant in September 2005 after failing to complete the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy. But that is just the end of his military career; according to Herr and Behrends, Tim Walz did other shameful things, and something far worse -- he abandoned his troops when they went to Iraq.\n\nThe Harris campaign, and Walz' interviews and biographies, claim he served in combat, and that he retired as a Commander Sergeant Major, the highest rank of anyone who served in Congress. GOP vice presidential nominee JD Vance has called him out on this deception.\n\nWATCH:\n\nCao kept his powder dry for a minute, but ultimately gave it to Walz with both barrels:\n\nI have tried to take my time in responding to stories about Tim Walz's service record. The hypocrisy astounds me.\n\nBecause I am a Trump supporter & running against a liberal career politician, a so-called Pentagon correspondent asked me to provide documented evidence of every time I had been outside the wire on a deployment & every time I received incoming enemy fire.\n\nYet no one in the legacy media appears to be questioning Walz' claims, and some are defending him:\n\nI was asked to provide my medical records & grilled about why my brain injury didn't earn me a Purple Heart. Contrast this with Tim Walz, whose entire political career appears to be based on a lie: that he served in Iraq when he did not.\n\nFunicello's article brings the detailed receipts and is worthy of a complete read. While Walz was deployed to Italy for a year, he was nowhere near Iraq, and because he had made several questionable decisions while he served in the Minnesota National Guard, he had been demoted--facts that he conveniently covered up when he talked about his military service:\n\n\"He exaggerated his rank. In an effort to disarm law abiding Americans he implied he had seen combat when he never did.\"\n\nThat's brutal. But, truth is often that:\n\nWhile it upsets me to read how Walz abandoned his unit before the deployment, it frankly upsets me more that this man spent 20 years as a candidate and in elected office, now seeking the Vice Presidency of the United States, and no one in the media asked him before or since any simple question like:\n\nYou were supposed to deploy to Iraq, but you quit so you didn't have to go, and then implied for years that you did. Why?\n\nBecause it was a convenient prop to use to show that he \"loved\" America, even though he is a Democrat. See Duckworth, Tammy, et. al. It's rhetorical, but Cao answers it anyway:\n\n\"The truth is: we all know the answer. And it is disqualifying for future service as our Vice President.\"\n\nIt is also disqualifying for our current vice president and the woman who wants to be commander in chief. What kind of vetting did the Harris' camp do? And why would she assume it's all good to trot this man out and boast about his supposed military service when he has manufactured a lot of it? It reflects the lackadaisical nature of the Biden-Harris administration and the Harris campaign. It's all about optics, and damn the substance. Finally, it reflects questionable judgment. Harris cannot even properly vet a vice presidential candidate; how will she be able to properly choose her cabinet or assess actual threats to our nation? If this is a reflection of Kamala Harris' leadership, then we certainly do not want her as the leader of our country.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"},

It would have been a different discussion, but he went to the higher ranks.

I'm proud I did 24 years [of service].\"\n\nWalz went on to win a House seat in 2006.

He weighed that for a long time,\" Bonnifield recalled.\n\nHe insisted that Walz did not seem concerned about the potential dangers of the combat zone.\n\n\"He was not that kind of man. Absolutely not,\" Bonnifield said.\n\nThe criticisms against Walz's military service have also come up on the 2024 campaign trail.\n\nTrump's VP pick, Marine Corps veteran JD Vance, has accused Walz of \"stolen valor\" for some of his past comments that incorrectly implied that he saw direct combat.\n\n\"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage.

Vance then laid into Walz, essentially calling him a coward, and rightly so, when he mentioned Walz's decision to abandon his troops right before they deployed to Iraq in 2004.\n\nTo be perfectly clear, I 100 percent agree with Vance in his remarks, though because I am not running for Vice President of the United States, I would be much more colorful in my language describing Walz and his shameful behavior. Walz is absolutely a coward and a liar, and he uses and embellishes his service record for political gain.\n\nRedState helped break the story regarding Walz's military service when several of his former peers in the Minnesota National Guard called him out for cowardice and lying. The biggest complaints are how Walz continues to lie by omission when he says he was the most senior enlisted soldier when he was in Congress as a Command Sergeant Major -- he was reduced in rank to Master Sergeant -- and that he knowingly abandoned his unit before they deployed to Iraq in 2004.\n\nIn an undated video posted to X, Walz is seen and heard ranting about gun control. Being a Democrat, that itself is not shocking or unusual. However, where he slipped up was when he called for banning so-called assault weapons. Walz said he wanted to ensure that \"weapons of war like I carried when I went to war\" stay on the battlefield. Again, the problem is he has no idea what a battlefield looks like and never carried a weapon in war, because he never went to war.\n\nServing in the United States military has been voluntary since 1973, when the all-volunteer force (AVF) went into effect after President Richard Nixon signed the legislation in 1971. Since then, Americans and residents alike could volunteer to serve in the military's active, reserve, or National Guard components. People serve for a plethora of reasons, but they all serve with the understanding that they may be called one day to serve in combat. Pre-9/11, the use of military force was rare, or at least much rarer than it is today. Serving in the military was almost viewed as \"safe,\" as some of my senior Marines who had served for several years before 9/11 had said to me.\n\nWhen I enlisted in 1999, in my junior year of high school, war was the last thing on my mind. I thought I was just going to join the Marine Corps and spend four years doing some pretty cool training. That, my friends, is one of the best examples of naivete because reality hit not even two months into BootCamp, when our Drill Instructors came out and said we were going to war when we saw the USS Cole with a gaping hole in her side after a suicide bomber blew her up, killing 17 Sailors and wounding 37 others. Nothing ever happened with that, but war and combat became a real thing to think about; then, the terrorist attacks on September 11th changed everything for us. War would come, not if, but when.\n\nFor those who went into their recruiter's offices on September 12th, 2001, they all went in there knowing that there was a distinct possibility they would be going to war. Especially those who chose the combat arms path, like infantry for me, or say, artillery, like Walz. I should note, that between 2001 and 2012 and possibly years past that, 0.45 percent of the American population served in the military. In a powerful and emotional essay penned by former Army Ranger and Captain Nick Palmisciano titled \"The 0.45%,\" he wrote of the powerful statistic of the number of those who served and the burden they had to bear. I strongly encourage everyone to read the essay in its entirety.\n\nIn World War II, 11.2% of the nation served in four years. In Vietnam, 4.3% served in 12 years. Since 2001, only 0.45% of our population has served in the Global War on Terror. These are unbelievable statistics.\n\nOver time, fewer and fewer people have shouldered more and more of the burden and it is only getting worse. Our troops were sent to war in Iraq by a Congress consisting of 10% veterans with only one person having a child in the military. Taxes did not increase to pay for the war. War bonds were not sold. Gas was not regulated. In fact, the average citizen was asked to sacrifice nothing, and has sacrificed nothing unless they have chosen to out of the goodness of their hearts.\n\nThe only people who have sacrificed are the veterans and their families. The volunteers. The people who swore an oath to defend this nation. You.\n\nYou stand there, deployment after deployment and fight on. You've lost relationships, spent years of your lives in extreme conditions, years apart from kids you'll never get back, and beaten your body in a way that even professional athletes don't understand. And you come home to a nation that doesn't understand.\n\nThey don't understand suffering. They don't understand sacrifice. They don't understand that bad people exist. They look at you like you're a machine - like something is wrong with you.\n\nGovernor Walz was technically one of those people who signed up after 9/11 when he re-enlisted just seven days after 9/11 for six years. He signed up for another six years, not four as he falsely claimed.\n\nAccording to his official Report of Separation and Record of Service, he re-enlisted for six years on September 18th, 2001. However, in his response he says that he re-enlisted for four years, conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq. Even if he had re-enlisted for four years following Sept.11, his retirement date would have been September 18th, 2005. Why then did he \"retire\" on May 16th, 2005, before his supposed four-year enlistment was up? And he makes it sound like he \"retired\" a year before his battalion deployed to Iraq; when in reality he knew when he \"retired\" that the battalion would be deployed to Iraq.\n\nTim Walz is an American coward, plain and simple. He betrayed his word, his contract; he betrayed his men. He committed the ultimate act of betrayal, and that is irrefutable. It is beyond offensive to those of us who not only served our country but who had the honor and privilege to serve with our brothers and sisters in combat.\n\nWar is absolutely hell, literally and figuratively speaking. It is filled with death, destruction, despair, stress, and much more, but I have to say, I loved it too. I loved combat. It was the ultimate test of strength and ability, to fight another armed foe on the battlefield; it was the ultimate rush. Yes, I am scarred for the rest of my life because of it, but no warrior comes out of a scrap without scars. To be clear, I do not see myself as anything special or someone who needs or wants validation or admiration for what I chose to do, but I do deserve a little respect for living up to my word as a man when I said I would go. I have photos to back that up, too, whereas Walz only has figments of his imagination.\n\nI was not supposed to go back to Iraq when I did in 2004. I had completed my four-year contractual obligation to the Marines and could have gotten out in August of 2004. Instead, to the chagrin of my family and friends, I volunteered for another tour and extended my contract for another year. I could not stomach the fact that I would be abandoning my brothers when they were to go back. Myself and two others all extended to go back with our boys.\n\nIn contrast, Walz most likely said to himself, \"Screw this, I won't go.\" He knew his unit was going to Iraq for months and told all his peers and leaders that he was going to go -- that they could count on him. But at the last minute, like a true coward, he abruptly quit (you can do that in the National Guard). He couldn't even be bothered to show up and sign his discharge paperwork. His military family was about to get into a scrap, and he just said to them he was just gonna go sit this one out. Pathetic.\n\nWalz is not a leader; he is a sheep in a sea of sheep, trying to convince them that he is a sheepdog when he is the farthest from it. JD Vance did not serve in a combat MOS; he was a combat camera, and he has openly said he never saw combat when he was in Iraq. But Vance honored his commitment to the Corps and the country and did not shy away from deploying in any way. Yes, I understand that as a junior enlisted non-commissioned officer, he did not have the capability of telling his leaders \"no,\" and that he had to follow orders. But Vance willingly obeyed his orders and lived up to what it means to be a man by doing what you say and saying what you do. Walz did not, and for that, he is no real man in the figurative sense of the word. He is a coward and a fraud, a person who takes the easy way out and lies about it. I refuse to pay any iota of respect to a person who so readily says, \"Screw it, I quit,\" and walks away on their family.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_funicello@redstate.com", "name": "Matt Funicello", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volunteer military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RedState", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RedState"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War on terror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill_instructor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drill instructor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlisted_rank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enlisted rank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/rs/images/up/2024/220/888d01c8-1fc2-4bb5-bbb2-7e8480bc3b82.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-11", "textStart": 3077, "textEnd": 3091}, {"amb": false, "date": "2001-09-12", "textStart": 3207, "textEnd": 3227}, {"amb": false, "date": "2001-09-18", "textStart": 5496, "textEnd": 5516}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-09-18", "textStart": 5756, "textEnd": 5776}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-16", "textStart": 5806, "textEnd": 5820}, {"amb": false, "date": "2011-09-", "textStart": 5711, "textEnd": 5718}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

From what we've seen today, the Democrats will make a big deal about his service. In particular, they will harp on him being the \"highest-ranking enlisted soldier ever to serve in Congress.\" You can tell the email went out.\n\nWalz's veteran status is supposed to give Kamala a connection to veterans. The \"highest-ranking enlisted soldier\" line is to give him the common touch.\n\nWhile I don't necessarily think military service qualifies anyone for anything -- Frederick the Great is supposed to have said, \"I had an ass that followed me on a dozen campaigns and at the end he was still and ass\" -- I do think that the character of service can tell us a great deal about the man.\n\nLet's look at JD Vance first. He was the product of a difficult childhood. He enlisted in the US Marine Corps in 2003 at age 18. He served four years as a journalist, including a deployment to Iraq. His motive for joining was that he believed, as did millions of us, that ridding Iraq of Saddam Hussein would make the world a better place.\n\nTim Walz was the son of a school administrator and stay-at-home mom. He had the advantages of a stable and somewhat privileged upbringing. According to Wikipedia,\n\nWith his father's encouragement, Walz enlisted in the Army National Guard when he turned 17. His father had served in the Korean War and paid for his education degree with the G.I. Bill, and wanted his son to have the same opportunity.\n\nWalz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, retiring at the rank of master sergeant. Many posts on social media claim that he was a command sergeant major, the highest enlisted rank, but that is not true for all the reasons my colleague Matt Funicello spells out in UPDATED: MN Gov. Tim Walz Accused of Cowardice and Embellishment of Army Service Record by Former Peers. Oops. I guess that was a spoiler alert.\n\nIt is at the very beginning that their careers diverge.\n\nVance enlisted in the USMC, knowing that decision would land him in combat. Fates intervened, and he was not destined to become an 0311, a shooter on the pointy end of the spear. Not everyone is called to greatness. During his time in Iraq, he did accompany units when they went \"outside the wire.\" Vance's former comrades still speak highly of him, even those who disagree with his politics.\n\nWalz's career was similar to that of many other young men in rural areas across the nation before the invasion of Iraq. Enlisting in the Guard was a tradition in some communities. The \"one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer\" training schedule was sold as a car payment by recruiters. Completing training made you eligible for VA benefits, including the zero-money-down home loan program. You drilled with friends and neighbors and made a lot of great business and professional contacts. Summer training was not necessarily high-pressure. One Guard battalion that I'm personally familiar with used weekend training to go deer hunting. None of this is to say some Guard units were not rock-solid. My division was partnered with 47th Infantry Division, the division to which Walz was assigned. I had men from that division attached to my company on several deployments. They were solid and capable and provided endless amusement on land navigation because their maps (Minnesota and North Dakota) had a 10-meter contour interval, and ours (California's Coastal Range) had 50-meter contour intervals. Of course, the Iraq War upset that decades-old pattern and Guard units were regularly called up for combat deployments.\n\nWalz's moment of truth came when his unit was ordered to deploy to Iraq. As Matt Funicello details, Walz had his enlistment cut short by asking for an early retirement. In the process, he violated his pledge to complete a training course and was administratively reduced to one rank.\n\nWhere Vance was the ultimate volunteer, choosing a service he knew would result in deployment to Iraq, Walz approached his enlistment to get benefits and improve his chances for professional advancement. When Vance was ordered to Iraq, he went. When Walz, the senior noncommissioned officer in his battalion, was ordered to Iraq, he quit and left his men high and dry.\n\nDon't be misled.

"Reality check: Vance misquoted Walz, saying the governor referenced weapons he \"used\" in war.\n\nZoom out: Walz has acknowledged that he did not face combat during his decorated military career, which began when he signed up two days after his 17th birthday.\n\nFlashback: Relaying his military experience to the Library of Congress' Veterans History Project, Walz said that after he and his wife moved to Minnesota, he joined the 125th field artillery and moved through various positions, such as gunnery sergeant and chief of the firing battery, until he became the battalion's sergeant major.\n\nFriction point: When Walz was on the gubernatorial campaign trail seeking reelection, his GOP rival sought to capitalize on the same narrative Vance and Trump attempted to leverage Wednesday.\n\nContext: These attacks are not pulled from a new playbook.\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign said in a statement: \"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families.\"\n\nWhat they're saying: Joseph Eustice, a 32-year National Guard veteran, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune in 2022 that Walz was a \"great soldier\" who had

Indeed, the only war Democrats have been enthusiastic about since then is the Ukraine War, which is a bloodbath that will have no direct discernable effect on America's national security (although it is draining our weapons supply). This reality does not mean that Democrats have not served in the military and used that service to advance their political careers. Minnesota governor Tim Walz traded on his service in the National Guard for decades. Now that he's playing in the big leagues, though, we've learned that he lied about his service and ran from his men when battle neared.\n\nJohn Kerry, Richard Blumenthal, Pete Buttigieg, Tim Walz...these are just a few hard-left Democrats who enlisted and then used that enlistment for political advancement. While Kerry and Buttigieg really did serve in combat zones, Blumenthal lied outright, implying that his time in the Marine Reserves in D.C. was, instead, active duty in Vietnam. Now, it turns out that Tim Walz is a liar in the Blumenthal mode.\n\nThe Tim Walz narrative is that he served overseas in combat zones while in the National Guard, retiring as a command sergeant major. The only problem is that this narrative contains a series of lies by omission.\n\nFirst, Walz implied he'd served in Afghanistan when he never got further east than a luxury gig in Italy. That means that his whole shtick about being a gun-toting combat vet to justify his dream of destroying the Second Amendment is farcical.\n\nSecond, he only had a conditional promotion to command sergeant major, after which he was demoted to master sergeant because he did not complete his obligation to serve for a minimal amount of time. It's that decision to leave before the promotion became permanent that highlights Walz's real problem.\n\nThird, and most seriously, when Walz's unit was going to be sent to Iraq at the height of the war, he abruptly retired. That not only jettisoned his promotion, but it left his unit high and dry.\n\nSo, Walz really was a longstanding member of the National Guard, having first enlisted in Nebraska in 1981 before transferring to the Minnesota National Guard. In 2001, when he'd accrued his 20 years of service, he reenlisted for another six years after 9/11. All of that is commendable. It's his apparent running away and then lying about his rank and the nature of his service that's a problem. Incidentally, Walz had multiple opportunities to correct any misconceptions about his service but never did.\n\nWhat really galls veterans is the \"running away before being deployed\" part.

Gomez and Adam Edelman and Jonathan Allen and Alec Hern\u00e1ndez and Courtney Kube and Gabe Gutierrez\n\nAugust 7, 2024 at 9:25 PM\n\nDonald Trump's presidential campaign is homing in on what advisers see as a potential liability for Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz: his departure two decades ago from the Army National Guard.\n\nWalz, introduced Tuesday as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, ended his 24-year military career to run for public office in 2005 -- just before the unit he led deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, do you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him -- a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with,\" Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate and a Marine veteran who served in Iraq, said Wednesday at a news conference in Michigan.\n\n\"I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through, and then to drop out right before you actually have to go,\" Vance added.\n\nThe strategy, which Trump amplified Wednesday by calling Walz a \"DISGRACE\" in a Truth Social post, is a throwback to 2004, when Republicans attacked Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry's record as a Navy officer in Vietnam. Chris LaCivita -- who served as a consultant to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth group that helped sink Kerry's bid -- is a senior adviser to Trump's campaign and has signaled an eagerness to reopen the playbook on Walz.\n\n\"And when his men needed him the most ... as they headed into the Crucible that is combat ... he deserted them ... left them,\" LaCivita posted Tuesday on X, shortly after Harris selected Walz to join her on the Democratic ticket. \"Why? So he could run for Congress.\"\n\nIn introducing Walz, 60, to a wider audience beyond Minnesota, the Harris campaign has emphasized his military record, as well as his experience as a football coach. Campaign officials frame his decision to leave the National Guard and pursue a career in politics as a path that offered him new and meaningful opportunities to help service members and veterans.\n\n\"After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as Vice President he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,\" Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt said in a statement for this article.\n\nWalz has faced these attacks before, including in his 2022 re-election campaign, when his GOP opponent questioned the governor's decision to leave the service in 2005. Walz's campaign responded with a letter signed by 50 veterans praising his record and leadership.\n\n\"Governor Walz secured additional funding for new veterans homes,\" read the letter, a copy of which the Harris campaign shared Wednesday with NBC News. \"In his first term, Minnesota was one of just seven states initially selected by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to participate in the 'Governor's Challenge' to eliminate veteran deaths by suicide.\"\n\nErick Erickson, a prominent conservative commentator, drew attention Tuesday to a paid letter to the editor that scrutinized Walz's service and was published by a local newspaper in 2018, days before he won his first term as governor. Erickson also called for a return of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, prompting LaCivita's initial social media post. Other posts followed.\n\n\"He deserted his men and quit before they went to combat,\" LaCivita wrote of Walz in response to a complimentary post from Alyssa Farah Griffin, a co-host of the daytime talk show \"The View\" and a former Trump White House aide who has since denounced the former president.\n\nLaCivita's previous work with Swift Boat Veterans for Truth stands as one of the most aggressive and potentially consequential political attacks of the modern era.\n\nKerry -- who was awarded a Silver Star, a Bronze Star and, for wounds sustained in battle, three Purple Heart medals -- had drawn the ire of many veterans for his advocacy against the war after returning home. And as he sought the presidency in 2004, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ran ads accusing Kerry of lying about his service on 50-foot aluminum crafts that ran dangerous missions in the Mekong Delta waterways of South Vietnam. Some of the veterans featured in the ads said that he had won awards under false premises.\n\nThen-Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who spent years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam before becoming friends with Kerry in the Senate, criticized the ads and noted that the veterans making claims against Kerry did not serve on his boat. Some of those who did supported Kerry's accounts. The allegations, which Kerry did not immediately counter, muddied the picture he presented of himself as a war hero -- which appeared to be the group's aim from a political perspective. Swift Boat Veterans for Truth may not have proved its case, but it sowed doubt about a perceived strength of Kerry's -- his war service -- and about his credibility.\n\nAs FactCheck.org concluded after exhaustive research, \"at this point, 35 years later and half a world away, we see no way to resolve which of these versions of reality is closer to the truth.\" Kerry lost to then-President George W. Bush.\n\nWalz joined the National Guard in 1981, just after his 17th birthday. After transferring from the Nebraska National Guard in 1996, he served in the Minnesota National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery, said Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, public affairs officer for the Minnesota National Guard. Walz, Aug\u00e9 added, \"culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion\" and \"retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nDuring Walz's nearly quarter-century of service, he was part of flood fights, responded to tornadoes and spent months on active duty in Italy, according to the Harris campaign. Walz \"was deployed to Italy in 2003 to protect against potential threats in Europe while active military forces were deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan,\" the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported in 2022, attributing the information to Walz in an article about the scrutiny of his military service.\n\nWalz and Vance are the first veterans on a national ticket for either major party since McCain was the GOP presidential nominee in 2008. Vance, 40, briefly chronicled his experiences in Iraq in his 2016 memoir \"Hillbilly Elegy,\" recalling his work as a public affairs marine.\n\n\"Sometimes I'd escort civilian press, but generally I'd take photos or write short stories about individual marines or their work,\" he wrote. \"Early in my deployment, I attached to a civil affairs unit to do community outreach. Civil affairs missions were typically considered more dangerous, as a small number of marines would venture into unprotected Iraqi territory to meet with locals.\"\n\nIn a Tuesday post on X that highlighted Walz's hunting and military background, the Harris campaign shared undated video footage that featured the governor talking about gun control.\n\n\"We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz is seen and heard saying in the brief clip.\n\nVance alluded to the video at campaign stops Wednesday, accusing Walz of misrepresenting his military service and asserting that the governor never spent time in a combat zone.\n\n\"Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war? What was this weapon that you carried into war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq?\" Vance asked at an event near Detroit. \"What bothers me about Tim Walz is this stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not. ... I'd be ashamed if I was him and I lied about my military service like he did.\"\n\nLater, after arriving for an event in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Vance told reporters that he had \"served in a combat zone\" and \"never said that I saw a firefight myself, but I've always told the truth about my Marine Corps service.\"\n\nTrump spokesperson Karoline Leavitt also alluded to the video in a statement, telegraphing the campaign's intentions to keep pressing on Walz's military record.\n\n\"Tim Walz is a fraud who wants to ban firearms like the ones he claimed to carry in war -- except Tim Walz never deployed to a combat zone and lied about his record of service in the National Guard,\" Leavitt said. \"If Walz won't tell voters the truth, we will: just like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz is a dangerously liberal extremist, and the Harris-Walz California dream is every American's nightmare.\"\n\nAsked about the video, a Harris campaign spokesperson did not deny that Walz had embellished when he spoke of carrying weapons in war.\n\n\"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" the spokesperson said. \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country -- in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country. It's the American way.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign",

Tim Walz, the current vice president pick for 2024 Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris, has been aware of stolen valor accusations going back to 2006, according to a report from CNN.\n\nThat year, multiple letters to his local paper in Mankato, Minnesota, accused him of making misleading statements about his service, including whether he had served in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nWalz found the accusations serious enough that he personally responded to them both.\n\nAt issue were a selection of political ads and statements on Walz's website describing his overseas military service. While they described Walz as having served overseas in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, they neglected to specify that he did so while serving in Italy, not Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the statements and ads painted a confusing picture of Walz's service, he did say in other interviews at the time he was posted to Italy instead of Afghanistan \"by the lack of the draw.\" In other interviews, Walz said that he had been deployed to Italy \"in support of\" Operation Enduring Freedom - the war in Afghanistan. His 2006 campaign biography also read, \"Prior to retiring, Walz served overseas with his battalion in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. A TV advertisement at the time also called Walz \"the soldier who served for two decades but ready when they attacked\" that showed an image of the Twin Towers burning on the front page of a newspaper. The ad also said he was \"command sergeant major, retiring four years late after a tour supporting the war in Afghanistan.\"\n\nAt the time, some of the ads drew scrutiny and several letters were sent to the editors at his local paper saying that Walz had been phrasing his service in a way to suggest he set foot in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\n\"It strongly suggests that he fought in Iraq or Afghanistan, but does not say which country,\" read the letter archived letter from 2006. \"Because the information is not classified, Walz can tell the voters where he deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan and his BOG (boots on the ground) dates. If Walz did not deploy downrange, he should say so.\"\n\nOther letters were written in support of Walz.\n\n\"I was wondering when the Republicans would start 'swift boating' Tim Walz,\" read one. \"Tim Walz has never lied about his service. I have heard him speak several times, and he always explains that the battalion he led was sent to Italy during Operation Enduring Freedom to provide support to the U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan.\"\n\n\"On Saturday The Free Press printed a letter which implied I embellished my military record. The details of my record can be easily found in numerous articles by The Free Press and other newspapers. Therefore, I must assume that the letter is meant to slander my good name,\" wrote Walz. \"For the record, I served 24 years in the Army National Guard and retired as a command sergeant major in May of 2005. I served in three NATO training missions to the Arctic and deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, serving in Italy in 2003-2004.\"\n\n\"Using innuendo to defame a candidate's character has no place in this debate,\" he added. \"This nation must do better because we have too many important issues facing us to do anything less.\"\n\nThe accusation surfaced again in November 2006, which he also denied. At least one former service member under Walz's leadership, Sgt. Ryan Marti, came to his defense.\n\nThe Kamala HQ account repeated his claim in the post sharing the clip.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D), who is facing accusations of stolen valor, allegedly falsely claimed in a previous press release that he was a veteran of Afghanistan.\n\nThe war in Afghanistan, which began on October 7, 2001, was called Operation Enduring Freedom, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command website. The operation's start came after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\n\"Democrat Tim Walz will spend Sunday, Feb. 19th and Monday, Feb. 20th traveling across Minnesota's 1st Congressional District as he formally announces his candidacy for the United States House of Representatives,\" the press release said. \"Walz, a veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom and longtime Mankato educator is unopposed for the DFL endorsement and is slated to challenge Rep. Gil Gutknecht in November of 2006.\"\n\nA photo at the time featured Walz at an anti-President George W.

Tim Walz of Minnesota's superior said he would not have allowed him to retire shortly before his National Guard unit was ordered to Iraq, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.\n\nA 2018 Facebook post by retired Army Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends accusing Walz of retiring after learning his unit would be deployed to Iraq resurfaced after Vice President Kamala Harris chose Walz as her running mate in the upcoming presidential election. Retired Army Command Sergeant Major Doug Julin, who was the command sergeant major of the brigade Walz was assigned to, said Walz went over his head in arranging his retirement with higher officers before the unit was scheduled to be deployed, The Washington Post reported. (RELATED: Tim Walz Appears To Ignore Shouted Questions About 'Stolen Valor' Accusation)\n\n\"I would have analyzed it and challenged him,\" Julin told The Washington Post. \"It would have been a different discussion, but he went to the higher ranks. He knew I would have told him, 'Suck it up, we're going.'\"\n\nJulin previously criticized the Minnesota governor in a Sept. 26, 2022, interview with Alpha News, where he expanded on what took place prior to Walz's May 2005 retirement, calling it a \"backdoor deal.\"\n\n\"I'm going forward,\" Julin recalled Walz telling him during an early 2005 meeting he and Walz attended where the unit's deployment to Iraq was discussed, according to Alpha News. \"Then out of nowhere in June of 2005, Tom Behrends is there as the new [command sergeant major].\"\n\nJulin said that the sudden retirement caused his fellow soldiers to ask questions.\n\n\"Soldiers are thinking, 'What does he know that I don't know?' That's the kind of message it sends,\" he told Alpha News.\n\nBehrends and retired Army Command Sergeant Major Herr, who was the command sergeant major in another battalion in the Minnesota National Guard, also published a letter in 2018 to the West Central Tribune regarding Walz's sudden retirement during Walz's first gubernatorial campaign. (RELATED: 'This Is A Shocking Pick': Trump Says Harris-Walz Ticket Would Make America 'Go Communist Immediately')\n\n\"When the nation called, he quit,\" Behrends and Herr wrote. \"He failed to complete the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy. He failed to serve for two years following completion of the academy, which he dropped out of. He failed to serve two years after the conditional promotion to Command Sergeant Major. He failed to fulfill the full six years of the enlistment he signed on September 18th, 2001. He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers. And he failed to lead by example.

Vance accused Minnesota Governor Tim Walz on Aug 7 of quitting the Army National Guard two decades ago to avoid being deployed to Iraq and of exaggerating his service record to claim falsely that he had served in combat.\n\nBoth provocative charges amounted to some of the sharpest Republican attacks yet on the Minnesota governor, and appeared aimed at disrupting what has been a run of positive news coverage of the Democratic ticket since Vice-President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the party's nominee.\n\nThe accusations by Mr Vance, who served a four-year active duty enlistment in the Marine Corps, about Mr Walz, whose career in the national guard spanned 24 years, also served to pit the military records of the two major party's vice-presidential candidates against each other.\n\nSpeaking at the police department in Shelby Township, Michigan, on the morning of Aug 7, Mr Vance said Mr Walz had effectively deserted his fellow soldiers to avoid serving in Iraq because he retired from the National Guard in May 2005, several months before his artillery unit received orders to deploy there.\n\n\"You abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq,\" Mr Vance said.\n\nMr Vance based his accusations on a Facebook post from 2018, and a paid letter to the editor to the West Central Tribune that same year in which the writers, Mr Thomas Behrends and Mr Paul Herr, both retired command sergeant majors in the Minnesota National Guard, accused Mr Walz of \"conveniently retiring a year before his battalion was deployed to Iraq\".\n\nThe criticisms were first levelled by Mr Behrends and Mr Herr during Mr Walz's first campaign for governor.\n\nBut Mr Joseph Eustice, a 32-year veteran of the national guard who led the same battalion as Mr Walz and served under him, said in an interview on Aug 7 that the governor was a dependable soldier and that the attacks by his fellow comrades were unfounded.\n\n\"He was as good a soldier as you'd find, and to have two former sergeant majors say that he wasn't, it's just not true,\" Mr Eustice said, adding that he disagreed with Mr Walz's politics and most likely would not vote for him in November even though they were friends.\n\nMr Eustice recalled that Mr Walz's decision to run for Congress came months before the battalion received any official notice of deployment, though he said there had been rumors that it might be deployed.\n\nThe two men were exercising in early 2005, when Mr Walz, who was then a command sergeant major, turned to Mr Eustice, who was then a first sergeant, and said: \"I got to ask you something. I'm thinking about running for Congress,\" Mr Eustice recalled.\n\n\"I said, 'What the hell's wrong?'\" he added. \"I mean, why would you want to do such a thing?\"\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign did not provide any new details about the timeline of Mr Walz's decision to retire.

Ignoring the fact that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz (D) lied about going to war and carrying a weapon there, Cuomo presented a misleading timeline of Walz's retirement and openly suggested it was an important issue.\n\n\"Now, the first allegation that's getting the most attention is about his character. I believe it means the least to your daily life. But it is getting all the buzz because the media prefers the personal attacks,\" he flippantly declared.\n\nCuomo falsely suggested the allegation was that, \"Walz did not serve honorably.\"\n\nThat suggestion was inaccurate. No one had accused Walz of being dishonorably discharged or receiving anything less than an honorable discharge. The accusation was that he lied about going to war and retired just before his unit was deployed, thus avoiding getting shipped off to Iraq.\n\nCuomo paid lip service to Senator J.D. Vance's (R-OH) deployment with the Marines and defended his service as a war reporter. But he presented a misleading timeline of events regarding Walz's retirement:\n\nAlright, Vance served in Iraq. He deserves respect. I hear the criticism that 'Vance wasn't really a warrior. He was a reporter.' Look, the service stands. Okay? I reported in Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, other bad places. I wish it on no one. And he did it a lot more than I did.\n\nBut Governor Walz has a pretty impressive service record. He was in for way longer than Vance, to the extent that that is relevant. He retired at over age 40 before there was word of deployment to Iraq for his troops. Of course, the war was going on. Troops were being sent regularly. So, it is fair to suspect that he could have assumed he was going to go.\n\n\"Now I qualify it that many layers. Why? Because he hasn't said that. And there's no proof he left to avoid war,\" he proclaimed in Walz's defense.\n\nBut there was more information publically available at the time that Cuomo was admitting. According to a press release from the fledgling Walz congressional campaign in March 2005, two months before his retirement, Walz was aware that \"roughly 2,000 troops from the Minnesota National Guard\" were going to be mobilized and deployed to Iraq.\n\n\"As Command Sergeant Major I have a responsibility not only to ready my battalion for Iraq, but also to serve if called on. I am dedicated to serving my country to the best of my ability, whether that is in Washington DC or in Iraq,\" Walz said in the statement.\n\nBefore proclaiming \"my answer is better than his,\" Cuomo offered one more desperate defense for Walz's abandonment of his unit: crying 'but Trump.' \"And even if Walz had left early at over age 40 because he didn't want to go to war that age and stage. Didn't former President Trump avoid service altogether in a less than honorable way? So, I'm not impressed by this line of attack,\" he scoffed, ignoring how Democrats were find with Bill Clinton's draft dodging.\n\nThe transcript is below.

To set the record straight, a group of retired Command Sergeants Major from the Minnesota National Guard published a letter back in 2018 outlining the true nature of his service record.\n\nAccording to information provided by people who served with him or had firsthand knowledge of the circumstances of his service, he reenlisted in the National Guard in 2001 and was chosen to take part in the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy in early 2003. His participation meant agreeing to a few stipulations. One of them is serving for two years after graduating or being promoted to Sergeant Major or Command Sergeant Major, while those who fail to complete the course will have their rank reduced to Master Sergeant.\n\nHe deployed with the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2003 to Italy. After returning in 2004, he was chosen to serve as Command Sergeant Major of the battalion. Then, in early 2005, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion received a warning order to prepare for mobilization for active duty in Iraq, including the position Walz was serving.\n\nHowever, he decided to quit in May, leaving his battalion and its soldiers hanging and without their senior officer as they got ready for war. He said the reason for quitting was to run for Congress. However, a Department of Defense directive states that he could have run for office and asked the Secretary of Defense for permission before entering active duty, which is something that many other reservists have done in the past.\n\nIn September of 2005, Walz saw his position reduced from conditionally promoted Command Sergeant Major to Master Sergeant.\n\nMeanwhile, his battalion was serving a 22-month deployment from 2006 to 2007. At the time, the members of his battalion were not allowed to speak out against him, as a candidate for office, due to army regulations. This meant that those with direct knowledge of his status were unable to dispute the claims he made about his service record.\n\nIraq war veteran Tom Hagen wrote a letter to the editor of the Winona Daily News in November 2006 drawing attention to how Walz handled the situation, noting: \"But even more disturbing is the fact that Walz quickly retired after learning that his unit -- southern Minnesota's 1-125 FA Battalion -- would be sent to Iraq. For Tim Walz to abandon his fellow soldiers and quit when they needed experienced leadership most is disheartening.\"\n\nThe National Guard members closed their own letter with a rundown of Walz's questionable record, reiterating that he didn't complete the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy. He also quit before fulfilling the six years enlistment he signed in September 2001, nor did he serve for two years following his conditional promotion to Command Sergeant Major.\n\n\"He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers. And he failed to lead by example. Shameful,\" they stated.\n\nSenator JD Vance (R-Ohio) has also called Walz out on his military record, stating: \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with.\"", "source": {"uri": "naturalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NaturalNews.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Sergeants_Major_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Sergeants Major Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Active duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_reserve_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military reserve force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winona_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Winona Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Genealogy/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2024/08/Tim-Walz-Minnesota-Governor.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2006-11-", "textStart": 2202, "textEnd": 2215}, {"amb": false, "date": "2001-09-", "textStart": 2807, "textEnd": 2821}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

The issue with those lines of attack, of course, is that they are entirely false.\"\n\nIn the clip, Vance accused Walz of retiring from the National Guard in order to avoid service in Iraq:\n\nWhat really bothers me about Tim Walz, it's not even the positions that he's taken, though certainly he has been a far-left radical, you know what bothers me about Tim Walz, as a Marine who served his country in uniform? When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. I did what they asked me to do and I did it honorably, and I'm very proud of that service. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq? You know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\n\nVance also cited Walz justifying his calls for gun control by claiming he simply wants to ban weapons he carried \"in war,\" but Velshi didn't play that part and completely ignored Walz's claim.\n\nInstead, Velshi fact-checked a straw man:\n\n[Walz] responded to floods and tornadoes and he spent months on active duty overseas doing things like training our NATO allies in Italy. Now, Walz has never claimed that he had a combat role in the military. He's never had one.\n\nBut that's not the point, because there's an understanding among people who served this country in the military that you have answered a sacred call no matter what you are, whether you're in reserve or you're active duty, no matter whether you're a cook or mechanic or fighter pilot, no matter whether you serve at home or abroad, you see combat or not. Tim Walz never saw combat. But you know who else didn't see combat? JD Vance.\n\nVance was a civil affairs Marine who took photos, wrote stories, and escorted journalists around Iraq. But that doesn't matter because neither of these two men have ever pretended they had combat roles. They both had incredibly important non-combat roles, and they are both veterans. And we should be grateful to both of them for their service to this nation.\n\nVelshi is correct, if Walz had just said, \"I served in the National Guard for 24 years,\" even Republicans would find that admirable, but he embellished his record in order to create a fallacious appeal to authority argument in favor of gun control, and that's the problem.\n\nWalz also embellished his rank, but, again, Velshi ignored that, \"The only reason Walz ultimately left the National Guard was to run for Congress. I mean, to go back and listen to how he presented himself even in that very first run for office, doesn't sound like stolen valor to me.\"\n\nIrony officially being dead, Velshi played a radio of Walz's 2006 congressional campaign, \"I am a retired command sergeant major in the Minnesota National Guard.\"\n\nBefore he appoints himself the guardian of truth, Velshi should at least learn what the definitions of \"entirely\" and \"false\" are.\n\nHere is a transcript for the August 7 show:", "source": {"uri": "newsbusters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://newsbusters.org/"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact-checking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fact-checking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Velshi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ali Velshi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Wagner_Tonight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alex Wagner Tonight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Active duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighter_pilot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fighter pilot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://cdn.newsbusters.org/styles/mobile_thumb_700x400_/s3/2024-08/2024-08-07-MSNBC-Alex%20Wagner%20Tonight-Walz-Vance.jpg?itok=XIQ0JpKf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 3558, "textEnd": 3566}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Vance, some forgotten history about Walz resurfaced.\n\nA paid letter to a newspaper in 2018 alleged that Walz suddenly retired from the Minnesota National Guard to avoid a deployment to Iraq. As well, daughter Hope leaked National Guard plans on Twitter during the Floyd Hoax Riots in 2020. Also going viral are Minnesota First Lady Gwen Walz's comments about the riots. Governor Walz let the rioters burn down 1,000 businesses and a police station.\n\nAside from all that, he is a typically modern crackpot Democrat. Last year, he signed a bill that made Minnesota a \"sanctuary\" for kids who are brainwashed into believing they need \"gender-affirming health care.\"\n\nThe paid letter to the West Central Tribune is frank. It accused Walz of cowardice, dereliction of duty, and aggrandizing his military service record.\n\nTwo command sergeant majors, Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, wrote that Walz, after his return on a deployment to Italy in 2004, was selected to become a command sergeant major.\n\nWalz \"was photographed holding a sign at a protest outside a President Bush campaign rally in southern Minnesota\" on August 5 that year, the two men wrote, and \"conditionally promoted to Command Sergeant Major\" on September 17. If the selectee doesn't meet the conditions of the promotion, he loses the rank.\n\nWalz did lose that rank, and with good reason:\n\nIn early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq.\n\nOn May 16th, 2005 he quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war. His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for congress. Which is false, according to a Department of Defense Directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have. If he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academy. Instead he waited for the paperwork to catch up to him. His official retirement document states, SOLDIER NOT AVAILABLE FOR SIGNATURE.\n\nWalz's rank was reduced to master sergeant.\n\n\"The bottom line in all of this is gut wrenching and sad to explain,\" the two men wrote. \"When the nation called, he quit.... He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers. And he failed to lead by example. Shameful.\"\n\nThe governor's website biography suggests that he retired as a command sergeant major.\n\nAdding to that bad news are daughter Hope's Twitter posts during the riots that ensued after George Floyd died of a fentanyl overdose as Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin restrained him.\n\nOn May 27, a Twitter user posted this message:\n\nURGENT: if you're at the protest GET OUT NOW. National Guard and SWAT en route. They're almost here and will be using city buses to arrest everyone / as many people as possible. Get everyone out.\n\nBeing the governor's daughter, Hope knew something the user didn't. Guardsmen were not on the way.\n\n\"There is a lot of misinformation that is further spreading fear and chaos at the scene of the protests,\" she wrote:\n\nthe guard can not be sent in within minutes. it takes time for them to deploy because they come from all over the state. to be clear, the national guard will not be present tonight.\n\njust because someone asked for something doesn't mean it's happening right away or even happening at all. i don't know about swat but what i do know is the guard will not be present arresting people tonight.\n\nAs the New York Post observed, rioters burned down a police precinct after Hope wrote those words.\n\nThe state Senate committee report duly noted the breach of secrecy. Walz \"allowed his adult daughter to access confidential information that she then disseminated to the general public and rioters.\"\n\nThe governor's wife was quite at peace with the widespread destruction that cost $500 million.\n\n\"With Mr. Floyd's death, it was the entire country and the whole world looking at and watching what we did here in Minnesota in response to that,\" Gwen Walz said during interview with the ABC affiliate, KTSP5:\n\nAgain we had more sleepless nights during the riots. I could smell the burning tires, and that was a very real thing. I kept the windows open as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening.\n\nBut the governor's refusal to stop the rioters and watch them burn down a police station won't be the only campaign issue for Trump and Vance.\n\nIn April last year, Walz signed the so-called Trans Refuge bill that would \"protect the rights\" of \"transgender\" kids to get \"gender-affirming care.\" That's leftist code for poisoning kids with hormones of the opposite sex, then mutilating them with \"gender reassignment\" surgery.\n\nIf a kid shows up in Minnesota from a sane state where poisoning and mutilation are forbidden, the law permits doctors to poison and mutilate the child.", "source": {"uri": "thenewamerican.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New American"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_cort_kirkwood@thenewamerican.com", "name": "R.

Tim Walz's former military comrades delivered a stunning condemnation of his actions and behavior - just days before he was elected to the first term of his current post in 2018. And he was elected anyway.\n\nNow he's been picked as Kamala Harris' vice presidential hopeful in the 2024 election, and the warning still stands at the West Central Tribune.\n\nRetired National Guard Command Sgt. Majors Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr said, at the time, \"The bottom line in all of this is gut wrenching and sad to explain. When the nation called, he quit. He failed to complete the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy. He failed to serve for two years following completion of the academy, which he dropped out of. He failed to serve two years after the conditional promotion to Command Sergeant Major. He failed to fulfill the full six years of the enlistment he signed on September 18th, 2001. He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers. And he failed to lead by example. Shameful\"\n\nThe document published at the time charged that Walz \"embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances of his military career.\"\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nThey wrote that they had verified dates and facts with official records and those who witnessed various events.\n\nWalz, before being governor, in 2001 re-enlisted in the Minnesota Army National Guard for six years.\n\nThen he was picked to attend the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy, making a commitment to serve for two years after graduation or being promoted.\n\nHe then deployed to Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and when he returned to Minnesota was appointed to the position of Command Sergeant Major of the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion.\n\nHowever, in 2004 he was photographed holding a sign at a protest outside a campaign rally for President Bush, and when his unit was informed of plans to deploy to Iraq, he quit, leaving the \"battalion and its soldiers hanging; without its senior non-commissioned officer, as the battalion prepared for war.\"\n\nThe two veterans said, \"His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for Congress. Which is false, according to a Department of Defense Directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have. If he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academy. Instead he waited for the paperwork to catch up to him. His official retirement document states, SOLDIER NOT AVAILABLE FOR SIGNATURE.\"\n\nUltimately his rank was reduced.\n\nA report at RedState said the two National Guard officers exposed how Walz \"lied or embellished his service record and shirked his duty.\"\n\nThey charge, the report said that \"he abandoned his troops when they went to Iraq.\"\n\nThe report said, \"He abandoned and walked away from his soldiers and his solemn responsibility to lead and take care of them. According to Behrends and Herr, Walz is hiding that part of the information from the public in an attempt to fool the electorate.\"\n\nRedState noted, \"Another retired command sergeant major corroborated the stories of Behrends and Herr. CSM (Ret) Douglas L. Julin was the 34th Infantry Division Command Sergeant Major and met with Walz, along with five other battalion CSMs, in early 2005 before they deployed to Iraq. According to Julin, Walz said he would be deploying with his battalion, even after mentioning that he was going to run for Congress.\"\n\nThen, suddenly, he was gone.\n\nOn social media, a Twitter account for \"Stolen Valor,\" was published paperwork from Walz's departure.\n\nThat site explained that Walz, in fact, was reduced in rank for \"not completing the required educational requirements.\"\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Vote Vets Calls Bull$hit On J.D. Vance, Literally, For Lies About Walz", "body": "OMG. This is yet another thing that if a screenwriter came up with it, you'd laugh the poor person into oblivion. J.D. Vance was considered an asset for the Trump ticket because of his military service, particularly in Iraq, which it turns out was six months sitting in an air conditioned office writing press releases. So he's been defending his service record and talking about Trump's glowing views on the military and we'll get to that in just a moment. Meanwhile, Vance has depicted Tim Walz as a coward and claiming he's inflating his rank and VoteVets got right on top of that one. J.D. Vance just blew himself up with a grenade.\n\nthe tweet ends, \"buddy JD was a pencil pusher sitting behind a desk,\" and three laughing emojis. And now it gets comical.\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance admitted he never saw combat in Iraq and defended Donald Trump's lack of military service.\n\nAfter accusing Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz of \"stolen valor\" on Wednesday, Vance took questions from reporters in Wisconsin.\n\n\"I just want to ask about the accusation this morning about Walz, about abandoning his fellow soldiers,\" a reporter asked Vance on an airport tarmac. \"Are you basing that on anything more than a Facebook post?\"\n\n\"I mean, these are, as you know, serious accusations, as well, like, I mean, your running mate has faced similar accusations about avoiding service because of bone spurs,\" the reporter added.\n\nVance claimed there was a \"difference\" between Trump's failure to serve and Walz's decision to leave the military after 24 years.\n\n\"President Trump did not serve in the United States military,\" Vance admitted. \"He's never claimed that he did. Walz did say on camera that 'I carried a gun in a war.'\"\n\n\"And I think the evidence at this point is overwhelming that he lied about serving in a combat zone,\" he continued. \"By the way, I served in a combat zone. I answered the call. I've never lied about my military service.\"\n\nThe Republican candidate accused Walz of \"disgraceful conduct\" and lying about combat service.\n\nThe New Republic pointed out that Vance's military service \"wasn't exactly the boots-on-the-ground experience that he's now framing it as.\"\n\n\"Instead, Vance served a single four-year enlistment in the public affairs section in the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, and wrote in his memoir, Hillbilly Elegy, that he was 'lucky to escape any real fighting,'\" the report said.\n\nDo yourself a favor click the link to Raw Story and scroll down to the video. Listening to this guy lie is so entertaining. Especially when credible people slap him back within a few hours time. Now we get to Vance lying about how much Trump \"admires\" the military.\n\nThis is how simple it is. J.D. Vance is a liar. He has no moral compass. He's merely trying to attain power and money. He'll say or do anything to get that. Tim Walz is the real thing. Walz served in the military, Walz taught school, Walz has a record in government as a public servant. Walz is not there to do the bidding of oligarchs and overthrow democracy and initiate oligarchy. J.D.

Maj. Paul Herr (Ret.), who accused Walz of misleading voters about his military service in 2018, joined \"Fox & Friends\" Thursday to discuss why veterans have accused the governor of \"stolen valor.\"\n\nJD VANCE ACCUSES TIM WALZ OF 'LYING' ABOUT MILITARY SERVICE: 'STOLEN VALOR GARBAGE'\n\n\"He continually claims that he's a retired [sergeant] major. He is not, he is a retired master sergeant,\" Herr told host Steve Doocy.\n\nHerr recalled that Walz told other soldiers that he would be going on deployment to Iraq while \"at the same time having backroom conversations with other people, other entities inside the Minnesota National Guard, to ensure that he could retire.\"\n\nWalz's service concluded when he retired from his unit in the Minnesota National Guard right before they deployed to Iraq in 2005, the New York Post reported. The Minnesota National Guard told Fox News Walz's unit was not given deployment orders to Iraq until July and he had put his retirement papers in five to seven months prior to his retirement in May 2005.\n\nThe VP nominee is described as a retired \"command sergeant major\" in his governor's website biography and has also claimed he carried a gun \"in war,\" despite never experiencing active combat.\n\nBut critics, including Herr and Ret. Command Sgt. Maj. Thomas Behrends, a former member of Walz's battalion, have pushed back on those claims.\n\nVP KAMALA HARRIS PICKING GOV. TIM WALZ AS RUNNING MATE MET WITH MEDIA SCORN: 'SUCH A WEIRD CHOICE'\n\n\"He's used the rank that he never achieved in order to advance his political career,\" Behrends told \"The Ingraham Angle\" on Wednesday. \"I mean, he still says he's a retired command sergeant major to this day, and he's not. He uses the rank of others to make it look like he's a better person than he is.\"\n\nBut Herr argued the most shameful portion of the controversy was his motive to \"feather his own bed.\"\n\n\"He subverted the chain of command, and he went around the chain of command. The brigade [sergeant] major had no clue. These are all important facts, and he did it to continually feather his own bed... That was the shameful part of it,\" Herr said.\n\n\"And then, of course, he never entered into the Sergeant Majors Academy. He never did one scrap of work. That takes years.\"\n\n\"He signed a commitment letter saying that he was going to do that job. He didn't, and he was stripped of that title when he left the Minnesota National Guard, yet he still claims to do it.\"\n\nBehrends said Walz had been promoted to command sergeant major in 2004, but claimed he was required to serve two additional years or the promotion would be void. His early retirement terminated the promotion, reducing his rank to master sergeant, Behrends said.\n\n\"What he did, basically, was he quit,\" he said. \"He didn't complete that condition of doing two years after graduation, so he gets reduced to a master sergeant, and that's what he is right now, is a retired master sergeant.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard released a statement on the controversy.\n\n\"Governor Tim Walz served from April 8, 1981, to May 16, 2005... He held multiple positions within field artillery... and culminated his career serving as the Command Sergeant Major for the battalion. He retired as a Master Sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy,\" it read.\n\nHerr wasn't satisfied with that response, calling it a \"very political answer.\"\n\n\"He didn't complete the course work because he never entered into it. It's misleading... It sounds like he missed the last test or something. He didn't do that... He didn't do anything.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bailee_hill@foxnews.com", "name": "Bailee Hill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Doocy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Doocy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_&_Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox & Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_hierarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Command hierarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ingraham_Angle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Ingraham Angle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brigade"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/08/1024/512/Tim-Walz-Kamala-Harris-VP-2024-Election_15.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-16", "textStart": 3487, "textEnd": 3499}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-", "textStart": 1419, "textEnd": 1427}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

But Vance and Walz are also both veterans, with another thing in common: neither one of them saw combat. Their service shored up each ticket, adding a military credential beside two presidential candidates that never served. It didn't seem like an issue. But in this compressed campaign season, Walz's phrasing opened up a line of attack -- and the Trump campaign took it, accusing the Minnesota governor of one of the most grievous charges possible in military circles.\n\nWalz joined the National Guard at age 17 and served 24 years, first in Nebraska then Minnesota. During that time he got called up to national disasters and a deployment to the Arctic Circle in Norway. He completed his 20 years required for retirement in 2001, but then reenlisted after the attacks on Sept. 11. His only wartime deployment was to Italy in 2003, backfilling troops that were deploying to Afghanistan.

J.D. Vance (Ohio), the Republican vice-presidential nominee, attacked his Democratic counterpart Tim Walz's military record on Wednesday, claiming the Minnesota governor \"abandoned\" his Army National Guard unit before it deployed to Iraq in 2006 and lied about serving in combat. The claims, recycled from Walz's 2018 gubernatorial run, appear to be false or based on subjective interpretation.\n\nWalz filed to run for Congress in February 2005 then retired from the National Guard in May, two months before his unit was told it was being sent to Iraq. Vance served four years in the Marine Corps, including six months in Iraq in a noncombat public affairs role.\n\n\"There is no evidence that Walz retired to avoid a wartime deployment\" and he \"never claimed he was a combat veteran,\" Politico said. Vance's attacks are \"reminiscent of the 2004 campaign to discredit the distinguished war record of Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry.\" Those 2004 \"'Swift boat' attacks,\" The New York Times said, were orchestrated by Chris LaCivita, now a \"senior strategist for the Trump campaign.\"\n\nThe attacks on Walz's 24-year military career were \"part of the race from both parties to define the relatively unknown governor\" after his selection as Kamala Harris' running mate, CNN said. They also \"appeared aimed at disrupting what has been a run of positive news coverage of the Democratic ticket,\" the Times said.\n\nIt \"remains to be seen\" if Swift-boating \"will be as successful 20 years later,\" Politico said, especially given the record of Vance's running mate. \"Anyone who tries to criticize [Walz's] record but looks the other way at Donald Trump's six deferments to Vietnam is beyond the pale,\" former Rep.

Tim Walz Facing Stolen Valor Accusation", "body": "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) -- the vice presidential candidate pick of Democrat presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris -- has listed on his official biography a higher military rank than the one he ultimately retired with, drawing criticism from some veterans and accusations of stolen valor.\n\nHis official bio states:\n\nAfter 24 years in the Army National Guard, Command Sergeant Major Walz retired from the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion in 2005. Tim won his first election to the United States House of Representatives in 2006 and was re-elected for another five terms serving Minnesota's First Congressional District in Southern Minnesota.\n\nThe Minnesota National Guard's State Public Affairs Officer, Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, confirmed to Breitbart News that Walz did not retire as an E-9. She said in an email:\n\nHe retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nTwo retired Army Command Sergeant Majors, Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr, wrote in a letter published November 2, 2018, in the West Central Tribune, a local news outlet, that Walz on September 17, 2004, was \"conditionally promoted\" to Command Sergeant Major but then later failed to meet the conditions of the promotion, which they said was later nullified.\n\n\"On September 17th, 2004 he was conditionally promoted to Command Sergeant Major. The conditions had been outlined to him when he was counseled and he signed the Statement of Agreement and Certification. If the conditions are not met, the promotion is null and void, like it never happened,\" they wrote.\n\nThey then said that after his unit was issued orders to deploy to Iraq, he then quit. They wrote:\n\nIn early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq.\n\nOn May 16th, 2005 he quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war. His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for congress. Which is false, according to a Department of Defense Directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have. If he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academy. Instead he waited for the paperwork to catch up to him. His official retirement document states, SOLDIER NOT AVAILABLE FOR SIGNATURE.\n\nOn September 10th, 2005 conditionally promoted Command Sergeant Major Walz was reduced to Master Sergeant. It took a while for the system to catch up to him as it was uncharted territory, literally no one quits in the position he was in, or drops out of the academy. Except him.\n\nIn November of 2005, while the battalion trained for war at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, it received an offer from retired Master Sergeant Walz. He offered to fund raise for the battalions bus trip home over Christmas that year.\n\nThe 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion was deployed for 22 months in 2006 - 2007. During this time, they were restricted by Army regulations and could not speak out against a candidate for office. In November 2006 he was elected to the House of Representatives.\n\nThey wrote:\n\nHe claims to be the highest-ranking enlisted service member ever to serve in congress. Even though he was conditionally promoted to Command Sergeant Major less than eight months, quit before his obligations were met, and was reduced to Master Sergeant for retirement. Yes, he served at that rank, but was never qualified at that rank, and will receive retirement benefits at one rank below. You be the judge.\n\nBehrends has since spoken out about Walz on other occasions, including to Alpha News on September 6, 2022, when he slammed the governor for bailing on the deployment.\n\nBehrends said he replaced Walz on the deployment to Iraq after he quit.\n\n\"The public needs to know how pathetic his leadership was as a National Guardsman,\" he said. \"He abandoned us. What the hell kind of leader does that? As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way and hung his hat up and quit.\"\n\nBehrends went on to serve in Iraq on a nearly two-year deployment -- while Walz ran for Congress and began calling himself \"Command Sergeant Major.\"\n\nAccording to Alpha News, Behrends said he contacted Walz with his concerns before raising the issue publicly, sending letters to Washington in 2016, but that all the letters went unanswered.\n\nBehrends said, \"It's stolen valor is really what it is. I don't know of anybody else that's done what he's done.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tim Walz, has come under fire from former military colleagues for allegedly ducking out on a deployment to Iraq in 2005.\n\nWalz, who was just announced Tuesday as Harris' running mate, is already being touted by liberal media outlets, including Newsweek, as \"the longest-serving military veteran to be a vice presidential nominee.\"\n\nThe 60-year-old served 24 years in the Army National Guard, where he reached the rank of command sergeant major.\n\nThe Newsweek account included praise from retired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling, who wrote on X that those who reach that rank \"know what they're doing.\"\n\n\"They uphold standards. They speak their minds to all ranks (private to generals). They're not afraid of getting bad news because they know how to fix things when they go wrong ...\n\n\"While I don't know the details of @GovTimWalz career wearing the cloth of our country, just the fact that he volunteered to serve and wore the CSM rank tells me a lot about him.\"\n\nHowever, at least some of those who do know Walz and who served in the military with him raised questions about his actions when it came time for his unit to deploy.\n\nIn September 2022, when Walz was running for re-election as governor, independent Minnesota news outlet Alpha News quoted retired Command Sgt. Maj. Doug Julin as saying, Walz \"abandoned his soldiers\" in 2005.\n\nJulin, who retired from the Minnesota National Guard in 2012 with 35 years of service, described \"a backdoor deal\" that allowed Walz to skip his unit's deployment to Iraq.\n\nHe said Walz insisted early in 2005 that he would be going on the deployment, despite talk of running for Congress.\n\nJulin told Alpha News that Walz confirmed \"I'm going forward\" with the deployment.\n\n\"Then out of nowhere in June of 2005, Tom Behrends is there as the new CSM,\" Julin recalled.\n\n\"Julin said he was most upset with how it was handled because Walz didn't come to him as brigade command sergeant major, the position he held at the time,\" Alpha News reported.\n\n\"He went around my authority to get out of the position. I probably would have told him, 'No, you're going on the deployment,'\" Julin told the outlet.\n\nJulin told Alpha News that Walz' pulling out of the deployment \"set a tone.\"\n\n\"Soldiers are thinking, 'What does he know that I don't know?' That's the kind of message it sends,\" he told Alpha News.\n\n\"I don't know anybody that wanted to go to war then, but we went because we were tasked to do it,\" Julin added.\n\nJulin told the outlet that Walz \"uses the military to promote himself when he abandoned his soldiers.\n\n\"He let the soldiers down. How can you be entrusted to be the governor of Minnesota when if something is not to your liking, you quit or you serve yourself and not others?\"\n\nTom Behrends, the man who replaced Walz on the deployment, told KSTP-TV in a 2022 interview that Walz was conditionally promoted to command sergeant major in September 2004.\n\n\"After a few weekend Guard drills and being notified we were going to war, he quit in May of 2005. What kind of leader does that?\"\n\nBehrends told Alpha News in a September 2022 video interview that Walz \"abandoned us.\"\n\n\"I mean, what the hell kind of leader does that?\" Behrends said.\n\n\"As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way and hung his hat up and quit.\"\n\n\"It's stolen valor is really what it is,\" Behrends said of Walz' actions.\n\nIn response to the retired soldier's remarks, Walz told KSTP at a 2022 event dedicating a Medal of Honor memorial, \"I don't know if Tom [Behrends] just disagrees with my politics or whatever, but my record speaks for itself, and my accomplishments in uniform speak for itself, and there's many people in this crowd, too, that I served with.\"", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lorri_wickenhauser@westernjournal.com", "name": "Lorri Wickenhauser", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hertling", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Hertling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_general_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant general (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Command sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brigade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KSTP-TV", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KSTP-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.westernjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Walz.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2004-09-", "textStart": 2939, "textEnd": 2953}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

That resentment didn't vanish in an instant, but as I stood and surveyed the mass of children of a war-torn nation, their school without running water, and the overjoyed boy, I began to appreciate how lucky I was: born in the greatest country on earth, every modern convenience at my fingertips, supported by two loving hillbillies, and part of a family that, for all its quirks, loved me unconditionally.\"\n\n\"At that moment, I resolved to be the type of man who would smile when someone gave him an eraser.

You just have to know what to look for.\n\nOn Wednesday, Vice President Harris gave a stump speech in Wisconsin. \"Prices for everyday things are still too high,\" she said. That's true. She continued, \"When I am president, it will be a day one priority to fight to bring down prices.\"\n\nIf only she had been ... say... vice president for the past four years. If only she could have met with the president during this time to talk about inflation. If only she were in position -- right now -- to do something to stop soaring prices.\n\nOh wait. She is. The Biden-Harris administration has been so terrible on inflation that she's running against her own record.\n\nAlso, on Wednesday, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance flew into Wisconsin. As he got off the plane, he noticed Air Force Two on the runway. Vance walked over, telling reporters, \"I just wanted to check out my future plane.\"\n\n\"I also thought you guys might get lonely because the vice president doesn't answer questions from reporters and hasn't for 17 days.\"\n\nAwesome. The subtle dig at the press for letting her avoid questions for two-plus weeks is spot on, too.\n\nIt's a reminder that the national mainstream media's liberal bias is a huge advantage for Democrats. But occasionally it backfires. Witness the unfolding saga of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' VP pick. He's been in politics for almost 20 years, so you would expect every wart to be well-known.\n\nNope. There's a mountain of evidence that Walz is repeatedly guilty of stolen valor -- inflating his military service for personal benefit. He served 24 years in the National Guard, eventually becoming a battalion command sergeant major. That's a major leadership position. But when his unit received deployment orders to Iraq, he bailed. He backed out of the commitment he made to receive the promotion to command sergeant major. He lost rank over it, retiring as a master sergeant.\n\nThat's a scandal. Tom Behrands replaced Walz as command sergeant major on that dangerous deployment. In 2018, when Walz ran for governor, he took this story to the Star Tribune in Minneapolis and local TV stations. They ignored it. My belief: If Walz had been a Republican, the press would have run that story into the ground. Walz wouldn't have become governor. Even if he did, the scandal would have kept him from becoming a VP candidate.\n\nWhile the media's bias helped Walz advance his career, this scandal will be a drag on the Democrat ticket. This isn't the end of it either. More evidence of Walz overstating his service record to help himself politically keeps coming out. Americans don't agree on much, but stolen valor remains deeply unpopular.\n\nAlso, Walz signed a bill requiring schools to put tampons and pads in boys' restrooms. Libs of TikTok creator Chaya Raichik was one of many who dubbed him \"Tampon Tim.\" A pithy encapsulation of what the left's transgender madness leads to.\n\nIt's significantly less funny to think about Harris and Walz running the country. Look at the past four years. But for now, enjoy the unintentional comedy provided by Kamala's campaign.", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force_Two", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air Force Two"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Media bias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainstream media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libs_of_TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Libs of TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Star Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minneapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/19485275_web1_19481347-8fdd2e29f59c402d81eafcadc2fb1987.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

It's sad.\"\n\n\"He had the opportunity to serve his country, and said 'Screw you' to the United States. That's not who I would pick to run for vice president,\" he added.\n\nBehrends previously spoke up about Walz's service in 2018 while the latter was running for governor of Minnesota.\n\nIn an open letter posted to Facebook that year, Behrends and fellow retired CSM Paul Herr wrote that Walz retired just a few months after receiving a warning order that his battalion would be deployed to Iraq - even though he told military personnel he would be going on the mission.\n\n\"On May 16, 2005, [Walz] quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125 Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war,\" Behrends and Herr wrote.\n\nThe pair wrote that Walz said he needed to retire to run for Congress, but this was untrue. Walz could have run for Congress and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before he entered active duty, the pair claimed.\n\n\"If he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academy,\" the two wrote. \"Instead he slithered out the door and waited for the paperwork to catch up to him.\"\n\nThey noted that his official retirement document says \"soldier not available for signature.\"\n\nWalz's sudden retirement complicated his selection to the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy, Behrends and Herr wrote. Once someone accepts enrollment, they agree to three stipulations: to serve two years after graduation from the academy or promotion, that failing the course could result in being kicked out of the military, and that they will be reduced to Master Sergeant if they don't complete the course.\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER FOR 'AM I RACIST?' -- A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI\n\nWalz wasn't promoted to Command Sergeant Major until September 17, 2004. A month earlier, he was photographed holding a protest sign outside a rally for President George W. Bush's re-election campaign, though it doesn't seem as though the military noticed or disciplined him.\n\nLess than a year after his promotion, Walz retired, meaning his promotion was nullified since he broke the agreement he signed when entering the academy.\n\nOn September 10,2005, Walz was reduced to Master Sergeant. As Behrends and Herr wrote, \"It took a while for the system to catch up to him as it was uncharted territory, literally no one quits in the position he was in, or drops out of the academy.\"\n\nIn November 2005, Walz reached out to his former battalion as it was preparing for war. He offered to hold a fundraiser for their bus trip home over Christmas. \"The same Soldiers he had abandoned just months before, trying to buy their votes,\" Behrends and Herr wrote.\n\nBehrends and Herr noted that Walz's official Report of Separation and Record of Service stated that Walz re-enlisted on September 18, 2001, for six years.

Tim Walz after the town meeting about veteran's issues held at the Richfield VFW. (Joey McLeister/Star Tribune via Getty Images)\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and organizers who once served in the U.S. military characterized GOP attacks on Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's military record as \"unfounded\" and \"morally bankrupt\" on a Thursday press call organized by the Democratic National Committee.\n\nRepublicans have been pushing the false line that Walz, who served in the National Guard for 24 years, abandoned his unit as it was being deployed to Iraq, with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, characterizing his service as \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\nSuch attacks don't hold up to scrutiny, according to Rep. Jake Auchinschloss, D-Mass., who pointed out that Walz, who won multiple decorations and received praise from fellow officers, made the decision to retire from the National Guard months before his unit received its deployment notification.\n\nWalz's retirement was finalized in May 2005, two months prior to the deployment notification in July 2005, and nearly a year before his former unit went to Iraq in March 2006. Its probable that he made the decision to retire and filed his paperwork months earlier, having filed his intent to run for Congress back in February 2006.\n\n\"Typically, processing time ranges from 60 to 180 days for retirement requests based on the selected date of retirement,\" said a U.S. Army Human Resources Command official in 2023, discussing such requests from reserve members.\n\n\"I think we saw twenty years ago with the swift-boating of John Kerry that we cannot presume that unfounded attacks will implode under their own lies, so we have to call out bad faith attacks and show them that we are not going to be pliant about this,\" Auchinschloss continued. The GOP effort to paint Kerry as a liar about his own military service in Vietnam was headed by Republican operative Chris LaCivita, who is now co-campaign manager in Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nAuchinschloss said that it's especially rich that the attacks would come from Republicans supporting former President Donald Trump, who took five deferments during the Vietnam War and \"has a record of disparaging veterans and throwing them under the bus for political gain.\"\n\nRepublicans are also accusing Walz of lying about his record, highlighting a speech in which he expressed his wish to \"make sure that weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war.\" Walz did not serve in a combat zone, but did provide base protection and participate in training missions and other support operations for the war in Afghanistan while stationed in Europe. If Walz used potentially ambiguous language in that instance, he also on numerous other occasions shared careful details of his service, noting that he did not deploy to Iraq and saying that \"there are certainly folks that did far more than I did. I know that.\"\n\nVeterans now working as organizers for the Harris-Walz campaign said they are angry at these Republican attacks and emphasized that all military service is important and commendable. Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colorado, suggested that Trump's allies are disparaging Walz because they \"have no ideas and no vision for the future, so all they can do is attack and lie and twist and contort and it shows the country their complete lack of leadership.\"\n\nThe call also discussed President Joe Biden and former president Trump's respective records on veterans affairs, as well as the PACT Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022 and expands the scope of benefits eligibility for American veterans.", "source": {"uri": "salon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Salon.com"}, "authors": [],

Large majorities of Americans look up to those who wore the uniform and associate serving in the military with positive stereotypes like self-discipline, loyalty and responsibility. Politicians and our political system? Not so much.\n\nOnly 26 percent of Americans have confidence in the presidency, and confidence in Congress stands at 9 percent. It's no wonder that both parties recruit military veterans to run for office, hoping that the halo from their service will soften the sharp edges of political reality and garner crossover appeal come election day.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris's selection of Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her running mate this week spurred adulation from groups as varied as the Democratic Socialists of America and mainstream pundits -- but it also brought renewed scrutiny of Walz's service record as a retired senior non-commissioned officer in the Army National Guard. There is no dispute that Walz enlisted in 1981 and retired in 2005 after twenty-four years of service, including several peacetime/non-combat rotations. Yet Walz's characterization of his service record raised questions that deserve close appraisal, not scattershot attacks.\n\nWhen Walz first enlisted, nearly one in five Americans had served in the military; today it's closer to one in twenty. Fewer Americans understand service from personal experience; most rely on media depictions shaped by over two decades of conflict. As a result, the image of a veteran in many Americans' minds is someone who put their on the line fighting overseas. While reality is quite different -- there are roughly ten support personnel for every combat arms soldier -- the political temptation for a candidate to wrap themselves in the warfighter narrative is hard to resist.\n\nThe year before he first ran for Congress in 2005, Walz cloaked himself in that image, holding a sign that read, \"Enduring Freedom Veterans for [John] Kerry\" at an event for the then-presidential candidate. In a technical sense, this was not a lie: Walz had mobilized to Europe that year to provide base security, a mission characterized as \"in support of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the overarching name of the post-9/11 anti-terrorism mission. At the time, Kerry's own service record in Vietnam was under attack -- and his criticism of then-President Bush's prosecution of the Iraq War led some to question Kerry's patriotism.\n\nThe takeaway of \"Enduring Freedom Veterans for Kerry\" was clear: attacks on Kerry were baseless; war veterans who put their lives on the line overseas had Kerry's back. Walz encouraged this deceptive picture, albeit without telling an outright lie himself. Edging up to that line may have had political upside for Walz, but it came with risks too. In 2009, National Guard veterans filmed themselves questioning his congressional staff about Walz's remarks tying his service to Operation Enduring Freedom, arguing the implication he served in Afghanistan violated the Stolen Valor Act of 2005.\n\nLying about your service, or falsely claiming experiences or awards not received, is the fastest way to become persona non grata in other veterans' eyes. Yet the mortal sin of stolen valor can become blurred by the natural tendency to embellish. There's a reason veterans joke about \"no shit, there I was...\" tales that get a bit further from the truth with each retelling. That line comes into sharp focus when stakes are considered: bending the truth for a laugh over beers is one thing; claiming undeserved credibility, that others earned at great personal expense, is another.\n\nThis habit of encouraging a false impression of his service continued when Walz decided to run for Minnesota governor. In Congress, Walz struck a more moderate tone for a Democrat, earning an \"A\" rating from the National Rifle Association in the four cycles leading up to his 2018 gubernatorial run. It wasn't until after the Parkland school shooting that year that Walz reversed his pro-gun stance, pivoting in support of an assault weapons ban by arguing, \"those weapons of war, that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\"\n\nWalz's defenders argue he spoke too quickly, that a pause was missed and he meant to say, \"those weapons of war, that I carried -- in war is the only place where those weapons are at.\" The less charitable read is that Walz claimed, \"I carried [weapons] in war.\" It's a critical distinction, and frankly arguable. What's inarguable is that Walz used his authority as a military veteran to argue for an assault weapons ban, encouraging listeners to confer on his stance a battle-born credibility he never earned.\n\nWalz owes it to his fellow veterans, and the voting public, to fully clarify these remarks and apologize for any false impressions of combat service. The absence of such a clarification, along with Walz's lesser mischaracterizing his retirement rank, has stoked angry accusations of stolen valor from the right. I don't think this issue is as neatly cut-and-dried as some claim, but if the parties were reversed there is no doubt that every liberal pundit praising Walz's service today would be eviscerating a Republican with a similar record for stolen valor.\n\nAnd therein lies the rub. Service members swear an oath to the Constitution. We served the nation, not a party, but when service gets dragged into partisan politics, there is no patience for accurate appraisals. Walz put himself in this position by playing fast and loose with his service record, encouraging a misimpression of his record to further his political career. But training fire on his otherwise respectable service gives Walz a pass on his shapeshifting political beliefs and burnishes the moderate image Kamala Harris needs him to project.", "source": {"uri":

As noted by CNN, it was two months after Walz retired in 2005 to run for Congress when his former unit received orders to deploy. Nevertheless, right-wing commentators have insisted on pushing the baseless claim, as Media Matters for America pointed out.\n\nThe criticism of Walz's record didn't go over well with some veterans groups.

Vance knows, as a corporal, that you don't become a sergeant major just because you're willing to put on the uniform and put the flag of this country on your shoulders and promise to defend it against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\"\n\nMoore, a combat veteran who deployed to Afghanistan in 2005 as a captain, argued that, especially as a veteran himself, Vance should \"respect Walz and anyone who is willing to put their hand up and put on the uniform of this country.\"\n\n\"He's a person who believes in patriotism, who believes in the goodness of the American people,\" Moore said, referring to Walz. \"He believes in the goodness of the documents that govern us and under which we have served.\"\n\nMoores' comments came in response to remarks by Vance at a campaign event in Shelby Township, Michigan, this morning, when he cast doubt on Walzs' military service by accusing him of resigning shortly before his unit was to deploy to Iraq.\n\nWell, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you in a war? When was it, what was that weapon that you took to war, given that you abandoned your unit right before they went to Iraq? Vance said. And he didn't spend a single day in a combat zone? What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen bravery, don't pretend to be something you're not.\n\nHarris' campaign also defended Walzs against Republican attacks on his military service. She pointed out that his military career included specializing in heavy artillery, awards for marksmanship and hand grenade handling, responding to tornadoes, participating in flood control and months of active duty in Italy. In Congress, Walz has also championed increased funding for the military and mental health resources for veterans.\n\nAfter 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform and as Vice President, he will continue to be a tireless advocate for our veterans and military families, said Lauren Hitt, a spokeswoman for the Harris-Walz campaign, in a statement.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Moore", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wes Moore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Mitchell_Reports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrea Mitchell Reports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Nor should voters remain silent when politicians lie about a crucial aspect of their service so as to advance a political agenda hostile to freedom.\n\nIn a 31-second clip posted to the social media platform X on Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, whom Vice President and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris chose as her running mate, further exposed himself as a radical leftist tyrant while at the same time exhibiting a shocking indifference to truth that one can only explain as either ignorance or dishonesty.\n\n\"I spent 25 years in the Army, and I hunt,\" Walz said.\n\nVeteran observers of leftist politicians undoubtedly know what came next without seeing or hearing it. After all, a reference to hunting by an elected Democrat invariably signals an impending plea for gun control.\n\n\"I've been voting for common-sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment. But we can do background checks. We could do CDC research. We could make sure, we don't have reciprocal carry among states,\" he said.\n\nNote the not-so-subtle connection between hunting and the Second Amendment, as if the Founding Fathers enshrined the right to bear arms in the Constitution for sporting purposes rather than the purpose of checking a tyrannical government filled with the likes of Walz.\n\nThen came the crowning absurdity.\n\n\"And we can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at,\" Walz awkwardly said.\n\nSince Tuesday, Walz has come under increasing scrutiny over both his military service and his subsequent characterizations of said service.\n\nFor instance, a former squad mate in the Minnesota Army National Guard has accused Walz of cowardice for skipping out on deployment to the Iraq War and thereby abandoning his men.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, an Iraq War veteran and former President Donald Trump's running mate, expressed outrage.\n\n\"You know what really bothers me about Tim Walz?\" Vance wrote on X. \"When the US Marine Corps asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it. When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him. I think that's shameful.\"\n\nTo say the least, Walz's \"weapons of war\" comment will not help his case.\n\nFor one thing, the Minnesota governor never carried a weapon in war because he never went to war. But even that does not reflect the full measure of his ignorance or dishonesty.\n\nBy \"weapons of war,\" Walz almost certainly meant the AR-15 -- the great leftist bugbear. But he did not tell the truth.\n\nIn fact, in 2022 GunMag Warehouse published an overview of arms used on the battlefield in Iraq. Walz, of course, was nowhere near Iraq, but had he been there he surely would have carried one of these weapons.\n\nThe overview highlighted eight different weapons systems, headed by the M4/M4A1 and the M16A2. Of course, it made no mention of the AR-15 because the AR-15 does not qualify as a \"weapon of war.\"\n\nAs a semi-automatic firearm, the AR-15 differs markedly from the fully automatic M4 and M16. The latter almost never come into the possession of civilians.\n\n\"To purchase a fully-automatic firearm requires an extensive FBI background check including fingerprints and photographs, as well as registration of the firearm at the federal level,\" per the NRA-ILA.\n\nWalz, therefore, has either an ignorance problem or a dishonesty problem. For one thing, he did not go to war. And even if he had, he would not have carried the weapon he and his fellow leftist radicals so desperately want to rip from the hands of law-abiding citizens -- something only tyrants would do.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_schwarz@westernjournal.com", "name": "Michael Schwarz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Second Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AR-15\u2013style_rifle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AR-15\u2013style rifle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

He served with the 1/125th Field Artillery Battalion. Though he obtained the rank of Command Sergeant Major, in 2005 he was reduced to Master Sergeant for failing to complete the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nPriorities.\n\nAfter Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz as her running mate on August 6, an article in Red State by Matt Funicello revealed a disconcerting twist to Walz' claims of National Guard service. He reportedly received a conditional appointment to Command Sergeant Major but was demoted due to a failure to complete requirements. But he left his unit without a senior command person as they were to be deployed to a war zone. He claimed it was because he was planning to \"run for Congress.\"\n\nIn a 2018 letter in the West Central Tribune from Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrens (Ret) and Command Sergeant Major Paul Herr (Ret), reported that Tim Walz left the service when he knew that his unit was being deployed to Iraq. Walz was never deployed to a combat unit.\n\n\"The 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion was deployed for 22 months in 2006 - 2007. During this time, they were restricted by Army regulations and could not speak out against a candidate for office. In November 2006 he was elected to the House of Representatives. He claims to be the highest-ranking enlisted service member ever to serve in congress. Even though he was conditionally promoted to Command Sergeant Major less than eight months, quit before his obligations were met, and was reduced to Master Sergeant for retirement. Yes, he served at that rank, but was never qualified at that rank, and will receive retirement benefits at one rank below. You be the judge.\n\nOn November 1st, 2006, Tom Hagen, Iraq War Veteran, wrote a letter to the editor of the Winona Daily News. Here are a couple of sentences from the letter: But even more disturbing is the fact that Walz quickly retired after learning that his unit -southern Minnesota's 1-125 FA Battalion - would be sent to Iraq. For Tim Walz to abandon his fellow soldiers and quit when they needed experienced leadership most is disheartening.\" West Central Tribune paid opinion piece\n\nThis is the left-wing person Harris chose as her running mate.

Tim Walz and his military service, Mediaite reported.\n\nWalz has come under criticism that he had embellished his record in the Minnesota National Guard when it was discovered that he did not obtain the rank of sergeant major at the time of his retirement, a claim that is listed on his official biography.\n\nWhen asked by host John Berman if the Harris campaign needed to address the discrepancy in a bigger way, Jones replied, \"Yeah, I think that they should clean it up.\n\n\"It's conceivable that he's been loose with his language or said stuff that doesn't, that's not, I mean, there's -- people are human beings on these campaign trails and so. But now he's running for a major position.\n\n\"If he needs to clean it up, clean it up. The reality is, if he said one or two things or said some things that turned out to be maybe a little bit sloppy, fix it, because he's got a gazillion people who are willing to stand up for his character,\" he said.\n\nWalz came under scrutiny a second time when it was implied that he had seen time in a war zone even though he retired prior to his battalion's deployment to Iraq.\n\nDuring his 2018 campaign for governor, Walz made a pitch to ban assault weapons when he told a crowd, \"We can research the impacts of gun violence. We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" implying that he had served in combat.\n\nWalz's contradictory statements were snatched up by Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance, who accused the Minnesota governor of \"stolen valor garbage.\"\n\n\"Do not pretend to be something that you're not,\" Vance said during a campaign event in Michigan on Wednesday. \"I'd be ashamed if I was saying that I lied about my military service like you did.\"\n\nVance advised the Democrats to call upon people who have known Walz for years to vouch for his character and move past the military service dispute.\n\n\"He's got gay students who are willing to stand up for his character. He's got people he's served with who's willing to stand up for his character.\n\n\"If this comes down to a character contest between this ticket and Donald Trump, we're going to win 50 states.

She's new! She's historic! The media are protecting her incompetency by not asking questions! Eventually, though, this exuberance would settle down. There's also the availability of alternative media to do what the corporate media refuses -- vet Harris and her failed, extremist record. Best of all, Trump is not John McCain or Mitt Romney. He will not allow the corporate media to intimidate him from telling inconvenient truths about the Harris/Walz ticket in the way McCain and Romney were intimidated by fake fact checks and phony media allegations of racism.\n\nThe latest polls do not take into account the revelations about Democrat vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz's (MN) questionable service record. Veterans who served in the Minnesota National Guard with Walz are making credible allegations of stolen valor against the Democrat Minnesota governor.\n\nWalz has repeatedly claimed he went to \"war.\" He didn't. When his unit was warned about being called up to Iraq, Walz suddenly decided to retire and run for Congress. On Wednesday, the Minnesota National Guard also confirmed Walz's official bio inflated his rank.\n\nA statement this week from Army Lt. Col. Kristen Aug\u00e9, Minnesota National Guard's State Public Affairs Officer, said:\n\nGovernor Tim Walz served from April 8, 1981, to May 16, 2005. Governor Walz served in the Minnesota National Guard's 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery after transferring from the Nebraska National Guard in 1996. While serving in Minnesota, his military occupational specialties were 13B - a cannon crewmember who operates and maintains cannons and 13Z -field artillery senior sergeant. In Nebraska, he served as a 11Z - infantry senior sergeant, and a 71L - administrative specialist. He held multiple positions within field artillery such as firing battery chief, operations sergeant, first sergeant, and culminated his career serving as the command sergeant major for the battalion. He retired as a master sergeant in 2005 for benefit purposes because he did not complete additional coursework at the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nStolen valor is the kind of sin that cuts across party lines. Rather than explain himself, Walz is dodging the question.

Tim Walz.\n\nHe's back again to wage a public war of words against Walz. This is what his grain bin looked like in the 2018 election:\n\n\"He abandoned us. What the hell kind of leader does that? As soon as the shots were fired in Iraq, he turned and ran the other way and hung his hat up and quit,\" Behrends said.\n\nThis all starts years ago, when Behrends says Walz's misleading statements about his military service first led him to come forward in the fall of 2018. The story was largely ignored and Minnesota's largest newspaper, the Star Tribune, checked it out but decided not to publish, according to Behrends.\n\n\"When the reporter called, I thought, 'What the hell, is this North Korea?'\" Behrends recalled. Alpha News reached out to the Star Tribune but didn't receive a response.\n\nThe backstory\n\nBack in early 2005, a warning order went out to southern Minnesota's First Battalion-125th Field Artillery to mobilize for a mission to Iraq, Behrends said. Walz served as the unit's highest non-commissioned officer after he was conditionally promoted to command sergeant major on April 1, 2005, records show. On May 16, Walz retired from the guard, avoided the deployment, and ran for Congress.\n\nWalz has implied in previous statements that he didn't retire because of the deployment, but National Guard records show his service obligation wasn't complete until September 2007.\n\nBehrends was next in line for the position and was asked to take his place.\n\n\"I was like well, for Pete's sake, if this guy quits, if I say I'm not going to do it, I mean, what the hell kind of leadership is that?\" Behrends recalled. \"If a company would say we're going to deploy to Iraq and the foreman says, 'I'm not going,' what does that say to the 500 that work in that factory?\"\n\nCommand Sergeant Major Behrends went on to serve in Iraq on a nearly two-year deployment, all while Walz began using that very title as a congressman.\n\nBehrends said he contacted Walz with his concerns before raising the issue publicly, sending letters to Washington in 2016. The letters all went unanswered, Behrends said.\n\nBehrends again tried to draw attention to the story in 2018 when Congressman Walz announced his run for governor.\n\n\"It kind of just sat there, you know, when he was a congressman. He bragged that he was a retired command sergeant major and the highest-ranking person ever in the House,\" Behrends recalled.\n\n\"Then, the state of Minnesota came out after 2018 after this was exposed and they said, 'Well, he can say that he served as a command sergeant major, but he can't say he's a retired one because he's not,'\" he added.\n\n\"He was saying that and there were campaign letters coming in the mail saying that. They said, right on there, he's a retired command sergeant major. Just tooting his own horn, hanging on the coattails of people that actually are command sergeant majors that went through all the process and put all the time in,\" Behrends said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Minnesota National Guard previously said Walz wasn't able to retire as a command sergeant major since he failed to complete coursework and other requirements related to the rank.\n\nDocuments show the Army corrected Walz's service record. He was reduced in rank to an E-8 master sergeant after retirement.\n\n\"It's stolen valor is really what it is. I don't know of anybody else that's done what he's done,\" Behrends said.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump says he is thrilled Vice President Kamala Harris announced her VP pick as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\n\"THANK YOU!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Tuesday.\n\n...\n\nThe Trump team immediately launched into attacking the Minnesota governor after the Harris team's announcement, ripping him for his \"far-left\" record dealing with his home state's stances on immigration, gender, COVID-19 and the riots after the death of George Floyd.\n\n\"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are two open-borders, weak-on-crime, defund-the-police liberals who make up the most radical, far-left ticket in the history of our country,\" Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley wrote in a statement.\n\n\"Walz supports illegal immigration, has called cops racist, put violent criminals back on the street, and in 2020, let rioters burn the Twin Cities while Kamala stepped in to fundraise for their bail.\"\n\nTrump adviser Brian Hughes said, \"By picking Tim Walz as her running mate, Kamala Harris not only bent the knee to the radical left, she doubled down on her dangerously liberal, weak, and failed agenda.", "source": {"uri": "acecomments.mu.nu", "dataType": "news", "title": "acecomments.mu.nu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz",

Tim Walz, who is Kamala Harris's pick for her vice-presidential running mate, has been lying for years and claiming that he served in war in the U.S. military in Iraq when he absolutely did not.\n\nHe has also variously claimed he retired as a Sgt. Major and that he carried a weapon \"in war.\" Both are lies.\n\nThe media -- and the Harris campaign -- has facilitated these lies for years and have allowed Walz to make these false claims without correction... until today. Today the media is quietly going back into past stories and \"correcting\" them without leaving notes to readers that the \"corrections\" have been made.\n\nIn any case, the first video clip posted to X by the Harris campaign to be highlighted is his claim that he carried a weapon while serving in a war. His claim is a flat-out lie.\n\n\"I spent 25 years in the Army, and I hunt ... I've been voting for common-sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can do CDC research ... We can make sure that those weapons of war that I carried in war is the only place where those weapons are at,\" he said in the video.\n\nTim Walz's official record shows that he served in the Minnesota National Guard for 24 years, then suddenly retired just as his unit was designated for a tour in Iraq. He served in Europe, but never in a war zone. Never even near one.\n\nThe website Stolen Valor accused Walz of pretending to be a warrior and falsely claiming to have served at war.\n\nIn his recent re-election campaign, Walz also claimed to have retired as a Sergeant Major. But in fact he never got any higher than master sergeant, or an E-8. His rant of Master Sgt. was never finalized as he did not complete all the requirements necessary to attain the rank.\n\nMeanwhile, right after Walz was announced as Harris' VP pick, all the lamestream media outlets rushed to note that Walz is a veteran who went to war. And all of them were caught in the lie. Then, they made stealth edits to their stories when the truth was revealed.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Bloomberg, CNN, and a host of other fake news outlets reported Walz's lies as if it was all true only to quietly change their stories later without telling readers and viewers that the changes were made.\n\nThe media won't tell you any of this.

Bob Menendez was plagued with scandals for years and managed to get reelected. He literally had to be caught with Egyptian gold bars and be tried and convicted before he resigned from the Senate.\n\nShamelessness is a superpower.\n\nBut Minnesota Governor Tim Walz's rollout as Harris' Vice Presidential pick is a special case because Walz is just being introduced to the country, and if the controversy over his outright lies--and yes, they are lies--about his service in the Minnesota National Guard gain traction, any benefit Harris thought she would get from picking him might evaporate entirely.\n\nIt will evaporate entirely. Stealing valor is a very big deal and goes to character. And given that Walz's only benefit to Harris is that he at first seems to be an avuncular Midwestern dad (a facade), being revealed as a liar boasting about serving in war could be devastating.\n\nBoth Beege and I wrote about this story yesterday, and while it isn't clear yet how much traction the story will get in the mainstream media, a subject so touchy with people is bound to have legs. War veterans will not be happy that a man running for Vice President abandoned his comrades before a deployment, lied about his rank, and claimed to have served in Iraq when he did not.\n\nHe was even demoted from the rank he claimed. He has been bragging for years that he was the highest-ranking enlisted man to ever serve in Congress, and it was all a lie.\n\nWalz also used his fake service in Iraq as a hook for promoting gun control. He claimed to have served in combat with an assault rifle, but in reality, he got a notice that he would deploy and scooted before he could be sent to war. He abandoned his comrades in arms, and many of them are pissed and ready to talk about it.\n\nNot having served, I can't say what it would feel like to a combat veteran to have one's valor stolen, but I would have to think that the first reaction would be disgust and contempt.\n\nThis will be devastating because it hits at Walz's supposed strength--being an avuncular Midwestern dad who everybody (supposedly) looks up to.\n\nA secret like this should have been vetted, discussed, strategized about, and Walz should have been discarded from consideration. It is at least a near-fatal wound, even if it will take a while to percolate into the public consciousness.\n\nThe chances that Kamala Harris dumps Walz for a safer choice hover around zero, but then again, so were the chances that Harris would be the nominee this year until June. Weird stuff happens.\n\nWalz will likely try to hang on until the story dies down, and the mainstream media will try to cover for him, accepting excuses like he \"misspoke\" or some other bulls**t like that. That has already been trotted out, but Walz has been peddling this story for two decades and it has been featured in profiles of him over the years. It is part of his stump speeches, so no \"misspoke;\" he is just a younger Joe Biden with a Midwest twang.\n\nIronic.\n\nThe problem Walz has is that his peer in the race IS a combat veteran who deployed to Iraq, and any BS about Vance not being a soldier isn't going to cut it. He was on the ground in a war zone, and combat veterans understand that even if many people don't understand MOSes. I'm certainly no expert on them either, but I do know that even truck drivers in Iraq took fire and are combat veterans in my book.\n\nThank you for your service, by the way! I was too old, too fat, and way too wimpy to serve. I am serious, however screwed you were by the government, and know you did a very brave and good thing. Americans are grateful to you, if not the politicians who got people killed and are watching Iraq begin the process to legalize child marriage.\n\nVeterans are now posting photos of their time (or their relatives') serving in a combat zone, and that trend will continue as people who went when sent express their rage at the coward who bailed to avoid going to Iraq.\n\nIt won't stop anytime soon, and the election is SOON.\n\nThere is a lot more to come out about just how big a fraud Tim Walz is, but of all the critiques, I think this one will stick the most. It, along with his failures during the George Floyd riot, hit people on an emotional level, and there are lots of people willing to talk about the issues in a compelling way.\n\nTim Walz is a fraud, and I suspect that this will sink in even in the shortened campaign season. It may not cost him his spot on the ticket--how much chaos can the Democrats survive?--but it will have a devastating impact on a significant demographic. A demographic that votes, which understands the issue, has strong feelings about it, and will be happy to wallop Walz on it.\n\nDemocrats do have grasstops organizations of committed Democrat veterans, so expect a lot of pushback on this. But this is hard to defend, too difficult to spin, and hits right where Tim Walz was supposed to help Harris.\n\nExpect to see a lot more about this over the next few months and a nasty exchange at the Vice Presidential debate.\n\nPITCH: You have heard about how Elon Musk is suing GARM because of their advertising bans on conservative sites.

Yet, on Wednesday, NewsNation host Leland Vittert interviewed a member of the National Guard put forward by the Harris/Walz campaign and upended their defense with Walz's own misleading words about his service. Ultimately getting the campaign's own expert to denounce what Walz said.\n\nRetired Army National Guard Sergeant Major Joseph Eustice served with Waltz in the Minnesota National Guard for many years, up until his sudden retirement, nearly two months before the unit got the order they'd be getting deployed to Iraq.\n\nEustice had defended Walz claiming, \"The Governor fulfilled his duty. He was a great soldier when he chose to leave he had every right to leave.\" He claimed that there were only \"rumors\" of potential deployment were not substantial and his leaving.\n\nA press release found on Walz' congressional website from 2005 states that the candidate knew as of March 17th of that year that there would be a possible mobilization of nearly 2,000 members of the Minnesota National Guard. These were more than rumors and as a Command Sergeant Major, Tim Walz would have been very aware of an imminent deployment.\n\nVittert then questioned Eustice on the controversial video of Walz claiming to have seen combat, a video which the Sergeant Major had not seen previous to his endorsement of the Harris/Walz ticket:\n\nVITTERT: The second question here is I think a little bit more poignant, which is that oftentimes and there was that video, actually, that the Kamala Harris campaign put out. Where he sure makes it sound like he was in combat, which is something that he never was in. And there's these accusations. Now the line is stolen valor. There are men who were in combat. There were men who didn't come home. There were men who were wounded. To say you were there when you weren't, it just isn't right. How do you come down on that?\n\nEUSTICE: Well, I hadn't heard that he had said that until today. Now., from my perspective, you shouldn't say when you don't, you shouldn't say you used weapons in war when you did not. I do know that our politicians do tend to say things that get embellished or they embellish themselves. And you know I think it is wrong to say you've done something that you didn't do.

(Getty/Canva)\n\nTim Walz had some choice words for the Republican critics condemning his progressive policies as governor of Minnesota. Republicans are also scrutinising Walz's military record, and have coined a disparaging nickname, \"Tampon Tim\", due to a law he oversaw providing free menstrual products in schools.\n\nWalz was named as Kamala Harris' running mate in the race for the White House on Tuesday (6 August). He has been in the governor's mansion since 2019, implementing several progressive policies over his political career - including turning the state into a haven for transgender Americans looking to flee Republican-controlled states.\n\nThis has made him a target for right-wing, anti-LGBTQ+ politicians and pundits, particularly for his efforts to ensure that young women, girls and non-binary people are given access to essential sanitary products such as tampons. Also, in March 2023, he signed a bill to provide free school meals for Minnesota students at participating schools, regardless of their family's income.\n\nWhen confronted about the backlash, in an interview on CNN's State of the Union, and being asked whether his history would fuel attacks and accusations that he is a \"government liberal,\" Walz replied sarcastically: \"What a monster. Kids are eating and having full bellies so they can go learn, and women are making their own healthcare decisions.\n\n\"They're gonna label whatever they're gonna label. [Donald Trump] is gonna roll it out, mispronounce names, try [to] make the case. The fact of the matter is that if you look at the policies that vice-president Harris was involved in making ... quality of life is higher, the economies are better, all of those things.\n\n\"If that's what they want to label me, I'm more than happy to take the label.\"\n\nConservatives are also poring over Walz's time in the military. Trump's running mate JD Vance, an Iraq War veteran, decided to target his record on Wednesday (7 August).\n\nVance, 40, deployed to Iraq in 2005, as a military journalist. He did not experience combat.\n\nWalz served in both the Nebraska and Minnesota Army National Guards, earning medals and reaching the rank of command sergeant major. However Vance and others have questioned whether Walz retired to avoid a 2005 deployment to Iraq.\n\nSpeaking in Michigan, Vance said: \"When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go without him.\"\n\nTim Walz has been described as a \"great governor\" with a \"great heart.\" The small-town Nebraska native's track record on LGBTQ+ rights includes turning Minnesota into a transgender refuge with a bill that aimed to block out-of-state subpoenas that forced families with trans kids back into hostile states.\n\nIn addition, he supported the same-sex marriage as long ago as 2006, after starting his political career in a Republican-leaning district.\n\nCongresswoman Angie Craig said: \"It wasn't a popular position at the time for a red-district Democrat. It didn't score him any political points. But he stood up for families like mine because he believed it was the right thing to do.\"\n\nFellow Democrat Craig added: \"His bravery made a difference in my life and the lives of thousands of Minnesotans, and it's a bravery that would make our country better.\"\n\nShare your thoughts!

As you know, with your contact with the military, I know from coming from a military family, there is a difference between being in a combat area, being involved in a time of war, and actually being in a position where people are shooting at you. There is no evidence that any time that Governor Walz was in the position of being shot at and some of his language could easily be seen to suggest that he was.\"\n\nOne video clip that raised the question was actually posted to X by Kamala Harris' campaign -- largely because it showcased Walz attempting to parlay his military service into a call for an assault weapons ban and increased gun control measures. But the way he did so raised eyebrows, because he appeared to claim he had actually carried such a weapon into an active war zone.\n\nWATCH BEN SHAPIRO'S 'SCAMALA: KAMALA HARRIS UNMASKED' ON DAILYWIRE+\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt,\" Walz said at a campaign event. \"I've been voting for common sense legislation that protects the Second Amendment, but we can do background checks. We can do CDC ... We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are carried.\"\n\nJim LaPorta offered a quick fact check on Walz's claims in just that brief clip, saying, \"Quick fact check: No, Gov. Walz did not spend 25 years in the Army, it's 24 years, 1 month and 9 days. No, he did not carry a weapon of war in war. In 2003, he deployed to Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\"\n\nDespite the apparent willingness to ask a few questions of Walz, legacy media writ large does not appear concerned that Harris -- the presidential candidate herself -- rose to the top of the Democratic ticket without earning a single primary vote on her own and has gone over two weeks without taking an interview or even a single hard question.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapons_legislation_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assault weapons legislation in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Background_check", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Background check"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://dw-wp-production.imgix.net/2024/08/GettyImages-2165247250.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

J.D. Vance's evidence-free accusation that his Democratic counterpart, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, dodged serving in the Iraq War has earned not only fact-checks but condemnation by veterans groups and former Vice President Mike Pence's one-time chief of staff.\n\nWhile in Michigan on Wednesday, Vance claimed that Walz -- who served in his home state's national guard for 24 years and deployed to Italy as part of the U.S. war in Afghanistan before retiring in 2005 -- abandoned his unit, and even asserted that Walz had \"stolen valor.\" The attack had been used against Walz in both his 2018 and 2022 gubernatorial campaigns, which he won.\n\nSeveral publications soon corrected the record. As noted by CNN, it was two months after Walz retired in 2005 to run for Congress when his former unit received orders to deploy. Nevertheless, right-wing commentators have insisted on pushing the baseless claim, as Media Matters for America pointed out.\n\nThe criticism of Walz's record didn't go over well with some veterans groups. VoteVets, a progressive veterans advocacy group, promptly fired back at Vance, a Marine who deployed to Iraq once for about six months.\n\n\"JD Vance attacking another Veteran holds no honor and no semblance of reality. This is a blatant, baseless, and abhorrent attack. Shame on him,\" the group wrote on X, followed shortly by a \"fiction versus facts\" graphic reiterating what CNN and others had fact-checked.\n\nThat sentiment was echoed later by Marc Short, the former chief of staff to Pence, whose one-time job Vance hopes to attain.\n\nShort, appearing on MSNBC's Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart Reports Wednesday morning, doubted the strength of Vance's line of criticism.\n\n\"J.D. Vance served in the Marines. He's entitled to make that attack. But I do think that in the last three weeks, there has been an enormous upheaval in all of this and the polls. But prior to Biden withdrawing, one of the biggest vulnerabilities for Democrats was the border and the economy, and I think that's still the case,\" he said.\n\n\"I think that, unfortunately, much of the Trump campaign continues to be personal, whether or not it is questioning Kamala Harris' heritage, or this attack, or frankly going to Georgia and deciding to attack a very popular Republican governor,\" he continued.\n\n\"So, I think that Harris and Walz have enormous vulnerabilities in their records in the progressive positions they have taken, and I think a policy attack would be more effective than the personal attacks that have been transpiring.\"\n\nVance's claim that Walz was \"dishonest\" about his service also spurred a response from the Harris-Walz campaign.\n\n\"In his 24 years of service, the Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,\" a spokesperson told CNN. \"Governor Walz would never insult or undermine any American's service to this country - in fact, he thanks Senator Vance for putting his life on the line for our country.

Tim Walz, nicknamed #TamponTim on social media, was confronted about allegations of stolen valor by reporters after a gathering in Wisconsin. Instead of addressing the allegations, he simply ignored the question. When asked again, he appeared to flee as fast as he possibly could.\n\nAs we and others reported, Walz left the National Guard when his unit was set to deploy to Iraq.\n\nHie Republican opponent, J.D. Vance, took him to task:\n\nWhen Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq, you know what he did? He dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him, a fact that he's been criticized for aggressively by a lot of the people that he served with. I think it's shameful to prepare your unit to go to Iraq, to make a promise that you're going to follow through and then to drop out right before you actually have to go.\n\nBut it gets worse. Breitbart reported that Walz falsely claimed in 2006 that he had served in Afghanistan. Walz even claimed he served in combat:\n\nBut in 2018, he admitted in an interview with MPR News that he never served in combat, telling the outlet that he had \"got far more out of the military\" than \"they got out of\" him.\n\nGive a middle finger to unaccountable global censors and big tech fascists.

When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq ... he dropped out of the Army,\" Vance said.\n\nKinzinger, an Air Force veteran, downplayed Vance's service in an effort to run defense for Walz: \"Ok. JD served honorably, but he wasn't kicking down doors. He was in public affairs. Which again, is fine and honorable. Tim, after he was eligible for retirement, retired. People do that. If it was a real problem he would have been 'stop lossed' and prevented from retiring.\"\n\nJones made it clear that he was not impressed, firing back at Kinzinger, \"I sat behind a 50 cal machine gun in Iraq on roads littered with IEDs. I walked around Afghanistan taking IEDs apart by hand. In Iraq and Afghanistan even pencil pushers were vulnerable to rockets and mortars landing on their heads (see Al Asad this week),\" he said. \"A chow hall at that very same base was hit in 2007 just before I got there.\"\n\n\"I lost more than one buddy to friendly fire in Afghanistan from foreign nationals on a secured base.

Beto O'Rourke, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and Walz were also in attendance.\n\nWalz, who had claimed he carried a 'weapon of war' during 'war' has been criticized of embellishing his military service record. He never served in a combat zone. He served in an artillery unit of the Minnesota National Guard, but he was deployed for a short time to Italy during the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nIn the photo posted by New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, Walz is wearing a hat bearing the U.S. Army Special Forces crest. Walz was never a member of the Special Forces. To the outside, wearing a hat in support of such a prestigious organization could be seen as a kind gesture, within military veteran circles, it is frowned upon.\n\nIt is frowned upon because it misleads people into thinking that person served with the special forces.\n\n\"Walz is falsely wearing the crest my husband earned. Walz was never Special Forces, another lie. Lying about his rank & combat wasn't enough. Stolen Valor Walz,\" said one woman on X.\n\n\"Hey @Tim_Walz , this you? Do you often wear our crest even though you were only National Guard with zero deployments, never went through SFAS or the Q course, and by all accounts never even worked with Special Forces?\" asked a U.S. Army Green Beret.\n\n\"As a 20+ year veteran Tim Walz knows how offensive it is for someone to wear the insignia of a unit they weren't a part of - especially the 1st Special Forces Command (Airborne). Time for an apology and promise never to do it again. Shame on you Walz.\" another veteran commented.\n\nShortly after Governor Murphy posted the photo, more photos of Walz wearing the Special Forces crest emerged.\n\nMore photos show that Walz routinely wears the Special Forces crescent.\n\nAccording to Walz's own claims, he never served in the U.S. Army Special Forces.\n\nThat's not the end of this story. Another question left unanswered today is why Walz was at the concert.

Mark Kelly, took to X to rail against Donald Trump's running mate after Vance had a lengthy takedown of Walz on the campaign trail. He accused Kamala Harris's running mate of having \"abandoned\" his unit in 2005 ahead of a planned deployment to Iraq and instead opted to run for Congress.\n\n\"He has not spent a day in a combat zone,\" Vance said. \"What bothers me about Tim Walz is the stolen valor garbage. Do not pretend to be something that you're not.\"\n\nScott Kelly clapped back:\n\n\"You know what really bothers me @JDVance, is when you attack a fellow veterans military service. I respect your service and the service of @GovTimWalz and all of those honorably discharged. He was eligible for retirement after 24 years and submitted his retirement paperwork before his unit received orders (or even warning orders) to deploy and then he continued his service as a member of congress,\" Scott Kelly said.\n\nHe continued: \"If they needed him to stay in his unit there is a mechanism called, \"stop-loss.\" Look it up. As a corporal with 4yrs of service, I highly doubt the USMC, \"asked,\" you to go to Iraq. They most likely, \"ordered\" you to go to Iraq and had you refused, you would have been thrown in the brig. Release your military record to prove the USMC, \"asked\" you to go. \"Raise your hand if you want to go to Iraq.\" It's laughable to those of us who have served. If you win, you are next in line to be Commander in Chief and need to earn the respect of all who serve, and this is not how you do it.\"\n\nAnother veteran, Secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg, also jumped into the fray to defend Walz.\n\n\"Come to think of it, denigrating the worth of a soldier's service based on whether he deployed to a war zone is... kind of like denigrating the worth of a woman's citizenship based on whether she happens to have children,\" he wrote on X.\n\nVance is a former Marine who was deployed to Iraq.\n\nNPR's Quil Lawrence, who covers national security, climate and veterans' issues nationwide, reported Vance worked as a \"civil affairs Marine\" who helped escort journalists around the wartorn country. He noted Vance has been careful not to say he served in a combat role.\n\n\"There's a civilian-military divide in this country and very people have firsthand experience, or even family experience, of military service, and I think most veterans, they really don't care what role you had with the proviso that at long as you're not bragging about doing something that you didn't do. And he hasn't done that,\" Lawrence said.\n\n\"He was in Iraq in a very tough year in Iraq. I can tell you, personally, that it was a very violent year and a lot of the combat in Iraq and Afghanistan wasn't really any sort of a frontline combat gunfight,\" he said. \"It was convoys getting blown up and mortars dropping anywhere on anyone, so I think veterans give Vance credit for going and as he says, serving honorably. And he has not been saying that he did anything other than what he did, which was go over and serve honorably.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, avoided service in the Vietnam War through student and medical deferments.\n\nHe said he got a medical deferment for a bone spur in a foot, but could not remember which foot when he talked about it in 2015. He added that he did not serve because he \"was not a big fan of the Vietnam War. I wasn't a protester, but the Vietnam War was a disaster for our country.\"", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Kelly_(astronaut)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scott Kelly (astronaut)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(United_States_O-3)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Captain (United States O-3)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_discharge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military discharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortar (weapon)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convoy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Convoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/WXHSE5HKHVA7LP7DHHXXDDI45Y.jpg?auth=74ddca441a4348cd96b97e5cf9be0bfe5e9529e67a69ca0c21e5a3d296e64a46&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Bush shortly before the 2004 election coincided with Walz's homecoming to Mankato, Minnesota. A high school teacher and football coach, he had left to serve overseas in Operation Enduring Freedom. Southern Minnesota is home to a large Guard contingent that includes Walz's unit, the First 125th Field Artillery Battalion, so the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are naturally a pressing local concern -- particularly to high school students headed into the armed services.\n\nSchachtel made two great points. Did Green omit the fact that Walz didn't serve overseas in Operation Enduring Freedom? Did Walz lie to Green about it?\n\nWell, Green probably answered the question later in the article when then-President George Bush showed up in Walz's hometown where he was protesting (emphasis mine):\n\nThe president's visit struck Walz as a teachable moment, and he and two students boarded a Bush campaign bus that took them to a quarry where the president was to speak. But after they had passed through a metal detector and their tickets and IDs were checked, they were denied admittance and ordered back onto the bus. One of the boys had a John Kerry sticker on his wallet.\n\nIndignant, Walz refused. \"As a soldier, I told them I had a right to see my commander-in-chief,\" the normally jovial forty-one-year-old recently explained to a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party dinner in the small town of Albert Lea, Minnesota.\n\nHis challenge prompted a KGB-style interrogation that was sadly characteristic of Bush campaign events. Do you support the president? Walz refused to answer. Do you oppose the president? Walz replied that it was no one's business but his own. (He later learned that his wife was informed that the Secret Service might arrest him.) Walz thought for a moment and asked the Bush staffers if they really wanted to arrest a command sergeant major who'd just returned from fighting the war on terrorism.\n\nGreen answered on Twitter, but we are left with more questions.", "source": {"uri": "legalinsurrection.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mechastain@legalinsurrection.com", "name": "mechastain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Tim Walz's former military comrades delivered a stunning condemnation of his actions and behavior - just days before he was elected to the first term of his current post in 2018. And he was elected anyway.\n\nNow he's been picked as Kamala Harris' vice presidential hopeful in the 2024 election, and the warning still stands at the West Central Tribune.\n\nRetired National Guard Command Sgt. Majors Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr said, at the time, \"The bottom line in all of this is gut wrenching and sad to explain. When the nation called, he quit. He failed to complete the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy. He failed to serve for two years following completion of the academy, which he dropped out of. He failed to serve two years after the conditional promotion to Command Sergeant Major. He failed to fulfill the full six years of the enlistment he signed on September 18th, 2001. He failed his country. He failed his state. He failed the Minnesota Army National Guard, the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, and his fellow Soldiers. And he failed to lead by example. Shameful\"\n\nThe document published at the time charged that Walz \"embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances of his military career.\"\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break!

Which is false, according to a Department of Defense Directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have. If he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academy. Instead he waited for the paperwork to catch up to him. His official retirement document states, SOLDIER NOT AVAILABLE FOR SIGNATURE.\"\n\nUltimately his rank was reduced.\n\nA report at RedState said the two National Guard officers exposed how Walz \"lied or embellished his service record and shirked his duty.\"\n\nThey charge, the report said that \"he abandoned his troops when they went to Iraq.\"\n\nThe report said, \"He abandoned and walked away from his soldiers and his solemn responsibility to lead and take care of them. According to Behrends and Herr, Walz is hiding that part of the information from the public in an attempt to fool the electorate.\"\n\nRedState noted, \"Another retired command sergeant major corroborated the stories of Behrends and Herr. CSM (Ret) Douglas L. Julin was the 34th Infantry Division Command Sergeant Major and met with Walz, along with five other battalion CSMs, in early 2005 before they deployed to Iraq.

Tim Walz had not even been VP Kamala Harris's running mate for 12 hours before MSNBC's All In host Chris Hayes accused Republicans of \"swift boating\" him on Tuesday. On Wednesday, CNN's Jim Acosta and Brianna Keilar followed suit by also turning the clock back to 2004 as they defended Walz from GOP criticism.\n\nHayes was displeased at anyone arguing Walz has a problematic past while supporting Donald Trump:\n\nSome Republicans are talking about swift boating Walz because he left the National Guard back in 2005 rather than stay and deploy to Iraq though I'm not sure trashing an honorably discharged 24-year Army veteran, the highest ranking enlisted man ever to serve the United States Congress, if I'm not mistaken, later worked on the House Veteran Affairs Committee, I don't think that helps Donald Trump, whose own former staffers say he called American war veterans suckers and losers.\n\nHayes also turned into a humorless scold as he went after some conservatives for claiming Minnesota isn't in the Midwest and might as well be considered Canada, \"Republicans are going to find out, I think, that framing a gun-owning Midwest nice guy as a radical far-left commie ends up painting you into some really weird corners. Some conservatives, now in order to keep this whole shtick going, now claiming Minnesota just isn't real America. No, literally, the secretary of the Ohio Republican Party said 'Minnesota isn't even in the Midwest, it's basically Canada' which last I checked we have 50 states. National Review writer [Heather Wilhelm] who said Minnesota is 'Canada lite' 'might as well be a different planet.'\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Walz's GOP counterpart, JD Vance, gave a press conference where he criticized Walz for retiring from the National Guard prior to his unit's deployment to Iraq. He also took exception to Walz using his military service to justify calls for gun control by referencing weapons \"I carried in war\" despite having never been to war.\n\nVance's comments were carried live on CNN Newsroom, but Acosta still turned to The Atlantic's senior editor, Ron Brownstein, and recalled, \"I mean, these attacks were going to come and they do remind me of when I covered the Kerry campaign back in 2004, the so-called swift boating of John Kerry was a key part of that campaign. Questioning his military service, even though John Kerry was a war hero. It does sound familiar these lines of attack.\"\n\nLike Hayes, Brownstein didn't actually defend Walz, but instead tried to make the conversation about Trump, \"A couple of big differences being Tim Walz is not the presidential nominee and Donald Trump is not really someone who can go around complaining about people dodging military service, right? I mean, that isn't really an effective line of comparison or argument for him.\"\n\nLater in the day, CNN News Central host Brianna Keilar didn't understand what the big deal was, \"We should also mention there's reporting that JD Vance did not see combat in his role. I would argue it doesn't matter. They both served. But what do you think about this, kind of, getting some swift boat vibes here.\"\n\nSure, but Vance did deploy to Iraq and that is what he was talking about on Wednesday, which CNN, again, ignored.\n\nHere is a transcript for the August 6 and 7 shows:", "source": {"uri": "newsbusters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://newsbusters.org/"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rutherford B.

He was a far-left progressive governor who had somehow convinced Minnesotans that he, too, shared their traditional Midwestern values. Here was a guy, the lore went, who could deliver both moderates and fringe lunatics to his deeply unpopular running mate, Kamala Harris. He was the perfect candidate for the job.\n\nCongressman Josh Gottheimer could not wait to offer his resounding endorsement of Tim Walz as his party's Vice Presidential nominee. On August 6, mere moments after the Kamala Harris veepstakes decision went public, Gottheimer gushed, \"Tim is just a great guy! Can't wait to vote for Harris-Walz in November!\"\n\nJosh Gottheimer's eagerness to follow orders and mindlessly rush into the partisan fray is astounding. At least there's still one \"good soldier\" left in the Democratic Party.\n\nBut it's not Tim Walz. A former National Guardsman, in 2005 Walz abruptly quit once rumors circulated that his unit might be slated to deploy to Iraq. As a Command Sergeant Major - the highest enlisted position in the entire unit - he walked away from the hundreds of soldiers he was responsible for training, mentoring, and protecting. As his troops marched on to war, Tim Walz marched on home.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped Walz from telling people he went to war. On several occasions during his political power climb, Walz has padded his leftist credentials and taken advantage of voters by decrying, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" [emphasis added].\n\nTim Walz carried nothing in war, because unlike his troops, he was never there. He has often touted his service in Operation Enduring Freedom, a generic term that can refer to either a combat tour in Afghanistan, or simply supporting a forward-deployed unit from a non-combat location during our nation's post-9/11 Global War on Terror.\n\nTim Walz fought the terrorists from Italy, and we thank him for that service. But we don't thank him for knowingly using confusing military speak to hoodwink voters and falsely imply he stood toe-to-toe with our nation's enemies. He didn't.\n\nWhether or not you believe this is stolen valor, no one doubts the moral bankruptcy of inflating one's service record to climb the political ladder. It is the behavior of a cold, calculated politician who places self before country. It is the embodiment of what has brought our system down to its knees.\n\nWe shouldn't be surprised. Of course Kamala Harris would turn a blind eye to this disqualifying character flaw. If her hand in the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, which took the lives of thirteen of our own troops, was not grounds for her own disqualification and removal from office, why would Tim Walz pawning an embellished military career in exchange for cheap political bona fides give her any pause in putting him on the Democratic ticket?\n\nBut for those of us who fought in our nation's wars, and had friends who did not return home, it does give us pause. Unlike Josh Gottheimer, we cannot bring ourselves to gush that Tim Walz is a \"great guy\" who we should be delighted to vote for in November.\n\nTim Walz is not a great guy. When the going got tough, he bailed on his troops and his country. And then he lied about it repeatedly. Only in the eyes of a pandering Congressional sycophant could that seem Vice Presidential.\n\n_\n\nNick De Gregorio is a US Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a 2022 Congressional candidate, he did not lie about his service record. Perhaps that is why he lost that race and is not Kamala Harris' choice for Vice President.", "source": {"uri": "savejersey.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "savejersey.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Gottheimer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Gottheimer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwestern_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midwestern United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War on terror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://savejersey.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/tim-walz.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 520, "textEnd": 528}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

But, in addition to this is his personal story, specifically his military service in the National Guard and his overselling of his record. The knee-jerk reaction in the press to protect any Democrat is leading - once again - to problems with their ethics, as Bloomberg News has discovered.\n\nIn the \"Businessweek Daily\" newsletter, Joshua Green penned a glowing profile of Walz that ran into the very type of problems you encounter by putting too much faith (read: \"any\") in a politician. In the attempt to paint the picture of a man who should be warmly accepted by everyone, Green failed to listen to his own internal voice. As he began to unfurl the Walz biography, he mentioned the very caution he failed to heed: \"Tim Walz, comes across as entirely -- almost suspiciously -- normal.\"\n\nOh Josh, if only you had listened...\n\nGreen ran headlong into the problem with Walz burnishing his accomplishments during his 20+-plus years of service in the National Guard. Over the years, there have been inconsistencies concerning his rank, how he departed just ahead of deployment, as well as how and where he served in the war effort. Bonchie covered some of these issues, and the problems emanating from this for the press, specifically in this Bloomberg piece.\n\nGreen had detailed that Walz had spent time in Iraq, when his actual service record defies this claim. (It is not made entirely clear if this had been an error on the part of Green, or if he was given this information by Walz/his team.) Many people call out the piece for inaccuracy; it needed to be edited to correct that Walz had in fact been stationed in Italy at the time, and therefore had not been close to the action. As such, it is even in dispute if he could claim to have been attached to Operation Enduring Freedom:\n\nOver an hour after publication, Bloomberg added a Correction note:\n\nFollowing this alteration, people found more things wrong with the piece. A section deeper in the piece discussed Democrats looking to bolster the party's image by recruiting Iraq war vets to run for office, and Walz' name was included as one of those courted at the time. After more complaints about this were lodged, Green went back and altered his piece a second time. The words \"Iraq and Afghanistan\" have now been struck from the piece, and Bloomberg was forced to issue a second Correction addendum to the column:\n\nThis has been an enduring problem, and not just for Walz. From the time he launched his political career, he has touted his service in a fashion that did not align with the facts, as Jordan Schachtel noted. In one of his first mentions of his new political career from 2006, as published in The Atlantic, it was noted how Walz \"just returned from fighting the war on terrorism.\"\n\nWalz personifies two of this year's most interesting political trends. The midterm elections this fall will be the first in which a sizable number of veterans from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq run for Congress. Like Walz, nearly every one of them is a Democrat.\n\nWoo, yeah - that has not aged well. Making this matter all the worse, Thursday is that puff piece in The Atlantic--penned by none other than the same Josh Green.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brad_slager@redstate.com", "name": "Brad Slager", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extremism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Green_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joshua Green (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Businessweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg Businessweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2022 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_terror", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "War on terror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Green_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Green (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/rs/images/up/2024/220/645465a4-ae72-43f5-870b-44d009516003.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

The charge is that Mr. Walz bailed from the National Guard, in which he served for a generation, ahead of his unit being sent to Iraq. Politico's reporting suggests that the Iraq assignment came into view after Command Sergeant Major Walz had decided to leave the Guard and run for Congress.\n\nMr. Walz is being compared to Senator John Kerry, whose campaign for president in 2004 was defeated by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. That was a heroic band of veterans of the Swift Boat campaign in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. The Swift Vets accused Mr. Kerry of being \"unfit for command\" for exaggerating the deeds for which he was decorated and testifying in Congress against those GIs who stuck with the war.\n\nThat was a major element in the 2004 race, and the Swift Vets -- an exceptionally admirable group -- succeeded on the merits in ending Mr. Kerry's presidential ambitions. Mr. Walz is kiloparsecs to the left of what we would look for in a vice president, but the allegation against him is less than what the Swift Vets laid to Mr. Kerry. Mr. Walz, moreover, served in the Nebraska and Minnesota National Guards for 24 years, reaching, at the end, command sergeant major.\n\nThat is the highest enlisted rank in the Army or the National Guard. It's revered by officers and enlisted men alike. Anyone in the National Guard can be sent into combat. It's a risk that's borne by all guardsmen throughout their service. Some sergeants major who served in the Minnesota Guard have chided Mr. Walz for leaving early. He left, though, for, in a run for Congress, another kind of national service -- one that can test another kind of courage.\n\nWhat strikes us as newsworthy, though, is a phenomenon about which we first wrote in 2010, when Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut was discovered to have spoken of having served \"in Vietnam\" rather than \"during Vietnam.\" Mr. Blumenthal is a Marine who served honorably in the reserves but did not appear in Vietnam. He served at a time when many GIs returning from Vietnam were ignored, scorned, ridiculed or called \"baby killers.\"\n\nThat, we wrote, was a time when the Times itself scoffed at the idea that Vietnam had any higher purpose. The war, \"then, as now, seemed to lack any rationale except the wrecking of as many lives as possible on both sides,\" is how the Times put it. Yet 50 years after we lost the war, it seems that for voters today, Vietnam did have some meaning, or politicians wouldn't be boasting of having served in Vietnam.\n\nWhich is something for the current generation of American youth to think about should they ever be called for the draft. That, after all, is not out of the question, as war clouds scud so furiously in the Middle East, Europe, and Asia. Where are Mr. Walz and Vice President Harris on the war? Ms. Harris just told a group in Michigan that she was open to the idea of blocking weapons for Israel. How is that going to look to a future generation of youths?", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "new_york_sun@nysun.com", "name":

That's not who I would pick to run for vice-president.\"\n\nWalz tried to remain in their good graces by offering \"to raise funds to cover his fellow soldiers' bus trips home for Christmas.\"\n\nThe soldiers saw right through him as some considered it as a \"cynical ploy.\"\n\n\"If it were me, I would feel guilty about leaving and do something to make up for it, but if you ask me he was doing it to buy votes,\" said Behrends. \"He will do anything for votes.\"\n\nWalz's unit lost three men in Iraq, including Kyle Miller, who was only 19 at the time:\n\nLike Walz, Miller signed up for the National Guard in high school, and hoped to work as an auto mechanic after his deployment, according to reports. He died when the vehicle in which he was a passenger was hit by a roadside bomb on June 29, 2006.\n\n\"Unlike Walz, Kyle volunteered to go with his unit,\" said Behrends, who worked with Miller's mother, Cathy Miller, to create a bronze memorial of her son.\n\nBehrends and retired Guardsman Paul Herr slammed Walz in 2018 during his first campaign for Minnesota governor:\n\nOn May 16th, 2005 he quit, betraying his country, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war. His excuse to other leaders was that he needed to retire in order to run for Congress. Which is false, according to a Department of Defense Directive, he could have run and requested permission from the Secretary of Defense before entering active duty; as many reservists have. If he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academu. Instead he slithered out the door and waited for the paperwork to catch up to him. His official retirement document states, SOLDIER NOT AVAILABLE FOR SIGNATURE.\n\nAlpha News interviewed Behrends in 2022.\n\n\"The public needs to know how pathetic his leadership was as a National Guardsman,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "legalinsurrection.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mechastain@legalinsurrection.com", "name": "mechastain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Artillery_Branch_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field Artillery Branch (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_sergeant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master sergeant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Minnesota", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Minnesota"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_duty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Active duty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-commissioned officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Improvised explosive device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_reserve_force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military reserve force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Retirement", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Retirement", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement Planning", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kamala-Harris-Tim-Walz.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2006-06-29", "textStart": 1870, "textEnd": 1883}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-16", "textStart": 2158, "textEnd": 2172}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

Tim Walz had not even been VP Kamala Harris's running mate for 12 hours before MSNBC's All In host Chris Hayes accused Republicans of \"swift boating\" him on Tuesday. On Wednesday, CNN's Jim Acosta and Brianna Keilar followed suit by also turning the clock back to 2004 as they defended Walz from GOP criticism.\n\nHayes was displeased at anyone arguing Walz has a problematic past while supporting Donald Trump:\n\nSome Republicans are talking about swift boating Walz because he left the National Guard back in 2005 rather than stay and deploy to Iraq though I'm not sure trashing an honorably discharged 24-year Army veteran, the highest ranking enlisted man ever to serve the United States Congress, if I'm not mistaken, later worked on the House Veteran Affairs Committee, I don't think that helps Donald Trump, whose own former staffers say he called American war veterans suckers and losers.\n\nHayes also turned into a humorless scold as he went after some conservatives for claiming Minnesota isn't in the Midwest and might as well be considered Canada, \"Republicans are going to find out, I think, that framing a gun-owning Midwest nice guy as a radical far-left commie ends up painting you into some really weird corners. Some conservatives, now in order to keep this whole shtick going, now claiming Minnesota just isn't real America. No, literally, the secretary of the Ohio Republican Party said 'Minnesota isn't even in the Midwest, it's basically Canada' which last I checked we have 50 states. National Review writer [Heather Wilhelm] who said Minnesota is 'Canada lite' 'might as well be a different planet.'\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Walz's GOP counterpart, JD Vance, gave a press conference where he criticized Walz for retiring from the National Guard prior to his unit's deployment to Iraq. He also took exception to Walz using his military service to justify calls for gun control by referencing weapons \"I carried in war\" despite having never been to war.\n\nVance's comments were carried live on CNN Newsroom, but Acosta still turned to The Atlantic's senior editor, Ron Brownstein, and recalled, \"I mean, these attacks were going to come and they do remind me of when I covered the Kerry campaign back in 2004, the so-called swift boating of John Kerry was a key part of that campaign. Questioning his military service, even though John Kerry was a war hero. It does sound familiar these lines of attack.\"\n\nLike Hayes, Brownstein didn't actually defend Walz, but instead tried to make the conversation about Trump, \"A couple of big differences being Tim Walz is not the presidential nominee and Donald Trump is not really someone who can go around complaining about people dodging military service, right? I mean, that isn't really an effective line of comparison or argument for him.\"\n\nLater in the day, CNN News Central host Brianna Keilar didn't understand what the big deal was, \"We should also mention there's reporting that JD Vance did not see combat in his role. I would argue it doesn't matter. They both served. But what do you think about this, kind of, getting some swift boat vibes here.\"\n\nLike it's 2004 again. \"Getting some Swift boat vibes here.\" CNN's Brianna @brikeilarcnn trying to discredit criticism of Tim Walz by JD Vance. pic.twitter.com/db7cTBfetg\n\n-- Brent Baker \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\udde6 \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1 (@BrentHBaker) August 7, 2024\n\nSure, but Vance did deploy to Iraq and that is what he was talking about on Wednesday, which CNN, again, ignored.\n\nCHRIS HAYES: Who do you think comes out sounding more radical to you, at least?

It takes roughly a year from filing your retirement packet until your retirement date, so he probably applied for retirement in 2004.\n\nIn July 2004, two months after CSM Walz' retirement ceremony, his unit was alerted for deployment to Iraq. Two months.\n\nNow JD Vance, who served in the Marines as a combat correspondent, apparently did one hitch and a tour in a war zone, and left the Marines as a Corporal, is running around claiming that CSM Walz, who served over twenty years in Field Artillery, abandoned his unit just when they needed him most.

There is really no ambiguity at all about the claim or Walz's awareness of it.\n\nA longtime National Guardsman who served in Afghanistan, Walz was a popular high school teacher and football coach who believed that because of his life experience he could do a better job in Congress than the incumbent. He appealed to voters with a great \"authentic\" message...\n\nYou could easily assume that Walz wasn't aware, but for the fact that he endorses the book as a winning formula. If you are quoted in the book, recommend the book, and are praised as an example in the book, then you read the book and know what it is in. Anybody who is featured in a book and then recommends it to others obviously knows what is in it.\n\nWalz has some other skeletons in his closet too. Special forces folks are very annoyed that he has been parading around in a camo hat with a special forces logo.\n\nIn fact, POLITICO features a photo of him praising his use of a camo hat with precisely that logo.\n\nWalz can pull it off!\n\nYeah, but it is apparently a fraud. I am not a military guy, so I don't have the greatest insight into how significant this issue will be to veterans, but it sure sounds bad to me. Going around talking about your service in a war that you never gave, wearing special forces logos that you never earned sure looks to this ill-informed guy to be pretty bad.\n\nSo far, we have learned that Walz lied about where he served, what rank he left the Guard with, whether he served in a war, that he left to avoid deployment to Iraq, and that he endorsed a claim he served in Afghanistan.\n\nBloomberg wrote a profile of Walz having him in Afghanistan and Iraq and had to correct it when this issue came to the fore. The correction on it is hilarious:\n\n(Corrects to remove reference to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in fifth paragraph; an earlier version of this story corrected where Walz served overseas in the third paragraph and Col\u00f3n's position with Rock Steady in the introduction to that item.)\n\nDoes that sound like a guy who is up-front and honest?\n\nThe Harris campaign can't even get Walz's service in Congress correct, having claimed he was Chair of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n\nNo doubt it was an innocent mistake.

It mobilized to Camp Shelby Mississippi in September and finally deployed to Iraq in March 2006, ten months after Walz's retirement.\n\nNotwithstanding this reasonable and credible timeline, Republican vice-presidential nominee, Sen. JD Vance on Wednesday had the temerity to accuse Tim Walz of leaving the National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq.\n\nVance also seized on a remark by Governor Walz supporting gun control in which the governor said, \"we can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war,\" to callously accuse Walz of \"stolen valor,\" one of the most slanderous charges one can make against a veteran's honor and integrity.\n\nSince Mr. Vance brought it up, let us talk about (stolen) valor on the part of the man about whom JD Vance \"once worried was 'America's Hitler,\" but whom he now idolizes: The GOP presidential candidate.\n\nIs it valor to avoid military service, \"sidestep the war in Vietnam,\" thanks to a conveniently timed deferment based on questionable bone spurs?\n\nWhat kind of valor is it to insult the valor of those men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country by referring to them as \"losers\" and \"suckers\"?\n\nHow can one cheapen valor more than by this reaction by the GOP presidential candidate to the gift of a Purple Heart medal by a veteran wounded in action in Iraq: \"...Man, that's like big stuff. I always wanted to get the Purple Heart...This was much easier.\"\n\nIs it valor to disparage a war hero, a man who spent more than five years as a Prisoner of War in a North Vietnamese prison and was subject to torture, by claiming \"He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured,\"?\n\nCan there be any more disrespect for valor than the cheapening of our nation's highest military award for valor in combat than by with frivolous remarks such as, \"As president, I wanted to give myself the Congressional Medal of Honor, but they wouldn't let me do it...they said that would be inappropriate...\"\n\nThis was not the first time that the GOP presidential candidate cheapened, diminished the Medal of Honor.\n\nIs it valor to mock combat injuries, such as those sustained by eleven soldiers in a 2020 Iranian attack on a U.S. post in Iraq, by claiming, \"I heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things...I've seen people with no legs and no arms... I can consider them to be really bad injuries.\"?\n\nPerhaps the vilest example of \"stolen valor\" by the 2024 presidential candidate occurred many years ago, when -- as his adorers will claim -- \"he was just a youngster.\"\n\nDiscussing the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) on a 1997 Howard Stern show, Trump claimed that \"...more people were killed by women in this act than killed in Vietnam...\"\n\nWhen Stern praised Trump for being \"braver than any Vietnam vet because you're out there screwing a lot of women,\" the \"hero\" replied, \"Getting the Congressional Medal of Honor, in actuality.\"\n\nBut that was not all.\n\nTrump and Stern continued to compare avoiding STDs to serving in Vietnam and thus came the most disgusting, grotesque example of \"stolen honor\" this author has ever seen or heard.\n\n\"I've been so lucky in terms of that whole world. It is a dangerous world out there -- it's scary, like Vietnam. Sort of like the Vietnam era. It is my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier.\" Trump said.\n\nAs retired four-star Marine Corps General John F. Kelly said while discussing Trump's numerous calumnies against our service members and veterans, \"There is nothing more that can be said.

Vance is going hard against Democrat vice presidential candidate Tim Walz about stolen valor. As we told you Wednesday, a reporter for Bloomberg went back and corrected his story about Walz's military career, having confused Italy for Iraq.\n\nAs we recently reported, Alyssa Farah Griffin of \"The View\" shared the \"very cool fact\" that Walz is the highest-ranking enlisted soldier ever to serve in Congress. That would be very cool if it were a fact, but it's not. That honor goes to Texas Rep. Tony Gonzales.\n\nCNN has rushed in to clear up questions about Walz's rank. Jake Tapper and his guest said that the E8 and E9 designations mean nothing to those who haven't served, and agreed that it's \"crazy\" to accuse Walz of stolen valor:\n\nOK, so maybe he embellished his rank.

Tim Walz accused him on Newsmax of exaggerating his rank after retiring from the unit.\n\nAccording to the governor's military record, which was reviewed by CBS News, Walz, who served in the Nebraska and the Minnesota Army National Guard for 24 years until he retired in 2005, earned the rank of command sergeant major, but had his rank reduced after retiring because he failed to complete additional coursework for the United States Army Sergeants Major's Academy.\n\nRet. Command Sgt. Maj. Thomas Behrends told \"National Report\" on Thursday that the issue of Walz's service and his official rank has \"been discussed for many years in Minnesota, but it's been swept under the rug.\"\n\nHe added, \"it was brought out in 2018 and it literally got buried. And they didn't want to influence the election. So it just kind of simmered there.\"\n\nBehrends went on to say that \"literally when you get promoted to command sergeant major or sergeant major (E-9) in the services, you do it conditionally that you're going to finish this United States Army Sergeant Major's Academy, and that you're going to do two years after you graduate from that.\"\n\nHe said that Walz did not complete the program and said, \"Anybody using that rank and saying that they're a retired command sergeant major at that point, it's just an absolute lie,\" though he noted that Walz \"technically\" served in that position.\n\n\"He was frocked, he was pinned with that position,\" Behrends said, adding that he prefers to call Walz\n\n\"an acting command sergeant major\" because \"he acted as one for a certain amount of time,\" but \"he was never a qualified one.\"\n\nAbout NEWSMAX TV:\n\nNEWSMAX is the fastest-growing cable news channel in America!\n\nFind Newsmax channel in your home via cable and satellite systems - More Info Here Watch Newsmax+ on your home TV app or smartphone and watch it anywhere!

That's disgusting and irrelevant to the case at hand. Also, anyone in a combat zone can get killed. It's not like these people are working in the safety of a CNN studio, Brianna.

I fully agree with Matt's conclusion \"I don't think its stolen valor, but Walz has played it lose when referring to his service,\" but have been steeped in the military culture most of my almost six decades and have a different perspective on many of the claims.\n\nSome deck clearing first.\n\nFirst, while I was only barely aware of him before his name surfaced as a VP candidate, I mostly like what I see. While I disagree with him at the margins on some issues, he seems like a pragmatist rather than an ideologue. While I roll my eyes at the lengths to which he goes to portray himself as an \"Everyday Joe,\" he seems like a decent guy. He's qualified to be VP and, should it be necessary, to step up into the big chair. Given the alternatives, I'll vote for the ticket.\n\nSecond, and perhaps more importantly, Walz being on the ticket will have almost nothing to do with my vote or that of any other American. In 2008, I wrote multiple scathing posts about the selection of Sarah Palin as John McCain's running mate. I thought and continue to think that Joe Biden, the VP alternative on the other ticket, was more prepared to serve. I still voted for McCain. (While I thought about it much less, the same is true in hindsight for Lloyd Bentsen and Dan Quayle in 1988.)\n\nThird, while I opposed him for all manner of reasons (my then-strong allegiance to the Republican Party first and foremost of them), I immediately and vociferously defended John Kerry against the smears of the Swift Boaters. While I thought his record of protests against the Vietnam War, including throwing his war medals over the White House fence and some smears against his fellow veterans before Congress were absolutely fair game, the \"stolen valor\" claims were outrageous and I said so early and often.\n\nAll that said, while I take @wr and others' point that politicians stretch the truth about their past accomplishments as a matter of course, military service is a different animal. Among veterans and active duty personnel, there is simultaneously a fierce and often petty pecking order about who did what but an honor culture that reacts -- even over-reacts -- to claims to honors one didn't earn. And Walz has clearly done the latter -- and allowed others to do the latter -- repeatedly.\n\nLet me take the claims Matt lists in the order in which he debunks them.\n\nThis is the first I'd seen of the charge and I largely agree with Matt that it's not a big deal. He has frequently worn a camouflage baseball cap with the De Oppresso Liber crest of the U.S. Army Special Forces, the Green Berets. It was a gift given to him, as a Member of Congress, when he visited the 1st Group. Given that he's never claimed to be SF, it's certainly not a \"stolen valor\" issue.\n\nThat said: I wouldn't wear the hat outside the context in which it was given. When presented with the hat, I'd have put it on and gotten photographed with the presenters. Depending on my reading of the room, I might have left it on. I would subsequently have put it on my mantle or wherever my SWAG was displayed and never worn it again precisely because I'd be embarrassed to give someone the impression that I'd been SF when I hadn't earned that right.\n\nMore than a decade ago, I was part of a delegation from the Atlantic Council that did a distinguished visitor tour of the USS Eisenhower. We were all presented Eisenhower ball caps with scrambled eggs on the visor. I haven't worn it since we left the carrier. While I suppose I have the \"right\" to wear the cap, most people seeing me in it would naturally assume that I had served in the Navy and been assigned to the Ike.\n\nSimilarly, I've been working for the Marine Corps since 2013. It would never occur to me to wear a hat, shirt, lapel pin, or anything else that said \"U.S. Marines,\" \"USMC,\" or the like on it because it might give the incorrect impression that I served in the Marines. (I served, but in the Army.) I have plenty of SWAG that says \"Marine Corps Command and Staff College\" and some that says \"Marine Corps University.\" Those, I've earned the right to wear.\n\nMatt is right here: Walz deployed to his unit to Europe to backfill soldiers who had been deployed to war zones. That's honorable service and more than most did. (It's more than I did in terms of the GWOT.)\n\nBut, to me, \"We can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war\" goes well beyond puffery. It's a goddamn lie. While it doesn't cross the line into \"stolen valor,\" it's awfully goddamn close. It's, frankly, shameful.\n\nAnd, frankly, in the broader context of GWOT, I would hesistate to describe going to Germany to relieve actual soldiers to go to actual combat as being \"deployed.\" It's technically correct but gives a misleading impression that I think intentional.\n\nThis is two claims, which I'll dissect in order. Because it's the most damning and prominent of the claims, I'll devote the most time to it.\n\nMatt presents the timeline that Walz' defenders have put out and, to the best of my knowledge, it's accurate. Unlike the previous case, Walz actually deserves some credit here: His press release announcing his candidacy for Congress acknowledged that he was aware that portions of his battalion would be deployed. But he's shading the truth here, too.\n\nFirst off, if a significant portion of the battalion is deployed, it's a sure bet that the commander, command sergeant major (CSM), and primary staff will go with them. Walz was the CSM. So, it's not like it was a random lottery he was avoiding.\n\nSecond, I'm reliably informed that the practice in those days for Guard units was to issue early warnings to the command team about probable deployments precisely so that people who didn't want to serve -- or were unfit to serve -- could muster out before the orders came down. Unlike the Reserve, the Guard has a very long history of cronyism. For much of its history, it was a way to pretend to serve in the military without much chance of having to actually go to war. Additionally, during that period, there were severe manpower shortages, so Guard units allowed people who were medically and otherwise fit to serve to stay on the rolls collecting (meager) paychecks and earning (rather significant) retirement pensions. (It should be noted, this would very soon change. The Guard would become an active reserve, expected to routinely deploy to combat. Walz retired at the tail end of the former era.)\n\nThird and relatedly, the rules for dropping retirement paperwork Matt cites are correct now. They weren't then. It was pretty easy for Guardsmen to get out of their contracts and, certainly, to retire.\n\nDoes all of this constitute \"abandoning his unit\"? I'm of mixed minds.\n\nWalz had decided to run for Congress. While I'm sure his motives were mixed -- he clearly has a lot more ambition that his \"aw shucks\" persona lets on -- that's a form of national service that's arguably more important than serving as CSM of an artillery battalion. And, while he never went to combat, 24 years of service is, again, way more than most gave.\n\nAt the same time, I can understand why some in his unit -- his commander and some of his subordinates -- would feel bitter about their CSM dropping his papers in the run-up to a combat tour. The unit would lose men in the war and get many more wounded.\n\nIt's worth noting that, unlike the Swift Boat smears, these charges seem to have been organic and to have emerged well before Walz' selection for the VP bid. Again, I don't think they'll amount to much. But they're not manufactured outrage, either.\n\nHere again, Walz is simply lying his ass off. He's repeatedly claimed, in official publications, to have retired as a CSM. Kamala Harris' introduction of him played up this rank.\n\nIn fact, as Matt notes, while he was promoted in-house to CSM (something that doesn't happen in the real Army), he was in fact a Master Sergeant, the next lower* rank. He would have actually promoted to CSM had he completed (apparently, by correspondence) the Sergeants Major Academy. He did not do so before putting in his retirement papers.\n\nIt would be somewhat weasely but, in my judgment, acceptable, to say that he'd served as his battalion's CSM. But to say that he'd achieved the rank of CSM, much less that he'd retired at that rank, is a goddamn lie.\n\nIn the real Army, by the way, selection for Sergeant Major is a very big deal. There are relatively few slots available and selection (as for Sergeant First Class and Master Sergeant) is by a centralized Army-level promotion board. In the Guard of Walz' day, it was hand-picked by the local commander. So, from my perspective (which is likely not Walz') it's doubly dubious to claim the title. (Then again, I have trouble with his claim that he \"served 24 years in the Army\" when his entire career, save arguably the deployment to non-combat in Europe, was in the Nebraska and Minnesota Guard.)\n\nAll of that, though, is very Inside Baseball. Will there be some significant number of veterans who have hard feeling over Walz' claims? Quite possibly. Will it matter in the election? I doubt it.\n\nRelatedly, as Matt's post notes some \"bothsides\" discussions on these matters, I want to note this graphic that I saw on the Facebook page of an esteemed former colleague as a way of comparing the military service of the two VP candidates:\n\nIt's rather amusing at first blush but incredibly deceptive.\n\nFirst, I'm sorry, 24 years in the National Guard of Walz' day is not 24 years of real service. There was next to zero chance that we were going to call up a Guard artillery unit for combat. Second, as already discussed, he never attained pay grade E-9. He was an E-8 wearing CSM rank insignia -- and assigned to the CSM billet -- in a Guard unit. Third, all of the awards listed for Walz save the top two are what we call \"I was there\" medals and ribbons. They're all for simply being in the Guard during certain periods of time or completing mandatory training. And, frankly, an Army Commendation Medal is a paltry top award, indeed, for a senior NCO.\n\nVance's NAM is, simultaneously not all that impressive and the highest award a corporal is likely to achieve absent combat valor. And he actually received plenty of I Was There awards: \"Sea Service Deployment Ribbon, Iraqi Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Letter of Appreciation (5th award), Meritorious Mast Certificate of Appreciation, and various Campaign and Service Medals.\" That's not bad for four years of service and, frankly, much more impressive to anyone in the know that Walz' rack.\n\nIn fairness, some veterans will scoff that he was in public affairs rather than a combat arms billet. But he did at least carry a rifle in a place where he could be potentially called upon to use it. Walz, claims to the contrary, did not.\n\nArmy NCO ranks are a bit odd. At pay grade E-8, one can be a Master Sergeant or a First Sergeant. The pay is the same but the latter is more prestigious, as it's a specific leadership billet: the senior enlisted advisor in a company/battery/troop. At pay grade E-9, on can be a Sergeant Major or a Command Sergeant Major. The latter is the senior enlisted advisor at a battalion or higher formation. Making it more confusing, 1SG and CSM are billet-specific. So, as was the case with my late father, one can serve as a company 1SG and then subsequently be assigned to a staff billet and revert to the default MSG rank. Usually, but not always, one is allowed to retire in the more prestigious rank if they've served in it.", "source": {"uri": "outsidethebeltway.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Outside the Beltway"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_joyner@outsidethebeltway.com", "name": "James Joyner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_impostor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military impostor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McCain", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John McCain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Special_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Special Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

Has Nancy Pelosi ever been sober on air?\n\nMaybe she's like Harris and skips the daily briefings.\n\nFair enough.

Thul went on to present the 2004 photo of Walz, as well as Walz's website, to another aide, who acknowledged that constituents could get the false impression that Walz served in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Operation Enduring Freedom is limited to Afghanistan and the airspace directly above,\" Thul told the aide. \"Congressman Walz is clearly claiming ... to be an Enduring Freedom veteran. Nobody disputes the fact that he is not an Afghanistan or Enduring Freedom veteran. So this represents a fairly serious issue.\" Asked whether he understood how constituents could falsely \"assume that means [Walz] served in Afghanistan,\" the aide responded, \"Perhaps, I guess.\"\n\nThe aide did not dispute that Walz was pictured in the 2004 photograph, and, indeed, a 2006 Atlantic article describes the spectacle of the future governor protesting the Bush visit with a group of high school students. The aide told Thul he would follow up with him. A source familiar with the situation said neither Walz nor his staffers followed through with that pledge.\n\nThul explained to the aide that \"there's a huge difference between being deployed to a base in Italy and being in a combat zone in Afghanistan.\"\n\nIn 2018, Walz told Minnesota Public Radio he never saw combat.\n\nIn fact, he \"spent time in Norway in support of NATO forces and in Italy working in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\"\n\nThe criticism has followed Walz since those days.", "source": {"uri": "legalinsurrection.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_chastain@legalinsurrection.com", "name": "Mary Chastain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Enduring_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operation Enduring Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "War in Afghanistan (2001\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

His qualifications to be second in line for Commander in Chief, not so much.\n\nWe, retired Command Sergeants Major of the Minnesota National Guard, feel it is our duty and responsibility to bring forth the truth as we know it concerning his service record. So, we have put together a timeline of his service post 9/11. ...\n\nOn September 18th, 2001 Tim Walz reenlisted in the Minnesota Army National Guard for six years.\n\nIn early 2003 he was selected to attend the United States Army Sergeants Major Academy.\n\nSo that taxpayer money isn't wasted training people for nothing, this came with the stipulation that he would serve for at least 2 years after graduation or promotion to Sergeant Major or Command Sergeant Major, whichever came later.\n\nOn September 17th, 2004 he was conditionally promoted to Command Sergeant Major.\n\nThis promotion became null and void after he failed to meet the conditions to which he had agreed.\n\nIn early 2005, a warning order was issued to the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion, which included the position he was serving in, to prepare to be mobilized for active duty for a deployment to Iraq.\n\nUh oh. A guy could get hurt over there.\n\nOn May 16th, 2005 he quit, leaving the 1-125th Field Artillery Battalion and its Soldiers hanging; without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.\n\nWalz gave the phony excuse that he was running for Congress. He did not need to go AWOL to do that.\n\nIf he had retired normally and respectfully, you would think he would have ensured his retirement documents were correctly filled out and signed, and that he would have ensured he was reduced to Master Sergeant for dropping out of the academy. Instead he waited for the paperwork to catch up to him. His official retirement document states, SOLDIER NOT AVAILABLE FOR SIGNATURE.\n\nOn September 10th, 2005 conditionally promoted Command Sergeant Major Walz was reduced to Master Sergeant. It took a while for the system to catch up to him as it was uncharted territory, literally no one quits in the position he was in, or drops out of the academy.

Tim Walz - Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate - described his military service are not new to the 2024 election.\n\nBack in 2009, Iraq War veteran David Thul went to then-Congressman Walz's office in Mankato, Minnesota, and presented evidence he said showed Walz misrepresenting his military service. The encounter was captured in a video that has recently resurfaced.\n\nThul presented a Walz staffer with a 2004 photo of Walz holding a sign saying \"Enduring Freedom Veterans for Care\" and said that the image depicts Walz as an \"Afghanistan War veteran.\"\n\n\"Congressman Walz is not an Afghanistan War veteran, is he?\" Thul asks the staffer.\n\n\"He served in Italy as a part of Operation Enduring Freedom,\" the staffer responds.\n\n\"But he didn't serve in Afghanistan, did he?\" Thul then asks.\n\n\"Not that I'm aware of,\" the staffer says.\n\nThe video then shows Thul meeting with another staffer and showing him the same picture.\n\nThe staffer said he always \"understood\" that Walz's involvement in Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) was that he was deployed \"in support of it.\" Thul then asked the staffer if he believed most people would associate Operation Enduring Freedom with Afghanistan, to which the staffer suggested it was a broader operation.\n\nThul then tells the staffer that OEF is \"limited to Afghanistan and the air space directly above it.\" He acknowledged that other units were called up \"in support of\" OEF but stated that his \"concern\" with the picture he presented and Walz's official website is that \"without any other details, don't you think it's reasonable people might assume that he served in Afghanistan?\"\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER FOR 'AM I RACIST?' -- A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI\n\nThe staffer takes a moment before responding: \"Perhaps, I guess?\"\n\nThul then points out that it has been nearly five years, and Walz's official biography has potentially caused confusion about whether or not he actually served in Afghanistan.\n\nWhen the staffer asked how Thul would change the wording to make it clearer, the Iraq War veteran said adding the words \"in Italy\" would suffice.\n\n\"We both appreciate his being deployed,\" Thul said, \"but there's a huge difference between being deployed to a base in Italy and being in a combat zone in Afghanistan.\"\n\nThul also notes that there were media articles in 2006 that referred to Walz as a \"war veteran\" and tells the staffer that the photo of Walz depicting him as an Afghanistan War veteran could violate Stolen Valor laws and result in incarceration. Walz has never been charged with Stolen Valor crimes, nor has he been officially investigated for such offenses.

However, PolitiFact omitted some key details from those who served with Walz that could've changed the truth-o-meter.\n\nIn the \"if your time is short\" summary, Sara Swann writes, \"Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz served in the Nebraska and Minnesota National Guards for 24 years. Walz has said he retired in May 2005 to run for Congress; he submitted retirement paperwork five to seven months beforehand.\"\n\nShe also insists, \"After Walz filed candidacy paperwork in February 2005, his battalion received a March 2005 notification for a potential -- not definite -- deployment within two years, not immediately.\"\n\nFinally, she maintains, \"Walz's battalion was not officially ordered to go to Iraq until July 2005, two months after Walz retired.\"\n\nSwann does mention the fact that people who served with Walz have come out and criticized his decision. She cites Doug Julin, \"who served as a more senior command sergeant major in Walz's battalion, said Walz went over his head to get retirement approval before the unit's deployment was official, because Julin would have 'analyzed it and challenged him,' the New York Post reported Aug. 8. Others who served in Walz's battalion have said he 'ditched' them and his actions were 'dishonorable,' Fox News reported.\"\n\nHowever, for some reason, that does not appear to have affected PolitiFact's conclusion. Swann's article was released Friday morning, but Thursday night Julin went on CNN and poured cold water on the idea Walz didn't know for sure if his unit would be ordered to go to Iraq, \"he told me [in March 2005], he says, I have not been nominated, I am going forward with the battalion. I said, 'Good, let's go.'\"\n\nJulin also wasn't a fan of the separating a notice to deploy with formal orders, \"People say, well, he never knew he was going forward. Yeah, he knew he was going forward. Had he gotten his orders yet? No. At that time, he had not.\"\n\nAs for PolitiFact, Swann conceded Vance had a point on Walz claiming to be command sergeant major, therefore saving him from a full \"false\" rating. However, Swann omitted the part where Vance criticized Walz for saying he carried weapons \"in war\" while pushing for gun control.\n\nMeanwhile, the Washington Post's Pinocchio system is the closest analogue to PolitiFact's truth-o-meter, and their fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, declined to rate such claims, \"Whether he abandoned his troops is a matter of perspective, but it is noteworthy that his retirement request was not blocked.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsbusters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "https://newsbusters.org/"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PolitiFact"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Walz", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tim Walz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battalion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battalion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Guard (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_major", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergeant major"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Kessler_(journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Kessler (journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gun control"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.newsbusters.org/styles/mobile_thumb_700x400_/s3/2024-08/2024-08-09-PolitiFact-Vance.jpg?itok=PrXEcFpx", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795921", "eventUri": "eng-9795921", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 1393, "textEnd": 1399}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-05-", "textStart": 571, "textEnd": 579}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-02-", "textStart": 729, "textEnd": 742}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-03-", "textStart": 769, "textEnd": 779, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-07-", "textStart": 965, "textEnd": 974}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 460917205, "relevance": 2}

{"id": 237079554, "title": "Gautam Gambhir, only applicant for job of India men&#8217;s cricket coach, to be interviewed today", "text": "Former India Test batsman Gautam Gambhir, the only candidate to have applied for the coach's post of the Indian men's team, will appear for an interview before the Cricket Advisory Committee over a Zoom call on Tuesday. The term of current India coach Rahul Dravid ends after the ongoing T20 World Cup in USA and West Indies. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) had invited applications for the post in mid-May and the deadline was May 27, the day after the IPL final. Gambhir is also mentor of the current IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders. The CAC comprises former cricketers Ashok Malhotra, Jatin Paranjpe and Sulakshana Naik. Interviews will also be conducted by the CAC to find a selector, who will replace Salil Ankola. Ankola and chief selector Ajit Agarkar are both from the West Zone, so the new selector is likely to be from the North Zone, a vacant position. Agarkar was appointed in July last year and replaced Chetan Sharma who had stepped down after being in the centre of a sting operation. Ankola was already a selector when Agarkar took over. Following interviews, the CAC will make recommendations to the BCCI. \u201cWe are conducting an interview session for candidates for the post of head coach and selector. The CAC will submit its recommendation to the BCCI and the board will make an official announcement thereafter,\u201d a BCCI source confirmed. The BCCI also had to clarify that no former Australian player had been approached for the job, after Ricky Ponting and Justin Langer, both coaches in the IPL, had said they had turned down approaches for the India coach job. \"Neither I nor the BCCI have approached any former Australian cricketer with a coaching offer,\" BCCI secretary Jay Shah said in a statement. \"The reports circulating in certain media sections are completely incorrect. Finding the right coach for our national team is a meticulous and thorough process. We are focused on identifying individuals who possess a deep understanding of the Indian cricket structure and have risen through the ranks.\" Some of the requirements of the new head coach listed by the BCCI were: the candidate \u201cmust be willing to meet work expectations and pressures associated with handling marquee athletes\u201d and they should help in \u201cdeveloping a world-class Indian cricket team which delivers sustained success in all conditions and formats, inspiring current and future generations of cricketers and stakeholders with their approach to the game.\u201d The term for the new coach starts in July 2024 and stretches to December 31, 2027 \u2013 the year of the next ODI World Cup.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/gautam-gambhir-only-applicant-for-job-of-india-mens-cricket-coach-to-be-interviewed-today-9398573/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/ROHIT-SHARMA-GAUTAM-GAMBHIR-CROP-PTI.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:24:10", "author": "Devendra Pandey", "authors": ["Devendra Pandey"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.014}

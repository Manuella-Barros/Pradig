Mike Davis\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nBRISTOL, Conn. -- Chris Cartnick is at least one up on his older brother, Tommy, and all it took was one swing.\n\nTwo years ago, with Tommy Cartnick leading the way, Holbrook Little League came here to the Mid-Atlantic Regional, falling in the championship game to a Lewisberry (Pa.) team that eventually played in the Little League World Series championship game.\n\nOn Saturday, Chris Cartnick, already playing a starring role during this week-long event, hit his fifth home run of the tournament in the top of the first inning. That homer was part of an early offensive barrage, culminating in 11 hits. as Holbrook defeated Thurmont (Md.) for Mid-Atlantic Regional title, 8-3, at Leon J. Breen Field.\n\nHolbrook, which is now 20-1 on the summer dating back to the District 18 Tournament, is through to the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa. It will begin play on Thursday afternoon at fabled Lamade Stadium against New England regional champion Fairfield (Conn.) American Little League.\n\nHolbrook will be the sixth team from Ocean County to represent New Jersey at the Little League World Series, and the first since Toms River National in 2010.\n\nCartnick wasted little time in setting the tone for the evening. He took the 12th pitch of the night, a curve ball from Logan Simanski, over the wall in left-center to open the scoring. Holbrook starter Tai Mann followed that in the bottom of the first by escaping two runners with just one out.\n\nIn control, as it was most of the week, Holbrook then opened up the floodgates.\n\nIt put up a six-spot in the second, highlighted by Mann's opposite-field, two-run homer for a 7-0 lead. A Cartnick single up the middle ended Simanski's evening. Peyton Castellow came on in relief of Simanski, getting a pair of fly outs to stop the bleeding with runners on the corners.\n\nMann, meanwhile, was the beneficiary of good defense. Cartnick started a pair of 6-4-3 double plays over the first two innings as Mann needed just 26 pitches to get through the first two innings.\n\nThurmont threatened in the bottom of the fourth, finally getting to Mann when Castellow registered an RBI walk, scoring Josh Skowronski. Mann's night on the mound was done there at 64 pitches, 38 for strikes, over 3 2/3 innings.\n\nWith the bases still loaded, Chris Andrews came on in relief of Mann. He issued an RBI walk on four pitches to Will Gisriel, yielded an RBI single to Simanski, then got Braden Bell to ground out to second to end the threat with Holbrook leading, 7-3, after four innings.\n\nStaff writer Josh Newman: jnewman@app.com\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "timeCrawl": "01:16:00", "sim": 0.7960784435272217, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8860543", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "id": 224, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "id": 395, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "id": 538, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

He hit two home runs and had six RBI in a 10-6 win. Sherlon Christie\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nBRISTOL, Conn. - When the Holbrook Little League team runs out onto the field in front of a national television audience Saturday night at Leon J. Breen Field, playing for the Mid-Atlantic Region crown and a berth in the Little League World Series, it's exactly where they've always expected to be, right down to the last man on the roster.\n\nThat's the way they've carried themselves since walking out onto the field and beat cross-town rivals Jackson, 12-2, in their opening game in District 18, believing this was their destiny.\n\nIt's a mindset that was forged over the past three years, and now, with a 19-1 record this summer, Holbrook is just one win away from a chance to play for a world championship.\n\n''This has been our goal since we were eight,'' said Chris Cartnick, who cracked a pair of home runs in Holbrook's win on Wednesday. ''We've always wanted to be at this point and now we have a chance to accomplish it with a win on Saturday.''\n\nPlenty of teams around the country have had that same thoughts. The difference is that Holbrook turned it into a realistic goal, its players' confidence growing with each passing year.\n\nHolbrook manager Rob Grano has witnessed the maturation of this team from the dugout over the past three seasons, with the team going as far as it could at 10 and 11-year-olds, winning the Mid-Atlantic Regional two years ago.\n\n''It's possible because of what they've done in the past,'' said Grano of the team's quest to reach the World Series in Williamsport, Pa.\n\nHolbrook Little League: Everything you need to know\n\n''I think anything less, and while you shouldn't say disappointing, for them it's disappointing. I feel like we've played our best baseball the past two weeks. Once we got to states they were like, 'OK, now it's time to really play, and play well now.'' I feel like we're getting tested a lot now. These are great teams, and I think they're really excited to be in these situations.''\n\nThat self-assurance has manifested itself with their dominating performances on the field.\n\nThey've produced double-digit run totals in 16 of their 20 games. Their only loss was to Manchester in Region 18 play, which they avenged by scoring 36 runs against Manchester in two games in the finals. They beat Sayreville 17-1 to win the sectional title, and topped Wayne in the state final, 10-2.\n\nIn three games in the regional they've outscored the opposition by a 35-12 margin.\n\n''We feel pretty confident because they don't really get nervous,'' Grano said. ''They don't really get flustered. I keep saying battle-tested. Three years of state champions, all those years in all those spots.\n\nHolbrook Little League vs Plainview in Mid-Atlantic Tournament Fullscreen 8/7/2017 - New Jersey's Garrett Drew (10) during the Mid-Atlantic Regional Little League Tournament held at Leon J.

Remember who you are, where you've been and what you've done, and fall back on that in a tense spot, in a tough spot. You've already done this.

He hit two home runs and had six RBI in a 10-6 win. Sherlon Christie\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nBRISTOL, Conn - Next stop, Williamsport, Pa., for the Jersey Shore's team of destiny.\n\nA bus with the Holbrook Little League team on it will pull out of the A. Bartlett Giamatti Little League Center here on Sunday morning bound for the Little League World Series, where the final chapter in what has been a storybook summer will be written.\n\nIt all started Saturday night when Holbrook's Chris Cartnick launched a curveball from Maryland pitcher Logan Simanski into the trees in left field at Leon J. Breen Field, not long after the national television broadcast began.\n\nAnd while there were a few anxious moments over the next few hours, when Simanski lined out to second baseman Charlie Meglio to finalize an 8-3 victory, it set in motion a joyous celebration, both on the field and in the stands.\n\nLive updates: Holbrook Little League in Mid-Atlantic Regional final\n\nWhat's become clear over the past week is that this group, which has displayed a potent combination of power at the plate and prowess on the pitching mound, will be a factor on the global stage.\n\nThey thoroughly demolished the competition over four games at the Mid-Atlantic, outscoring the opposition by a 43-15 margin over four games, improving their record to 20-1 since they began play in Region 18 in early July.\n\nIt's not the first time a group of young players has kids has captured the imagination of the locals.\n\nBack in 1975, Lakewood's Deon Lowe and Bobby Del Conte became household names when they won the national championship in Williamsport.\n\nThe most famous of the five previous Ocean County teams to make it to the grandest stage in youth sports was the 1998 Toms River East American team led by Todd Frazier, beating Japan in the final win a world title.\n\nNow, this group from Jackson that has already energized Central Jersey is ready to show the rest of the Little League universe what they're all about.\n\nAfter smacking a pair of home runs and driving in six runs in Holbrook's win on Wednesday, Cartnick's heroics continued against Maryland. Not only did he blast a homer, part of a two-hit night, the shortstop started 6-4-3 double plays in the first and second innings.\n\nStarting pitcher Tai Mann picked up the victory and slammed a two-run homer to right center, and Garrett Drew's two-run double helped keep their six-run second inning going.\n\nWhen Holbrook opens play on Thursday against Fairfield, Conn. Team that's unbeaten this summer, it will mark the first appearance by a local team since Toms River National made it to the World Series in 2010, and the first New Jersey team since Parsippany-Troy Hills East did it in 2014.\n\nBut it's hard to remember a local team heading to Williamsport with so much momentum and confidence, which should make for a very interesting trip in Central Pennsylvania.\n\nStephen Edelson is an Asbury Park Press columnist: sedelson@gannettnj.com\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE", "timeCrawl": "01:16:00", "sim": 0.7254902124404907, "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-09", "textStart": 127, "amb": false, "textEnd": 141}], "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8860548", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "id": 25, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "id": 28, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "id": 36, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "id": 220, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "id": 224, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Fantasy", "id": 383, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

Doug Hood\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nNineteen years ago it was the ''Beast of the East'' capturing the imagination of fans everywhere, as Toms River East American made it to the Little League World Series and returned home as world champions two weeks later.\n\nNow it's the ''Boys of Summer'' trying to recreate the magic of 1998, as Holbrook made the trip from Bristol, Pa., where they won the Mid-Atlantic Region Saturday night with an 8-3 win over Thurmont, Md., to Williamsport, Pa. on Sunday morning.\n\nNot only are there some similarities to the two teams on the field, there's a link to the glory days of Little League baseball in Ocean County, when Toms River East American reached the World Series three times between 1995 and 1999. Many of the Holbrook players having worked with the Frazier brothers, including Todd, the Yankees third baseman and star of the 1998 team, in Toms River.\n\n''I'm really excited about it. I'm happy for them,'' said Todd Frazier last week, noting that he had worked with Holbrook's slugging shortstop Chris Cartnick, who slammed four home runs in region play.\n\n''They swept through the whole bracket, they've got a really good chance and I hope they make it because that'd be exciting - not only for the town and Ocean County too, but for New Jersey as well.''\n\nUnlike the Toms River East American team, which experienced a hitting slump over the final three games of the regional before breaking out by winning a 13-9, 11-inning slugfest in their first game in Williamsport, Holbrook has been crushing the ball, scoring 43 runs in four games in Bristol.\n\n''We started working with (the Fraziers) when we were like 8-years-old,'' said Cartnick, who had a solo homer Saturday night. ''It's been good.''\n\nHolbrook is headed to Little League World Series\n\n''(The Frazier's) are really good,'' added Holbrook manager Rob Grano. ''They've been following us, and we talk to Charlie and Jeff quite a lot. They have a good philosophy and they're good guys.\n\nHolbrook Little League heads to Williamsport, looking like team of destiny\n\n''Todd has been to Holbrook, he's been to games, and he knows what's going on right now.''\n\nThe question now is whether this Holbrook team, the first from the area since Toms River National made it to the World Series in 2010, can slug its way through the United States bracket, beginning with Thursday afternoon's (3 p.m.) showdown against Fairfield, Conn., which is unbeaten this summer.\n\nHolbrook Little League wins Mid-Atlantic Regional title Fullscreen 8/12/2017 Mike Orazzi | Staff New Jersey celebrates after winning the Mid-Atlantic Regional Final at the Eastern Regional Little League Tournament at Breen Field in Bristol Saturday night.

Doug Hood\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nNineteen years ago it was the ''Beast of the East'' capturing the imagination of fans everywhere, as Toms River East American made it to the Little League World Series and returned home as world champions two weeks later.\n\nNow it's the ''Boys of Summer'' trying to recreate the magic of 1998, as Holbrook made the trip from Bristol, Pa., where they won the Mid-Atlantic Region Saturday night with an 8-3 win over Thurmont, Md., to Williamsport, Pa. on Sunday morning.\n\nNot only are there some similarities to the two teams on the field, there's a link to the glory days of Little League baseball in Ocean County, when Toms River East American reached the World Series three times between 1995 and 1999. Many of the Holbrook players having worked with the Frazier brothers, including Todd, the Yankees third baseman and star of the 1998 team, in Toms River.\n\n''I'm really excited about it. I'm happy for them,'' said Todd Frazier last week, noting that he had worked with Holbrook's slugging shortstop Chris Cartnick, who slammed four home runs in region play.\n\n''They swept through the whole bracket, they've got a really good chance and I hope they make it because that'd be exciting - not only for the town and Ocean County too, but for New Jersey as well.''\n\nUnlike the Toms River East American team, which experienced a hitting slump over the final three games of the regional before breaking out by winning a 13-9, 11-inning slugfest in their first game in Williamsport, Holbrook has been crushing the ball, scoring 43 runs in four games in Bristol.\n\n''We started working with (the Fraziers) when we were like 8-years-old,'' said Cartnick, who had a solo homer Saturday night. ''It's been good.''\n\nHolbrook is headed to Little League World Series\n\n''(The Frazier's) are really good,'' added Holbrook manager Rob Grano. ''They've been following us, and we talk to Charlie and Jeff quite a lot. They have a good philosophy and they're good guys.\n\nHolbrook Little League heads to Williamsport, looking like team of destiny\n\n''Todd has been to Holbrook, he's been to games, and he knows what's going on right now.''\n\nThe question now is whether this Holbrook team, the first from the area since Toms River National made it to the World Series in 2010, can slug its way through the United States bracket, beginning with Thursday afternoon's (3 p.m.) showdown against Fairfield, Conn., which is unbeaten this summer.\n\nHolbrook Little League wins Mid-Atlantic Regional title Fullscreen 8/12/2017 Mike Orazzi | Staff New Jersey celebrates after winning the Mid-Atlantic Regional Final at the Eastern Regional Little League Tournament at Breen Field in Bristol Saturday night.

They also lost a game in pool play at what was then the East Regional.

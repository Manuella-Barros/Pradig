Aspinall has been repeatedly calling out Jones for quite some time now.\n\nThe current heavyweight champion of the UFC was supposed to defend his title against Stipe Miocic at UFC 295 in November last year. Nevertheless, Jones' injured pectoral muscle prompted him to withdraw from the fight.\n\nAs a result, Aspinall came into the picture to challenge the original backup, Sergei Pavlovich, for the vacant heavyweight title on short notice. The British fighter secured the interim title after knocking out Pavlovich less than a minute into the first round.\n\nFollowing his victory, Aspinall pushed for a fight to unify the titles with Jones. But 'Bones' turned down the request and said he would like to reschedule his fight with Miocic.\n\nIn a recent interview with TNT Sports, Aspinall shared his thoughts on an undisputed title fight against Jones:\n\n''If we can get old mate Jon to ever sign a contract with my name on the other side of the contract, I'll talk about him for hours on this show. But right now, the guy is playing games again. Trying to convince the public what he wants and what he doesn't want. Which he does really, really well.

But the UFC interim heavyweight champion was disappointed when 'Bones' expressed his desire to face Alex Pereira.\n\nDuring a fan interaction, the UFC heavyweight champion expressed interest in a bigger fight with Pereira, especially after the Brazilian's victory at UFC 300.

However, a pectoral injury suffered whilst training forced Jones to bow out of the bout. That paved the way for Tom Aspinall to step in and claim the interim heavyweight title with a stunning 69-second KO of Sergei Pavlovich.\n\nAs it stands, Aspinall will defend his interim title before Jones returns to defend the undisputed belt. That has some fight fans suggesting that the Salford, England native is the true heavyweight king, relegating Jones to the role of interim champion.\n\nWhen one fan online suggested this, noting that Jones simply \"won a vacant belt,\" 'Bones' snapped back writing: \"Lol I went into the cage a champion, I left the cage that night a champion.\"\n\nEven though a fight between Jon Jones and Tom Aspinall should be top priority for the UFC, it appears as though 'Bones' has absolutely no interest in fighting the UK-based star, even if he gets past the 41-year-old Miocic later this year.\n\nInstead, Jones is either toying with retirement or a heavyweight title clash with fellow two-division titleholder Alex Pereira. Taking to social media, 'Bones' gauged interest from fans, suggesting that a superfight fight against 'Poatan' would be the biggest fight the UFC could make in the division, completely snubbing Aspinall in the process.\n\n\"If Alex P became champion of the heavyweight division, would you guys consider him the GOAT?\" Jones asked on X. \"Being back in the gym has got me thinking differently. That fight after Stipe maybe the next biggest move I could possibly make.This killer has already defeated so many champions, and is already considered a legend to millions around the world.

In November 2023, Jones was scheduled to defend his heavyweight title for the first time in the UFC 295 main event. Unfortunately, 'Bones' suffered a torn pectoral muscle and couldn't fight, leading to his legacy matchup against Stipe Miocic being postponed.\n\nThe UFC needed a high-profile fight on short notice to improve the UFC 295 pay-per-view quality. As a result, Tom Aspinall and Sergei Pavlovich fought for the interim heavyweight title, with Aspinall winning by first-round knockout.\n\nSince then, Aspinall and his fans have called for a fight between him and Jones to determine the undisputed heavyweight champion. Meanwhile, 'Bones' and Dana White have remained consistent with their interest to re-schedule the matchup against Miocic.\n\nEarlier today, Jones was interacting with fans on Twitter when one person had this to say in the comment section:\n\n\"They should have never made the interim belt in the first place just to save the event, horrible decision by the UFC\"\n\nJon Jones responded by saying:\n\n\"UFC is a brilliant company, did what they had to do to save the event. But I do agree with you, it definitely confused a bunch of UK fans, got them entitled thinking their boy really is the champion. It reminds me of when DC was the \"champion\" during my absence.\"\n\nJon Jones claims his next opponent is a \"pretty clear decision\"\n\nJon Jones discussed several potential opponents for his next fight, including Stipe Miocic, Tom Aspinall, and Alex Pereira. Nonetheless, the UFC heavyweight champion hasn't steered away from his and Dana White's plan of fighting Miocic, which he reiterated on Twitter earlier today:\n\n\"I'm in the middle of a pretty clear decision... stick to exact and original plans, and fight the man with all the accolades. Or, completely disregard all of the Stipe training I've put in and fight another potential hype train that may not even be around in three years.\"\n\nJones continued:\n\n\"I am not changing my plans for anyone.

However, with the reigning champion Francis Ngannou leaving to pursue boxing and the PFL, he was forced to fight for a vacant belt.\n\nJones faced Ciryl Gane and submitted him within a round, but many felt that it wasn't a legitimate world title win. Ngannou had already handed Gane a first professional loss, and it is believed that he wasn't the true top contender in the division.\n\nAfter defeating Gane, Jones was due to face the former champion Stipe Miocic, who is widely considered the greatest heavyweight in UFC history. But an injury forced him out of that fight and the emergence of Tom Aspinall as interim champion has fans clamouring for a different fight.\n\nMany feel that after three years out of action and turning 41-years-old, Miocic is no longer the force he was previously. And they believe that Aspinall is the rightful heavyweight champion having taken out a number of top ranked contenders on route to his interim belt.\n\nLast night, one fan wrote to Jones with a trolling message telling him that he \"won an interim belt\". The fighter responded with a laugh, telling the user: \"Lol I went into the cage champion, I left the cage that night a champion.\"\n\nLater asked why he engages with trolls online, Jones replied: \"I find it fun and somewhat educational, it's good to know what the haters are thinking. And besides it too easy, this is my game.\"\n\nJones is set to return this year, and plans to defend his belt on the big stage at least once, if not more. However, Aspinall seems to be third on his list of priorities, with Miocic and light-heavyweight champion Alex Pereira both appearing as big prospects for a title shot.\n\nThe Brit has been pursuing Jones ever since winning his interim belt in November, but it doesn't look like he'll get the shot. Speaking with fans on X last week, Jones explained why he feels Pereira makes more sense as a contender.\n\n\"If Alex P became champion of the heavyweight division, would you guys consider him the GOAT?\" He asked. \"Being back in the gym has got me thinking differently. That fight after Stipe maybe the next biggest move I could possibly make.\n\n\"This killer has already defeated so many champions, and is already considered a legend to millions around the world. The most massive fight the UFC could make. Give Alex a chance to avenge all those great Brazilian champions I've defeated.\"\n\nAspinall and Jones came head-to-head at a recent event in the UK, but the American had no interest in a meeting between the two. They eventually did take a photo together, but he refused to pose for a face-off.\n\n\"I wanted to face off,\" Aspinall said during a recent appearance on The MMA Hour. \"Jon's smart... Jon will not say anywhere, you can't find it, it's not out there, that he will fight me. He won't say it anywhere publicly. He won't say it.\n\n\"You can't find a clip, a quote, nothing, anywhere, of Jon Jones saying, 'One day I'm going to fight Tom Aspinall, and I'm going to freaking beat the brakes off him. That's what I'm going to do.' That doesn't exist.\n\n\"He doesn't want any evidence, anywhere, of him agreeing to any kind of fight with me, because he doesn't want to go back on that. He doesn't want to do a faceoff because that promotes a potential fight.\n\n\"When I ask him, 'Jon are we going to do this?' He doesn't say, 'Absolutely. Let me get Stipe out of the way and we'll do it.' He'll instead say, 'Oh, maybe one day.' Because he doesn't want that quote of, 'We're going to fight one day.'

Aspinall makes history by becoming first British heavyweight champ, Jones focused on Miocic clash. Interim champ Aspinall awaits title defense at UFC 304, while Jones eyes showdown with Miocic or Pereira.\n\nThe UFC heavyweight division is abuzz with anticipation as former champion Jon Jones hinted at his much-awaited comeback after a hiatus of over a year. Jones revealed that negotiations for his return were underway with a tentative date and verbal agreement in place awaiting an official announcement.\n\nJones, who has been sidelined due to two surgeries, including a torn pectoral muscle, was originally slated to face former heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic in a highly anticipated bout last November. However, fate intervened, forcing Jones to withdraw from the match. Miocic, refusing a replacement opponent, led to the UFC arranging an interim heavyweight title bout between Russian contender Sergei Pavlovich and British sensation Tom Aspinall.\n\nOn short notice, Aspinall clinched victory over Pavlovich in just over a minute, etching his name in history as the first British fighter to claim heavyweight gold in the UFC. Meanwhile, Jones underwent surgeries to address his injuries and has teased some upcoming fights in his pending return to action.\n\nRelated 10 Best Performances Of Jon Jones' UFC Career, According To Stats Jon 'Bones' Jones has gone on a dominant run with a record 13 belt defences, these are his best performances.\n\nJon Jones Claims He Has A Fight Date\n\nThe UFC Champ Did Not Mention An Opponent\n\nIn a tweet, Jones said UFC CEO Dana White will announce his fight date when asked by a fan on X about when he will return. \"I have a date, I'll let boss man Dana announce that.\" When pressed on revealing the fight date, Jones revealed that he only has a verbal agreeement.\n\n\"Nope, as right now it's just a verbal agreement.\" Noticely Jones did not mention Stipe Miocic who is he expected to fight. White was adamant that he wanted to make the fight between the two legends after the interim champ Tom Aspinall demanded he gets the first crack at Jones.\n\nDespite Aspinall's interim champion status and a ready-to-fight attitude, Jones has shown reluctance towards a potential matchup with the British fighter, emphasizing his desire for a showdown with Miocic.\n\nRecently, Jones also teased a fight with the UFC light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira. In a lengthy series of social media posts, Jones laid out his case for why he'd rather defend his UFC heavyweight belt against Pereira following his expected bout against Stipe Miocic rather than unifying the title against interim champ Tom Aspinall.\n\nHe argued that a fight with the Brazilian champion would be a blockbuster event than fighting the lesser known British champion.\n\nIn the meantime, Aspinall finds himself in a precarious position, expected to defend his interim title, possibly at UFC 304 in Manchester this summer. Should this materialize, it's likely that the Jones-Miocic showdown will take precedence, leaving Aspinall to fend off potential challengers in his pursuit to solidify his status as a heavyweight

With Jones sidelined, the UFC opted to book Aspinall in an interim title fight against Sergei Pavlovich to help save the pay-per-view, which took an understandable hit with the original headliner falling apart.\n\nEver since Aspinall made quick work of Pavlovich, he's been calling for a fight against Jones but the reigning UFC heavyweight champion remains adamant that he's focused only on Miocic next when he returns from injury.\n\n\"I'm in the middle of a pretty clear decision,\" Jones wrote. \"Stick to exact and original plans, and fight the man with all the accolades or completely disregard all of the Stipe training I've put in and fight another potential hype train that may not even be around in three years.\n\n\"I am not changing my plans for anyone. Stipe is over there as the best heavyweight ever working his ass off. I'm gonna give that man what he wants, and I'm going to claim another head. Whatever comes next comes next.\"\n\nIn a perfect world, Jones wouldn't have suffered an injury and he would have faced Miocic in 2023, which would have then lined up other contenders like Aspinall for a shot at the belt.\n\nWith Jones sidelined, the UFC opted to introduce the interim title, which muddied the waters when it comes to deciding the next title challenger. For his part, Jones understands why the UFC made the interim title fight, but he doesn't agree with the decision because of the shadow cast over his already expected matchup against Miocic.\n\n\"UFC is a brilliant company, did what they had to do to save the event,\" Jones wrote. \"But I do agree with you, it definitely confused a bunch of UK fans, got them entitled thinking their boy really is the champion. It reminds me of when [Daniel Cormier] was the 'champion' during my absence.\"\n\nJones also disagrees with the notion that he's holding up the heavyweight division because he's waiting to fight Miocic later this year.\n\nWhile he's resolved in the decision to make that his next fight, Jones believes that Aspinall could and should still be fighting in his absence, which hasn't happened yet. Aspinall hasn't fought since this past November when he claimed the interim title in 69 seconds.\n\n\"I think it's great to see the UFC showing such a level of respect to their champion athletes,\" Jones said. \"I've dedicated my entire adult life to the sport, I think I'm allowed to get hurt once. This injury was supposed to take up to a year to heal, but I'm already back in pre-camp, I'm committed to progression.\n\n\"And besides, there's not many people in the heavyweight division right now that are capable of creating super fights. If Alex [Pereira] doesn't move up in the near future, you're not really missing out on much. The belt will just be tossed around like usual business.\"\n\nWhile Aspinall has stated that he's more than willing to stay active in Jones' absence with all signs pointing to his return at UFC 304, which takes place in Manchester, England, in July, he remains unbooked.\n\nIn Jones' mind, it looks like Aspinall is sitting and waiting for a title unification bout rather than just facing the next contender in line.\n\n\"Would you agree that it's just as selfish to have a completely healthy [interim] champion who is only 30 years old, sitting out and waiting to fight the winner of a 42 and 36 year old,\" Jones wrote. \"Who literally actually already committed to fighting each other? No one stopping anyone, I'm on a mission.\"\n\nJones also addressed the persistent rumors that he may actually call it a career after facing Miocic, who he's long targeted thanks to the Ohio native owning the record for the most successful UFC heavyweight title defenses (3).\n\nJones views Miocic as a huge jewel to add to his crown as arguably the greatest mixed martial artist in history and there might not be much left to achieve after that.\n\n\"I was talking about retirement after Stipe way before there was an [interim] champion announced,\" Jones said. \"I would literally be in the same exact position if Sergei [had the interim title]. I love how the UK have convinced themselves I'm afraid of their [interim] champion. Opens me up to a whole new fanbase. They all know who the actual champion is.\"\n\nAs of now, there's still no word when Jones may fight Miocic, although it's likely the fight happens in either September, November, or December based on the current UFC schedule. With pay-per-views happening in England in July, Australia in August, and Abu Dhabi in October, the domestic schedule only leaves UFC 306 at Sphere in Las Vegas in September, an expected event at Madison Square Garden in New York in November, and the year-end event usually held in Las Vegas in December as options.", "source": {"uri": "mmafighting.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MMA Fighting"}, "authors": [{"uri": "damon_martin@mmafighting.com", "name": "Damon Martin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interim championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_Miocic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stipe Miocic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Aspinall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Aspinall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Pavlovich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Pavlovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cormier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Cormier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison_Square_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madison Square Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abu Dhabi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pNGWZBmkVSlDO_1W82hc8a-udqQ=/0x0:3000x1500/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25440877/1248061015.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543383", "eventUri": "eng-9543383", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

There is a verbal agreement reportedly in place for his return to the Octagon -- one that UFC boss Dana White will announce. It is highly likely that UFC will re-book a fight between Jones and Stipe Miocic.\n\nUFC heavyweight champion, Jon Jones, has been out of the Octagon for over a year following two surgeries but he could be close to a return, as he posted Sunday on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, that he has a date and verbal agreement in place.\n\nJon Jones Has a Fight Date Jones has been out of action for over a year following double surgery\n\nJon Jones was originally scheduled to face former UFC heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic back in November in a dream fight, but a torn pectoral muscle forced Jones to withdraw from the bout. Miocic did not accept a replacement opponent, which led to the UFC making an interim heavyweight title bout between Russian knock-out artist Sergei Pavlovich and British star Tom Aspinall. Aspinall made light work of Pavlovich, knocking him out in just over a minute, becoming the first Brit to win heavyweight gold in the UFC.\n\nFollowing Jones' torn pectoral surgery in October, the American decided to \"kill two birds with one stone\" and undergo a separate surgery to shave down bone spurs in his left elbow whilst also recovering from his pectoral surgery. There has been a lot of talk and controversy around Jones' impending return to the Octagon as he has shot down and shown zero interest in a fight with Aspinall, despite the Brit being the interim champion of the division. Jones has also been adamant that a Miocic fight is the one to make next despite the ageing nature of the opponent, and the fact he's not fought in over three years.\n\nJones said on X that he had a fight date lined up and, when asked to give a date, Jones said there was only a verbal agreement in place at that stage. 'Bones' returned to full MMA training last week and seems to be targeting a return to the Octagon late this summer.\n\nRelated Jon Jones Breaks Silence Following Return to Full MMA Training Jon Jones, UFC heavyweight champion, breaks silence following his return to full MMA training Who Will Jon Jones Fight Next? Jones has shot down suggestions he fight interim champ Tom Aspinall next\n\nThe big question ahead of Jones' return is \"who will he fight?\"\n\nInterim champion status should mean a challenger is ready and raring to go, which is the case with Aspinall, however, that does not seem to be the case at heavyweight. UFC president Dana White has shot down the idea of Aspinall challenging Jones next as he wants to re-book the fight between Jones and Miocic, which was originally scheduled for UFC 295. This left Aspinall in a position where he will likely have to defend his interim title. He is rumored to defend this for the first time at UFC 304 which is taking place at the Co-Op Live Arena in Manchester this summer. Should that transpire, it's likely we'll get the Jones vs Miocic bout first.\n\nRelated Tom Aspinall Continues to Slam 'Absolutely Terrible' UFC 304 Start Time Tom Aspinall has continued to criticise the UFC for their decision regarding the start time of UFC 304, taking place in Manchester, England.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_Miocic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stipe Miocic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jon Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_White", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dana White"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Aspinall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Aspinall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Pavlovich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Pavlovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interim championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mixcollage-06-may-2024-08-41-am-4860.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543383", "eventUri": "eng-9543383", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Jones, 36, noted that verbal agreements are in place for his return bout and first heavyweight title defense. Rather than spoil the surprise of who his challenger will be, \"Bones\" opted to let UFC CEO Dana White reveal everything when the time is right.\n\nJones' tease came shortly after expressing his belief that a title fight against light heavyweight king Alex Pereira would be significantly larger than an eagerly anticipated unification clash against the interim heavyweight titleholder, Tom Aspinall. The latter party, unfortunately, has never appeared to be the next option and after seeing Jones' Twitter tirade shared that he had no update for his immediate future. Although the comments threw the majority of the online community into a frenzy, Jones' old rival Cormier liked to see the play made.\n\n\"Not everybody hits like Francis Ngannou or Alex Pereira, but if you can get away from that and manage that, it's much less risky than fighting a guy with a full skillset that's complete. That's exactly what Tom Aspinall looks to be,\" Cormier said on Good Guy / Bad Guy. \"I love what Jon is doing in terms of being smart, finding the right matchup. I don't know that it will fly.\n\n\"These athletes are much smarter today than they were before and I believe it makes for the sport to be even more interesting. I love it. I love what Jon is doing. I love what Alex is doing, but I think Jon is choosing: 'Dude, I'm not fighting Tom Aspinall. Have you seen Tom Aspinall?'\"\n\nIt was a somewhat counterproductive and unexpected move from Jones -- unless the fight actually does happen -- which led to many more claims of him being afraid of a fight with the talented Aspinall. Historically, the interim champion can expect their champion vs. champion collision to be forthcoming because of the absence that led to their title's creation.\n\nThe promotion and White have maintained that the originally planned Stipe Miocic fight at UFC 295 last November will be rebooked for Jones. Speculation around the time leading up to it was that it very well could have, and still might be, Jones' last fight. Another past opponent of Jones', Cormier's co-host Chael Sonnen, simply sees Jones' interest in Pereira as an overall good sign more than anything.\n\nUnfortunately for Miocic, he becomes less and less of the matchup the world wants to see as time goes on.\n\n\"You can call Jon Jones a lot of things, I'll look the other way, I'll even help you do it. You call Jon Jones scared, I'm not part of that,\" Sonnen said. \"It's just not true. This is the second time in as many weeks that Jon Jones is talking about opponents that are not Stipe. Whether it was the faceoff with Aspinall or now all of the sudden he's bringing up this huge payday with Pereira. He is starting to talk and warm to the idea that his next fight is not his last. That is the common theme here.\"\n\nGo to Twitter, use the #MorningReport hashtag, or find one of my tweets with it, and drop me a jam you're currently really into. I'll pick the best one alongside my daily choice and give you a shoutout!

As many fans likely remember, that UFC 295 bout was a short-notice one for Tom Aspinall. After Jon Jones withdrew from his title defense against Stipe Miocic, he stepped up on two weeks' notice to fight for interim gold.\n\nSix months removed from that knockout, Tom Aspinall and Jon Jones are each working toward their returns. However, they won't be fighting each other. The interim champion has been linked to a rematch with Curtis Blaydes in July, while 'Bones' is expected to fight Miocic sometime in the late summer. The expectation was that if both men won, they would fight at some point in 2024.\n\nHowever, Jon Jones has been providing a lot of pushback on that idea. Earlier this week on X, the UFC heavyweight champion released a series of posts about Tom Aspinall. 'Bones' stated that in his view, a fight with light-heavyweight titleholder Alex Pereira would be a far bigger fight. While that's debatable, his comments have seemingly irritated Aspinall.\n\nRELATED: CHAEL SONNEN REFLECTS ON LOSS TO JON JONES ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF UFC 159: \"I HAD A HIGHER JUICE CONCENTRATE THAN TROPICANA!\"\n\nIn a recent appearance on TNT Sports, Tom Aspinall was asked about Jon Jones' recent comments. There, the UFC's interim heavyweight champion stated that he doesn't really care what the legend says until he signs a deal to fight him. However, at this point, he doubts he ever will.\n\n\"Yeah. It has nothing to do with me, mate. If we can get old Jon to ever sign a contract with my name on the other side of the contract, I'll talk about him for hours on this show. Hours.\" Tom Aspinall responded when asked about Jon Jones' comments. \"But right now, the guy's playing games again. Trying to convince the public of what he wants, and what he doesn't want. Which he does really well.\"\n\nHe continued, \"As I said, we can chat about Jon if he, if and when, he ever signs a contract with my name on the other side of it.

Generally, that would guarantee a shot at the undisputed title holder, but not so much in this case.\n\nInstead, Jones seems to be more keen on facing either 41-year-old two-time former champion Stipe Miocic or light-heavyweight champion Alex Pereira. Both are bigger names as far as the iconic New Yorker is concerned, and should skip the queue for a shot of his belt.\n\nWith his next fight already booked in for UFC 304 in July, it seems almost certain that Aspinall will not be facing Jones any time soon. But it is a rare situation for an interim champion to defend their belt while the undisputed is cleared to compete, as Jones now is.\n\nIt seems more likely that the Brit will rematch Curtis Blaydes or top contender Ciryl Gane, who Jones already stopped within a round to win the vacant belt at UFC 285 last year. Meanwhile, the American is keen to face either Miocic or Pereira, and appears to be regularly rubbishing Aspinall's chances.\n\nSpeaking with TNT Sports recently, Aspinall expressed his frustrations and noted that he has limited interest in obsessively commenting on Jones. \"If we can get old mate Jon Jones to ever sign a contract with my name on the other side of the contract, I'll talk about him for hours on this show,\" he explained.\n\n\"Hours. But right now, the guy is playing games again. Trying to convince the public what he wants and what he doesn't want. Which he does really, really well.\n\n\"As I said, we can chat about Jon, if and when he ever signs a contract with my name on the other side of it. Because right now, let's be honest, it's not looking very likely.\"\n\nThe heavyweight champion has been taking to social media in recent weeks to speak with fans directly, and has made his feelings clear. He sees Aspinall as a regional star in the UK, without enough name value worldwide to add much to his legacy.\n\n\"If Alex P became champion of the heavyweight division, would you guys consider him the GOAT?\" He asked fans during a multi-tweet discussion last week, before teasing that he could take that fight after facing Miocic, meaning a two-fight plan.\n\n\"Being back in the gym has got me thinking differently.That fight after Stipe maybe the next biggest move I could possibly make. This killer has already defeated so many champions, and is already considered a legend to millions around the world.\n\n\"The most massive fight the UFC could make. Give Alex a chance to avenge all those great Brazilian champions I've defeated.\"\n\nJones was then pushed back by fans, who noted that Aspinall deserves the shot as interim champion. But he insisted that the potential of a legacy-building bout for both he and Pereira, who is a fan favourite that has headlined around the world, would be more intriguing.\n\n\"It would be absolutely massive,\" he insisted in a later tweet. \"A guy with a chance to be three division champion and a goat versus the actual goat. Same age, different strengths.\n\n\"No one can argue that that would be the biggest fight in MMA history. There's absolutely no fight that generates a payday like that. Marketing would be insane.\"\n\nHe later wrote off Aspinall, adding: \"You actually think me fighting Tom would be more massive than Alex and I colliding? Tom only matters in the UK, newsflash. Pereira is one of the most polarizing figures this sport has seen.\n\n\"Tom's a contender who won a belt against another contender. We had to save Madison Square Gardens main event. I'm thinking dollar signs, legacy, big picture here. Not what UK fans are dying to see.

Jones has shown interest in a potential fight against Pereira due to strategic advantages in avoiding risky match-ups. Cormier has commended both Jones and Pereira for smart decision-making in choosing opponents based on strengths and skillsets.\n\nDespite once being the most bitter of rivals, UFC Hall of Famer, commentator, and former two-division champion Daniel Cormier has branded his old rival Jon Jones as \"smart\" when it comes to selecting his next fights.\n\nJones is likely fighting heavyweight GOAT Stipe Miocic next, but has Tom Aspinall waiting in the wings to fight him and has shown big interest recently in fighting light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira.\n\nCormier: Jones Is \"Smart\" For Favouring Pereira Over Aspinall\n\nDespite the two once being arguably the most bitter rivals in UFC history, Daniel Cormier has praised the current UFC heavyweight champion Jon Jones for his tactics in choosing his upcoming fights. Over the last week or so, Jones has been active on social media, going back and forth with fans debating who he will likely fight next after he faces Stipe Miocic, which is heavily rumoured to be his next fight. Cormier has spoken about the situation on his show 'Good Guy/Bad Guy' with his co-host Chael Sonnen.\n\n'DC' has praised Jones for his approach regarding potential future fights against either one of Pereira or Aspinall and has revealed that if he was in Jones' position, he would likely do the same thing.\n\nCormier said: \"He's smart. If I'm an Olympic wrestler or a national champion, and I'm watching the landscape of things, valuing the money vs the fame, vs the championships and everything else, I'm doing exactly what Jon's doing. I'm saying to myself, 'I've been in there with the most scary, dangerous men in the world. I have been in there with extremely well-rounded guys, with tremendous kickboxers, with super heavy punchers. I've been able to manage that. But who I haven't been in there with is a guy that is a straight kickboxer.'\"\n\nDespite 'Bones' now being at a size and weight which would likely prevent him from ever making the light heavyweight limit again, Pereira has teased a move up to heavyweight a lot recently, and it seems a future fight between 'Poatan' and Jones is now a real possibility now the heavyweight champ is pushing for it.\n\nIn a string of posts on X recently, Jones claimed that Aspinall was only relevant in the UK and that a fight and win over Pereira would be much better for his legacy.\n\nRelated Jon Jones Says he Has a UFC Return Date in The Works UFC heavyweight champion Jon Jones says he has a UFC return date in the works\n\nCormier went on to say that for Jones, a fight against Pereira is \"much less risky\" than a fight against the Brit, Aspinall.\n\n\"While he has improved tremendously in his grappling, no one would ever say that's Alex Pereira's strength. His strength is his striking, and he can knock you out. Not everybody hits like Francis Ngannou or Alex Pereira, but if you can get away from that and manage that, it's much less risky than fighting a guy with a full skillset, that's complete. That's exactly what Tom Aspinall looks to be. So I love what Jon is doing in terms of being smart, finding the right match-up. I don't know that it'll fly.\"\n\nChampions Choosing Their Own Opponents Cormier believes Pereira is doing exactly what Jones is doing\n\nFollowing his quick win at UFC 300 against Jamahal Hill, Alex Pereira looks set to defend his light heavyweight title next in a rematch against Jiri Prochazka, who was also successful at UFC 300, defeating Aleksandar Rakic. Despite Magomed Ankalaev seemingly, going into UFC 300, being planned as the next fight for the winner of the main event, it seems like the Russian is once again going to be overlooked for a title shot.\n\nDaniel Cormier believes Alex Pereira is doing the same thing at light heavyweight as Jones is doing at heavyweight in terms of being smart in picking and choosing his opponents.\n\n\"Give a tip to the cap to the champion. The champ goes, 'Hey, I think Jiri Prochazka is next. Ankalaev is going to have to wait.' Smart! Alex, why would you fight Ankalaev? He's going to try and wrestle you. Go fight the dude you've knocked out already. These athletes are much smarter today than they were before, and I believe it makes the sport even more interesting. I love it. I love what Jon is doing, I love what Alex is doing, but I think Jon is choosing, 'I'm not fighting Tom Aspinall.'\"\n\nRelated Alex Pereira's Next Fight After Quick UFC 300 Win 'Revealed' UFC light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira has revealed who he is likely fighting next following his quick UFC 300 win over Jamahal Hill.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Pereira", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Pereira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Aspinall", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tom Aspinall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cormier", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Cormier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jon Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_heavyweight_(MMA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Light heavyweight (MMA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_Miocic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stipe Miocic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UFC Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chael_Sonnen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chael Sonnen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickboxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kickboxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamahal_Hill", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamahal Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji\u0159\u00ed_Proch\u00e1zka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ji\u0159\u00ed Proch\u00e1zka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magomed_Ankalaev", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Magomed Ankalaev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ngannou", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Francis Ngannou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grappling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/daniel-cormier-jon-jones-ciryl-gane-ufc-285.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543383", "eventUri": "eng-9543383", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

As usual, his X (formerly Twitter) following replied to that message with a mix of praise and disdain, leading Jon to clap back.\n\n\"I'm also not allowed to take three years to become a heavyweight and absolutely demolish my first opponent,\" he tweeted. \"Nope, that was too long. Screw the flawless Victory. 'Jones ran for three years. Too afraid of Francis.' 'He's scared of everyone we haven't seen him fight yet.'\"\n\nJones' injury has left the heavyweight division in limbo since he won the vacant title against Ciryl Gane in March 2023. Further frustrating to some fans is the GOAT contender's insistence on fighting Stipe Miocic when he's healed, not interim champion Tom Aspinall.\n\nEven if he does decide to keep fighting after the Miocic bout (which is not a certainty), he has suggested he'd rather fight light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira than unify the belts.\n\n\"Yep, Stipe and then decisions decisions,\" Jones said regarding his future. \"I'm cool with this spot.\"\n\nHe also responded to a fan who argued Ciryl Gane was a 'tailor made' opponent for him.\n\n\"Lol they all are tailor-made for me, even the close fights. I'm pretty damn good,\" he said. \"From my POV its like deja vu. Some of the most passionate fans ever believe with their whole heart that their guy is going to be the one who beats me. I make peoples' heroes look average.\"\n\nIt's clear that Jones won't be swayed from chasing the fights he wants to close his legendary career out on. That leaves Aspinall in a bit of a lurch.

Meanwhile, Aspinall can expect to also defend his title against another Heavyweight contender, which would ideally lead to a clash with the winner of Jones vs. Miocic.

Aspinall would of course like to fight the winner of that bout, but Jones has been pointedly uncommitted to the matchup. Then last week things took an even worse turn for Aspinall when Jones flat-out said he'd prefer to fight light heavyweight champion Alex Pereira.\n\nAll in all, an undisputed title shot isn't looking all that likely for Aspinall, who lamented the situation when asked about it by TNT Sports recently.\n\n\"If we can get old mate Jon to ever sign a contract with my name on the other side of the contract, I'll talk about him for hours on this show,\" Aspinall said. \"Hours.

However with 'Bones' tearing his pectoral muscle, that has been put on hold. Add Aspinall to that list and suddenly we have to ask is Jones vs Miocic happening? Daniel Cormier, meanwhile, is concerned for another reason.\n\nYes, Cormer has posed the most important question. With the likes of Pereira and Aspinall breaking down doors, \"Can Stipe (Miocic) still compete at that level?\"\n\nSpeaking to former UFC star, Ben Askren, DC had a lot to say about a possible match between Jones and Miocic. In fact, the former HW champion is of the opinion that a bout with interim champ, Tom Aspinall is the most logical solution for Jones instead of taking on a 41-year-old Miocic.\n\n\"The toughest fight and the most meaningful fight in all of fighting right now is Jon Jones-Tom Aspinall. I dont know at this point if it should be Jon Jones vs Stipe Miocic and I like Stipe, Stipe is a great guy but at that age with that much time off... I dont know. I dont know what Stipe looks like today.\"\n\nFans of Miocic might not like it, but DC has a point here.\n\nA bout with Jones on paper might be the last thing for Miocic, especially considering his age. He suffered a devastating loss in his last bout against Francis Ngannou. Not to forget, his chin has been tested a lot. Miocic might be the greatest heavyweight of all time given his well-rounded game, but time beats them all.\n\nIn fact, as for Miocic who is coming off a break to take on a killer like Jones, things might end up terribly wrong as a false move against the undisputed heavyweight champion can put him straight into retirement. As per Cormier, a bout with Aspinall is the most meaningful one, one that Jones is less likely to take up.\n\nWell, DC is bang on here as well, instead of going up against Aspinall who is a much well-rounded fighter, also in his prime, a bout against Pereira is Jones' safest bet. According to Cormier, Jones' pick is not coincidental in fact, it's more of a strategy!\n\nSpeaking on ESPN's Good Guy/Bad Guy podcast to his co-host and former UFC superstar Chael Sonnen, DC offered his take on Jones' interest in taking on Pereira instead of Aspinall. From Jones' perspective, a bout with the Brazilian who is more of a striker is a safer bet as per Cormier instead of facing a well-rounded fighter like Aspinall who is renowned for his grappling. Cormier said,\n\n\"Not everybody hits like Francis Ngannou or Alex Pereira, but if you can get away from that and manage that, it's much less risky than fighting a guy with a full skillset, that's complete. That's exactly what Tom Aspinall looks to be.\"\n\nWhile the UFC commentator believes that \"won't fly\" would have the better odds of beating Jones, he gave his former rival props for playing it smart. Meanwhile, the Brit has been poking Jones in every way possible in an effort to make him accept the fight. But even with all that, Jones' future endeavors still remain a mystery.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kishore_r@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Kishore R", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Pereira", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Pereira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_Miocic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stipe Miocic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cormier", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Cormier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jon Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Askren", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben Askren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_heavyweight_(MMA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Light heavyweight (MMA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Aspinall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Aspinall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ngannou", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francis Ngannou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chael_Sonnen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chael Sonnen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grappling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Trepanation", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Trepanation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Artists", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Artists", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/15df8466-untitled-design-73.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543383", "eventUri": "eng-9543383", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

He has seemingly accomplished everything that there is in the sport. Having conquered the light heavyweight division, he moved to the heavyweight division last year.\n\nIn his very first fight, Jones secured the heavyweight championship. Following this, he was scheduled to take on Stipe Miocic. However, he ended up suffering an injury and the fight was postponed.\n\nWhile a date for Jon Jones's fight against Stipe Miocic has not yet been confirmed, it is confirmed that the fight will happen.\n\nInterestingly, despite a date for Jones' next fight not being announced yet, there are a lot of discussions surrounding his fight following Stipe Miocic.\n\nMany suggested that Jon Jones would take on Tom Aspinall following his fight against Stipe Miocic. However, Alex Pereira's intentions of moving up to the heavyweight division might change the scenario.\n\nMoreover, it looks like Jones is more interested in a fight against Pereira than Aspinall. Speaking about the same, Daniel Cormier suggested that Jones is playing smart in terms of finding a less risky matchup and said:\n\n\"I love what Jon is doing in terms of being smart, finding the right matchup.

Jokingly, he gave Jones props for pursuing Pereira instead of competing for the unification of the titles against UFC interim heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall.\n\nAt UFC 295 in November last year, the UFC heavyweight champion was scheduled to defend his belt against Stipe Miocic. However, Jones had to withdraw from the fight due to a pectoral muscle injury.\n\n'Bones' announced that he intends to postpone his fight with Miocic. He also hinted at a potential fight against the reigning UFC light heavyweight champion following his highly anticipated fight with Miocic.\n\nIn a post on X, Jones hailed Pereira's rapid ascension in the UFC and hinted that a bout with 'Poatan' would be historic. He also acknowledged Pereira's ambition of becoming the first UFC fighter to win titles in three divisions.\n\n''It would be absolutely massive. A guy with a chance to be three division champion and a goat versus the actual goat. Same age, different strengths. No one can argue that that would be the biggest fight in MMA history. There's absolutely no fight that generates a payday like that. Marketing would be insane.''\n\nIn a recent episode of Good Guy/Bad Guy, Cormier spoke with Chael Sonnen about Jones' choice to go after a fight with Pereira.\n\n''He's smart. If I'm an Olympic wrestler or a national champion, and I'm watching the landscape of things, valuing the money vs. the fame, vs. the championships and everything else, I'm doing exactly what Jon's doing.''\n\nCormier additionally gave a backhanded compliment to Jones. He indicated Jones is wise in going for Pereira rather than Aspinall since the latter has a broader skill set. 'DC' also pointed out that Pereira's major weapon is his ability to hit hard, which Jones can try to avoid.\n\nCormier said:\n\n''It's much less risky than fighting a guy with a full skillset, that's complete. That's exactly what Tom Aspinall looks to be.''\n\nCheck out Daniel Cormier's comments below (13:18):\n\nAlex Pereira is excited about the prospect of a super fight with Jon Jones\n\nRecently, Alex Pereira discussed his desire for a possible super fight with Jon Jones.\n\nWhile speaking to MMA Junkie's Nolan King, Pereira opened up about a hypothetical fight against Jones and his expectations for the outcome. He stated that he had no personal grudge against 'Bones' and that, should it happen, UFC fans would see an extremely thrilling fight.\n\n''If this [fight] ends up happening, I believe it'd be fantastic. I would be looking forward to it...It would be a war. It would be a very entertaining showcase for the fans. With all the experience and skillset that Jon [Jones] has, but also with all the abilities I've been growing during my MMA career...I think it would be a great championship [fight] and everyone would be entertained by that.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swagat_kumar_jena@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Swagat Kumar Jena", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Pereira", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Pereira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_Miocic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stipe Miocic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cormier", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Cormier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jon Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Aspinall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Aspinall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_heavyweight_(MMA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Light heavyweight (MMA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chael_Sonnen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chael Sonnen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMAjunkie.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MMAjunkie.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Spirit/Fight_Songs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Spirit/Fight Songs", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/501dc-17152363350990-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543383", "eventUri": "eng-9543383", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

That night saw Stipe Miocic badly knocked out by 'The Predator', avenging his prior loss to the champion. Over three years removed from that defeat, the former titleholder is preparing for a return to the octagon.\n\nStipe Miocic was originally scheduled to meet Jon Jones last November in the main event of UFC 295. However, just weeks before the event, 'Bones' suffered a torn pectoral muscle and was forced to withdraw. As a result, Miocic also withdrew. In their place was an interim title bout between Tom Aspinall and Sergei Pavlovich.\n\nThe interim championship was later won by the aforementioned Aspinall. With Jon Jones still healing from injury, the British fighter has been vocal about his intent to defend the title. While he was offered a fight against Stipe Miocic at UFC 300, the former champion shot down the offer. Speaking on a recent edition of the JAXXON Podcast with Rampage Jackson, the 41-year-old discussed his layoff.\n\nRELATED: CHAEL SONNEN OFFERS TO FIGHT JORGE MASVIDAL AFTER NATE DIAZ BOXING MATCH: \"I WILL BE JUICED UP AND I WILL BEAT HIM ANYTIME\"\n\nThere, Stipe Miocic confirmed that he had no intention of fighting anyone but Jon Jones next. While he's shown interest in a future fight with Tom Aspinall to unify the gold, the 41-year-old doesn't want to fight the Brit next. As far as Miocic is concerned, 'Bones' is going to be next for him, and there's zero question about that.\n\n\"You're damn right.\" Stipe Miocic responded when asked if he was going to be Jon Jones' first fight back from injury. \"I want that [fight]. No, I'm going to wait. I don't care [about fighting anyone else]. I want that fight.\"\n\nAs far as Stipe Miocic's fight with Jon Jones is concerned, it is currently unbooked. However, later in the interview on the JAXXON Podcast, the former champion revealed that he's in active discussions with the UFC for the contest.

Interim heavyweight champion Aspinall has complained about the decision, but is expected to fight on the event. His rival, Jon Jones, has now weighed in on the issue via social media.\n\nUFC Heavyweight Champion Jon Jones couldn't resist wading into the controversy surrounding the start time of UFC 304 by taking a swipe at rival Tom Aspinall. The world's leading MMA confirmed its return to the UK last month, with the pay-per-view event set to take place at the new Co-op Live Arena in Manchester on the 27th of July.\n\nHowever, after the excitement surrounding the announcement started to cool down, it became apparent that the event would be timed to cater for an American audience. This detail did not go down well with current interim heavyweight champion Aspinall.\n\nThe Time at Which UFC 304 Will Start Has Angered Aspinall The potential headliner was not amused\n\nThe UFC's refusal to adjust their usual pay-per-view timings means that the UFC 304 main card won't start until 3am local time - a decision that Englishman Aspinall recently took issue with.\n\n\"Obviously, predominantly, it's an American audience, so I understand that they want to sell to them. But why can't they sell to them in the afternoon, which is our evening time? Why can't the Americans watch it in the afternoon? And the UK fans, the Manchester fans, the European fans can all fly to this event [and] sell out this new arena. I mean, it's going to sell out regardless, mate. We're very, very, very, very lucky to have a pay-per-view event in Manchester. Very lucky. But it's UK MMA... let's put it on UK time.\"\n\nJon Jones Responds to Aspinall's Complaints\n\nWhile Aspinall's opinion has received plenty of support among UFC fans in the UK, Jones has been less than sympathetic on the issue. The American star recently stated that he had agreed a return date with the promotion - although it seems highly unlikely that he will face Aspinall at the Manchester event - particularly given his response to the timings controversy.\n\nIn a screenshot taken of a reply on Instagram, Jones wrote from his official account: \"When will this man realize that he doesn't call any shots\", accompanied by a laughing face emoji.\n\nIt is assumed that Jones and Aspinall will eventually face off to determine an undisputed UFC Heavyweight Champion, However, the promotion has given no indication of when that fight might take place. By Jones' logic above, he'll be the one deciding when and where it happens.\n\nIn the presumed absence of Jones, Aspinall is expected to defend his interim heavyweight title at UFC 304 - with Curtis Blaydes' name being thrown around as a potential opponent. The 31-year-old suffered the only loss of his UFC career to date in 2022 when he sustained an injury in the opening seconds of a bout against Blaydes. A shot at redemption could be on the cards.\n\nRelated Tom Aspinall Continues to Slam 'Absolutely Terrible' UFC 304 Start Time Tom Aspinall has continued to criticise the UFC for their decision regarding the start time of UFC 304, taking place in Manchester, England.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-view", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pay-per-view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jon Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Co-operative_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Co-operative Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Aspinall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Aspinall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Time in the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amway Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Blaydes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Blaydes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Submission_Fighting_and_MMA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Submission Fighting and MMA", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/jon-jones-v-aspinall.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543383", "eventUri": "eng-9543383", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-27", "textStart": 674, "textEnd": 686}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

That win at UFC 285 crowned Jon Jones as the new heavyweight champion, winning the title Francis Ngannou vacated in January. Following the win, the newly crowned titleholder signed a deal to face Stipe Miocic in November.\n\nHowever, that fight never happened. Weeks before UFC 295, Jon Jones tore his pectoral muscle in training and withdrew from the title defense. As a result, Stipe Miocic was also pulled from the card, and Tom Aspinall faced Sergei Pavlovich for interim gold. The Brit wound up winning the title by first-round knockout.\n\nWhile there was some speculation that Jon Jones would face the interim champion, Dana White later confirmed that wasn't the case. Over the last few months, the UFC CEO has repeatedly stated that Stipe Miocic is next in line for the champion.

However, the same can't be said for the former heavyweight champion. Whenever Miocic fights next, it will be his first bout since a second-round knockout loss to Francis Ngannou in March 2021.

The first defense of his heavyweight crown was supposed to take place last November but a pectoral injury to Jones scuttled those plans. Stipe Miocic was set to fight him at UFC 295, but that fight was obviously scrapped.\n\n'Bones' still seems to want that fight against the UFC heavyweight, although a strong contingent of fans want to see a fight between Jones and interim UFC heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall.\n\nIn a recent social media interaction with one of the all-time great mixed martial artists, @T_canFrost posted:\n\n\"I would imagine you're a person that probably vacated most of their dreams after graduating high school.

That being said, the prolific fighter has had to give up championships on multiple occasions previously.\n\nJones was a multi-time UFC light heavyweight champion but never lost his belt inside of the confines of the cage.\n\nThe native of New York state first had to give up gold when he was involved in a hit-and-run incident involving a pregnant woman. This scrapped a UFC 187 title defense against the late Anthony 'Rumble' Johnson, and Jones was suspended indefinitely in Q2 of 2015.\n\nJon Jones returned in April 2016 to capture the interim title against Ovince St. Preux before becoming lineal champion once again by stopping Daniel Cormier with strikes at UFC 214 in July 2017. This was a brief return to the throne as Jones failed a drug test that overturned the Cormier bout to a no-contest and saw the title belt go back to 'DC.'\n\n'Bones' regained the light heavyweight belt versus Alexander Gustafsson in their rematch at UFC 232.

He submitted Cyril Gane in the first round of the title fight. Jones was set to take on Stipe Miocic last October but was ruled out of the fight due to an injury he suffered in training. Since then, Jones has called out many fighters, including Alex Pereira of the Light Heavyweight division. UFC Hall of Famer Daniel Cormier had an interesting take on Jones' callouts.\n\nDaniel Cormier and Jon Jones go way back in the UFC. Their rivalry is for the history books. Jon has beaten Cormier multiple times in the octagon.\n\nJon Jones has been pretty active on social media lately. He has been using it to decide his next title fight in the company. Jones called out the Brazilian kickboxing legend Alex Pereira on his social media handle. His former rival and Hall of Famer Daniel Cormier thought Jones might have a plan to maximize his chances of winning in the octagon. Cormier said,\n\nNot everybody hits like Francis Ngannou or Alex Pereira, but if you can get away from that and manage that, it's much less risky than fighting a guy with a full skillset that's complete. That's exactly what Tom Aspinall looks to be.\n\nDaniel Cormier made it clear that Jon Jones might be calling out Alex Pereria to avoid Tom Aspinall, the interim Heavyweight champion. Cormier believes that if Jon can avoid Pereira's striking and power punches, he can win the fight in a rather unchallenging manner. DC claims Jon might avoid the much more versatile fighter in Tom Aspinall by calling out Pereira. Tom is one of the complete fighters in the UFC Heavyweight division. He is proficient in striking and is a black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.\n\nJon Jones has yet to respond to Daniel Cormier's allegations. Jon recently took to social media to reveal his next title fight in the UFC has been decided. Jon will likely face Stipe Miocic in the octagon in the upcoming months.

I'm a bit OCD when it comes to training, I like to know who I'm fighting. I like to know all the details so I can prepare myself physically and mentally. Unfortunately right now I don't know all of that.\n\n\"The last time I was in America we met. I have a good relationship with the guys high up at the UFC, we can speak openly. We were just talking about where I want to go, who I want to fight and what works for them. It's not me holding it up, I'm willing to fight anyone so it's the opponents that are holding it up.\"\n\nA rematch with #5 ranked contender Curtis Blaydes has been cited as a possibility with their first fight in 2022 ending prematurely after Aspinall injured his knee within 15 seconds, while light-heavyweight champion Alex Pereira and French contender Ciryl Gane have also been at the centre of the discussion.\n\n\"If the fight doesn't happen between me and Curtis, it's the UFC's doing,\" said Aspinall. \"We both want the fight.

Whether the UFC does it or not is up to them.\n\n\"Ciryl Gane is always knocking around, he's a very talented guy, and Alex Pereira has spoken about moving up. I guess it's pretty thin at the top of the heavyweight division. You're only talking about a few guys who are really up there and elite, so it just depends on the UFC.\"\n\nUFC 304 will be the promotion's first pay-per-view card held in the UK since 2016, representing the growing popularity of the sport across Europe.\n\nHowever, the timing of the event has caused controversy after the UFC announced that it will be staged on normal US primetime to maximise pay-per-view sales, meaning the main card won't start until 3am in Manchester.\n\n\"It's hard to put into words how big it is,\" said Aspinall. \"Having a pay-per-view card is massive in any country, but especially in a small country like ours. Obviously it's going to be on in the middle of the night which isn't ideal.\n\n\"For me as an athlete, 10 days out from the fight I'll start waking up in the night to train at around 5am.

'Bones' won that showdown via unanimous decision, successfully defending the light heavyweight belt and handing Cormier his first professional MMA defeat.\n\nIn the ensuing years, Jones faced several challenges outside the octagon. He was involved in a hit-and-run case, besides testing positive for PEDs on multiple occasions. The 'UFC Athlete Conduct Policy' violations led to him being stripped of the light heavyweight belt more than once.\n\nWhen their long-awaited rematch finally materialized at UFC 214 (July 2017), it was 'DC' who entered as the UFC light heavyweight champion. 'Bones' won their rematch via third-round KO (head kick and punches) and reclaimed the light heavyweight title. However, Jones tested positive for the PED turinabol. He was stripped of the title, and his KO win was overturned to an NC (No Contest).\n\nWhat if Jon Jones had fought Daniel Cormier in a trilogy bout?\n\nDaniel Cormier retained the light heavyweight belt due to Jon Jones' positive PED test. 'DC' then defended the belt once, moved up to heavyweight where he won the UFC heavyweight title, and eventually retired in Aug. 2020 after back-to-back defeats against Stipe Miocic.\n\nMeanwhile, Jones returned to beat Alexander Gustafsson in their rematch to capture the vacant UFC light heavyweight title in Dec. 2018. 'Bones' then defended the title thrice before vacating it in Aug. 2020. After a three-year hiatus, Jones debuted at heavyweight in March 2023, beating Ciryl Gane via first-round submission to win the vacant UFC heavyweight title, which he still holds.\n\nConsidering the variables at play, it'd be safe to say that a trilogy fight at light heavyweight would've favored Jon Jones more than Daniel Cormier. Currently, Jones is 36, whereas Cormier is 45 years of age. Their age differential and 'DC' being the naturally heavier fighter meant that his light heavyweight cut was inadvertently helping Jones.\n\nHad they clashed at heavyweight, Cormier would've probably been able to defeat his archnemesis. Barring a pair of losses against all-time-great heavyweight Stipe Miocic in their rematch and trilogy; 'DC's' wrestling, punching power, and overall performances were stellar at heavyweight. Only Miocic bested him in the 265-pound weight class, going 1-2 against 'DC.'\n\nThe Jon Jones-Daniel Cormier trilogy dream matchup would've seen Cormier possess considerably better cardio than his 205-pound version. He'd have been able to push the pace, even more so than he did in his rematch against Jones up until that fateful head kick. But given Jones' unparalleled resilience, the best-case scenario for Cormier would've probably been a decision win at heavyweight.\n\nFurthermore, given the ease with which Jon Jones won the UFC heavyweight title in his very first fight in the division, one can't help but wonder whether the heavyweight version of 'Bones' would've been too much for Cormier.\n\nExamining the probability of a Jones victory in the dream trilogy matchup against Cormier, he'd have employed a similar strategy as he did in their rematch. 'Bones' would steer clear of Cormier's punches, even at the expense of letting 'DC' take control of the octagon and push the pace.\n\n'Bones' would've consistently utilized long-range strikes and eventually caught the shorter fighter with a well-timed head kick.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "johny_payne@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Johny Payne", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance-enhancing_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Performance-enhancing substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cormier", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Cormier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jon Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Light heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mixed martial arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Fury_vs._Deontay_Wilder_III", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Fury vs. Deontay Wilder III"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_182", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UFC 182"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_Miocic", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stipe Miocic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unanimous_decision", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unanimous decision"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_and_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hit and run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_214", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UFC 214"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciryl_Gane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ciryl Gane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_contest_(combat_sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "No contest (combat sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Gustafsson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexander Gustafsson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wrestling"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Electrical", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Electrical", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Lighting", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Lighting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/8f33c-17151522821982-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543383", "eventUri": "eng-9543383", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-01-", "textStart": 164, "textEnd": 173}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 684, "textEnd": 693}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-08-", "textStart": 1285, "textEnd": 1294, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-12-", "textStart": 1470, "textEnd": 1479}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Jon Jones: 'Intern' champion Tom Aspinall 'just as selfish' to wait for undisputed title fight", "body": "Ultimate Fighting Championship's (UFC) Heavyweight division is broken.\n\nJon Jones won the promotion's undisputed title in a vacant title tilt against Ciryl Gane at UFC 285 in March 2023 (watch highlights). Unfortunately for \"Bones,\" injury torpedoed his planned first title defense against former champion, Stipe Miocic, at the end of the year. Therefore, an interim title was created and took place at UFC 295 as consolation.\n\nInterim titles are made as placeholders that essentially guarantee who the definitive top, next title contender is when the champion is injured or unavailable. That's, traditionally, the purpose of its existence. That titleholder wound up as Tom Aspinall after his 69-second knockout of Sergei Pavlovich (watch highlights). However, Jones has proclaimed Aspinall's insistence on fighting the undisputed champion, whether he or Miocic, more selfish than Jones wanting to unify the titles.\n\n\"Would you agree that it's just as selfish to have a completely healthy intern champion who is only 30 years old, sitting out and waiting to fight the winner of a 42 and 36 year old.\" Jones tweeted in response to a fan. \"Who literally actually already committed to fighting each other? No one stopping anyone, I'm on a mission.\n\n\"I'm in the middle of a pretty clear decision... stick to exact and original plans, and fight the man with all the accolades,\" he continued. \"Or, completely disregard all of the Stipe training I've put in and fight another potential hype train that may not even be around in three years.\n\n\"I am not changing my plans for anyone,\" Jones concluded. \"Stipe is over there as the best Heavyweight ever working his ass off. I'm gonna give that man what he wants, and I'm going to claim another head. Whatever comes next comes next.\"\n\nAs time goes on, Aspinall has continued to tumble down Jones' totem pole of interest. UFC Light Heavyweight champion, Alex Pereira, garnered attention from \"Bones\" last week (Fri., May 3, 2024) when declared a more \"massive fight\" than Aspinall. Ultimately, Jones is seeking the match ups with magnitude, hence his desire to fight Miocic.\n\n\"I was talking about retirement after Stipe way before there was an intern champion announced,\" Jones said. \"I would literally be in the same exact position if Sergei would had one. I love how the UK have convinced themselves I'm afraid of their intern champion,opens me up to a whole new fan base.They all know who the actual champion is.\"", "source": {"uri": "mmamania.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MMAmania.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "drake_riggs@mmamania.com", "name": "Drake Riggs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_Miocic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stipe Miocic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_285", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UFC 285"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciryl_Gane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ciryl Gane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight_(MMA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight (MMA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Aspinall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Aspinall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Pavlovich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Pavlovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Pereira", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Pereira"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_heavyweight_(MMA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Light heavyweight (MMA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rgz1JFQJO3NMgGNijKPaMzNOvnQ=/0x0:5051x2526/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25441016/1247757866.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543383", "eventUri": "eng-9543383", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 452988141, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 42, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 42}}}

Or, completely disregard all of the Stipe training I've put in and fight another potential hype train that may not even be around in three years.\"\n\nThe potential hype train that Jones speaks of is the 31-year-old Aspinall, who claimed the interim championship last November with a first-round knockout of Sergei Pavlovich. Outside of an injury that caused a TKO loss to Curtis Blaydes in 2022, Aspinall's run in the UFC has seen him finish all seven of his opponents, with no fighter lasting longer than 7 minutes in the Octagon with him.\n\nAspinall has repeatedly called for a unification fight with Jones. However, Jones is simply not interested in anybody not named Stipe Miocic.\n\n\"I am not changing my plans for anyone,\" Jones said. \"Stipe is over there as the best heavyweight ever working his ass off. I'm gonna give that man what he wants, and I'm going to claim another head. Whatever comes next comes next.\"\n\nJones, 36, hasn't fought since March 2023, when the former light heavyweight champion made his heavyweight debut against Ciryl Gane for the vacant championship. Jones submitted Gane in just over two minutes and set his sights on the man who has often been called the greatest UFC heavyweight of all time. A fight between Jones and Miocic -- who hasn't won a fight in nearly four years -- was scheduled for UFC 295 last November but Jones suffered an injury and was forced out of the fight.\n\nJones placed much of the blame for the confusion about a potential unification bout on the UFC for elevating the Aspinall-Pavlovich fight to the main event and making it for the interim title at UFC 295.\n\n\"UFC is a brilliant company [and] did what they had to do to save the event,\" Jones said in response to a commenter stating the interim title shouldn't have been introduced once he fell to injury. \"But I do agree with you, it definitely confused a bunch of UK fans, got them entitled thinking their boy really is the champion. It reminds me of when DC [Daniel Cormier] was the 'champion' during my absence.\"\n\nThere is no timetable for when Jones will return to the Octagon, but he did mention that he's in the beginning stages of getting into fight shape. Meanwhile, there is speculation that Aspinall will defend the interim title at UFC 304, which takes place at the Co-op Live in Manchester, England on July 27.\n\nA unification bout with Aspinall may take place down the line, but Jones is only interested in facing Miocic next.\n\n\"That's one thing about this sport, there will always be that next challenger,\" Jones said. \"I could've retired five years ago and I would've been running from someone. All the men I beat up, will have their stories. All the men I didn't get to beat up, we have their stories. It is what it is. It's an honor to be that guy people talk about. I know a lot of names who's gone ghost over the years.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interim_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interim championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipe_Miocic", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stipe Miocic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Aspinall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Aspinall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Pavlovich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sergei Pavlovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Blaydes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curtis Blaydes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciryl_Gane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ciryl Gane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Light heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Cormier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Cormier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2023%2F0301%2Fr1138169_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543383", "eventUri": "eng-9543383", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-07-27", "textStart": 2644, "textEnd": 2651}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 452991969, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 44, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 44}}}

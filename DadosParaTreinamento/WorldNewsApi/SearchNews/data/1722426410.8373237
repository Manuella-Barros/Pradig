In doing so they will meet new manager Chris Davies and his assistant Ben Petty for the first time. Davies hasn\u2019t previously coached any of the Blues squad and is looking forward to welcoming them back. The only players who will be allowed to report at a slightly later date are Juninho Bacuna and Jordan James due to playing for their countries earlier this month. Paik Seung-ho could also be eased back in having spent time completing military service in South Korea. Davies will be able to work with the rest of his squad, including new signing Ryan Allsop, straight away. The Blues players will report for pre-season testing on Monday and Tuesday.

Davies will have four days at the Elite Performance and Innovation Centre before Blues fly out to Austria for their week-long training camp. It is over in Austria where Davies can really start imparting information and ideas. The manager will have a week in the mountains to work on the playing style and patterns of play. By the time Blues return, Davies plans to have sussed out his new charges. \u201cIt won\u2019t take me long,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have that first week here at the training ground, then we\u2019re going to Austria for a week. By the end of the Austria trip I will have a really good handle on the level of the players I\u2019m working with and the training sessions will be designed to see how they cope and get to know them personally as well. \u201cI\u2019ll have a really good idea when we return from Austria what we have got in the building, and that will give me more clarity on what we need to bring in to add to that and make sure we have a really robust squad.\u201d", "summary": "Birmingham City will soon report for pre-season training to prepare for the upcoming League One campaign", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/birmingham-city-pre-season-training-29426288", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article29426491.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_escenic-35.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:12:28", "author": "Alex Dicken", "authors": ["Alex Dicken"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.211}

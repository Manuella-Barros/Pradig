Los Angeles has 12 homers over its past three games and Ohtani has four in that span.\n\nDodgers right-hander Walker Buehler made his first appearance since June 2022 after undergoing elbow surgery and he showed some rust. He gave up three runs on six hits over four innings with no walks and four strikeouts.\n\nMLB POWER RANKINGS: Dodgers finally bully their way to No. 1\n\nNick Gordon hit his fifth home run of the year for the Marlins. Right-hander Roddery Munoz (1-1) was touched for six runs on seven hits with four walks in 4 2/3 innings, his worst outing of his three career starts.\n\nThe Marlins, who had won four of their past six games, wasted little time getting to Buehler in the first inning. Bryan De La Cruz and Jesus Sanchez each had RBI singles to give Miami a 2-0 lead.\n\nThe Dodgers answered just as quickly. Mookie Betts led off the bottom of the first with a walk and Ohtani followed with his 11th home run of the season. Freeman made it back-to-back shots with his third of the season to give Los Angeles a 3-2 lead.\n\nGordon added to Buehler's rough outing with a home run to lead off the second inning and tie the score 3-3.\n\nThe Dodgers moved back ahead for good in the bottom of the second inning. Outman hit a two-run blast - - his third on the season and first since April 9 - - to put Los Angeles back in front. Hernandez hit his ninth homer of the season, a solo homer that increased the Dodgers' lead to 6-3 in the third inning.\n\nDespite losing late-inning relievers Evan Phillips and Joe Kelly to injuries in a span of two days, the Dodgers' bullpen held the Marlins scoreless over the last five innings. Left-hander Ryan Yarbrough (3-1) followed Buehler with three scoreless innings, allowing one hit and striking out two.\n\nLos Angeles left-hander Alex Vesia pitched a perfect ninth inning for his first save of the year.\n\nThe second game of the three-game Marlins-Dodgers series is Tuesday night (10:10 p.m. ET on MLB Network).\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Shohei Ohtani

The Marlins are still 4-2 in the past 6 games despite that embarrassment over the weekend, and the Over is 3-1 in the past 4 outings and on a 7-2 run in the past 9 contests.\n\nThe Marlins also made headlines this past weekend, trading All-Star 2B Luis Arraez to the San Diego Padres, as apparently another fire sale is on the horizon in South Florida.\n\nThe Dodgers made a giant statement over the weekend, posting a 3-game sweep of the rival Atlanta Braves. Los Angeles outscored Atlanta 20-6 in the thorough beatdown. Unlike the Marlins, runs have been at a premium for the opposition of the Dodgers, with L.A. allowing just 25 runs in the past 13 games.\n\nMarlins at Dodgers projected starters\n\nLHP Roddery Munoz vs. RHP Walker Buehler\n\nMunoz (1-0, 2.45 ERA) makes his 3rd start. He has a 0.73 WHIP, 2.5 BB/9 and 11.5 K/9 in 11 innings.\n\nLast start: Win, 6 IP, 1 ER, 3 H, 2 BB, 7 K (67 pitches) in 4-1 home win vs. Colorado Rockies Wednesday Last road start: 5 IP, 2 ER, 2 H (2 solo HR), 1 BB, 7 K in 5-3 road loss vs. Chicago Cubs April 20 in his MLB debut\n\nBuehler (6-3, 4.02 ERA) makes his first start since 2022 after a 23-month layoff due to Tommy John surgery.\n\nLast start: Loss, 4 IP, 3 ER, 4 H (1 HR), 0 BB, 6 K in 7-2 road loss vs. San Francisco Giants June 10, 2022 2022 stats: 6-3, 4.02 ERA (65 IP, 29 ER), 1.29 WHIP in 12 starts\n\nWin your fantasy baseball league with BaseballHQ.com.

Lines last updated at 12:24 p.m. ET.\n\nMoneyline (ML): Marlins +240 (bet $100 to win $240) | Dodgers -300 (bet $300 to win $100) Run line (RL)/Against the spread (ATS): Marlins +1.5 (+120) | Dodgers -1.5 (-145) Over/Under (O/U): 8.5 (O: -110 | U: -110)\n\nMarlins at Dodgers picks and predictions\n\nPrediction\n\nDodgers 4, Marlins 3\n\nMoneyline\n\nYou just can't back the Dodgers (-300) laying 3 times your potential return.\n\nThat's risky betting behavior anyway, but especially with a guy making his first start since June 2022. Buehler is making his way back, he'll likely be eased into things, and the Marlins (+240) are using a hard-throwing pitcher with plenty of gas.\n\nAVOID.\n\nRun line/Against the spread\n\nThe MARLINS +1.5 (+120) are a solid play at plus-money. We don't know how effective Buehler is going to be, although he faces a rather toothless Miami lineup, and now Arraez is playing his baseball in San Diego.\n\nThe Dodgers -1.5 (-145) will have their hands full with Munoz, who has pitched well in his first 2 appearances, though.\n\nOver/Under\n\nUNDER 8.5 (-110) is the way to go, as Munoz has kept scores low, and Buehler faces the perfect offense to ease back into action after a long layoff. Los Angeles is on a 7-3 run to the Under, and that is what is driving this play.\n\nPlay our free daily Pick'em Challenge and win!

LA is rounding into form and is looking like serious contenders, as many in the offseason predicted. The Marlins, who were a playoff team in 2023, have fallen off and look pretty bad right now.\n\nInjuries have played a role, but they now face a tall task in taking on the mighty Dodgers. Can David surprise Goliath this week in this series?\n\nThe Dodgers have caught fire and are now 23-13, the second-best record in the National League.\n\nMeanwhile, the Marlins have only recently reached double-digit wins. They're 10-26 right now, which is the third-worst record in the league. Only the Chicago White Sox and Colorado Rockies are worse.\n\nDodgers and Marlins Pitching Matchups\n\nIn Game 1, Walker Buehler will make his long-awaited debut. He hasn't pitched in over a year thanks to Tommy John surgery, and he is penciled into the lineup for Monday's matchup. Opposite him for the Marlins will be Roddery Munoz.\n\nGame 2 will see Yoshinobu Yamamoto put his 15-inning scoreless streak to the test against Edward Cabrera and his 6.05 ERA. The finale pits Ryan Weathers (2-3 record) against Gavin Stone (4.06 ERA).\n\nPredictions for Dodgers vs. Marlins\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are starting to resemble the team many thought they'd be. They just swept the Atlanta Braves, who are a far better team than the Marlins. That doesn't bode well for Miami's chances.\n\nLook for the Dodgers to make it two sweeps in a row. The Marlins just don't have the firepower, especially after trading Luis Arraez, to keep up in this series.\n\nChannels to watch the Dodgers take on the Marlins\n\nThe Dodgers always play on Spectrum SportsNet LA. This is where all three games will be held for local audiences. Miami plays on Bally Sports Florida, and all three games will be there as well.\n\nThe first two games on Monday and Tuesday will also be on MLB Network for those outside the local market for either team.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_roberts@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Zachary Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulnar_collateral_ligament_reconstruction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Cabrera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Edward Cabrera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Weathers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Weathers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_SportsNet_LA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spectrum SportsNet LA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/fd6e1-17150004776129-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

In seven games this season, the 25-year-old has a 2.91 ERA and 11.1 strikeouts per nine innings, while allowing a batting average of .225 to his opponents. Yamamoto is aiming for his fourth straight quality start. Yamamoto will try to build upon a seven-game streak of pitching five or more innings (he's averaging 4.9 frames per appearance). He is looking to keep a streak of two games without giving up an earned run intact. He will match up with a Marlins offense that is batting .227 as a unit (22nd in MLB).

Marlins stats and trends Marlins betting records The Marlins have been chosen as underdogs in 23 games this year and have walked away with the win seven times (30.4%) in those games. This will be the worst odds to win that sportsbooks have given Miami this season with a +268 moneyline set for this game. Oddsmakers have implied with the moneyline set for this matchup that the Marlins have a 27.2% chance of pulling out a win. Miami and its opponents have hit the over in 21 of its 37 games with a total set by oddsmakers this season. The Marlins are 11-25-0 against the spread in their 36 games with a line set by sportsbooks this season. Edward Cabrera (Marlins probable starter) Cabrera gets the start for the Marlins, his fifth of the season. He is 1-1 with a 6.05 ERA and 30 strikeouts in 19 1/3 innings pitched. In his most recent time out on Thursday, the righty tossed four innings against the Colorado Rockies, allowing four earned runs while surrendering three hits. In four games this season, the 26-year-old has put up a 6.05 ERA and 14.0 strikeouts per nine innings, while giving up a batting average of .253 to opposing batters. Cabrera is looking to pick up his second quality start of the season in this matchup. Cabrera has put together two starts this season that he pitched five or more innings. He will face a Dodgers offense that ranks first in the league with 203 total runs scored while batting .273 as a unit. His opponent has a collective .456 slugging percentage (first in MLB play) and has hit a total of 51 home runs (second in the league). Marlins batting stats The Marlins have hit 28 home runs this season, the fifth-lowest total in MLB play. So far this year, Miami has the fourth-lowest slugging percentage in baseball (.339).

However, the Dodgers offense was having none of it as they quickly answered back each time the Marlins attempted to establish an early lead.\n\nWith the Dodgers facing a 2-0 deficit in the first Shohei Ohtani evened the score with his 11th homer of the season and fourth in his last three games. Freddie Freeman immediately followed it up with a home run of his own, a solo shot to give the Dodgers a 3-2 lead.\n\nNick Gordon hit a solo homer of his own in the top of the second to tie the score at 3-3, but it didn't stay that way for long. Once again the Dodgers quickly answered the Marlins' scoring with runs of their own as James Outman hit L.A.'s second two-run homer in as many innings to put them up 5-3 heading into the third.\n\nFrom there Buehler settled into the game and faced just one over the minimum during his final two innings of work.

Bryan De La Cruz also went deep for the Marlins.\n\nMiami right-hander Edward Cabrera (1-2) gave up Muncy's grand slam and went two innings. He was followed by right-hander George Soriano, who met a similar fate by allowing four runs over three innings.\n\nAfter Chisholm put the Marlins up early with his fifth home run of the season, the Dodgers went to work quickly against Cabrera. Shohei Ohtani walked, Freddie Freeman was hit by a pitch and Will Smith walked to load the bases with one out.\n\nMuncy's grand slam, the opposite way to left-center field, came on Cabrera's second pitch of the at-bat. The ninth home run of the season for Muncy was also his sixth career grand slam. Muncy hit three last season.\n\nThe Dodgers tacked on four more runs in the third inning on a sacrifice fly from Andy Pages, an error by Marlins catcher Christian Bethancourt to bring home Muncy and a two-run shot from Lux, his first homer this year after a slow start offensively.\n\nLos Angeles has 14 home runs in the past four games.\n\nDe La Cruz took Yamamoto deep in the sixth inning to cap the scoring.\n\nOn Wednesday, it was back to where it all began for the Miami Marlins' Ryan Weathers as the left-hander took the mound against the host Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nWeathers had never pitched in a regular-season game when he made his debut for the San Diego Padres in a 2020 National League Division Series contest against the Dodgers. He showed promise by not allowing a run over 1 1/3 innings in the pressure cooker that became an eventual Dodgers victory.\n\nNow a member of the Marlins after a trade last season, Weathers (2-3, 4.54 ERA) faced Los Angeles on Wednesday after matching his career high by going six innings against the Oakland Athletics on Friday. He gave up three runs but didn't walk a batter while taking the loss.\n\n\"I thought Weathers was good [with] 70 percent strikes, or something like that,\" Marlins manager Skip Schumaker said. \"Slider [and] changeup was excellent. I thought the command on both of those pitches and the swing-and-miss was good.\"\n\nWeathers will need more of the same against the high-octane Los Angeles offense, which used a Max Muncy grand slam in the first inning on Tuesday to start its way to an 8-2 victory over the Marlins. The Dodgers turned five walks, two hit batters and five hits into the win.\n\n\"You get in bad counts and they'll make you pay,\" Schumaker said. \"That's what good teams do. You cannot do that against that team, and that's how they get the eight runs on the board.\"\n\nCounting his playoff appearance, Weathers' six career outings against the Dodgers are tied for his most against any club. In the five regular-season outings (four starts) vs. Los Angeles, he is 0-1 with a 4.66 ERA.\n\nIn something of an awakening, the Marlins delivered a three-game home sweep of the Colorado Rockies last week, but they are 1-4 heading into the finale of a six-game West Coast trip.\n\nThe Dodgers, on the other hand, are on a six-game winning streak and looking to sweep consecutive home series after rolling through the Atlanta Braves over the weekend. Los Angeles has won 13 of 15.\n\n\"It's a good indicator of what this group is capable of and I think everyone in here would admit that we let those two (recent defeats) get away from us,\" Muncy said. \"It's been fun showing up every single day, and we have a good group here.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

It was a 95 mph fastball over the heart of the plate, but Yamamoto settled in right after.\n\nHe threw 19 strikes to open the game, and did not allow a baserunner from the second inning until the fourth inning. Yamamoto ended up allowing another solo home run in the sixth inning, but that was all the Marlins were able to score against him.\n\nHe ended up pitching into the seventh inning for the first time in his MLB career, where he worked a scoreless frame, and went back out for the eighth. His final inning proved to be slightly more of a challenge as he allowed a single, but he was able to escape with no damage allowed.\n\nHe finished the outing with eight innings pitched, allowing two runs on five hits with five strikeouts and no walks. He has cemented himself as one of the premiere pitchers in Major League Baseball.\n\nThe Dodgers offense got off to a hot start as they loaded the bases with a walk from Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman getting hit by a pitch, and Will Smith working a walk as well. Max Muncy capitalized on the poor pitching from the Marlins and hit a grand slam to put the Dodgers up 4-1.\n\nIt was Muncy's sixth career grand slam, which places him sixth all-time in the Dodgers' record books. Gil Hodges is the all-time leader with 14, and the next closest players are Carl Furillo and Mike Piazza with eight each, while Matt Kemp and Cody Bellinger are tied with seven.\n\nThe Dodgers added on with another four-run inning in the third as Andy Pages put them up 5-1 with a sacrifice fly. A throwing error by Chrisitan Bethancourt scored another Dodgers' run.\n\nThen Gavin Lux blasted his first home run sine August 2022 with a two-run shot, giving the Dodgers their eighth run of the game.\n\nDodgers go for second consecutive sweep\n\nAfter sweeping the Atlanta Braves, the Dodgers now have a chance to sweep the Marlins with an early, 12:10 p.m. PT game on Wednesday.\n\nGavin Stone is scheduled to face Ryan Weathers, and the Dodgers will likely have many of their platoon players in the lineup with the day game after a night game.", "source": {"uri": "dodgerblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "blake_williams@dodgerblue.com", "name": "Blake Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinobu_Yamamoto", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoshinobu Yamamoto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Muncy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Max Muncy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Chisholm_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jazz Chisholm Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Weathers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Weathers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Lux", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Lux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Furillo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Furillo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gil_Hodges", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gil Hodges"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Kemp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Kemp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Error (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Piazza", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Piazza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Bellinger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Bellinger"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s22927.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_23216913_168397645_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Fans can watch tonight's game and the series finale tomorrow by using the free trials offered by DirecTV Stream and Fubo TV. These streaming services will also broadcast the Braves-Red Sox game this evening.\n\nThe Dodgers enter tonight's game with a 24-13 record, and they have won five games in a row. This win streak includes a dominant series sweep of the Braves over the weekend. Additionally, the Dodgers beat the Marlins 6-3 in the first game of this series yesterday.\n\nThe Dodgers have two of the best MLB hitters right now, Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts. Ohtani leads all MLB players with 11 home runs and a .370 batting average. Meanwhile, Betts has a .356 batting average, which is good enough to be the second-best of all MLB players. With these two hitters on fire for a majority of the season, the Dodgers have been putting up ridiculous offensive numbers. Out of all MLB teams, the Dodgers have the most hits, RBI, and runs scored. If they can keep their bats rolling tonight, then the Dodgers should run away with a victory over the Marlins.\n\nThe Marlins have had a terrible start to the 2024 MLB season, as they are currently sitting in last place of their division with a 10-27 record. Their record is among the worst in MLB, as the Chicago White Sox and Colorado Rockies are the only teams with a worse record.\n\nAlthough the Marlins are a relatively decent offensive team, they have been hampered by terrible pitching this season. Specifically, their team's 5.16 ERA is second-worst in MLB. This ERA makes them one of just three MLB teams to have an ERA that is 5.0 or greater. Since the Dodgers are currently on fire with their hitting, the Marlins pitching staff will have to greatly overperform to even have a chance at winning a game in Los Angeles this week.\n\nFans can freely watch Ohtani's Dodgers take on the Marlins tonight and tomorrow by utilizing the free trials offered by DirecTV Stream and Fubo TV.", "source": {"uri": "al.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "al"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports_Florida", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirecTV_Stream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DirecTV Stream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FuboTV", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FuboTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.al.com/resizer/v2/BSAJKWTPCFA7FDNBPVDS5YZMTY.jpg?auth=25e4336973176469b9e6b51521d7496f2eeef241345703614da77e3526e2e7bc&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Bryan De La Cruz and Jesus Sanchez each had RBI singles to give Miami a 2-0 lead.\n\nThe Dodgers answered just as quickly. Mookie Betts led off the bottom of the first with a walk and Ohtani followed with his 11th home run of the season. Freeman made it back-to-back shots with his third of the season to give Los Angeles a 3-2 lead.\n\nGordon added to Buehler's rough outing with a home run to lead off the second inning and tie the score 3-3.\n\nThe Dodgers moved back ahead for good in the bottom of the second inning.

Hernandez hit his ninth homer of the season, a solo homer that increased the Dodgers' lead to 6-3 in the third inning.\n\nDespite losing late-inning relievers Evan Phillips and Joe Kelly to injuries in a span of two days, the Dodgers' bullpen held the Marlins scoreless over the last five innings. Left-hander Ryan Yarbrough (3-1) followed Buehler with three scoreless innings, allowing one hit and striking out two.\n\nLos Angeles left-hander Alex Vesia pitched a perfect ninth inning for his first save of the year.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_De_La_Cruz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan De La Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Vesia", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Vesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Yarbrough", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Yarbrough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Kelly_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Kelly (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hernandez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Hernandez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/07/USAT/73595798007-usatsi-23208229.jpg?crop=2268,1276,x42,y67&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-09", "textStart": 1484, "textEnd": 1491}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

J.P.

Our MLB odds series has our Marlins-Dodgers prediction, odds, and pick for Wednesday.\n\nThe Marlins make the trip to Los Angeles to face the Dodgers! The Marlins have struggled as one of the worst teams in the MLB this season while the Dodgers have started to live up to their massive expectations. Our MLB odds series has our Marlins-Dodgers prediction, odds, and pick for Wednesday.\n\nThe Marlins are competing for the title of worst team in the MLB with a 10-27 record. Their bats have struggled up to this point in the season, ranking near the bottom of the MLB in team batting average. Their pitching is also one of the worst units in the MLB, only above the Rockies. Bryan De la Cruz, Jake Burger, Josh Bell, and Jazz Chisholm Jr. have been able to stand out despite the overall struggles as a team behind the plate. Ryan Weathers has been okay at best on the mound for a pitching staff that has struggled as a whole. The Marlins have struggled across the board this season and a matchup against the Dodgers is not going to help them gain any momentum.\n\nThe Dodgers were billed as a super team before the year and they currently have a 24-13 record. They are the best offense in the MLB with a team batting average of .273, and then their pitching is a top-10 unit as well. On offense, there are stars galore with Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Teoscar Hernandez, Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, and Max Muncy to name a few. Their pitching is led by Tyler Glasnow, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and James Paxton on the mound. The pieces are starting to fit together and the Dodgers are currently one of the best teams in the entire MLB right now due to all that talent they have.\n\nThe Marlins are putting Ryan Weathers on the mound where he has a 2-3 record, a 4.54 ERA, and a 1.37 WHIP. Through 26 innings, he has allowed 20 runs on 34 hits with 15 walks and 31 strikeouts. Weathers has appeared in seven games for the Marlins and they have gone 2-5 in those games. In his last start, he pitched six innings and allowed three runs on five hits with zero walks and five strikeouts in a Marlins loss. Weathers has been the best player for the Marlins in their pitching staff, but he gets a very tough matchup against the Dodgers.\n\nThe Marlins' offense has struggled this season especially when compared to last season. They are 22nd in team batting average at .227 after finishing last season with a .259 batting average which was one of the best in the entire MLB. The offense is led by Bryan De La Cruz and Jazz Chisholm Jr. now that Luis Arraez is no longer on the team. De La Cruz leads the way in batting average at .264, in home runs at six, in RBI at 19, and in total hits at 39. Chisholm Jr. then leads the way in OBP at .324. This matchup does not do them any favors against Gavin Stone for the Dodgers.\n\nWhy The Dodgers Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Dodgers are putting Gavin Stone on the mound where he has a 2-1 record, a 4.06 ERA, and a 1.35 WHIP. Through 31 innings, he has allowed 14 runs on 29 hits with 13 walks, and 23 strikeouts. In his six appearances this season, the Dodgers are 4-2 in those games. In his last start, he pitched 6.0 innings and allowed one run on five hits with one walk and five strikeouts in a Dodgers win. Stone has been playing much better this season when compared to his rookie year last year and he gets a decent matchup against a struggling Miami offense.\n\nThe Dodgers have the most talent on offense in the MLB, and they are leading the entire MLB with a .273 batting average. This was after they finished with a .257 batting average last year. Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts lead the way in most of the batting categories. Ohtani leads the way in batting average at .370, in home runs at 11, and in total hits at 54. Betts then leads the way in RBI at 27 and in OBP at .463. This will be an interesting matchup for an elite Dodgers offense against Ryan Weathers for the Marlins on the mound.\n\nFinal Marlins-Dodgers Prediction & Pick\n\nThis matchup is very lopsided. The Dodgers are the better team across the board. Gavin Stone is a slightly better pitcher than Ryan Weathers and it helps the Dodgers are the best offense in the MLB as well. Expect the Dodgers to win and win easily on their way to a cover at home and extend their winning streak from five to six in a row.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_faigus@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jake Faigus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Weathers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Weathers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Bell_(first_baseman)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Bell (first baseman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Chisholm_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jazz Chisholm Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Smith (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Muncy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Muncy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Paxton_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Paxton (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_De_La_Cruz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryan De La Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Marlins-vs.-Dodgers-prediction-odds-pick-how-to-watch-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

First pitch is scheduled for 10:10 p.m. ET. Let's analyze BetMGM Sportsbook's lines around the Marlins vs. Dodgers odds and make our expert MLB picks and predictions for the best bets.\n\nSeason series: Dodgers lead 1-0; split last season 3-3\n\nThe Dodgers welcomed back RHP Walker Buehler in the series opener Monday, as he pitched for the first time in an MLB game since June 2022. He allowed 3 earned runs and 6 hits in 4 innings in a 77-pitch no-decision, giving way to the bullpen to clean things up. L.A. won 6-3 as -315 favorites as the Over (8.5) just came through.\n\nThe Dodgers have picked up 5 straight wins, including a 3-game sweep of the Atlanta Braves over the weekend. Los Angeles also has won 8 in a row against the NL East since a 6-4 loss at home against the New York Mets April 20. The Over is 2-1 in the past 3 games and 6-4 in the past 10 vs. NL East clubs.\n\nThe Marlins have dropped 3 of the past 4 games on the current 6-game road trip, splashing a little cold water on a 3-game series sweep of the Colorado Rockies in South Florida April 30-May 2. The Over is 3-0 in the past 3 games and 8-2 across the past 10 outings.\n\nMarlins at Dodgers projected starters\n\nRHP Edward Cabrera vs. RHP Yoshinobu Yamamoto\n\nCabrera (1-1, 6.05 ERA) makes his 5th start. He has a 1.50 WHIP, 4.7 BB/9 and 14.0 K/9 in 19 1/3 innings.\n\nLast start: No-decision, 4 IP, 4 ER, 3 H, 4 BB, 9 K in 5-4 home win in 10 innings vs. Colorado Rockies Thursday Last road start: Win, 5 IP, 3 ER, 7 H, 3 BB, 7 K in 6-3 road win vs. Chicago Cubs April 2\n\nYamamoto (3-1, 2.91 ERA) makes his 8th start. He has a 1.09 WHIP, 2.1 BB/9 and 11.1 K/9 in 34 innings.\n\nLast start: Win, 6 IP, 0 ER, 5 H, 2 BB, 5 K in 8-0 road win vs. Arizona Diamondbacks May 1 Last home start: No-decision, 6 IP, 4 R (3 ER), 7 H (1 HR), 1 BB, 9 K in 9-4 home loss vs. New York Mets April 19\n\nWin your fantasy baseball league with BaseballHQ.com.

Lines last updated at 11:53 a.m. ET.\n\nMoneyline (ML): Marlins +240 (bet $100 to win $240) | Dodgers -300 (bet $300 to win $100) Run line (RL)/Against the spread (ATS): Marlins +2.5 (-145) | Dodgers -2.5 (+120) Over/Under (O/U): 7.5 (O: -110 | U: -110)\n\nMarlins at Dodgers picks and predictions\n\nPrediction\n\nDodgers 6, Marlins 3\n\nMoneyline\n\nThe Dodgers (-300) are heavy favorites again in Game 2 of this series, and you can't risk 3 times your potential return on the home team.\n\nRemember when Yamamoto was tuned up in the Korea Series, and all of the Los Angeles fans were up in arms? He has arguably been one of the team's top pitchers since that ugly debut, allowing 3 or fewer earned runs in each of his past 6 outings, including 3 straight quality starts.\n\nAVOID.\n\nRun line/Against the spread\n\nThe DODGERS -2.5 (+120) are worth a roll of the dice at this price point. Winning by 3 or more runs in an MLB game isn't easy, but Los Angeles has the offense to put it on the Marlins +2.5 (-145).\n\nWe saw the Dodgers, even when the starting pitching wasn't at its best Monday night, cobble together enough offense to get the job done on the run line.\n\nCabrera is a pitcher with straight gas, racking up plenty of strikeouts when he pitches. But he is also very wild and gets himself into trouble with walks. Look for the experience and high-powered L.A. offense to take advantage of his generosity.\n\nOver/Under\n\nOVER 7.5 (-110) is the lean, but go with a half-unit play at most.\n\nThe Over cashed in the series opener, just barely, and is 2-1 in the past 3 games for Dodger Blue.\n\nFor the Marlins, the total has gone high in 3 in a row, 4 of the past 5, and 8 of the previous 10 outings.\n\nPlay our free daily Pick'em Challenge and win!

The 25-year-old Japan native has gone 3-0 with a 1.64 ERA over his past six starts, and enters play on Tuesday coming off consecutive scoreless outings.\n\nYamamoto (3-1, 2.91 ERA) gave up five hits over six scoreless innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks on Wednesday in an outing that came six days after he gave up four hits in another six scoreless frames against the Washington Nationals. Both starts were on the road.\n\n\"There are some differences between here and Japan, such as the PitchCom, pitch clock. I think I'm being able to get myself used to it,\" Yamamoto said through an interpreter. \"And I'm feeling more comfortable. ... I think I'm just getting used to the environment since I came here.\"\n\nOhtani is on a roll with four home runs over his past three games, including a two-run, 441-foot blast in the first inning against Miami on Monday. He has a major-league-leading 11 home runs on the season after not hitting one over his first eight games with the Dodgers.\n\nFreddie Freeman hit back-to-back home runs with Ohtani, while James Outman and Teoscar Hernandez also went deep in the Dodgers' 6-3 victory over the Marlins on Monday. Ohtani added two stolen bases.\n\n\"We always knew we had a good team,\" Freeman said on the SportsNet LA broadcast. \"Obviously, we didn't get off to the start we wanted to in the first 20, 25 games. You could see it pretty fast that we can change the game on one swing of the bat with a lot of guys in this lineup.\"\n\nThe Marlins will send Edward Cabrera (1-1, 6.05 ERA) to the mound after he gave up a combined 10 runs, nine earned, over his past two starts. The hard-throwing right-hander has been a strikeout machine, logging nine in his most recent outing and 30 over four starts in just 19 1/3 innings.\n\nMiami got off to a fast start on Monday, putting up three runs over the first two innings, including a home run from Nick Gordon.

It's one of those things where hitting is contagious, but also starting pitching is contagious.\"\n\nFreddie Freeman got aboard with a two-out double off the wall in right field before Hernandez drove a full-count changeup from Ryan Weathers (2-4) just over the wall in left center and past the outstretched glove of Miami left fielder Nick Gordon.\n\nMiami Manager Skip Schumaker ended up second-guessing his decision of allowing Weathers to pitch to Hernandez with first base open and Kike Hernandez on deck.\n\n\"At the end of the day, that's on me. I should have taken that situation out of their hands and had him face Kike,\" Schumaker said. \"I thought there's a chance that he would pitch around him a little bit where he could chase. And in worse-case scenario he would put him on and go attack Kike.\"\n\nHernandez drove in all three Los Angeles runs in a game that went only 1 hour, 55 minutes, the shortest contest at Dodger Stadium in 21 years. His RBI base hit to right marked the fourth consecutive game the Dodgers scored in the first inning.\n\n\"Nowadays the outfielders make plays. I was waiting until he was laying on the ground. After that I celebrated,\" said Hernandez, who leads with Dodgers with 29 RBI. \"I was looking for changeup. He got me out on my second at-bat with a changeup and then at 3-1 he threw a changeup.\"\n\nBryan De La Cruz went deep for the second consecutive game, accounting for Miami's only run with a home run to left in the fourth inning. It is the second time this season he has homered in back-to-back games.\n\nThe Marlins have dropped five of six on their current road trip.\n\n\"It's tough to win with one run. Ryan did really well. I'll take that version of Ryan Weathers any day of the week,\" Schumaker said. \"We just couldn't get anything going.\"\n\nStone (3-1) went seven innings and allowed only 1 run on 6 hits with 4 strikeouts. Five of the Dodgers' starters during the homestand went at least six innings and posted a 2.33 ERA with 31 strikeouts and only four walks.\n\n\"He had command of all his pitches and induced a lot of weak contact. To see him again get to the seventh inning is pretty commendable,\" Roberts said of Stone.\n\nDaniel Hudson retired the Marlins in order in the ninth for his second save.\n\nWeathers allowed three runs and five hits in six innings.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers' Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, right, hits a two-run home run as Miami Marlins pitcher Ryan Weathers, left, and catcher Nick Fortes, second from left, watch along with home plate Alfonso Marquez during the sixth inning of a baseball game Wednesday, May 8, 2024, in Los Angeles.

He gave up five hits and struck out four, while walking no one.\n\nThe only damage came on a solo home run in the fourth inning by Bryan De La Cruz, who had a strong series overall.\n\nThis is the second time this season Stone has pitched seven innings while giving up one run, with his last coming on April 26 against the Blue Jays.

Their pitchers have combined for a 1.74 ERA, yielding 28 earned runs and 12 homers in 145 innings.\n\nThe Dodgers entered the day with 23 defensive runs saved, according to Fangraphs, the third-best team total in the league, and Wednesday's errorless game ended with second baseman Miguel Rojas charging a slow Jesus Sanchez roller and making a quick and accurate off-balance throw to first for the final out.\n\nDodgers starting pitchers have notched 11 quality starts and allowed 23 earned runs in 94 1/3 innings in the 16 games, good for a 2.19 ERA.\n\nThe bullpen -- after Michael Grove's scoreless eighth inning and Daniel Hudson's scoreless ninth -- has allowed five earned runs over 50 2/3 innings during the stretch, good for an 0.89 ERA. And that's despite losing closer Evan Phillips and setup men Joe Kelly and Ryan Brasier to injuries during the stretch.\n\n\"We've played some great baseball at times over the years, but this [stretch], from all facets of the game, is as good as I've seen,\" Roberts said. \"It's hard to beat what we've done.\"\n\nThe Dodgers didn't pound the ball on Wednesday, mustering six hits against hard-throwing Marlins left-hander Ryan Weathers and two relievers in the 1-hour, 55-minute matinee, the shortest Dodgers game since 2003. But when you pitch as well as they did -- the Dodgers did not walk a batter -- you don't have to.\n\n\"I think you win with pitching and defense, like everyone says, and our offense is the best in the league,\" Rojas said. \"The starters have been doing their part, and the bullpen has been amazing.

That longest win streak of the season came only a few games after the previous longest winning streak. That's the recipe for 14 wins in 16 games, and Los Angeles separating themselves from the rest of the National League West.\n\nIn the last homestand, the Dodgers lost six of their first eight games, and lost all three series at Dodger Stadium. Things weren't clicking, either they couldn't get enough offense in a decently pitched game, or the pitchers dug too much of a hole or allowed runs late.\n\nThis current run started with a 10-0 shutout of the Mets on April 21, one of four double-digit-scoring games for the Dodgers in the last two and a half weeks, and seven games scoring at least eight runs.\n\nOver the 14-2 stretch, the Dodgers have averaged 6.25 runs per game, which is good enough to sweep a lot of problems under the rug.\n\nIn his first major league game in nearly 23 months on Monday, for instance, Walker Buehler allowed three runs in his four innings. But the Dodgers scored three runs in the first inning, two more in the second, and another run in the third, such that after the top of the first inning the Dodgers never trailed.\n\n\"I kept messing it up, and they kept fixing it,\" Buehler said Monday night.\n\nShohei Ohtani homered in that game on Monday, and leads the team with seven home runs during this 16-game stretch, with an 1.185 OPS. He leads the majors in several categories on the season.\n\n\"He's the best player ever,\" Buehler said of Ohtani. \"They gave him twice as much money as anyone's ever made in this game, and he keeps proving why we did that.\"\n\nFreddie Freeman has seven doubles and is tied with Ohtani with a team-leading 10 extra-base hits over the last 16 games.\n\nRookie Andy Pages is thriving in his runway of playing time, leading the Dodgers in hits (22) during this stretch, with four home runs, four doubles, and his 13 RBI are second-best over the last 16 games.\n\nTeoscar Hern\u00e1ndez has five home runs, and drove in all three runs in Wednesday's win that finished off a sweep of the Marlins.\n\nMookie Betts set the world on fire while winning National League player of the month in April, but has cooled off in a relative sense with an .845 OPS over the last 16 games. That's still a very good number, but ranks seventh on the team during that span.\n\nBut for the most part, Dodgers pitching hasn't needed much help from the offense over the last two and a half weeks.\n\nTyler Glasnow and Yoshinobu Yamamoto won all six starts during this stretch, allowing a total of five runs in 41 innings. Each has an eight-inning start -- Glasnow on April 21, Yamamoto on Tuesday -- something the Dodgers didn't get at all in 2023.\n\nGavin Stone has allowed three solo home runs over his last three starts and nothing else in 20 innings.\n\nExcluding the planned bullpen game on April 28 in Toronto, Dodgers starting pitchers during this run have a 1.95 ERA while averaging 6.15 innings, the perfect recipe for an 11-0 record in those 15 starts.\n\nThe bullpen has been even stingier, with a 1.37 ERA in 52\u2153 innings. That includes bulk left-hander Ryan Yarbrough pitching nine scoreless innings. Just about the only ding among the relievers over the last two and a half weeks are the injuries suffered by high-leverage right-handers Evan Phillips (hamstring), Ryan Brasier (calf), and Joe Kelly (shoulder) in the last week.\n\nOn the whole, the pitching staff has allowed no more than four runs in any one game over the last 16 games, and allowing four only twice.\n\nBefore winning on April 21 to start this hot streak, the Dodgers lost their previous three games and never led once in those games. But in the last 16 games, the Dodgers have trailed at the end of only 17 of 145 innings.", "source": {"uri": "truebluela.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "True Blue LA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_stephen@truebluela.com", "name": "Eric Stephen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Yarbrough", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Yarbrough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Brasier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Brasier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Kelly_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Kelly (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Party_Games/Drinking_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Party Games/Drinking Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r8a1HYHJZqxhR_DoLRMx6OzilsI=/0x0:8045x4023/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25439820/2151543127.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-21", "textStart": 645, "textEnd": 653, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-28", "textStart": 2893, "textEnd": 2901}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

He'll make his return against a struggling Miami Marlins team on May 6.\n\nMy Marlins vs. Dodgers predictions touch on the unlikelihood of Miami hurler Roddery Munoz continuing his strong pitching, and to fade him I've chosen to target the Over of Will Smith's total bases market in my best MLB picks.\n\nMy analysis\n\nThe Miami Marlins believe they've found something with Roddery Munoz. Early returns have been positive -- the rookie became just the second hurler in Marlins history with at least 13 Ks and a WHIP under 0.75 across their first two starts, joining Jose Fernandez.\n\nThat's an impressive start to one's career, but it's fair to question whether or not the effectiveness will continue. Munoz sports a career 5.47 ERA and 1.49 WHIP in 223 2/3 innings in the Minors and was blasted for an 0-3 record, 8.62 ERA, and 1.79 WHIP in 15 2/3 innings at AAA this year before \"earning\" the call-up.\n\nThose are concerning numbers, and it's hard to envision the 24-year-old stymying the fearsome Los Angeles Dodgers. The projection systems are pretty bearish on his odds, and the least-friendly (THE BAT) calls for a 5.02 ERA and 4.78 FIP. He's posted an unimpressive 96 Pitching+ through two starts, which undermines his surface-level statistics and ranks 149th out of 188 starting pitchers.\n\nThings could come crashing to a halt as soon as Monday night against a lethal Dodgers lineup that smacks right-handed pitching with a league-best wRC+ (136) and wOBA (.360). Isolating for the last 15 days, those numbers become even more impressive (165 wRC+ and .402 wOBA).\n\nI'm looking to fade Munoz, and there are a few avenues to do so. LA's team total is set at 4.5, but you're required to pay a hefty tax on the Over. An alternative run line of 5.5 is decently appealing.\n\nMy favorite option on the board is catcher Will Smith to record 2+ total bases at +145 odds. He's been hot at the dish, recording a hit in eight straight appearances to boost his OPS to .930. The slugger received a day off on Sunday, and that's been a good sign lately, as he's homered in each of his last two games after a day of rest.\n\nSmith has recorded two or more total bases in six of his last eight starts, and I like his odds of staying hot against a hittable pitcher who's projected to come back to earth.\n\nMunoz posted a 1.79 WHIP at AAA this year and has sported a WHIP above 1.50 at each of his last four Minor League stops, so I'm happy to fade him here against the MLB's best lineup against right-handed pitching. L.A. has the league's best run differential (+63) while Miami has the second-worst (-68), so this is a mismatch.\n\nLastly, Dodgers star Walker Buehler returns to the mound after a 22-month hiatus. It's difficult to know exactly what to expect after such a long layoff, but Buehler struggled with his command in six rehab starts and posted an unseemly 1.62 WHIP.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nWill Smith has recorded 2+ total bases in six of his last eight games.

It could be his best option.\n\nMax Muncy hit a first-inning grand slam and the Dodgers never looked back, rolling over the Marlins, 8-2, on Tuesday night for their sixth consecutive win and 13th in their past 15 games.\n\nThe Dodgers have outscored their opponents 107-30 during this surge, a run differential that reflects just how dominant they have been both on offense and defense.\n\nDodgers hitters are batting .292 during the 15-game stretch with 27 home runs, averaging 7.13 runs per game.\n\nAt the same time, Dodgers pitchers have a 1.79 ERA and a 1.00 WHIP.\n\nThe Marlins were complicit in their own demise Tuesday. Starter Edward Cabrera walked four of the first 11 Dodgers batters and hit another one. Mookie Betts flew out to start the bottom of the first against Cabrera. The next ball the Dodgers put in play was an opposite-field grand slam by Muncy.\n\nCabrera was gone after two innings but his reliever George Soriano didn't seem to learn from his mistakes. He hit the first batter he faced, gave up a broken-bat double to Muncy then walked Teoscar Hernandez to load the bases again.\n\nAndy Pages drove in one run with a sacrifice fly and Marlins catcher Christian Bethancourt drove in another when he threw wildly on an ill-advised pickoff attempt at third base.\n\nGavin Lux followed by lining a two-run home run into the right field pavilion. A night after Walker Buehler made his first big-league start since June 2022, the home run was Lux's first since Aug. 15, 2022. Lux missed the 2023 season following a devastating spring knee injury and has gotten off to a slow start this year.\n\nWhile the Marlins pitchers searched for the strike zone, Dodgers starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto was filling it up. Jazz Chisholm Jr. ambushed Yamamoto's first-pitch fastball to start the game. The leadoff home run snapped a 15-inning scoreless streak for Yamamoto but he cruised through the first five innings on just 59 pitches - only 10 of them called balls.\n\nYamamoto gave up another home run (to Bryan De La Cruz) in the sixth inning but his pitch efficiency allowed him to complete eight innings for the first time in his eight MLB starts. Yamamoto's 97th and final pitch of the night was a 95-mph fastball blown past De La Cruz for his fifth strikeout of the night.\n\nThe right-hander allowed five hits and lowered his ERA to 2.79.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bill_plunkett@ocregister.com", "name": "Bill Plunkett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Cabrera", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edward Cabrera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Muncy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Max Muncy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Schumaker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skip Schumaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Soriano", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Soriano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_fly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice fly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_De_La_Cruz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryan De La Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Chisholm_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jazz Chisholm Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinobu_Yamamoto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoshinobu Yamamoto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pickoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/imageedit_16_2172921527.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2015-08-", "textStart": 1719, "textEnd": 1726}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Hernandez was the star of the show on Wednesday, hitting an RBI single in the first to give the Dodgers the lead before his two-run blast in the sixth secured the win.\n\nWhen asked if he made any adjustments to his game, the outfielder said:\n\n\"Nothing different.

Over seven innings pitched, the righty allowed six hits and one home run, while recording four strikeouts. The youngster has been impressive in the MLB this season, and his performance took his record to 3-1 for the current campaign.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nishant_borooah@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Nishant Borooah", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F\u00e9lix_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Slugger_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silver Slugger Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Mariners", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Mariners"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/5f3db-17152216783510-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

He showed promise by not allowing a run over 1 1/3 innings in the pressure cooker that became an eventual Dodgers victory.\n\nNow a member of the Marlins after a trade last season, Weathers (2-3, 4.54 ERA) will face Los Angeles on Wednesday after matching his career high by going six innings against the Oakland Athletics on Friday. He gave up three runs but didn't walk a batter while taking the loss.\n\n\"I thought Weathers was good (with) 70 percent strikes, or something like that,\" Marlins manager Skip Schumaker said. \"Slider (and) changeup was excellent. I thought the command on both of those pitches and the swing-and-miss was good.\"\n\nWeathers will need more of the same against the high-octane Los Angeles offense, which used a Max Muncy grand slam in the first inning on Tuesday to start its way to an 8-2 victory over the Marlins. The Dodgers turned five walks, two hit batters and five hits into the win.\n\n\"You get in bad counts and they'll make you pay,\" Schumaker said. \"That's what good teams do. You cannot do that against that team, and that's how they get the eight runs on the board.\"\n\nCounting his playoff appearance, Weathers' six career outings against the Dodgers are tied for his most against any club. In the five regular-season outings (four starts) vs. Los Angeles, he is 0-1 with a 4.66 ERA.\n\nIn something of an awakening, the Marlins delivered a three-game home sweep of the Colorado Rockies last week, but they are 1-4 heading into the finale of a six-game West Coast trip.\n\nThe Dodgers, on the other hand, are on a six-game winning streak and looking to sweep consecutive home series after rolling through the Atlanta Braves over the weekend. Los Angeles has won 13 of 15.\n\n\"It's a good indicator of what this group is capable of and I think everyone in here would admit that we let those two (recent defeats) get away from us,\" Muncy said. \"It's been fun showing up every single day, and we have a good group here.\"\n\nRight-hander Gavin Stone started off the homestand by allowing one run over six innings against the Braves on Friday in a game the Dodgers won in 11 innings. He gets to put bookends on the homestand by pitching Wednesday.\n\nStone (2-1, 4.06 ERA) has not faced the Marlins in his career.\n\nThrough eight appearances (four starts) last season and six outings (all starts) this year, Stone has been trending upward. In his past two outings, he gave up two combined runs over 13 innings. He allowed two hits over seven innings in a road win over the Toronto Blue Jays on April 26.\n\n\"We're in first place right now, and he saved us a lot, helped us win a lot of baseball games,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"Watching his growth, I'm not surprised given his makeup, his command of the fastball, confidence in the changeup, the slider has gotten a lot better. So he's starting to become a real major league starter.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Weathers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Weathers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Schumaker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skip Schumaker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Division_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League Division Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Muncy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Muncy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Blue_Jays", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Blue Jays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 2855, "textEnd": 2863}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The first two went well - a 1-0 record and 2.45 ERA, allowing only three runs on five hits in his first eleven innings.

It's one of those things where hitting is contagious, but also starting pitching is contagious.\"\n\nFreddie Freeman got aboard with a two-out double off the wall in right field before Hern\u00e1ndez drove a full-count changeup from Ryan Weathers (2-4) just over the wall in left center and past the outstretched glove of Miami left fielder Nick Gordon.\n\nMiami manager Skip Schumaker ended up second-guessing his decision of allowing Weathers to pitch to Hern\u00e1ndez with first base open and Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez on deck.\n\n\"At the end of the day, that's on me. I should have taken that situation out of their hands and had him face Kik\u00e9,\" Schumaker said. \"I thought there's a chance that he would pitch around him a little bit where he could chase. And in worse-case scenario he would put him on and go attack Kik\u00e9.\"\n\nHern\u00e1ndez drove in all three Los Angeles runs in a game that went only 1 hour, 55 minutes, the shortest contest at Dodger Stadium in 21 years. His RBI base hit to right marked the fourth straight game the Dodgers scored in the first inning.\n\n\"Nowadays the outfielders make plays. I was waiting until he was laying on the ground. After that I celebrated,\" said Hern\u00e1ndez, who leads with Dodgers with 29 RBIs. \"I was looking for changeup. He got me out on my second at-bat with a changeup and then at 3-1 he threw a changeup.\"\n\nBryan De La Cruz went deep for the second straight game, accounting for Miami's only run with a solo shot to left in the fourth inning.

I'll take that version of Ryan Weathers any day of the week,\" Schumaker said. \"We just couldn't get anything going.\"\n\nStone (3-1) went seven innings and allowed only one run on six hits with four strikeouts. Five of the Dodgers' starters during the homestand went at least six innings and posted a 2.33 ERA with 31 strikeouts and only four walks.\n\n\"He had command of all his pitches and induced a lot of weak contact. To see him again get to the seventh inning is pretty commendable,\" Roberts said of Stone.\n\nDaniel Hudson retired the Marlins in order in the ninth for his second save.\n\nWeathers allowed three runs and five hits in six innings.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nMarlins: RHP Edward Cabrera was placed on the 15-day injured list for the second time this season due to right shoulder impingement. He left Tuesday's game after two innings.

Their pitchers have combined for a 1.74 ERA, yielding 28 earned runs and 12 homers in 145 innings.\n\nThe Dodgers entered the day with 23 defensive runs saved, according to Fangraphs, the third-best team total in the league, and Wednesday's errorless game ended with second baseman Miguel Rojas charging a slow Jesus Sanchez roller and making a quick and accurate off-balance throw to first for the final out.\n\nDodgers starting pitchers have notched 11 quality starts and allowed 23 earned runs in 94 1/3 innings in the 16 games, good for a 2.19 ERA.\n\nThe bullpen - after Michael Grove's scoreless eighth inning and Daniel Hudson's scoreless ninth - has allowed five earned runs over 50 2/3 innings during the stretch, good for an 0.89 ERA. And that's despite losing closer Evan Phillips and setup men Joe Kelly and Ryan Brasier to injuries during the stretch.\n\n\"We've played some great baseball at times over the years, but this [stretch], from all facets of the game, is as good as I've seen,\" Roberts said. \"It's hard to beat what we've done.\"\n\nThe Dodgers didn't pound the ball on Wednesday, mustering six hits against hard-throwing Marlins left-hander Ryan Weathers and two relievers in the 1-hour, 55-minute matinee, the shortest Dodgers game since 2003. But when you pitch as well as they did - the Dodgers did not walk a batter - you don't have to.\n\n\"I think you win with pitching and defense, like everyone says, and our offense is the best in the league,\" Rojas said. \"The starters have been doing their part, and the bullpen has been amazing. Everything is clicking right now for us, and we have to kind of continue to ride the wave.\"\n\nThe Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first when Freddie Freeman reached on a two-out, broken-bat single to right-center field, took second on a balk, third on a wild pitch and scored on Hern\u00e1ndez's RBI single to right.\n\nThe Marlins tied the score in the fourth when Bryan De La Cruz lined an 88-mph change-up from Stone, one of the right-hander's few mistakes, into the left-field bullpen for a leadoff homer.\n\nJake Burger and Josh Bell followed with singles, but Stone escaped the two-on, no-outs jam by snagging Sanchez's hard one-hopper to his left and firing to shortstop Mookie Betts to start a double play and striking out Nick Gordon with a 96-mph fastball.\n\n\"I didn't know I had it, first off - it kind of surprised me that it was in my glove,\" Stone said of the double-play ball. \"But Mookie is a super athlete, so if I just throw it anywhere around the bag, he's probably going to turn it.\"\n\nStone, leaning heavily on a fastball that averaged 94.2 mph and an 86.5-mph change-up, blanked the Marlins on two hits over his final three innings. He is 3-1 with a 3.55 ERA on the season and 3-0 with a 2.10 ERA in his last five starts in which he's given up seven earned runs and 22 hits, struck out 16 and walked nine in 30 innings.\n\n\"He's been very consistent with his command, his conviction, his confidence, and as a result, he's gone deeper into games,\" Roberts said. \"He looks like a seasoned major league pitcher. He has that boyish face, but the demeanor on the mound, he's a bulldog out there.\"\n\nStone, 25, struggled in four big league stints in 2023, going 1-1 with a 9.00 ERA, but he has found his footing - and a dash of swagger - with an extended run in the rotation to start 2024.\n\n\"Yeah, I would probably say confidence and conviction in all of my pitches,\" Stone said, when asked about the difference between 2023 and 2024. \"I feel like that's a key for not only me, but for every pitcher. If you pitch with conviction, more likely than not, good things will happen.\"\n\nHern\u00e1ndez put Stone in line for the win in the sixth when he followed another Freeman two-out hit, this one a double into the right-field corner, with a towering two-run homer to left-center field on a full-count change-up for a 3-1 lead.\n\n\"I was thinking change-up, yeah,\" Hern\u00e1ndez said of his battle against Weathers. \"He got me out in my second at-bat with a change-up, he threw me a change-up on a 3-and-1 count, and I knew he was going back to that.\"\n\nThe Dodgers signed Hern\u00e1ndez to a one-year, $23.5 million deal last winter in hopes that the 31-year-old slugger would add power and length to a lineup headed by Betts, Shohei Ohtani, Freeman and Will Smith. Hern\u00e1ndez is batting .265 with an .843 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, 10 homers and a team-leading 29 RBIs.\n\n\"He's exceeded all of my expectations,\" Roberts said. \"In that situation, they were trying to pitch around him and to be careful, he got to 3-2 and [Weathers] left that change-up just a little bit up and he put a good swing on it. Give him a lot of credit. But he likes being in that spot. He's not afraid to drive in a run.\"", "source": {"uri": "miamiherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Miami Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_digiovanna@miamiherald.com", "name": "Mike

In climbing back into the top spot, the Dodgers managed to displace the Atlanta Braves, who had been Newsweek's top team for two consecutive weeks. The Dodgers swept the Braves in a three-game series at Dodger Stadium ending Sunday.\n\nThe Dodgers aren't merely winning, they're winning big. During the six-game streak, they have managed to outscore opponents by a cumulative score of 42-11. That's an unsustainably large run differential for a full season, but it speaks to the Dodgers' dominance on both sides of the ball.\n\nMookie Betts and Shohei Ohtani are 1-2 in MLB in Wins Above Replacement. Tyler Glasnow leads MLB in innings, wins, and strikeouts, forming a potent 1-2 with Yoshinobu Yamamoto atop the rotation. Evan Phillips was looking like a capital-C closer before suffering a mild hamstring strain. After some early hiccups, the Dodgers have shifted around their personnel in the field to create one of the game's best defenses.\n\nDepth has been an issue at times for the Dodgers, but lately that's been moot. Fans who embraced the World-Series-Or-Bust mantra at the beginning of the year expected nothing less. Still, as the last month has shown, it shouldn't be taken for granted that the Dodgers look like baseball's best team to begin both April and May.\n\nPhoto Credit: Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports", "source": {"uri": "dodgersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodgers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jp_hoornstra@dodgersnation.com", "name": "Jp Hoornstra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinobu_Yamamoto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoshinobu Yamamoto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://dodgersnation.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/USATSI_23184927_168396005_lowres.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

But then he settled in for his longest major league start to date in a Dodgers 8-2 rout of the Marlins that was essentially decided by the third inning.\n\nSix straight wins matches a season high for the Dodgers, matching their previous best which was also in the last three weeks to tell you how things have gone of late for Los Angeles.\n\nYamamoto pounded the zone all night, with 73 of his 97 pitches for strikes. The very first one was perhaps too much of a strike, a fastball right down the middle that Jazz Chisholm Jr. quickly turned into a souvenir.\n\nBut Yamamoto allowed only four hits the rest of the way, one of them was another solo home run, this one by designated hitter Bryan De La Cruz in the sixth inning. The efficiency for Yamamoto included no walks, and allowed him to pitch his longest outing to date with the Dodgers, going eight innings to win his third straight start. The eight innings match Tyler Glasnow's April 21 start for the longest by a Dodgers pitcher both this season and last.\n\nOn the season, Yamamoto has only eight walks in his eight starts, with 47 strikeouts in 42 innings and a 2.79 ERA.\n\nThough he trailed early, Yamamoto didn't have to wait long for a lead.\n\nThe Dodgers struggles with the bases loaded have been well-documented this season, hitting just .182/.216/.273 entering Tuesday, with six hits in 33 at-bats, and 14 strikeouts. They had three doubles with the bases loaded, but no grand slams. At least until Max Muncy cleared the bases with an opposite-field blast in the first inning, making Marlins starter Edward Cabrera pay dearly for the two walks and a full-count hit batter immediately preceding Muncy's home run, his 10th of the season.\n\nMuncy, whose three grand slams last year tied a Dodgers record, part of the team-record 11 slams in 2023, now has six grand slams in his career, tied for fourth-most since the Dodgers moved to Los Angeles, trailing only Mike Piazza (eight), Matt Kemp (seven), and Cody Bellinger (seven).\n\nOn the whole Muncy has been quite productive, now hitting .263/.370/.570 with a 161 wRC+, including a double in addition to his home run on Tuesday.\n\nBut he also has a very odd stretch of games over the last month or so. The last time he had at least one hit in a game but no extra-base hits was April 3. In the 24 games since, he had 13 games with no hits. In the 11 games during that stretch when Muncy does have a hit, he also has an extra-base hit. In that span, Muncy has eight home runs, six doubles, and six singles.\n\nCatch '22\n\nSomewhat lost in the fact that Blake Treinen on Sunday pitched in his first major league game since 2022, and on Monday Walker Buehler did the same, is that Gavin Lux this season is also back after missing an entire season following major surgery. Lux launched a ball over the wall in right field in the third inning for a two-run shot that expanded the Dodgers' lead to 8-1.\n\nThat was the first home run since August 15, 2022 for Lux, who reached base twice on Tuesday. Lux has two extra-base hits in his last 20 plate appearances, after just one (a double) in his first 77 PA this season.\n\nThe Dodgers finish off the homestand with a game under the sun on getaway day (12:10 p.m., SportsNet LA). Gavin Stone is on the mound going for the sweep, making just the second start on four days rest for the Dodgers in 2024.

It's one of those things where hitting is contagious, but also starting pitching is contagious.\"\n\nFreddie Freeman got aboard with a two-out double off the wall in right field before Hern\u00e1ndez drove a full-count changeup from Ryan Weathers (2-4) just over the wall in left center and past the outstretched glove of Miami left fielder Nick Gordon.\n\nMiami manager Skip Schumaker ended up second-guessing his decision of allowing Weathers to pitch to Hern\u00e1ndez with first base open and Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez on deck.\n\n\"At the end of the day, that's on me. I should have taken that situation out of their hands and had him face Kik\u00e9,\" Schumaker said. \"I thought there's a chance that he would pitch around him a little bit where he could chase. And in worse-case scenario he would put him on and go attack Kik\u00e9.\"\n\nHern\u00e1ndez drove in all three Los Angeles runs in a game that went only 1 hour, 55 minutes, the shortest contest at Dodger Stadium in 21 years. His RBI base hit to right marked the fourth straight game the Dodgers scored in the first inning.\n\n\"Nowadays the outfielders make plays. I was waiting until he was laying on the ground. After that I celebrated,\" said Hern\u00e1ndez, who leads with Dodgers with 29 RBIs. \"I was looking for changeup. He got me out on my second at-bat with a changeup and then at 3-1 he threw a changeup.\"\n\nBryan De La Cruz went deep for the second straight game, accounting for Miami's only run with a solo shot to left in the fourth inning.

The Dodgers have won 14 of their past 16.\n\n\"Today we didn't put up a bunch of runs, but we got a big hit when we needed it,\" Manager Dave Roberts said. \"The starters are coming into their own. It's one of those things where hitting is contagious, but also starting pitching is contagious.\"\n\nFreddie Freeman got aboard with a two-out double off the wall in right field before Hern\u00e1ndez drove a full-count changeup from Ryan Weathers (2-4) over the wall in left-center. The key blow sailed just past the outstretched glove of Marlins left fielder Nick Gordon.\n\nMiami Manager Skip Schumaker second-guessed his decision to allow Weathers to pitch to Hern\u00e1ndez with first base open and Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez on deck.\n\n\"At the end of the day, that's on me,\" Mr. Schumaker said. \"I should have taken that situation out of their hands and had him face Kik\u00e9. I thought there's a chance that he would pitch around him a little bit where he could chase. And in a worse-case scenario, he would put him on and go attack Kik\u00e9.\"\n\nTeoscar Hern\u00e1ndez drove in all three Los Angeles runs in a game that lasted only one hour, 55 minutes, the shortest contest at Dodger Stadium in 21 years. His RBI base hit to right marked the fourth straight game the Dodgers scored in the first inning.\n\n\"Nowadays, the outfielders make plays. I was waiting until he was laying on the ground. After that, I celebrated,\" said Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez, who leads the Dodgers with 29 RBIs. \"I was looking for a changeup. He got me out on my second at-bat with a changeup, and then at 3-1 he threw a changeup.\"\n\nBryan De La Cruz went deep for the second straight game, accounting for Miami's only run with a solo shot to left in the fourth inning. It is the second time this season he has homered in back-to-back games.\n\nThe Marlins dropped five of six games on their road trip.\n\n\"It's tough to win with one run,\" Mr. Schumaker said. \"Ryan did really well.

The Dodgers accomplished the feat with a 10-3 victory over the Washington Nationals on May 6, 2009.\n\nPrior to the Dodgers, the last team to start a season with a 12-game home winning streak the Ty-Cobb era 1911 Detroit Tigers. The Tigers lost the following day, and went on to finish the 1911 season with a 89-65 record that included a 51-25 mark at home.\n\nAs for the Dodgers, they improved to 21-8 with their record-setting victory. That was nine games better than their record on the same day the previous season and were in first place in the National League West by six and a half games.\n\nThe record-breaking win against the Nationals also marked Clayton Kershaw's first victory of the season. He only pitched five innings but held the Nationals to just one run on four hits and three walks. Kershaw additionally collected five strikeouts.\n\nKershaw was spotted an early lead thanks to Andre Ethier grounding into a double play with the bases loaded in the first inning. After the Nationals tied the game, the Dodgers took a lead in the fifth inning on Ethier's bases-loaded walk.\n\nThe Dodgers then broke the game open with a seven-run sixth inning that included Manny Ramirez driving in a pair on a double.\n\nUnfortunately for the Dodgers, their record-setting home winning streak was snapped the next day in an 11-9 loss to the Nationals.\n\nThe Dodgers ended the season in first place in the NL West with a 95-67 record, which featured going 50-31 at Dodger Stadium.\n\nPrior to breaking the MLB record for most home wins in a row to start the season, the Dodgers franchise record was set at 10 games.\n\nWhile the 2009 Dodgers etched themselves in the MLB record book, the 2019 team set a franchise record with 59 wins at Dodger Stadium.\n\nAlso on this day in Dodgers history, Andre Ethier extended his hitting streak to 30 games in 2001. However, he went 0-for-4 the next game, bringing an end to the second-longest hitting streak in Dodgers franchise history.\n\nWillie Davis holds the franchise record with a 31-game hitting streak during the 1969 season.", "source": {"uri": "dodgerblue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dodger Blue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "trevor_morgan@dodgerblue.com", "name": "Trevor Morgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Kershaw", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clayton Kershaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Tigers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Tigers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Ethier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Ethier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Double play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Davis_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willie Davis (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Ramirez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manny Ramirez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_streak", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hitting streak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s22927.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC01049.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2009-05-06", "textStart": 223, "textEnd": 234}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Dodgers Game Preview: Yoshinobu Yamamoto Looks To Continue Hot Stretch", "body": "The Los Angeles Dodgers took down the Miami Marlins in the opener, providing them with another opportunity to secure a series win in the middle game on Tuesday.\n\nThe Dodgers sit atop the National League West with a 24-13 record, riding a five-game win streak. Having won eight of their prior 10 games, their offense also ranks as the best unit in Major League Baseball.\n\nTheir 152 wRC+ as a team in that span is the top mark by a wide margin, also leading MLB with a combined .886 on-base plus slugging since April 26.\n\nOn the year, the Dodgers' offense is still the best in baseball, leading in runs scored, OPS, wRC+ (134) and weighted runs above average (wRAA) at 54.3, combined. For comparison, the Baltimore Orioles slot in second at 24.4 wRAA.\n\nThe Dodgers hand the ball to Yoshinobu Yamamoto on Tuesday, making his eight start of the season. The right-hander has pitched to the tune of a 2.91 ERA, 2.61 FIP, 1.09 WHIP, with a .221 batting average allowed.\n\nOutside of his blow-up start in South Korea, Yamamoto has been a top-five starting pitcher in MLB. Since March 30, he owns a 1.64 ERA, 2.54 FIP, 2.62 xFIP, stranding 89.9% of runners who reach base.\n\nHe's still susceptible to making mistakes, but his issues in that area can be attributed to his four-seam fastball and finding how to execute his primary pitch.\n\nThe Marlins offense has been incredibly aggressive this season, punishing pitchers on the first-pitch of an at-bat. Yamamoto should look to make a pitcher's pitch to start off each plate appearance, avoiding easy swings for a struggling group of bats.\n\nHe'll be opposed by right-hander Edward Cabrera, making his fifth start of the regular season. The 26-year-old is a promising arm for the Marlins, dating back several years in their farm system.\n\nIn his four starts this year, Cabrera has a 6.05 ERA, 1.50 WHIP, and a .253 batting average allowed. Looking at his 2.94 FIP, he's pitched better than his ERA suggests, as he's struck out 13.97 batters per nine innings.\n\nCabrera also ranks in the 22nd percentile in walk-rate, while allowing an 11.1% barrel rate. Even with his ability to strike hitters out, it poses a difficult task against a patient Dodgers offense that punishes free runners and mistake pitches.\n\nAgainst right-handed pitching, the Dodgers have three of MLB's top bats in Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Max Muncy. All of which rank within the top-20.\n\nSS: Mookie Betts\n\nDH: Shohei Ohtani\n\n1B: Freddie Freeman\n\nC: Will Smith\n\nLF: Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez\n\nRF: Andy Pages\n\n2B: Gavin Lux\n\nCF: James

Read on for my best bet and full MLB picks with Marlins vs. Dodgers predictions on Tuesday, May 7.\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto has been fantastic since getting shelled for five earned runs in just a single inning in his debut. He's allowed just six earned runs across his next six starts, good for a 1.64 ERA.\n\nSimply put, he's been one of the most effective starters in baseball and the Dodgers' front office has to feel like they've gotten their money's worth thus far from the Japanese import. He carries a 2.91 ERA, 3.32 xERA, and 2.61 FIP into Tuesday's meeting with the Miami Marlins.\n\nMiami has been lost at the dish, ranking 26th in wRC+ (88) and 24th in wOBA (.293) against right-handed pitching. The Marlins have already waved the white flag despite the season still being so young, trading away Luis Arraez, one of only two regulars with a wRC+ above 100. It's only going downhill from here.\n\nOn the flip side, Miami sends the hard-throwing Edward Cabrera to the mound. His 6.05 ERA doesn't look great, but the underlying metrics are more promising. His 3.50 xERA and 2.94 FIP point toward better days ahead, and most projection systems paint him with an ERA in the low 4.00s.\n\nThe 6-foot-5 hurler needs to clean up the walks and barrels, but he has a lot of strengths to build around. He pumps gas at 96 mph on his heater and his xBA (.186) indicates that opposing batters will stop pounding it for hits as frequently (.357 BA).\n\nWhile his 11.1% barrel rate is concerning, he ranks in the 85th percentile in hard-hit percentage (31.1%) and the 94th percentile in average exit velocity (84.8 mph). It wouldn't be surprising if he brings that number down after sporting a respectable 6.9% barrel rate a year ago.\n\nCabrera has a strong 12.6% swinging strike rate and ranks in the 84th percentile in chase rate (84th). His stuff is good enough to fool batters routinely and he's racked up an absurd amount of punchouts this season, averaging 13.97 Ks per nine innings.\n\nI like the outlook for both starting pitchers, and one team's lineup has already called it quits on the season. I'll take the Under.\n\nCabrera is rocking an impressive 35.3% K-rate supported by some impressive underlying metrics. It'll be difficult to keep up this pace forever, but I see no reason to expect severe regression in the short term as long as he keeps pumping gas and making batters whiff.\n\nYamamoto, meanwhile, has a 30% K-rate and has recorded 6+ strikeouts in four of his previous five starts.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Dodgers have hit their Team Total Under in 10 of their last 15 home games.

He beat the likes of Emmet Sheehan and Michael Grove for the starting role, as well as outside candidates like Ryan Yarbrough and Kyle Hurt. He has only further distanced himself from the group.\n\n\"Confidence, conviction - I feel like that's key for not only me, but for every pitcher and so if you pitch with conviction, more likely than not, good things will happen,\" Stone said.\n\nThe perfect homestand might have showcased the Dodgers' power-proficient offense, but Stone started it and ended it with outings that led to victories, first over the Atlanta Braves on Friday and then against the Marlins.\n\nIt was just the 15th outing of Stone's promising career, dating to last season, and his 11th start. In his last five starts, he has given up two runs or less, including three consecutive when he went at least six innings while giving up a single run.\n\n\"He's been very consistent with his command, conviction and confidence,\" Manager Dave Roberts said.\n\nAnd that was before Wednesday's outing.\n\n\"I've seen way more consistency with that and as a result he has gone deeper into games,\" Roberts said. \"He looks like a seasoned major league pitcher. He obviously has a boyish face, but the demeanor on the mound, he's a bulldog out there. It's been fun to watch him gain that confidence.\"\n\nA slow-starting offense finally saved the day against Marlins left-hander Ryan Weathers as only it knows how: with a home run. The Dodgers entered with 14 home runs over their previous four games but only needed the lone blast from Hernandez to make another victory come to fruition.\n\nIn a 1-1 game in the sixth inning, with Freddie Freeman on second base after a two-out double, Hernandez hit a full-count pitch from Weathers just over the left-field wall and barely out of reach of the Marlins' Nick Gordon.\n\nHernandez's home run celebration was a bit delayed.\n\n\"Nowadays the outfielders make plays and they act like they don't, just to see the hitters celebrate and say, 'Oh, I have the ball,'\" Hernandez said after his 10th homer moved him one off Shohei Ohtani's MLB lead. \"So I was waiting until he was getting up from the ground. After that I was celebrating.\"\n\nIt was Hernandez's third RBI on the day after a two-out rally in the first inning, when Freeman singled, went to second on a balk and advanced to third on a wild pitch. Hernandez's single to right field made it 1-0.\n\nThe Marlins tied it with a home run from Bryan De La Cruz in the fourth inning, his eighth of the season and second in four at-bats after also hitting one Tuesday.\n\nStone rebounded to deliver three more scoreless innings, while a reorganized bullpen closed out another sweep. After Evan Phillips (hamstring) and Joe Kelly (shoulder) each went on the injured list during the homestand, Michael Grove pitched a scoreless eighth inning and Daniel Hudson added a scoreless ninth for his second save.\n\n\"You win and you sustain winning with starting pitching,\" Roberts said. \"They're giving us a chance to win. They're taking care of the bullpen. Today we didn't put up a bunch of runs, but we scored just enough.\n\n\"... I think it's one of those things where I think hitting is contagious and starting pitching is contagious.

Ryan Weathers allowed only five hits and a walk in his six innings, but the sequencing of those hits cost him dearly.\n\nWith two outs in the first inning, Freddie Freeman singled off Weathers, then advanced on a balk and got to third base on a wild pitch. Hern\u00e1ndez singled to left for the first run of the game.\n\nThat was pretty much it against Weathers until two outs in the sixth inning, this time in a tie game. Freeman again got things started with a double. After a mound visit from pitching coach ... and first base open, Weathers fell behind 3-1 to Hern\u00e1ndez at the plate. Hern\u00e1ndez swung through a changeup to run the count full, but did not miss the next one, and changed the complexion of the game.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez has four home runs in his last six games, and his 10 on the season are tied for the second-most in the majors, behind only Shohei Ohtani's 11 homers. Hern\u00e1ndez by driving in all three runs on Wednesday now leads the Dodgers with 29 RBI.\n\nThose three runs held up thanks to Gavin Stone, who completed seven innings for the second time in three starts. The right-hander struck out four and walked none, and the only tally against him was a solo home run by Bryan De La Cruz in the fourth inning.\n\nStone has lasted six or more innings in three straight starts and four of his last five, allowing seven total runs during that time and no more than two in any start, lowering his ERA on the season to 3.55.\n\nWith both Evan Phillips and Joe Kelly placed on the injured list within the last four days, the hierarchy in the back end of the Dodgers bullpen is still very much a fluid situation. On Wednesday, Michael Grove got the call with a two-run lead in the eighth inning, and delivered the ninth scoreless outing in his last 10 appearances.\n\nThat left the ninth inning for Daniel Hudson, who recorded his second save of the season with a perfect ninth. At one hour, 55 minutes, Wednesday was the first Dodgers nine-inning game completed in under two hours since April 17, 2006.\n\nThe Dodgers have now won seven in a row and 14 of their last 16 games. They just completed their 14th undefeated homestand of at least six games at Dodger Stadium. They've had longer home winning streaks, and the caveat is that for several decades both homestands and road trips were often longer than one week at a time.\n\nBut still, winning every game on a single homestand, with at least six of them, is still impressive.\n\nThursday is an off day for the Dodgers, who begin a stretch of 13 game days in a row -- tied for their longest stretch this season, along with August 9-21 -- on Friday in San Diego (6:40 p.m., SportsNet LA).

He beat the likes of Emmet Sheehan and Michael Grove for the starting role, as well as outside candidates like Ryan Yarbrough and Kyle Hurt. He has only further distanced himself from the group.\n\nThe perfect homestand might have showcased the Dodgers' power-proficient offense, but Stone started it and ended it with outings that led to victories, first over the Atlanta Braves on Friday and then against the Marlins.\n\nIt was just the 15th outing of Stone's promising career, dating to last season, and his 11th start. In his past five starts, he has given up two runs or less, including three consecutive in which he went at least six innings while giving up a single run.\n\n\"He's been very consistent with his command, conviction and confidence,\" manager Dave Roberts said.\n\nAnd that was before Wednesday's outing.\n\n\"I've seen way more consistency with that and as a result he has gone deeper into games,\" Roberts added. \"He looks like a seasoned major-league pitcher. He obviously has a boyish face, but the demeanor on the mound, he's a bulldog out there. It's been fun to watch him gain that confidence.\n\nA slow-starting offense finally saved the day against Marlins left-hander Ryan Weathers as only it knows how: with a home run. The Dodgers entered with 14 home runs over their previous four games but needed only the lone blast from Hernandez to make another victory come to fruition.\n\nIn a 1-1 game in the sixth inning, with Freddie Freeman on second base after a two-out double, Hernandez hit a full-count pitch from Weathers just over the left-field wall and barely out of reach of the Marlins' Nick Gordon.\n\nIt was Hernandez's third RBI on the day after a two-out rally in the first inning, when Freeman singled, went to second on a balk and advanced to third on a wild pitch. Hernandez's single to right field made it 1-0.\n\nThe Marlins tied it with a home run from Bryan De La Cruz in the fourth inning, his eighth of the season and second in four at-bats after also hitting one Tuesday.\n\nStone rebounded to deliver three more scoreless innings, while a reorganized bullpen closed out another sweep. After Evan Phillips (hamstring) and Joe Kelly (shoulder) went on the injured list during the homestand, Michael Grove pitched a scoreless eighth inning and Daniel Hudson added a scoreless ninth for his second save.", "source": {"uri": "whittierdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whittier Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_padilla@whittierdailynews.com", "name": "Doug Padilla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Weathers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Weathers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Yarbrough", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Yarbrough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hernandez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Hernandez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_De_La_Cruz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryan De La Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evan Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Kelly_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Kelly (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Balk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.whittierdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24129704113938.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-21", "textStart": 665, "textEnd": 673}], "sentiment": 0.4823529411764707, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

After a tough couple of games a few weeks ago, the Dodgers are back to being the championship-level team many expected them to be. Although it is only May, many baseball enthusiasts expect greatness from this team, and how could you not?\n\nThis team made strategic investments and added some of the biggest names in baseball during the past offseason, making it one of the most expensive ones in their history. The Dodgers continue to be a powerhouse, with a roster full of superstars and the addition of two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani. This move signals that L.A. is not just all-in, but should be a force to be reckoned with for years to come.\n\nHowever, if there were any holes to point out for the Dodgers entering this season, it was their defense. On paper, it didn't look pretty, especially on the left side of the field. Thus far, though, the Dodgers have debunked that narrative. Through 37 games, the Dodgers rank second in the major leagues in team defensive runs saved and first in the National League.\n\nSIS baseball shared via Twitter.\n\nThe Dodgers were expected to be something other than an outstanding defensive team coming into the year. The left side of the infield, with Mookie Betts/Gavin Lux at shortstop and Max Muncy at third base, is far from Gold Glove level. On top of that, first-year Dodger outfielder Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez has been a good outfielder, but wasn't expected to be this season. The doubt was there from day one, but thus far, the Dodgers have proved the naysayers wrong.\n\nDodgers president of baseball operations, Andrew Freidman, realized the challenge at hand but believed in the guys from the start. Freidman affirmed that to the Orange County Register's Bill Plunkett before domestic Opening Day.\n\n\"I think it's the area that will probably take up most of our attention and focus,\" Friedman said about the team's infield defense. \"We're optimistic that we've got the right personnel to make it work well. But obviously it's something we'll monitor and continue to stay on top of as we go.\"\n\nL.A. has a long way to go, but thus far it's working, and they'll look to carry this play moving forward.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ricardo_sandoval@si.com", "name": "Ricardo Sandoval", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_Runs_Saved", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive Runs Saved"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Glove_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold Glove Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Lux", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Lux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Muncy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Max Muncy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opening Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3511,h_1974,x_0,y_0/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si-temp/01hxab8b2v9rm88m8qf0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

They were a race car on 87 octane. A classic novel with a chapter missing.\n\nSure the Dodgers assembled one of their more anticipated rosters in a long time, but it had the potential to be destroyed from within by its defense. Or more specifically: infield defense.\n\nThat's how the narrative went, anyway.\n\nGavin Lux was moved off shortstop in spring training because of throwing issues and placed at second base. Mookie Betts moved to short as a career outfielder who merely dabbled on the dirt in recent years. Max Muncy never has been considered a Gold Glove contender.\n\nTo top it off, the Dodgers moved one of the top defensive shortstops in Miguel Rojas into a backup middle infielder role.\n\nAll of it was believed to be an overall flaw that would make the Dodgers' offensive machine a little less potent.\n\nFlash forward to just shy of one-third through the season and the Dodgers were third in the major leagues in FanGraphs' defensive runs saved, heading into Wednesday's game against the Miami Marlins. Defense isn't a liability, it's a strength, at least in the early going for the Dodgers.\n\n\"Defense, sometimes there is a ceiling individually, but I think the floor a lot of times, isn't raised as high as it should be and that's because of effort,\" manager Dave Roberts said. \"And our guys have put forth the effort to raise the floor and the ceiling ... coincidentally.\"\n\nRoberts noted the hard work put forward by Muncy and Betts in order to pull their weight, as well as the mentorship from Rojas, who has been trying to pass on as many tricks of the trade as possible. Lux's determination to improve has been noted.\n\n\"I give Miguel a lot of credit because understanding your role on a ballclub is really important,\" Roberts said. \"Everyone wants to play every day but to feel that you can do things to be additive and help your teammates out and to help us win baseball games, he's done that.\"\n\nThe pitching staff is also helping the defense. The pitching has been so strong and efficient in the early going that it has made life easy for infielders who are growing into their roles. The starting staff has been strong, but so has the bullpen, despite a number of injuries.\n\n\"I think it's no secret that our pitching has been so much better in, call it, the last two weeks,\" Roberts said. \"And that's because our defense has been stellar.\"\n\nAfter the Dodgers enjoy a day off Thursday, they will start a stretch of 13 games in 13 days starting with the opener of a three-game series at San Diego on Friday. From there, it's a trip to San Francisco then home series against the Cincinnati Reds and Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nWith Brusdar Graterol, Evan Phillips, Joe Kelly and Kyle Hurt all out because of injuries, the nearly two-week run of games will put bullpen management at the forefront.\n\n\"That's something that we have to be ready for,\" Roberts said. \"We play some really good teams so we're going to need really good starts. We might drop somebody in at some point to kind of give the starters an extra day. But yeah, bullpen management will be huge.\"\n\nSince Phillips went to the injured list Sunday, the Dodgers had one save situation, with Alex Vesia coming through with his first save of the season Monday and the fourth of his career in five seasons.\n\nRyan Yarbrough's ability to cover multiple innings at a time has been huge for the group with a possibility the left-hander could pick up a spot start during the upcoming stretch.\n\nThe Dodgers off Thursday.\n\nDodgers (RHP Tyler Glasnow, 6-1, 2.70 ERA) at Padres (RHP Michael King, 3-3, 4.29), Friday, 6:40 p.m., SportsNet LA, AM 570",

He owns a Pitching+ of 101.\n\nCabrera is yet to face an offense which ranks higher than 14th in wRC+ versus right-handed pitching.\n\nSo while his underlying results suggest improvement is on the horizon, it's also important to consider he has been getting crushed by softer-than-average opponents thus far.\n\nThe Dodgers rank first in wRC+ to righties by a gigantic margin, with a mark of 138. The next closest rating is the Padres at 123.\n\nIt also doesn't help Cabrera that he has been backed by a Marlins side that has been horrid defensively. The Marlins own a 28th-worst rating in defensive runs saved (minus-20).\n\nCabrera is going to prove to be a better-than-average starter this season.\n\nFor that reason, he is getting some market respect as his earned run line is set at 2.5 with equal odds each way.\n\nThis sets up as a good time to fade Cabrera in that specific market though, because he will get a long leash in this spot given the state of the Marlins' bullpen.\n\nIf Cabrera can pitch six innings without allowing three earned runs to the Dodgers, we will just have to tip our caps to him.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Cabrera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edward Cabrera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_on_balls_in_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average on balls in play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_Runs_Saved", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive Runs Saved"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/shohei-mookie-freddie-dodgers-marlins-e1715115683338.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

The 1-hour, 55-minute game ended with second baseman Miguel Rojas charging a slow Jesus Sanchez grounder and making an accurate off-balance throw to first for the final out.\n\nDodgers starting pitchers have notched 11 quality starts and allowed just 23 earned runs in 94 \u2153 innings over their last 16 games, good for a 2.19 ERA.\n\nThe bullpen, after Michael Grove's scoreless eighth inning and Daniel Hudson's scoreless ninth for the save on Wednesday, has allowed just five earned runs over 50 \u2154 innings during the stretch, good for an 0.89 ERA.\n\n\"We've played some great baseball at times over the years, but this [stretch], from all facets of the game, is as good as I've seen,\" Roberts said. \"It's hard to beat what we've done.\"\n\nThe Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the first on Wednesday when Freddie Freeman reached on a two-out, broken-bat single to right-center field, took second on Marlins pitcher Ryan Weathers' balk, third on a wild pitch and scored on Hern\u00e1ndez's RBI single to right field.\n\nThe Marlins tied the score 1-1 in the top of the fourth when Bryan De La Cruz lined an 88-mph hanging changeup from Stone into the left-field bullpen for a leadoff home run.\n\nJake Burger followed with an infield single, and Josh Bell flared a single to left field, but Stone escaped the two-on, no-outs jam by starting a 1-6-3 double play on Jesus Sanchez's comebacker and striking out Nick Gordon swinging with a 96-mph fastball.\n\nStone, leaning heavily on a fastball that averaged 94.2 mph and a changeup that averaged 86.5 mph, retired eight batters in a row to open the game before giving up a two-out single to Otto Lopez in the third.\n\nHe responded to Miami's run-scoring fourth inning by retiring the side in order in the fifth and allowing just two singles over a scoreless sixth and seventh. Stone is 3-0 with a 2.10 ERA in his last five starts, a stretch in which he has given up seven earned runs and 22 hits, struck out 16 and walked nine in 30 innings.\n\n\"He's been very consistent with his command, his conviction, his confidence, and as a result, he's gone deeper into games,\" Roberts said. \"He looks like a seasoned major league pitcher. He has that boyish face, but the demeanor on the mound, he's a bulldog out there. It's really fun to watch him.\"\n\nTeoscar Hern\u00e1ndez put Stone in line for the win when he followed another Freeman two-out hit, this one a double into the right-field corner in the sixth, with a towering two-run homer to left-center field for a 3-1 lead, giving Hern\u00e1ndez 10 homers and a team-leading 30 RBIs on the season.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Complete game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanGraphs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FanGraphs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_Rojas_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miguel Rojas (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_Runs_Saved", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defensive Runs Saved"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Hudson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Hudson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Error (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Changeup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Weathers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Weathers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liv\u00e1n_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liv\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddie_Freeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddie Freeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2a0adba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5052x2842+0+438/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F35%2F0a%2F44e819594c42b2ba260427122fb8%2F1439088-sp-dogers-marlins01-wjs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Our MLB odds series has our Dodgers-Padres prediction, odds, and pick for Thursday.\n\nThe Dodgers make the trip to San Diego to face the Padres! The Dodgers are one of the best teams in the MLB, while the Padres have been dealing with some inconsistent play across this whole season so far. Our MLB odds series has our Dodgers-Padres prediction, odds, and pick for Thursday.\n\nThe Dodgers were billed as a super team before the year and they currently have a 26-13 record. They are the best offense in the MLB, and then their pitching is a top-10 unit as well. On offense, there are stars galore with Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, Teoscar Hernandez, Freddie Freeman, Will Smith, and Max Muncy to name a few. Their pitching is then led by Tyler Glasnow, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and James Paxton on the mound. The pieces have finally started to fit together and now Dodgers are one of the best teams in the entire MLB right now with all the talent they have on the roster.\n\nThe Padres have been decent to start the season, but inconsistent with a 20-20 record so far on the season. The key has been their offense this season where they rank second in offense only behind the Dodgers. In comparison, their pitching is in the bottom half of the MLB. Fernando Tatis, Manny Machado, Xander Bogaerts, Jurickson Profar, Jackson Merrill, and Jake Cronenworth have been the biggest keys behind the plate and why the Padres have started better than most originally thought before this season. This is after they went through a massive fire sale in the offseason after a disappointing year last year. Their pitching has been bolstered after they added Dylan Cease to a lineup that already had Michael King and Yu Darvish. All of them have been playing well so far this season too.\n\nThe Dodgers are putting Tyler Glasnow on the mound where he has a 6-1 record, a 2.70 ERA, and a 0.92 WHIP. Through 50 innings, he has allowed 15 runs on 33 hits with 13 walks and 63 strikeouts. The Dodgers are 7-1 in the eight games that he has appeared in so far this season. In his last start, he pitched seven innings and allowed two runs on five hits with one walk and 10 strikeouts in a Dodgers win. Glasnow has been playing great on the mound this season and gets a tough matchup against the Padres behind the plate.\n\nThe Padres are starting Michael King to start at pitcher in this spot. So far this year, he has a 3-3 record, a 4.29 ERA, and a 0.80 WHIP. Through 42 innings, he has allowed 25 runs on 38 hits with 21 walks and 43 strikeouts. He has appeared in eight total games so far this season and the Padres have gone 5-3 in those games. In his last start, he pitched six innings and allowed zero runs on six hits, with zero walks and three strikeouts. Michael King has been one of the better pitchers for the Padres this season, but he gets a tough matchup against the Padres in this spot.\n\nThe Padres' offense has started the season red-hot. They are second in team batting average at .260 after finishing last season with a .244 batting average. The offense is highlighted mainly by Jurickson Profar and Fernando Tatis Jr. in most of the batting categories. Profar leads the way in batting average at .328, in RBI at 27, in OBP at .409, and in total hits at 44. Tatis Jr. then leads the way in home runs at seven. Their offense can compete with any team in the MLB, but they get a tough matchup against Tyler Glasnow, who has been great for the Dodgers.\n\nFinal Dodgers-Padres Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Dodgers are this year's super team and it has paid off so far with them being one of the best teams in the MLB.

Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman and Will Smith all came home on Muncy's monstrous opposing field home run.\n\nEntering the game, Muncy was hitting .255 with 22 RBIs. This dinger was his ninth of the season as the Dodgers uplifted the mood in Chavez Ravine. The ball sailed for 381 feet with an exit velocity of 102.4 mph.\n\nEarlier, Japanese star Yoshinobu Yamamoto gave up a home run to Jazz Chisholm Jr. However, with Muncy's hit, the Marlins need some catching up to do.\n\nMax Muncy had a career night against Atlanta Braves\n\nThe Dodgers offense this year has mostly been spearheaded by Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Will Smith. However, in between, Max Muncy has come out of the shadows and led the offense, and that's exactly what happened when the Dodgers routed out the Atlanta Braves, 11-2 on Saturday night.\n\nMuncy had his first career three-home run game on the night when he went 4-of-5. from the plate. This was Muncy's 15th multi-home run game of his career:\n\n\"It was really cool,\" Muncy said. \"First time I've ever done that, so that's obviously a really cool moment for me. I've felt good at the plate last couple weeks. I know the results aren't always there, but I feel like I've put together some decent at-bats and sometimes you get tough pitches. Tonight I feel like I was able to just get the barrel to the ball a little bit better.\"\n\nAmong all the homers, Muncy was most delighted with his center field drive, as he held up his shape the way he liked:\n\n\"To me the best indication was the first one being to center field,\" Muncy said. \"That's just something that, with my approach, I try to stay through the center of the field. I'm obviously going to pull the ball more than I'm not. That's just how it's always going to be.\n\n\"But my approach is always to the center of the field, so whenever I'm able to actually do that, that to me is the best indicator.\"\n\nThe Dodgers have started well in their game against the Marlins.

The three-game set will last until Sunday, May 12. Two division rivals will come together for an important early-season matchup. Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe Dodgers enter this series with a pristine 26-13 record. That is tied for the second-best record in the MLB this season, making them hot favorites for the series. The Padres, on the other hand, are 20-20. They've been underwhelming so far, winning the same amount as they're losing.\n\nPitching Matchups in Dodgers vs. Padres\n\nIn Game 1, the Dodgers will send ace Tyler Glasnow to the mound. He and his 6-1 record with a 2.70 ERA will be opposed by Michael King, who comes in with 43 strikeouts this year.\n\nGame 2's matchup will be made up of James Paxton (4-0 record) and Michael Waldron and his knuckleball. Walker Buehler will make his second start off the Injured List (he missed all of 2023 and part of 2024) in Game 3 against Yu Darvish, who also had a brief but recent stint on the IL.\n\nDodgers Padres Prediction\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are playing like the best team in baseball. They're finally beginning to resemble the unbeatable juggernaut that everyone expected them to be. This is a road set, so it will be hard to sweep.\n\nWith that said, the Padres just don't have the juice to keep up for three games. They're outmanned in this battle, and the pitching matchups are decidedly not in their favor. They should still win one of three and avoid a sweep, though.\n\nDodgers and Padres Channels\n\nThe San Diego Padres always play on Padres TV since the Bally Sports and Diamond Sports bankruptcy. The three-game set will be there once again for those in the local markets.\n\nThe Dodgers will be, as they always are, broadcast on Spectrum SportsNet LA in the Los Angeles area.

One team that's been mentioned more than others in connection to multiple players who might look good in a Dodger uniform: the Boston Red Sox.\n\nKenley Jansen looked like a potential trade candidate when the Dodgers were searching for someone to fill the closer role, but Evan Phillips locked that up during spring training. He's 8-for-8 in save chances, with a 0.66 ERA (one earned run in 13.2 innings).\n\nBut the Red Sox seem too good to sell.\n\nJansen was a sentimental favorite to go back to the Dodgers in a trade. Left-hander Brennan Bernardino was more recently reported to be a player the Dodgers coveted, but now even he could be too valuable for the Red Sox to trade this season.\n\nThe Dodgers were reportedly interested in Milwaukee shortstop Willy Adames as well, but with the Brewers in first place in the National League Central, the likelihood of him being dealt at the trade deadline has quickly disappeared.\n\nMeaning, the Milwaukee Brewers seem too good to sell too.\n\nThe question facing the Dodgers' front office is always the same: do they een want to make a trade at this point? It's hard to tell what might or might not happen as the season inches closer to the trade deadline, but at least two teams that were expected to be out of contention still can't be counted out of the wild card race in the American and National leagues.\n\nRight now, the Dodgers are the No. 1 team in baseball. Is there anyone out there on a team looking to sell who can help?", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenley_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenley Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spring training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Adames", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willy Adames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8001,h_4500,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_dodgers/01hxfbn911w3ckpmrx8j.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

They were pegged as MLB's best team in the offseason and they have thus far lived up to the hype for the most part. Their offseason spending spree has paid off, but they don't have the best record in baseball, or even the National League.\n\nAs such, they might want to look into some reinforcements. It's very early for trades, but a divisional rival of LA already swung a trade. Here are some the Dodgers might want to consider.\n\nThree trades the Dodgers should look into to cement World Series favorite status\n\n3) Jazz Chisholm Jr.\n\nThe Miami Marlins are bad, and they already started the fire sale by trading Luis Arraez away. They could continue by fielding offers for star center fielder Jazz Chisholm Jr. If so, the Dodgers should be all over it.\n\nTheir outfield depth has not been good without Mookie Betts there, as Chris Taylor, James Outman, Jason Heyward, Teoscar Hernandez and Andy Pages have been worth a combined 1.4 fWAR. Pages and Hernandez have been good, but the rest have not.\n\n2) David Bednar\n\nFormer All-Star closer David Bednar has had a rough go with the Pittsburgh Pirates, who should be sellers once again. The Dodgers pitching factory could fix him, and while they do have a plethora of starters, their bullpen is not as deep.\n\nAdding Bednar would give them a bullpen that could be feared by other teams. It would also prevent some innings overload for some starters, like Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Walker Buehler or Tyler Glasnow, who should probably keep their innings total lower this year.\n\n1) Ha-Seong Kim\n\nHa-Seong Kim is a pending free agent and very well could be on the move. The San Diego Padres have been trading both ways this offseason and regular season, so it wouldn't be a shock.\n\nThis is the perfect move for the Dodgers, though. It would allow Mookie Betts to move back to the outfield and give them tremendous infield depth. It would improve their infield and outfield defense, neither of which has been excellent this year.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_roberts@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Zachary Roberts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Chisholm_Jr.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jazz Chisholm Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bednar_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "David Bednar (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wins Above Replacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Taylor_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Taylor (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Glasnow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Glasnow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_Buehler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walker Buehler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/042b8-17152622081584-1920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

LA had earlier lost their home series against the Padres, so they will be eyeing redemption against them. This will be the third time San Diego and LA will face off in a regular-season series in 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dodgers had earlier completed a resounding sweep against the SF Giants at home, so it will be interesting to see if they can repeat the same feat at Oracle Park next.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "karan_tyagi@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Karan Tyagi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoscar_Hern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23099233-1715219523.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543871", "eventUri": "eng-9543871", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

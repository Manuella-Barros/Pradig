For months, the drumbeat of dissatisfaction with the Biden administration's support for Israel has been growing, even as the president has been ramping up pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to change his scorched-earth policy in Gaza. With civilian casualties topping 30,000, the pressure for many has come too late.\n\nMeanwhile, desperate to find a distraction from Donald Trump's legal problems, Republicans have seized upon the protests to paint a picture of leftist chaos and rampant antisemitism. The combination of Democratic dissatisfaction over the administration's policy and Republican efforts to capitalize on it raises the question of whether this could be harm President Joe Biden's re-election chances.\n\nNormally, foreign policy doesn't make that much of a difference to most voters. They care about economic issues. High interest rates and the perception that inflation is still raging are probably hurting Biden a lot more than any other issue. Even though the economy is by objective measures doing quite well, most voters feel it isn't.\n\nJoin our newsletter for thought-provoking commentary that goes beyond the surface of LGBTQ+ issues\n\nBut that doesn't mean that the war in Gaza isn't a problem for Democrats. There are two reasons why it's a threat to Biden's campaign.\n\nFor one, as the campus protests show, for many younger voters, the administration is clearly on the wrong side of the issue. A Harvard Institute of Politics poll found that voters under 30 favor an immediate ceasefire by a margin of five to one. Still, only two percent of young voters cited the war as their top concern, putting the economy at the top instead. However, as time goes on, there's concern that number may grow.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, the war is exposing rifts within the Democratic party. For example, despite running as the incumbent with virtually no competition, Biden had 100,000 people vote \"uncommitted\" in Michigan's primary, 88,000 in North Carolina's primary, and 57,000 in Massachusetts'. The votes were the result of a concerted effort to send a message to Biden about dissatisfaction with his stance on the war.\n\nLosing 57,000 Democratic votes in Massachusetts is a bit like losing a French fry at McDonald's. There are plenty more to replace it. But losing 100,000 votes in Michigan is a serious problem. He only won the state by fewer than 155,000 votes in 2020. In a very tight race -- which this election is shaping up to be -- Biden can't afford to lose any voters.\n\nYet his support among young voters is also dwindling, and it has been for years. Younger voters simply aren't thrilled with the octogenarian in the Oval Office, and the war isn't helping any. Their support was critical to getting Biden over the finish line in 2020, and losing any part of it puts his re-election in jeopardy.\n\nRepublicans are doing their best to inflame the situation by making the campus protests look like Biden's fault, a world of woke run amok. That may play well with some voters, especially older ones. And Trump gets to play the strong man, insisting something like this would never happen on his watch.\n\nBut for those unhappy with the administration's current policy, Donald Trump isn't likely to be the alternative. The most probable outcome would be voters turning to a third-party candidate or sitting it out.\n\n\"They might not show [up],\" Adam Berinsky, a political scientist at MIT, told The Atlantic.\n\nA lot can happen in the next six months. The threat that Trump presents may lead people to decide to vote for Biden despite their disagreement about the war. (After all, Trump is not the candidate to protect the rights of Muslims.) Biden may force Israel to change course. Other issues could overtake the current focus on the war.\n\nBut in the meantime, the war is raising the stakes in the election. The protests may die down, but the impact will linger. Whether they linger long enough to make a difference on Election Day is the big question.", "source": {"uri": "lgbtqnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LGBTQ Nation"}, "authors": [],

He has remained supportive of Israel's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7 terrorist attack but offered some sharp criticisms of Israel's military actions as civilian deaths have mounted. Activists in a handful of states organized protest votes against Biden in Democratic primaries as part of their calls to the White House to bring an end to the war.\n\nTensions have been building on campuses over the last several weeks as some protests have gotten out of hand. Administrators have increasingly asked law enforcement to help break up the protests and encampments amid pressure from lawmakers and other local leaders to address the problems.\n\nThe political pressure has piled up on the Biden administration as it also tries to navigate the path forward with policy toward the Israel-Hamas war. He faces potential issues from both sides, with progressive voters angry about his support for Israel and moderates or Republicans who may cast a ballot for him wanting to act on the protests.\n\n\"The worst thing he can do is to pretend it's not happening,\" said Chris Devine, an associate professor of political science at the University of Dayton. \"He has to say something. But if what he says is bland and noncommittal, then both sides are upset with him for not speaking clearly on the issue, but if he really takes a firm stance, then someone's going to lose out and someone's not going to get the policy that they're asking for. There is no clear answer.\"\n\nAfter a couple weeks of frequent questions about the administration's handling of the protests, Biden gave rare public remarks on the civil unrest that has broken out on campuses that have been confrontational and sometimes threatening or violent. Biden defended Americans' right to protest but condemned the more destructive behavior that has been seen on some campuses.\n\n\"We are not an authoritarian nation where we silence people or squash dissent, the American people are heard. In fact, peaceful protest is in the best tradition of how Americans respond to consequential issues,\" Biden said. \"But neither are we a lawless country. We are a civil society, law and order must prevail.\"\n\nBiden has resisted GOP calls to call in the National Guard to help schools break up encampments or keep the situation under control, but has still said that making threats and destroying property isn't acceptable either.\n\n\"Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campuses, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduations. None of this is a peaceful protest,\" Biden said. \"Threatening people, intimidating people, instilling fear in people is not peaceful protest. It's against the law.\"\n\nRepublicans in Congress and former President Donald Trump have framed Biden's response to the protests as weak and inept or held them up as an example of Biden caving to activist pressure.\n\nDealing with the protests puts Biden in a precarious spot as he is locked into a tight matchup with Trump, who has frequently turned to a \"law-and-order\" message when it comes to quelling protests. Biden's campaign has tried to draw a contrast to America under Biden and Trump, whose presidency came to an end after mass protests following the murder of George Floyd and the Jan. 6 riots after Biden won the election. How well that contrast is being received by voters is an open question as campus protests linger.\n\nThere are many unknowns about what issues will be prioritized come Nov. 5, and how the protests develop or fade out of the public spotlight over the next months bring in many variables that polling cannot predict.\n\n\"The greatest risk for Biden politically about the college protests is not that people will vote differently because of what they're seeing on their TV screens at this moment or maybe even experiencing in person,\" Devine said. \"It is that these have laid a foundation for other events that will happen in the fall that are inspired by what people have been seeing in the spring.\"", "source": {"uri": "wsbt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WSBT"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They were now dialed in.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, interest in Gaza was off the charts. I would rank it a 10. Many said they would not vote for Biden because of his support for Israel.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jeff Jackson's vote to possibly ban TikTok (while being a TikTok user himself) ranked a six.\n\nAbortion was a four.\n\nA week later, I sat down with five of the most vocal students in the student union.\n\nMy conversation with the students -- which took place before the recent eruptions of protests at college campuses -- offers important insights about this year's presidential race. It's a small sample size, to be sure. But my discussions with the students give a window into some of the challenges facing Democrats, who will need a strong youth vote if they hope to win North Carolina.\n\nThree had softened their position. They still opposed Israel's conduct in the war, but said they would likely support Biden in the end. Two said they might look for a third-party candidate.\n\nEmily Holiday works full-time and is a full-time student. She's from Cleveland County and is in her 30s.\n\nIn the primary, she voted \"No Preference.\" She said she was \"happy to not click (Biden's) name because I have seen images of dead children on my phone for the last seven months.\"\n\nHoliday added: \"I have a deep problem with the idea of the lesser of two evils (Biden vs. Trump). We are still building a border wall. It's more humane discrimination, but it's still discrimination. It's still you are asking me to stomach a little bit of genocide instead of a lot of genocide. If you are telling me Biden is the more moral candidate, show me some moral behavior.\"\n\nHe hates the war and turned off Instagram for a week because of all the gory images from Gaza. But said: \"The idea of not voting is a non-factor for me.\"\n\n\"I've always said that Biden -- despite all of his flaws -- is a very progressive president,\" he said.\n\nHe, too, says he'll likely vote for Biden.\n\nAs progressives, none of the five would consider voting for Trump.\n\nBut two, Hasia Allen and Kayla Bittle, said they might look at a third-party candidate.\n\nAllen, of Rutherford County, is a junior.\n\n\"I feel like as a person of color, I feel like not voting is something I don't have the privilege of doing,\" she said, adding that there's an 80% chance she votes.\n\n\"But I don't know if that's towards the Democratic Party or independent,\" she said. \"It just depends on what I'm hearing and what they promise.\"\n\nBittle is a senior from Charlotte. She might vote for someone other than Biden or Trump.\n\n\"I have to agree with Haisa,\" she said. \"As a woman of color, I don't have the privilege of not voting. But I don't like either one. If Biden continues to do what he's doing and isn't putting his foot to the ground to tell Israel to stop all the genocide that they are committing, they are doing, then Trump will win the election.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign is making abortion rights a key part of its campaign.\n\nOf the UNC Charlotte students, Riss Mejia-Horton, of Raleigh, was the only one who put abortion rights as her most important issue.\n\nShe said she will vote for Biden.\n\nBut she said a lack of enthusiasm for Biden across campus goes beyond Gaza.\n\n\"People are concerned that they can't buy a house when they grow up, they are concerned with gas prices, concerned that groceries are too expensive,\" she said.\n\nShe added: \"When we ask our friends, 'Are you voting?' They say, 'We don't like either.'\"\n\nI was surprised that abortion was not more top of mind.\n\nAnd I wondered what should the Democratic Party do about Gaza?\n\nThere are two schools of thought.\n\nOne is that Biden is blowing it, brushing off the concerns of Gen Z. Charlotte Observer columnist Isaac Bailey wrote in early April that \"Joe Biden is squandering a chance to make North Carolina purple again.\"\n\nHe said the president is \"hurting his reelection chances by giving into the far-right in Israel.\" He added that \"Obama won North Carolina largely by energizing young voters -- the very voters who are expressing, in no uncertain terms, their disdain for how Biden has handled Israel's war in Gaza.\"\n\nIn the Wall Street Journal last week, James Traub took the opposite view.\n\nIn an essay titled \"Biden Needs to Learn From the Democrats' Disaster in '68,\" he argued that Hubert Humphrey's reluctance to distance himself from anti-war protesters cost him the election to Richard Nixon.\n\n\"The lesson of that tumultuous political summer is clear,\" the story said. \"The fireworks may be on the party's left, but the votes needed for victory are on the right.\"\n\nThe votes needed for victory.\n\nOf the five students I spoke with, only one -- Holiday -- voted in March.\n\nThough some college students vote in their hometown, plenty of UNC Charlotte students sat out the election.\n\nThere are 4,105 registered voters in the precinct that's home to the university. In the March primary, just 90 people voted there in the presidential primaries.\n\nThat's a turnout rate of 2%.\n\nThere is an idea that young voters just need to be mobilized, but that only works when people are willing to be mobilized.\n\nIf young voters are \"meh\" on the top of the ticket, pursuing them is like sweeping water uphill -- a fruitless exercise.\n\nLast week, after days of unrest at college campuses nationwide, Biden seemed to cast his lot with older voters.\n\n\"There's the right to protest, but not the right to cause chaos,\" Biden said. \"People have the right to get an education, the right to get a degree, the right to walk across the campus safely without fear of being attacked.\"", "source": {"uri": "wfae.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFAE 90.7 -

But few cite the conflict as a top source of discontent with the president.\n\nYoung Americans' outrage over the Israel-Hamas war has dominated the political conversation for weeks. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have made pilgrimages to Columbia University and other campuses to offer support to demonstrations in solidarity with Gaza or to denounce them, and President Biden addressed the upheavals in remarks on Thursday.\n\nBut these headlines are not reflective of young voters' top concerns this election year, according to recent polls. Surveys taken in recent months show young voters are more likely to sympathize with Palestinians in the conflict, but few of them rank the Israel-Hamas war among their top issues in the 2024 election. Like other voters, young people often put economic concerns at the top the list.\n\nAnd while young voters are cooler to Mr. Biden than they were at the same point in 2020, there is little evidence that American support for the Israeli invasion of Gaza is a critical factor in their relative discontent.\n\n\"When you have two presidents that have the same stance on one issue, that automatically puts that issue -- I hate to say lower down the list, because it's obviously an important issue, but it doesn't make it an issue where I'm going to choose Donald Trump over Joe Biden,\" said Devon Schwartz, a student at the University of Texas at Austin.\n\nA student of both Muslim and Jewish descent who is active in a campus group promoting interfaith dialogue, Mr. Schwartz, 19, thought the protests at his college, which have drawn police crackdowns, were \"a historic moment.\" And he said he would have liked the opportunity to vote for a candidate who is \"more progressive on Israel\" than Mr. Biden in November. But he plans to vote for him anyway.\n\n\"I want to see policy changes from Joe Biden,\" he said. \"I don't want to vote for Donald Trump and then just see the same exact policies.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Texas at Austin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/06/multimedia/06pol-biden-young-qtkv/06pol-biden-young-qtkv-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543107", "eventUri": "eng-9543107", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

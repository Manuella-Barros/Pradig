Recognised by the United Nations since 2008, World Ocean Day aims to bring everyone together to create a better future with a healthy ocean and stable climate. Reflecting this year\u2019s theme of \u2018Catalysing Action for Our Ocean and Climate\u2019, the museum and local voluntary environmental group teamed up for the first time to invite everyone to a beach clean up followed by creative poster making. The community clean up on Irvine Beach will take place between 10am and 11:30am on Saturday, June 8. As well as cleaning up the marine environment and saving litter from ending up in the sea, participants will learn about the main types of litter found along this stretch of coastline. Participants will even be able to pledge one action which they will take to help keep the waters free from litter. That afternoon between 1pm and 4pm, visitors can pop into the Museum\u2019s Linthouse building for some creative fun making posters which promote the need to protect the oceans from litter. The session is drop in and all materials are included. There\u2019ll even be some cleaned litter from the morning\u2019s beach clean to work with. Finished posters can also be contributed to the museum for a World Ocean Day display. Announcing the activities, Jennifer Pless , Community Engagement & Development Officer at the Scottish Maritime Museum, said: \"It\u2019s more important than ever that we protect our local marine environment so we are thrilled to join with Irvine Clean Up Crew for this year\u2019s World Ocean Day. \"Together, we wanted to create some fun practical and creative opportunities engaging everyone in taking positive action to protect our planet\u2019s oceans. We\u2019re looking forward to welcoming everyone on the day - let\u2019s celebrate World Ocean Day together!\" Kathryn Sloan, Irvine Clean Up Crew Treasurer, added: \"We are delighted to be partnering with the Scottish Maritime Museum for World Ocean Day. Our practical approach to protecting our marine environment by litter picking and stopping rubbish entering the sea will be complemented by the creative poster making session at the museum. \"It is an opportunity to show that there are different ways to 'take action' to help protect our planet\u2019s oceans. We hope that it will inspire those who join in to do what they can to reduce their impact on our oceans and the whole planet. \"We love Irvine Beach and would love to show others how they can contribute to helping protect it.\" Participation is free and all equipment is provided. No booking is required but participants are asked to visit Irvine Clean Up Crew\u2019s Facebook page @irvinebeach and register interest on the event listing. Participants will meet at the picnic area behind the beach pavilion at the bottom of Beach Drive. Adults attending the beach clean in the morning will also receive a token giving them entry to the museum at a reduced rate of \u00a34. Up to three children get free entry with each paying adult.

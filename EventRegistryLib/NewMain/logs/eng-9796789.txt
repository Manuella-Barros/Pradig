The high court judge said that the Supreme Court has no role in a contempt of court proceedings pertaining to an order passed by the High Court.\n\nJustice Sehrawat in his order observed that a stay by Supreme Court on a contempt of court case being heard by his bench can have \"drastic and damaging consequences\" and it seemed the top court wants to control the roaster of High Court\n\nThe high court judge passed an order observing that the Supreme Court has a tendency to presume itself as more \"Supreme\" that it actually is and see high court to be lesser \"high\" than it is constitutionally. Justice Rajbir Sehrawat went on to caution the Supreme Court about legal consequences of its order. The judge questioned the role of the Supreme Court in contempt of court cases in the high court and observed that more caution on the part of the top court would have been more appropriate.\n\n\"Seen at a psychological plane this type of order is actuated, primarily, by two factors, firstly a tendency to avoid owning responsibility of the consequence which such an order, in all likelihood, is bound to produce, under a pretense that an order of stay of contempt proceedings does not adversely affect anybody, and secondly, a tendency to presume the Supreme Court to be more 'Supreme' than it actually is and to presume a High Court to be lesser 'High' than it constitutionally is,\" the judge had written about the Supreme Court's stay order.\n\nThe judge further said that the top court itself has clarified multiple times that the High Court is not subordinate to it administratively.\n\nTaking cognisance of the order, the Supreme Court has constituted a five judge bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, Justice BR Gavai, Justice Surya Kant and Justice Hrishikesh Roy to hear the matter.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has no role in this aspect except in an appeal against the order of a Division Bench of High Court convicting a contemnor. As per the provisions of the Act, even an appeal does not lie before the Supreme Court against an order passed by single-bench, rather it lies before the Division Bench of High Court, and even there, the powers of the appellate court are well defined, in terms of stage of appeal and in terms of the nature of order which the appellate Court could pass,\" the single-judge said.\n\nJustice Sehrawat further called for the Supreme Court's stay on his order in the contempt of court case in the nature of controlling the High Court's roster to decide which judge hears criminal cases.\n\nInterestingly, Justice Sehrawat had also referred to the rules suggested by the Supreme Court for designation of advocates as Senior Advocates\n\n\"...the High Courts may still follow any type of directions coming from the Supreme Court, sometimes out of perceived coercion, sometimes out of due regard for such order, and at some other times for the sake of institutional majesty,\" the judge said.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nupur_dogra@news.abplive.com", "name": "Nupur Dogra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_judge_(England_and_Wales)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Court judge (England and Wales)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sua_sponte", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sua sponte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haryana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haryana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrishikesh_Roy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hrishikesh Roy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhananjaya_Y._Chandrachud", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dhananjaya Y.

The bench comprises the first five judges of the top court.\n\nThe case, titled \"In Re: Order of Punjab and Haryana High Court Dated 17.07.2024 and Ancillary Issues,\" was registered following the high court order on July 17. In that order, a single bench led by justice Rajbir Sehrawat made several critical remarks about the Supreme Court's decision to stay contempt proceedings initiated by the high court in a case.\n\nAccording to justice Sehrawat, the Supreme Court thinks of itself as more \"Supreme\" than it really is, and it thinks of the high courts as less \"high\" than they truly are in terms of the Constitution. His judgment also sounded a \"note of caution\" for the Supreme Court, asking it to be more explicit about the potential legal ramifications of any decisions it makes.\n\nJustice Sehrawat noted that the Supreme Court stayed the contempt proceedings not while hearing an appeal against the order initiating contempt, but in an appeal against the order that led to the contempt proceedings.\n\nHe observed: \"Seen at a psychological plane this type of order is actuated, primarily, by two factors, firstly a tendency to avoid owning responsibility of the consequence which such an order, in all likelihood, is bound to produce, under a pretense that an order of stay of contempt proceedings does not adversely affect anybody. Secondly, a tendency to presume the Supreme Court to be more 'Supreme' than it actually is and to presume a High Court to be lesser 'High' than it constitutionally.\"\n\nThe judge also emphasised that the apex court itself has clarified numerous times that high courts are not subordinate to the Supreme Court. \"The relation between high court and the Supreme Court is not the same as is the elation between a civil judge (junior division) within its jurisdiction and the high court. In terms of Articles 132 to 134 of the Constitution of India, the Supreme Court is not even an ordinary court of unconditional appeal, unless there is a specific statute providing for appeal from the orders of the high court to the Supreme Court in specified matters,\" said justice Sehrawat. Therefore, the judge asserted, \"there is no scope for sundry direction being issued by the Supreme Court to a high court, regarding certain proceeding pending before a high court.\"\n\nThe judge acknowledged that while high courts may follow directions from the Supreme Court, whether out of perceived coercion, due regard, or institutional majesty, the Supreme Court may not always consider the \"drastic and damaging consequences\" its stay orders on contempt proceedings can produce.\n\nAs an example, the high court referred to a stay order in a specific case, which the jduge claimed, deprived about 35% of Punjab and Haryana superior judiciary members of their selection grade and super time scale for several years. This happened because the high court, on its administrative side, interpreted the Supreme Court's stay as a de facto order staying a final order passed by its division bench on the judicial side, justice Sehrawat said.\n\nThe judge questioned who should be held responsible for this situation -- \"the high court or the Supreme Court?\" He suggested that both courts engage in \"soul searching\" to address this issue and advised that the Supreme Court should be more specific in its orders to avoid similar situations in the future.\n\nHis judgment concluded by adjourning the case sine die until the Supreme Court decides the relevant appeal, while noting that such a course might not always be possible for a high court to follow, depending on the facts of a particular case or the involvement of specific statutory provisions.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that on Monday evening, high court chief justice Sheel Nagu modified the roster, transferring all contempt of court cases from justice Sehrawat to justice Harkesh Manuja.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While the Supreme Court may have the power to permit a special appeal by a 'party' to contempt proceedings before the High Court against certain types of orders under specific circumstances. However, no such circumstances exist in the present case. Additionally, the respondents have not filed any special appeal against any order of the Contempt Court.\n\n2. In these circumstances, the Supreme Court's order effectively places an estoppel on the High Court's powers under Article 215 of the Constitution of India and the Contempt of Courts Act.\n\n3. There is significant doubt whether the Supreme Court possesses the authority to stay the operation of Article 215 of the Constitution of India and the Contempt of Courts Act. More caution from the Supreme Court would have been appropriate.\n\n4. Psychologically, this type of order is driven by two primary factors: a tendency to avoid responsibility for the consequences of such an order under the pretence that staying in contempt proceedings does not adversely affect anyone, and a presumption that the Supreme Court is more 'Supreme' than it actually is, while the High Court is presumed to be less 'High' than it constitutionally is.\n\n5. The potential drastic and damaging consequences of staying contempt proceedings may not have been fully considered by the Supreme Court.\n\n6. The Supreme Court likely did not intend such drastic consequences. However, the Punjab and Haryana High Court, on the administrative side, has interpreted this order as effectively staying the final order passed by the Division Bench of this Court on the judicial side and has decided not to grant the said scales to judicial officers until the SLP is finally decided by the Supreme Court.\n\n7. A legitimate question arises regarding who is responsible for the plight of the judicial officers in the Superior Judiciary of Punjab and Haryana. Is it the High Court or the Supreme Court? A thorough examination by both the High Court and the Supreme Court may yield surprising insights for both.\n\n8.

Expunging the remarks, the top court pointed out that \"discipline of hierarchy should be maintained\".\n\nIn an order passed on July 17, Justice Rajbir Sehrawat had criticised a top court order given on May 3. Justice Sehrawat had said the top court order \"turns out to be simply in the nature of putting an estoppel on the powers of the High Court\".\n\nThere was a tendency on the part of the Supreme Court to presume that it was \"more Supreme\", the judge had said.\n\nA five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud said it was \"pained\" by the High Court judge's remarks and said, \"This tendency of passing observation about the Supreme Court is not correct. Discipline has to be maintained. This discipline of hierarchy has to be maintained and the discipline of system has to be maintained. There is work pressure on high court judges. The Supreme Court must also use its powers with great caution and remedy by us should not cause greater judicial harm\".\n\nEchoing the CJI, Justice Hrishikesh Roy said \"What is mentioned by you SG is not part of the order but it is in the course of proceedings. We are on what is recorded in written. You are correct that tone and tenor expression could be avoided but we as the Supreme Court has to go by what is recorded in the order\".\n\nThe bench, also comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai and Surya Kant heard the Suo-motu case and also issued a word of warning to the high court judge, saying that greater caution is expected from him in future while dealing with the orders of the Supreme Court and the High Court division bench.\n\n'OBSERVATIONS MATTER OF GRAVE CONCERN'\n\n\"Justice Rajbir Sehrawat has made observations with regard to the Supreme Court of India, which are a matter of grave concern. Judicial discipline in the context of the hierarchical nature of the judicial system is intended to preserve the dignity of all institutions whether at the level of District Court, or high court or Supreme Court\", the CJI-led bench said in its order.\n\n'COMPLIANCE TO SUPREME COURT ORDER NOT MATTER OF CHOICE BUT CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION'\n\nTerming the observations by the high court as unnecessary, the bench in its order said \"The observations which were made in the order of the single judge were unnecessary for the ultimate order which was passed. Gratuitous observations with regard to the previous orders passed by the Supreme Court are absolutely unwarranted. Compliance with the orders passed by the Supreme Court is not a matter of choice but a matter of the constitutional obligation. Parties may be aggrieved by an order. Judges are never aggrieved by an order passed by a higher constitutional forum\".\n\n\"Such observations tend to bring the entire judicial machinery into disrepute. This affects not only the dignity of this Court but also the high court,\" reads the order.\n\nLIVE STREAMING OF COURT PROCEEDINGS\n\nCJI Chandrachud also took a note of a video clip of the proceedings by the single judge, where he made unnecessary remarks, saying \"A video of the judge is doing the rounds where the judge is using gratuitous and unwarranted remarks during the hearing. In the age of live streaming, it is necessary that judges exercise greater restraint during proceedings and the observations made can cause impalpable harm to the judicial process\".\n\n\"We expect certain circumspection shall be exercised in the future. We desist from directing any judicial enquiry at this stage but as per our constitutional duty we were bound to intervene. Thus, remarks from the order stand expunged. We hope the court would not have to interfere in a similar matter in the future in relation to the same judge or any other judge of this country\", read the order.\n\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta told the bench about the facts of the case and said \"This case is related over a land dispute between A and B and court ordered the land should be vested with the government. This part of transfer of land to government was stayed and this is the controversy\".\n\nAt this, Justice khanna said \"We are not required to go into facts. When there is a stay order passed by this court, it's not that the high court is subordinate but we are an appellate court.

Taking exception to the stay order, the single judge said, \"Seen at a psychological plane this type of order is actuated, primarily, by two factors, firstly a tendency to avoid owning responsibility of the consequence which such an order, in all likelihood, is bound to produce, under a pretence that an order of stay of contempt proceedings does not adversely affect anybody, and secondly, a tendency to presume the Supreme Court to be more 'Supreme' than it actually is and to presume a High Court to be lesser 'High' than it constitutionally is\".\n\n\"Power to initiate and to continue the proceedings for alleged contempt qua an order passed by the High Court lies exclusively with the High Court as per Article 215 of the Constitution of India and Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act. The Supreme Court has no role in this aspect except in an appeal against the order of a Division Bench of the High Court convicting a contemnor. As per the provisions of the Act, even an appeal does not lie before the Supreme Court against an order passed by a Single Bench, rather it lies before the Division Bench of the High Court, and even there, the powers of the appellate Court are well defined, in terms of stage of appeal and in terms of the nature of order which the appellate Court could pass,\" said Justice Rajbir Sehrawat.\n\nOn Tuesday, the SC took suo motu cognisance of the matter and posted it for hearing by the five-judge bench.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ananthakrishnan_g@indianexpress.com", "name": "Ananthakrishnan G", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay_of_proceedings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stay of proceedings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_and_Haryana_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Punjab and Haryana High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Kant_(judge)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surya Kant (judge)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrishikesh_Roy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hrishikesh Roy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_bench_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution bench (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sua_sponte", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sua sponte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Real", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 21}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/08/SC_e799f1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796789", "eventUri": "eng-9796789", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 1061, "textEnd": 1068}], "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

However, that has not been done. Rather, the order passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court has given rise to a problem of Constitutional Conformity vis-a-vis the Court Compliance, besides increasing the pendency before this Court by one more case\". It added, \"one never knows how many more cases in execution and contempt petition may have been kept pending throughout the country because of such orders\".\n\nThe HC said, \"power to initiate and to continue the proceedings for alleged contempt qua an order passed by the High Court lies exclusively with the High Court as per the Article 215 of the Constitution of India and Section 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act. The Supreme Court has no role in this aspect except in an appeal against the order of a Division Bench of High Court convicting a contemnor.\n\nAs per the provisions of the Act, even an appeal does not lie before the Supreme Court against an order passed by Single Bench, rather it lies before the Division Bench of High Court, and even there, the powers of the appellate Court are well defined, in terms of stage of appeal and in terms of the nature of order which the appellate Court could pass\".\n\nIt said that \"how much drastic and damaging consequences such an order of stay of contempt proceedings can produce, may not have occurred to the Supreme Court in its most wide imaginations\". The HC said the SC \"itself has clarified multiple times that the High Court is not subordinate to the Supreme Court... therefore, there is no scope for sundry direction being issued by the Supreme Court to a High Court, regarding certain proceedings pending before a High Court\".\n\nThe judge said that he \"however, keeping in view the sanctity of the judicial process...feels to be absolutely bound by the order and hence, the case is adjourned sine die till the...SLP is decided\" by the SC.\n\nHe added, \"but this may not be always possible for a High Court to follow such a course in view of particular facts and circumstances embedded in a particular case or because of involvement of some statutory provisions.

Justice Sehrawat's order on July 17 stated that the Supreme Court tends to consider itself as more \"Supreme\" than it actually is and views high courts as being less \"high\" than they are constitutionally.\n\nThe five-judge bench, consisting of Chief Justice of India Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and justices Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai, Surya Kant and Hrishikesh Roy, expressed its dismay over the observations made by the high court judge, saying it is \"pained\" at the \"completely unwarranted and unnecessary\" remarks.\n\n\"The Supreme Court is not 'supreme' nor is the high court or a munsif court 'supreme'. The supremacy is of the Constitution. We are all under the Constitution,\" commented the bench, adding its role as custodian of the judicial system in the country require the Supreme Court to order deletion of the judge's \"gratuitous remarks\" that bring not only the top court but also the high court into disrepute.\n\nEven as it observed that justice Sehrawat's comments border on contempt, the bench refrained from initiating contempt proceedings against the judge, saying it would not want the majesty of the high court to be undermined or put the judge of a constitutional court in the dock as a litigant to defend himself.\n\n\"Thus, we will expunge the remarks of the judge and express that observations in the order are scandalous. The Supreme Court must also use its powers with great caution and remedy by us should not cause greater judicial harm...at the same time, this tendency of making observations on the orders of the Supreme Court must be eschewed. Every judge has to maintain the discipline of the system,\" said the bench.\n\nIn its order, the bench stated: \"Justice Rajbir Sehrawat has made observations in regard to the Supreme Court of India, which are a matter of grave concern...Judicial discipline in the context of the hierarchical nature of the judicial system is intended to preserve the dignity of all institutions whether at the level of district court, or high court or the Supreme Court.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court emphasised that compliance with its orders is not optional but a \"bounden constitutional obligation\". It added that the remarks made by justice Sehrawat were unnecessary for the outcome of the case and were \"gratuitous\" in nature, noting that such comments could potentially undermine the dignity of the judicial system as a whole.\n\nThe bench also made it clear that while parties may be aggrieved by an order, judges should not take issue with decisions made by higher constitutional fora. \"Judges are never aggrieved by an order passed by a higher constitutional forum,\" the court pointed out, underlining the expectation that judicial officers maintain decorum and respect the judicial hierarchy.\n\nDuring the proceedings, attorney general R Venkataramani and solicitor general Tushar Mehta expressed their concerns regarding the remarks made by justice Sehrawat. SG Mehta pointed out that a video clip from the high court proceedings had been circulating, wherein justice Sehrawat allegedly declared an order of the Supreme Court \"non-est\" and expressed his unwillingness to adhere to a stay order passed by the division bench. Mehta argued that this conduct not only breached judicial propriety but also bordered on contempt.\n\nWhile the Supreme Court acknowledged the merit in the arguments that the remarks bordered on contempt, it chose to exercise restraint in pursuing further action, opting instead to expunge the contentious observations and issuing a word of caution for the high court judge, whose conduct, it said seemed an \"attempt to dislocate the sanctity of judicial hierarchy and maintenance of judicial discipline\".\n\nThe bench said it expects more caution on the part of justice Sehrawat with respect to judicial orders issued by the Supreme Court or a larger bench in the high court. \"Whether an individual judge is aggrieved by an order is beside the point. Every judge is bound by the discipline that hierarchical discipline envisaged under the judicial system of the country,\" it held.\n\nThe bench further refrained from directing any judicial inquiry into the incident at this stage but noted its constitutional duty to intervene when such remarks threaten to compromise the integrity of the judiciary.\n\n\"We desist from directing any judicial enquiry at this stage but as per our constitutional duty we were bound to intervene. Thus, the remarks from the order stand expunged. We hope the court would not have to interfere in a similar matter in the future in relation to the same judge or any other judge of this country,\" said the bench while noting that a bench led by high court chief justice Sheel Nagu has stayed justice Sehrawat's order on its own motion.\n\nIn addition to addressing the remarks made in the order, the Supreme Court also highlighted the implications of the live-streaming era on judicial conduct. Referring to the video clip that was widely shared, the bench underscored the necessity for judges to exercise greater restraint during court proceedings, particularly in an age where public scrutiny is intensified by digital media.\n\n\"A video of the judge is doing the rounds where the judge is using gratuitous and unwarranted remarks during the hearing. In the age of live streaming, it is necessary that judges exercise greater restraint during proceedings and the observations made can cause impalpable harm to the judicial process,\" the bench maintained.\n\nA suo motu case, titled \"In Re: Order of Punjab and Haryana High Court Dated 17.07.2024 and Ancillary Issues,\" was registered by the Supreme Court following justice Sehrawat's order on July 17 in which the judge made several critical remarks about the Supreme Court's decision to stay contempt proceedings initiated by the high court in a case.\n\nAccording to justice Sehrawat, the Supreme Court thinks of itself as more \"Supreme\" than it really is, and it thinks of the high courts as less \"high\" than they truly are in terms of the Constitution. His judgment also sounded a \"note of caution\" for the Supreme Court, asking it to be more explicit about the potential legal ramifications of any decisions it makes.\n\nHe observed, \"Seen at a psychological plane this type of order is actuated, primarily, by two factors, firstly a tendency to avoid owning responsibility of the consequence which such an order, in all likelihood, is bound to produce, under a pretense that an order of stay of contempt proceedings does not adversely affect anybody. Secondly, a tendency to presume the Supreme Court to be more 'supreme' than it actually is and to presume a High Court to be lesser 'high' than it constitutionally.\"\n\nJustice Sehrawat acknowledged that while high courts may follow directions from the Supreme Court, whether out of perceived coercion, due regard, or institutional majesty, the Supreme Court may not always consider the \"drastic and damaging consequences\" its stay orders on contempt proceedings can produce.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The bench found the Punjab and Haryana High Court judge's observations troubling and excessive.\n\nThis issue arose from a Punjab and Haryana High Court judge's unusual order criticising a Supreme Court stay order, suggesting that the apex court views itself as overly supreme and high courts as inferior.\n\nThe case in context, titled \"In Re: Order of Punjab and Haryana High Court Dated 17.07.2024 and Ancillary Issues,\" began after a 17 July order by Justice Rajbir Sehrawat of the Punjab and Haryana High Court.\n\nJustice Sehrawat had criticised the Supreme Court for staying contempt proceedings initiated by the high court, stating the stay order was issued not during an appeal against the contempt initiation but against the preceding order.\n\nHe argued this reflected a psychological tendency to avoid responsibility and an inflated perception of the Supreme Court's supremacy over high courts.\n\nCJI Chandrachud responded that neither the Supreme Court nor high courts are supreme, but the Constitution is. The five-judge bench, including justices Sanjiv Khanna, BR Gavai, Surya Kant, and Hrishikesh Roy, was reviewing the matter.\n\nAlso read - Restoration Campaign For Historic Shaniwar Wada Fort In Pune Gains Momentum With Efforts Of Rajya Sabha MP Medha Kulkarni", "source": {"uri": "swarajyamag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Swarajyamag"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhananjaya_Y._Chandrachud", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhananjaya Y.

Chandrachud and four senior-most judges of the apex court held a special sitting on Wednesday to expunge the remarks made by a High Court judge challenging the Supreme Court's position at the top of the judicial hierarchy.\n\nA video capturing the comments by Justice Rajbir Sehrawat of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, in court, was widely circulated on social media, compelling the Chief Justice of India to urge judges to exercise restraint and responsibility while making observations in the course of court proceedings.\n\nThe Chief Justice said livestreaming of court sessions was meant to provide citizens access to judicial proceedings, and not for judges to make unwarranted observations, lowering the dignity of the judicial system.\n\nChief Justice Chandrachud said the apex court had been pained by the observations made by Justice Sehrawat and had decided to take suo motu cognisance of them. The other judges on the Bench were Justices Sanjiv Khanna, B.R. Gavai, Surya Kant, and Hrishikesh Roy.\n\nAlthough Attorney General R. Venkataramani and Solicitor General Tushar Mehta termed Justice Sehrawat's observations as \"serious transgressions\" on judicial discipline, and even \"aggravated contempt\" of the Supreme Court, the Chief Justice-led Bench decided in favour of restraint.\n\nThe Chief Justice said that unlike aberrations such as this, an overwhelming majority of High Court judges worked with greater responsibility and restraint despite the huge workload.\n\nThe CJI said his Bench did not want to inadvertently harm the majesty of the High Courts, especially the Punjab and Haryana High Court, by making any comments or issuing notice in this case. Besides, a Division Bench headed by the Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice had already stayed Justice Sehrawat's controversial order of July 17.\n\nJustice Sehrawat had taken offence to the top court staying an earlier order of his in a case. On July 17, he blamed the apex court for \"presuming itself to be more 'supreme' than it actually is and the High Court to be less 'high' than it constitutionally is\".\n\n\"The Supreme Court is not supreme. The High Court is not supreme. What is supreme is the Constitution of India. We all interpret the Constitution the best we can,\" Justice Roy said.\n\nThe CJI termed Justice Sehrawat's remarks \"gratuitous\". \"They affect not only the dignity of the Supreme Court but also of the High Courts as well,\" he said.\n\nThe Chief Justice highlighted that the system of judicial hierarchy was founded in the Constitution. Article 144 of the Constitution advised civil and judicial authorities to act in aid of the Supreme Court. It was litigants, and not judges, who should be aggrieved by an order of stay by a superior court, the CJI said.\n\n\"Whether individual judges are in agreement or otherwise of orders passed by a superior court is besides the point. Every judge is bound by judicial discipline and the hierarchical nature of the judicial system... Judges should employ greater caution while dealing with the orders of the Supreme Court and Division Benches of their High Courts,\" Chief Justice Chandrachud observed.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_and_Haryana_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Punjab and Haryana High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_judge_(England_and_Wales)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "High Court judge (England and Wales)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhananjaya_Y._Chandrachud", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhananjaya Y.

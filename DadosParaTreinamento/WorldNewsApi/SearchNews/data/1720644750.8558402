Villeneuve, the ex-Canadian driver and 1997 F1 world champion, is featuring on Sky Sports\u2019 coverage of this weekend\u2019s race in Montreal. Ricciardo, 34, has endured a difficult start to the 2024 season with RB and trails his team-mate Yuki Tsunoda by 14 points after eight races. After being dropped by McLaren in 2022 and failing to hit the heights of his time at Red Bull earlier in his career, Ricciardo found a way back into the sport last year with Red Bull\u2019s sister team \u2013 yet Villeneuve remains unimpressed with the popular Aussie and did not hold back on his opinion. \u201cWhy is he still in F1?\u201d Villeneuve said on Sky F1. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing the same thing for the last five years. We have to \u2018make the car better for him, poor him\u2019, no. You\u2019re in F1. \u201cMaybe you make that effort for Lewis Hamilton, who has won multiple championships. You don\u2019t make that effort for a driver that can\u2019t cut it. \u201cIf you can\u2019t cut it, go home. There\u2019ll be someone else to take your place. \u201cThat\u2019s how it\u2019s always been in racing. It\u2019s the pinnacle of the sport. There\u2019s no reason to keep going and finding excuses. \u201cYou all talk about those first two seasons, he was beating a [Sebastian] Vettel that was brunt out and trying to invent things. Then he was beating for half a season an 18-year-old Verstappen. He stopped beating anyone after that.\u201d Asked if Ricciardo has been overrated, Villeneuve replied: \u201cI think his image has kept him in F1 more than his actual results.\u201d Ricciardo secured his first of nine wins in Formula 1 in Montreal 10 years ago, but his seat for 2025 is unconfirmed at this stage.", "summary": "<p>The 1997 F1 world champion did not hold back when asked about the Australian\u2019s time in the sport</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/f1/f1-jacques-villeneuve-daniel-ricciardo-canada-b2559167.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/08/15/MixCollage-08-Jun-2024-03-00-PM-3344.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ITn5lle1-OhrQWqOm.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:01:39", "author": "Kieran Jackson", "authors": ["Kieran Jackson"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.055}

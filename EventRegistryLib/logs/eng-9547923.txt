Porzingis left the team's Game 4 win over the Miami Heat early with a lower leg injury, and was later diagnosed with a right calf strain.\n\nInitial reporting after the injury indicated Porzingis would miss \"several\" games, seemingly suggesting he would be out at least through the ECS. However, a report just ahead of Game 1 suggested that timetable may have changed.\n\n\"Nothing hard and fast to report here (stop and read that part again), but the Cavaliers are expecting to see Kristaps Porzingis before this series is over,\" longtime Celtics insider Steve Bulpett posted on X/Twitter just before Game 1. \"I'm getting the same vibe from the Celtics.\"\n\nPorzingis playing in this series would be a surprise for two reasons. First, it would represent a much quicker return to play than initially expected. Second, the Celtics shouldn't need Porzingis to beat a Cavs team they handled relatively easily on Tuesday - a team that is also missing its top big man (center Jarrett Allen has missed the last four games with a rib injury).\n\nSo, that's what's being reported about Porzingis' progress and timetable to return. But what is the team saying?\n\n\"It's definitely better than we thought,\" head coach Joe Mazzulla told 98.5's Zolak & Bertrand during his weekly interview on Wednesday. \"I think one thing about KP is -- I don't know what his timetable is -- but I know his mentality, and he really pushes himself to get back as quickly as he can.\"\n\n\"He does a great job working to take care of himself,\" Mazzulla continued. \"He's walking a little bit better, and every day he's in there doing whatever it takes to try to get back as fast as he can. I appreciate that.\"\n\nMazzulla also spoke about Porzingis' progress during his pre-game press conference ahead of Game 1. Asked if Porzingis could return for this series, Mazzulla replied \"I don't know,\" before adding \"I just know he's working every day to get back as fast as he can. [He is] involved with all of our meetings, films, drills, shootaround, and doing what he can treatment wise.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Celtics got by just fine without Porzingis in their first game against Cleveland. Al Horford led the way in the frontcourt with seven points and eight rebounds. Luke Kornet added four points, 10 rebounds, and two blocks off the bench. Trade deadline acquisition Xavier Tillman also his first non-garbage-time minutes of these playoffs - in three and a half minutes on the floor in the second quarter he contributed two points, three rebounds, and was plus-five during his shift.\n\nAccording to Mazzulla after the game though, replacing Porzingis comes down to more than just the big men.\n\n\"It's not just on the bigs. It's on everybody,\" he explained. \"To rebound, to play physical, to communicate. So, I thought Al and Luke and X did a good job from the big standpoint, but it's on everybody to be able to do that. And I think everyone did that.\"\n\nLeading the way in the 'everybody else' category was Jayson Tatum. Tatum did his part to make his presence felt at the rim on both ends of the floor. Although it was an off scoring night for him, he did grab a team-high 11 rebounds and added three blocks.\n\n\"I thought he played an overall well-rounded game,\" Mazzulla said of Tatum's performance, adding \"he had some good shots at the rim defensively.\"\n\nThere are two big takeaways from Tuesday night when it comes to Kristaps Porzingis' situation. On one hand, it appears we'll be keeping an eye out for his return earlier than expected. At the same time though if the Celtics get the same kind of performance on the interior they got in Game 1, there won't be a lot of incentive to rush him back before he's absolutely ready.", "source": {"uri": "985thesportshub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "98.5 The Sports Hub - Boston's Home For Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_barth@985thesportshub.com", "name": "Alex Barth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2022 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Kornet", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Kornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Musketeers_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavier Musketeers men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://985thesportshub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/88/2024/05/GettyImages-2151959760_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547923", "eventUri": "eng-9547923", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Porzingis suffered a soleus strain in the first round and will miss \"multiple games\" due to a non-contact injury. A Celtics reporter observed Porzingis walking fine and believes he will be back in time when needed.\n\nThe Boston Celtics don't seem to be missing Kristaps Porzingis so far in the 2024 NBA Playoffs. Boston just dominated the Cleveland Cavaliers, 120-95, in Game 1 of their second-round series on Tuesday night.\n\nNonetheless, while the Celtics seem to be just fine without their starting center, they would likely prefer to be healthy and whole the deeper they get into the postseason. Before Boston's demolition of Cleveland in the series-opener, Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla provided an optimistic update on his starting center's recovery.\n\n\"It's definitely better than we thought. I say, the one thing about [Kristaps Porzingis]... I don't know what his timetable is... But I know his mentality and he really pushes himself to get back as quickly as he can... He's walking a little bit better. Everyday, he's in there doing whatever it takes to try to get back as fast as he can.\" - Joe Mazzulla\n\nPorzingis Suffered Non-Contact Injury In The First Round Latvian is slated to miss \"multiple games\" due to injury\n\nKristaps Porzingis was officially diagnosed with a soleus strain after he suffered a non-contact leg injury in Game 4 of Boston's first-round series against the Miami Heat, which was nine days ago. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported that Porzingis is expected to miss several games. However, no official timeline was given for his return.\n\nThe injury was initially feared to be serious, as he suffered it on a non-contact play. But it seems like the Latvian avoided major disaster.\n\nStill, the Celtics will need to remain cautious and careful in bringing him back, since the soleus strain could potentially lead to an Achilles injury, which would be more devastating, not just for Boston, but for Porzingis' career as well.\n\nCeltics Reporter Provides Optimistic Insight On Porzingis \"He's walking perfectly fine.\"\n\nCeltics fans should also be thrilled to hear NBC Sports Boston reporter Chris Forsberg provide an optimistic update on Porzingis' status. Though he didn't give an actual diagnosis, Forsberg relayed what he noticed from seeing Porzingis and believes the big man will be back in time when the Celtics need him, as NBC Sports Boston detailed.\n\n\"He's walking perfectly fine... No boot, no brace, no nothing... I don't think they're going to have to rush him back. But when he's needed, I feel pretty confident he's going to be ready.\" - Chris Forsberg\n\nObviously, this is just a reporter saying what he observed from the outside-looking-in. The Celtics' doctors and staff surely have more information on when he could realistically return with minimal risk of aggravating or suffering a more devastating injury.\n\nNonetheless, it's certainly a good sign that Porzingis is reportedly walking much better and even has a pep in his step with the Celtics rolling through their opponents so far in the postseason.\n\nPorzingis will likely not see the floor anytime soon. But so far, it doesn't seem like the Celtics need him at this point, with the way they are steamrolling through their opponents despite his absence.\n\nRelated Celtics' Jaylen Brown Praises 'New Version' of Derrick White After Game 1 Win Derrick White is on an absolute tear for the Celtics to start the postseason.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2023 NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Forsberg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chris Forsberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Boston", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_tendon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Achilles tendon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Conventions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/mixcollage-30-apr-2024-06-46-pm-7975.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547923", "eventUri": "eng-9547923", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The Celts lead the series 1-0.\n\nPorzingis has been diagnosed with a right soleus strain suffered during the second quarter of Game 4 in Boston's first-round series against the Miami Heat. He informed reporters on Saturday that his recovery is expected to be on a week-to-week basis:\n\n\"It's something; it's not nothing. So it will take a little bit of time, for sure. But I'm doing everything I can to speed it up because I want to be back out there as soon as possible.\n\n\"But also understanding the worst thing would be probably to re-aggravate that, so being smart about it.\"\n\nGiven the duration of the NBA playoffs, with the conference finals starting no earlier than May 19 and the NBA Finals slated to begin on June 6, it's possible that Porzingis could return at full strength and rejoin the Celtics if they advance deep into the postseason.\n\nKristaps Porzingis, in his eighth NBA season, averages 19.7 points and 7.9 rebounds. He has played for the New York Knicks from 2015-2018, the Dallas Mavericks from 2019-2022, the Washington Wizards during the 2022-23 season, and now the Celtics.\n\nKristaps Porzingis missed the entire 2018-19 season because of an ACL injury. During his inaugural season with the Celtics, he recorded averages of 20.1 points and 7.2 rebounds over 29.6 minutes per game across 57 starts. In his first four games of the postseason, he averaged 12.3 points and 5.0 rebounds.\n\nBoston Celtics dominated Game 1 against Cleveland Cavaliers without Kristaps Porzingis\n\nBoston dominated from beyond the arc in Game 1, consistent with their season-long performance, securing a substantial blowout victory. Jaylen Brown led the scoring with 32 points, while Derrick White contributed 25.\n\nJayson Tatum added 18 points in 34 minutes of play. The team made 18-of-46 3-point attempts. Holding a 15-point advantage at the start of the fourth quarter, they began the period with a 10-2 run. The lead became insurmountable for the Cavaliers, allowing the Boston starters to rest for most of the quarter.\n\nDerrick White is setting records with his performance. His 28 3-pointers across a six-game stretch are the most in Celtics playoff history. Additionally, Boston has won its last 21 games where he has attempted at least 12 3-pointers.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanay_sahai@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Tanay Sahai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Knicks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Knicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Wizards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Wizards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23105549-1715247625.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547923", "eventUri": "eng-9547923", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 840, "textEnd": 846}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 885, "textEnd": 891}], "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Boston ruled out their starting big man due to a strained right soleus. Porzingis hurt his right calf in Game 4 of the Heat series last week and is availability for the series against the Cavs remains uncertain.\n\nPorzingis is the only player listed on the injury report for Boston for the second straight game as they face off with a shorthanded Cavs squad. Jarrett Allen is also questionable with bruised ribs and the starting center has missed four straight games with that injury. Reserve forward Dean Wade is also out with a strained knee but he's inching closer towards a return according to Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com.\n\nPorzingis was originally called week-to-week by Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla but he began stationary shooting on the court at Wednesday's practice.\n\n\"It's definitely better than we thought,\" Mazzulla told Zolak and Bertrand on 98.5 The Sports Hub on Tuesday. \"I think one thing about KP is, I don't know what his timetable is but I know his mentality, and he really pushes himself to get back as quickly as he can.\n\n\"He does a great job working to take care of himself. He's walking a little bit better, and every day he's in there doing whatever it takes to try to get back as fast as he can. I appreciate that.\"\n\nThe good news for the Celtics is that they should feel no motivation to rush Porzingis back to the floor after winning their last two games handily without him. Luke Kornet provided a massive spark off the bench for Boston as a backup center in a Game 1 rout against the Cavs, posting a career postseason high 10 rebounds in the victory.\n\nThat performance earned him high praise from All-Star teammate Jaylen Brown.\n\n\"Luke reads the game,\" Brown said. \"He's an intelligent basketball player. He knows the right reads in the right time and when he's playing well he's not thinking. He's just out there playing. He's a 7-footer so he contests shots at the rim and does a good job of just doing his job day in and day out, and that's what we need.

Forsberg's observation after Tuesday's game provided more evidence on that front.\n\n\"He had a little swagger, no hitch,\" Forsberg added of how he saw Porzingis walking after the game. \"He had a little bounce because he was happy about the team winning, but no boot, no cast, no brace, no nothing.

Mandatory Credit: Michael Laughlin-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Boston Celtics kickstarted their highly anticipated semi-final journey with a dominating 120-95 home victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers. However, for the franchise to continue in this form, it is going to need just about every star healthy and ready to play. As a result, the spotlight shifts to Kristaps Porzingis, whose physical condition has remained a source of worry for supporters.\n\nThe 28-year-old incurred a non-contact strain on his right leg in the second quarter of Game 4 against the Miami Heat. Soon after this, the Latvian struggled to even walk properly, limping his way onto the Celtics bench. This restricted his contributions during the clash, before keeping him out for the subsequent two games as well.\n\nUnfortunately, the recent injury report from the NBA only amplifies this misery. Porzingis is still reportedly dealing with his right soleus strain, a condition that often leads to stiffness and tightness in his right calf.\n\nA full recovery from this condition usually takes weeks, which means the star is still potentially set up to miss a few more games. Consequently, he has been listed as 'Out' for their Game 2 against the Cavs.\n\nDespite these worries, it is important to note that the rest of the roster has always held the fort well in Porzingis' absence. In the regular season, they maintained a 21-4 record without the services of the 2018 All-Star. In the playoffs, they have only extended this record, going 2-0 without the 7ft 2'' sensation's presence on the floor.\n\nThis just further showcases the quality of the Celtics' roster. In times of need, they have been collaboratively able to make up for Porzingis' 20.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks per game this season.\n\nHowever, the Latvian's addition to the starting five provides the team with a much-needed edge.

This current core has flirted with contention for years but has yet to grab a coveted 18th banner for the franchise, most recently coming up short in the 2023 Eastern Conference finals with Mazzulla at the helm.\n\nHere in the 2024 playoffs, Mazzulla's crew is once again in the mix for a title. They are favored to make another trip to to the conference finals once again following a historic regular season campaign. After the team's Game 1 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers in the second round, a 25-point home victory, Mazzulla was asked about how each player on the team is working to prioritize winning and keep a shared goal in mind. Mazzulla said he understood that there are plenty of individual accolades NBA players can work toward that may otherwise become a distraction.\n\n\"Every team is different,\" Mazzulla explained. \"Timing has a lot to do with that.\"\n\nYoung players aren't always ready for the spotlight, while other guys may be fighting for a new contract or to reach a career milestone. Mazzulla said he thinks Boston has the right collection of players at the right moment.\n\n\"I think there are a bunch of guys who have been through a lot around the league,\" Mazzulla said. \"But when you get them together sometimes the perfect timing allows for that.\"\n\n\"Guys go through different experiences throughout their career, and they're at the point now where winning is the most important thing.\"\n\nBoston's star players are only just entering their prime, even if they have been a part of a number of postseason runs already in their careers. Jayson Tatum, for example, turned 26 in March. Fellow All-NBA forward Jaylen Brown turned 27 in the fall.\n\nYoung players with big expectations and followings can often get sidetracked by the many responsibilities that come with superstardom. They may also simply not be ready to lead a team all the way to the Finals and beyond.\n\nExperience is the best teacher, as they say, and Mazzulla agrees. He explained why his group knows that just because the stars have aligned for Boston, things won't always come without adversity.\n\n\"I think you become aware that that doesn't mean it's going to be perfect,\" Mazzulla said of this timing. \"But the guys do a great job of holding that standard, I think because of what they have been through in their careers.\"\n\nWhile Tatum, Brown, and even Kristaps Porzingis are perhaps reaching new heights in their careers, Boston's veterans Jrue Holiday and Al Horford must also work to keep winning a title as the singular goal.\n\n\"You just have to keep fighting for that,\" Mazzulla said. \"There's nothing more important than winning.\"\n\nBecause the Celtics won 64 wins in the regular season, they will have home court for any future series this postseason.

You can't be a good team unless those guys win you games ... I thought Luke's presence was great for us.'\"\n\nKornet played 21 minutes off the bench for the Celtics, scoring only four points but snagging 10 rebounds and blocking a pair of shots while finishing with a +12 in the game.\n\nIn the regular season, Kornet averaged just 5.3 points and 4.1 rebounds per game for the Celtics.\n\nBoth teams played without their starting centers. Cleveland's Jarrett Allen missed his fourth straight game with a bruised rib injury he sustained in the first round against Orlando. Boston's Kristaps Porzingis was sidelined for the second consecutive game with a strained right calf.\n\nChampionship or bust for Celtics\n\nAfter falling in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals in Game 7 last year, the Celtics' front office knew something had to change. Yet, few expected just how monumental Boston's roster shake-up would be at the hands of president of basketball operations Brad Stevens.\n\nIn June, Stevens tried to deal 2023 Sixth Man of the Year Malcolm Brogdon in a three-team trade for 2018 All-Star Porzingis. The deal ultimately fell apart due to Brogdon's injury history.\n\nStevens didn't give up, though, eventually parting ways with veteran guard Marcus Smart in order to land Porzingis. The longest-tenured Celtic at the time was a key part of Boston's core for nearly a decade, but Stevens knew he had to do whatever it took to improve the roster.\n\nThis huge trade set the NBA world on fire, especially for die-hard Celtics fans who'd grown to love Smart and all the energy and defensive aggressiveness he brought to the team as their tone setter.\n\nBolstering Boston's starting lineup with Porzingis wasn't the only work Brad Stevens put in this offseason. To fill the defensive hole left by Smart, the former head coach traded for two-time All-Star Jrue Holiday just a few days before training camp. Holiday was available after the Milwaukee Bucks dealt him to the Portland Trail Blazers in the Damian Lillard blockbuster.\n\nBy moving off of Brogdon in exchange for a defensive-monster guard who will do whatever it takes to win, the Celtics have gone from contenders to a team that has seen their championship window kicked wide open.

Jarrett Allen, the Cavaliers' leader in rebounds (13.8 in playoffs), missed his fourth straight playoff appearance with a bruised rib injury and Cleveland had no backup plan on any area of the floor.\n\n\"Competitiveness was there (from) all the guys,\" Celtics head coach Joe Mazzulla said after Boston's 120-95 victory. \"Just the willingness to defend another team. They're a great team, they have really talented team, and one person can't do it by themself, it takes everybody. We had some really good team defensive possessions and some good team offensive possessions.\"\n\nMazzulla added: \"If you wanna get to where you wanna get to against teams like this, you can always fight for another level.\"\n\nIn terms of the margins, the Celtics competed at a level that the Cavaliers looked unprepared to handle. Boston out-rebounded (55-38), out-shot (49.9% to 41.1%), and overall outperformed Cleveland in a way that could set the tone for the series until the Cavaliers show a different version of themselves.\n\nHere are three takeaways from Game 1:\n\n1. Derrick White's playoff mode switch was lethal once again\n\nThe growth White's shown since debuting as a full-time starter this season has been tremendous, but the fringe All-Star candidate continues to surpass expectations when the moments matter most.\n\nSo far, White's shot an impressive 47.7% from 3-point range, scoring a combined 88 points in Boston's last three playoff games, including Game 1 against Cleveland. The signs were looming in the regular season when the 29-year-old scored 30 points twice in December, against the Warriors and Hornets, but its taken on a new life amid the team's quest for Banner 18.\n\nWhite finished with 25 points, knocking down seven 3-pointers to remain one of the most dangerous catch-and-shoot threats in the postseason.\n\n\"I always see him working on the types of shots that he knows he's gonna get,\" Jaylen Brown explained. \"We got certain actions and those actions he's mastered them -- like where his shots come from. So it's almost like practice for him because he shoots those shots over and over again.\"\n\n2. Max Strus was the wannabe villain who only villainized Cleveland\n\nStrus has undergone his fair share of post-season run-ins with Boston since being waived by the Celtics before the 2019-20 season, never failing to garner hatred from the TD Garden crowd.\n\nLast season, the 28-year-old was an unsung hero for the underdog Heat in their Eastern Conference finals win over the Celtics. Strus scored 15 points in Game 1, averaged 9.4 points throughout the series, and trolled Boston for releasing him following Miami's Game 7 victory -- before losing in the NBA Finals to the Nuggets in five games.\n\nCrossing paths again with the Celtics, this time in the semifinal round, Strus wasted no time getting on Boston's bad side. Strus committed a blatant personal foul by hacking Al Horford, which prompted an outpour of boos from Celtics fans, and an animated surprise reaction from Strus.\n\nWhile riling up the opposing crowd is part of being the \"bad guy\" of a playoff series, so is performing, therefore Strus checked only one box.\n\nStrus scored five points, shot 2-for-8 from the field, and registered a minus-12 rating for the Cavaliers, which is fearful, but not for Boston.\n\n3. Joe Mazzulla (effectively) busted out the clipboard creativity\n\nWithout Kristaps Porzingis, the Celtics needed to keep the sizing void filled to keep the Cavaliers from snagging a physicality advantage -- which has become increasingly critical due to the more lenient postseason officiating.\n\n\"It is what it is,\" Mazzulla said pregame. \"You just gotta adapt to your environment so at the end of the day, we just have to be ready to play with physicality on both ends of the floor and play without the expectation that it's going to go a certain way.\"\n\nUnderstanding the importance of maintaining an effective front-court presence, Mazzulla paired Kornet and Horford together, a combination that was used only 45 minutes during the regular season. Kornet was fresh off playing a combined 26 minutes in the first round, yet it all worked out.\n\nOff the bench, Kornet provided 10 rebounds and two blocks in 21 minutes, supporting Horford's seven points, eight rebounds, and four assists in the starting lineup. The two helped prove that regardless of circumstances, the Celtics have a roster interchangeable better than anyone in the NBA.\n\nIt's paid off handsomely amid the team's four-game winning streak in the playoffs, and removes the pressure from Porzingis to return quickly.", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u201320_Oklahoma_City_Thunder_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2019\u201320 Oklahoma City Thunder season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Strus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Max Strus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristaps_Porzi\u0146\u0123is", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Horford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Horford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show_Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Show Basketball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/12/Derrick-White-1-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547923", "eventUri": "eng-9547923", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

How bad has the damage been? Without him on the floor the Celtics enjoyed a +17 rebound advantage, and that's without their own big man - Porzingis - on the floor. To say the Cavs can't let that happen in Game 2 would be stating the obvious, but for the purpose of clarity, the Cavs can't let that happen in Game 2. If the likes of Evan Mobley - he grabbed 13 rebounds in Game 1 - can continue in a similar vein, it may just be that Cleveland can cause some problems. If he can't then don't be surprised if the Cavs get swept.\n\nThere is no other way to say it. In Game 1, the Boston Celtics made things look easy. With that in mind, one has to believe that they will be looking to do the exact same in Game 2 when they once again host the Pacers in the TD Garden on Thursday night.\n\nNow, do remember that the Celtics got that opening win without Kristaps Porzingis, who remains sidelined with a calf injury. To that end, the team relied on Jaylen Brown who scored a team-high 32 points, while Derrick White had 25 of his own, and Payton Pritchard chipped in with a further 16 points off the bench. Consider for a moment that the other Celtics star, Jayson Tatum scored just 18 points on 7 of 19 from the floor i.e., the Celtics have got depth and then some.\n\nAs for the Cavs, it was clearly a struggle as the team failed to cause any significant problems from deep, while the absence of Jarrett Allen essentially conceded the paint to Boston. The Cavs did manage to see four of their starters score in double digits, but they still lost by 25 points which should tell you, it was a rough night. What that means is that if the Cavs are to have any hope of heading back home with the series tied, they will have to do some serious self review, because as things stand, nothing has worked, and the way the Celtics are playing, that's definitely not a good thing.", "source": {"uri": "as.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "as"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Mobley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evan Mobley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaylen_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaylen Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indiana Pacers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayson_Tatum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jayson Tatum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derrick_White_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derrick White (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarrett Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payton_Pritchard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Payton Pritchard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://img.asmedia.epimg.net/resizer/v2/C7B7B6RY75PCZPVV7UVKXULUBY.jpg?auth=996e06b87fa88c4a3d9720b3431b8a9eaf2784fd58b04bb2e1f0d0641a3d33f8&width=644&height=362&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547923", "eventUri": "eng-9547923", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

He will remain with the Celtics for the rest of the postseason before joining the Hornets full-time.\n\nMazzulla reacted to the news before Game 2 of Boston's Eastern Conference semifinals series vs. the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n\"Happy for him,\" Mazzulla said. \"Great coach. Long overdue, and he's going to do a great job.\"\n\nLee joined the C's after five seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks, where he won the 2021 NBA championship as part of Mike Budenholzer's coaching staff. Boston finished with a 64-18 record -- the fourth-best in franchise history -- in Lee's lone season working under Mazzulla.\n\nMazzulla served as an assistant for three seasons before his unexpected promotion to Celtics head coach in 2022. With Lee earning his first head coaching job, Mazzulla offered some blunt advice based on his own experience.\n\n\"Everybody hates you. Get used to it,\" he said. \"You're no longer the nice, shiny toy.\"\n\nBoth Mazzulla and Lee remain focused on bringing Banner 18 to TD Garden. When the time comes to find a new lead assistant, Mazzulla plans to hire from within.\n\n\"When you have the structure that we have as far as talented young guys, you just be as patient as you can knowing that there's a process in order of how you try to go about doing it,\" he said. \"Especially when you want to keep as many people around as you can. So, just got to go through that process.\"\n\nMazzulla cited Lee's experience and accolades as reasons he believes he'll succeed in Charlotte. He also mentioned an important quality that you won't find on Basketball Reference.\n\n\"I think one of the best things besides his basketball has been his ability to communicate,\" Mazzulla said. \"He's a really positive guy.\"\n\nLee will be on the Celtics bench as Boston looks to take a 2-0 series lead over Cleveland on Thursday night.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eastern Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TD_Garden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TD Garden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Careers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2024/05/Mazzulla_Joe_Lee_Charles_GettyImages-1990611074-e1715291954631.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547923", "eventUri": "eng-9547923", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 452990485, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 20, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 20}}}

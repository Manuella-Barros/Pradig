What's next?\n\nIranian actors also have spent recent months creating fake news sites and impersonating activists, laying the groundwork to stoke division and potentially sway American voters this fall, especially in swing states, the technology giant found.\n\nThe findings in Microsoft's newest threat intelligence report show how Iran, which has been active in recent U.S. elections, is evolving its tactics for another election that's likely to have global implications. The report goes a step beyond anything U.S. intelligence officials have disclosed, giving specific examples of Iranian groups and the actions they have taken so far. Iran's United Nations mission denied it had plans to interfere or launch cyberattacks in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe report doesn't specify Iran's intentions besides sowing chaos in the United States, though U.S. officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes former President Donald Trump. U.S. officials also have expressed alarm about Tehran's efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump. This week, the Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against a Pakistani man with ties to Iran who's alleged to have hatched assassination plots targeting multiple officials, potentially including Trump.\n\nThe report also reveals how Russia and China are exploiting U.S. political polarization to advance their own divisive messaging in a consequential election year.\n\nMicrosoft's report identified four examples of recent Iranian activity that the company expects to increase as November's election draws closer.\n\nFirst, a group linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard in June targeted a high-ranking U.S. presidential campaign official with a phishing email, a form of cyberattack often used to gather sensitive information, according to the report, which didn't identify which campaign was targeted. The group concealed the email's origins by sending it from the hacked email account of a former senior adviser, Microsoft said.\n\nDays later, the Iranian group tried to log into an account that belonged to a former presidential candidate, but wasn't successful, Microsoft's report said. The company notified those who were targeted.\n\nIn a separate example, an Iranian group has been creating websites that pose as U.S.-based news sites targeted to voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum, the report said.\n\nOne fake news site that lends itself to a left-leaning audience insults Trump by calling him \"raving mad\" and suggests he uses drugs, the report said. Another site meant to appeal to Republican readers centers on LGBTQ issues and gender-affirming surgery.\n\nA third example Microsoft cited found that Iranian groups are impersonating U.S. activists, potentially laying the groundwork for influence operations closer to the election.\n\nFinally, another Iranian group in May compromised an account owned by a government employee in a swing state, the report said. It was unclear whether that cyberattack was related to election interference efforts.\n\nREAD MORE: U.S. says cyberattacks against water supplies are rising, and utilities need to do more to stop them\n\nIran's U.N. mission sent The Associated Press an emailed statement: \"Iran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centers, and industries. Iran's cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks. The U.S. presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\"\n\nThe Microsoft report said that as Iran escalates its cyber influence, Russia-linked actors also have pivoted their influence campaigns to focus on the U.S. election, while actors linked to the Chinese Communist Party have taken advantage of pro-Palestinian university protests and other current events in the U.S. to try to raise U.S. political tensions.\n\nMicrosoft said it has continued to monitor how foreign foes are using generative AI technology. The increasingly cheap and easy-to-access tools can generate lifelike fake images, photos and videos in seconds, prompting concern among some experts that they will be weaponized to mislead voters this election cycle.\n\nWhile many countries have experimented with AI in their influence operations, the company said, those efforts haven't had much impact so far. The report said as a result, some actors have \"pivoted back to techniques that have proven effective in the past -- simple digital manipulations, mischaracterization of content, and use of trusted labels or logos atop false information.\"\n\nMicrosoft's report aligns with recent warnings from U.S. intelligence officials, who say America's adversaries appear determined to seed the internet with false and incendiary claims ahead of November's vote.\n\nTop intelligence officials said last month that Russia continues to pose the greatest threat when it comes to election disinformation, while there are indications that Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously when it comes to 2024.\n\nIran's efforts seem aimed at undermining candidates seen as being more likely to increase tension with Tehran, the officials said. That's a description that fits Trump, whose administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of the top Iranian general.\n\nThe influence efforts also coincide with a time of high tensions between Iran and Israel, whose military the U.S. strongly supports.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines said last month that the Iranian government has covertly supported American protests over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. Groups linked to Iran have posed as online activists, encouraged protests and provided financial support to some protest groups, Haines said.\n\nAmerica's foes, Iran among them, have a long history of seeking to influence U.S. elections.

The report goes a step beyond anything U.S. intelligence officials have disclosed, giving specific examples of Iranian groups and the actions they have taken so far. Iran's United Nations mission denied it had plans to interfere or launch cyberattacks in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe report doesn't specify Iran's intentions besides sowing chaos in the United States, though U.S. officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes former President Donald Trump. U.S. officials also have expressed alarm about Tehran's efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump. This week, the Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against a Pakistani man with ties to Iran who's alleged to have hatched assassination plots targeting multiple officials, potentially including Trump.\n\nThe report also reveals how Russia and China are exploiting U.S. political polarization to advance their own divisive messaging in a consequential election year.\n\nMicrosoft's report identified four examples of recent Iranian activity that the company expects to increase as November's election draws closer.\n\nFirst, a group linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard in June targeted a high-ranking U.S. presidential campaign official with a phishing email, a form of cyberattack often used to gather sensitive information, according to the report, which didn't identify which campaign was targeted. The group concealed the email's origins by sending it from the hacked email account of a former senior adviser, Microsoft said.\n\nDays later, the Iranian group tried to log into an account that belonged to a former presidential candidate, but wasn't successful, Microsoft's report said. The company notified those who were targeted.\n\nIn a separate example, an Iranian group has been creating websites that pose as U.S.-based news sites targeted to voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum, the report said.\n\nOne fake news site that lends itself to a left-leaning audience insults Trump by calling him \"raving mad\" and suggests he uses drugs, the report said. Another site meant to appeal to Republican readers centers on LGBTQ issues and gender-affirming surgery.\n\nA third example Microsoft cited found that Iranian groups are impersonating U.S. activists, potentially laying the groundwork for influence operations closer to the election.\n\nFinally, another Iranian group in May compromised an account owned by a government employee in a swing state, the report said. It was unclear whether that cyberattack was related to election interference efforts.\n\nIran's U.N. mission sent The Associated Press an emailed statement: \"Iran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centers, and industries. Iran's cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks. The U.S. presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\"\n\nThe Microsoft report said that as Iran escalates its cyber influence, Russia-linked actors also have pivoted their influence campaigns to focus on the U.S. election, while actors linked to the Chinese Communist Party have taken advantage of pro-Palestinian university protests and other current events in the U.S. to try to raise U.S. political tensions.\n\nMicrosoft said it has continued to monitor how foreign foes are using generative AI technology. The increasingly cheap and easy-to-access tools can generate lifelike fake images, photos and videos in seconds, prompting concern among some experts that they will be weaponized to mislead voters this election cycle.\n\nWhile many countries have experimented with AI in their influence operations, the company said, those efforts haven't had much impact so far. The report said as a result, some actors have \"pivoted back to techniques that have proven effective in the past - simple digital manipulations, mischaracterization of content, and use of trusted labels or logos atop false information.\"\n\nMicrosoft's report aligns with recent warnings from U.S. intelligence officials, who say America's adversaries appear determined to seed the internet with false and incendiary claims ahead of November's vote.\n\nTop intelligence officials said last month that Russia continues to pose the greatest threat when it comes to election disinformation, while there are indications that Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously when it comes to 2024.\n\nIran's efforts seem aimed at undermining candidates seen as being more likely to increase tension with Tehran, the officials said. That's a description that fits Trump, whose administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of the top Iranian general.\n\nAn update last month from officials with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), FBI and Department of Homeland Security concluded that Tehran's efforts appeared designed to undercut Trump.\n\n\"Since our last update, the [intelligence community] has observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase tensions with the United States,\" a senior ODNI official said, adding, \"Iran's preference is essentially a reflection of its desire to not worsen tensions with the United States, and Iran is opposing the candidate that Iran's leaders perceive would increase those tensions.\"\n\nThe officials did not explicitly name the Trump campaign and referred instead to the key findings of the 2020 assessment. They also stressed that most of Iran's online activities, which they said rely on a \"vast web\" of internet personas, have been focused on stoking chaos and societal divisions.\n\nThe influence efforts also coincide with a time of high tensions between Iran and Israel, whose military the U.S. strongly supports.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines said last month that the Iranian government has covertly supported American protests over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. In the statement, issued on July 9, Haines said the intelligence community had \"observed actors tied to Iran's government posing as activists online seeking to encourage protests and even providing financial support to protesters.\"\n\nAmerica's foes, Iran among them, have a long history of seeking to influence U.S. elections. In 2020, groups linked to Iran sent emails to Democratic voters in an apparent effort to intimidate them into voting for Trump, intelligence officials said.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com",

The report goes a step beyond anything U.S. intelligence officials have disclosed, giving specific examples of Iranian groups and the actions they have taken so far. Iran's United Nations mission denied it had plans to interfere or launch cyberattacks in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe report doesn\u00b4t specify Iran\u00b4s intentions besides sowing chaos in the United States, though U.S. officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes former President Donald Trump. U.S. officials also have expressed alarm about Tehran's efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump. This week, the Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against a Pakistani man with ties to Iran who\u00b4s alleged to have hatched assassination plots targeting multiple officials, potentially including Trump.\n\nThe report also reveals how Russia and China are exploiting U.S. political polarization to advance their own divisive messaging in a consequential election year.\n\nMicrosoft\u00b4s report identified four examples of recent Iranian activity that the company expects to increase as November\u00b4s election draws closer.\n\nFirst, a group linked to Iran\u00b4s Revolutionary Guard in June targeted a high-ranking U.S. presidential campaign official with a phishing email, a form of cyberattack often used to gather sensitive information, according to the report, which didn't identify which campaign was targeted. The group concealed the email\u00b4s origins by sending it from the hacked email account of a former senior adviser, Microsoft said.\n\nDays later, the Iranian group tried to log into an account that belonged to a former presidential candidate, but wasn\u00b4t successful, Microsoft\u00b4s report said. The company notified those who were targeted.\n\nIn a separate example, an Iranian group has been creating websites that pose as U.S.-based news sites targeted to voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum, the report said.\n\nOne fake news site that lends itself to a left-leaning audience insults Trump by calling him \"raving mad\" and suggests he uses drugs, the report said. Another site meant to appeal to Republican readers centers on LGBTQ issues and gender-affirming surgery.\n\nA third example Microsoft cited found that Iranian groups are impersonating U.S. activists, potentially laying the groundwork for influence operations closer to the election.\n\nFinally, another Iranian group in May compromised an account owned by a government employee in a swing state, the report said. It was unclear whether that cyberattack was related to election interference efforts.\n\nIran's UN mission sent The Associated Press an emailed statement: \"Iran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centers, and industries. Iran\u00b4s cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks. The U.S. presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\"\n\nThe Microsoft report said that as Iran escalates its cyber influence, Russia-linked actors also have pivoted their influence campaigns to focus on the U.S. election, while actors linked to the Chinese Communist Party have taken advantage of pro-Palestinian university protests and other current events in the U.S. to try to raise U.S. political tensions.\n\nMicrosoft said it has continued to monitor how foreign foes are using generative AI technology. The increasingly cheap and easy-to-access tools can generate lifelike fake images, photos and videos in seconds, prompting concern among some experts that they will be weaponized to mislead voters this election cycle.\n\nWhile many countries have experimented with AI in their influence operations, the company said, those efforts haven\u00b4t had much impact so far. The report said as a result, some actors have \"pivoted back to techniques that have proven effective in the past - simple digital manipulations, mischaracterization of content, and use of trusted labels or logos atop false information.\"\n\nMicrosoft\u00b4s report aligns with recent warnings from U.S. intelligence officials, who say America\u00b4s adversaries appear determined to seed the internet with false and incendiary claims ahead of November\u00b4s vote.\n\nTop intelligence officials said last month that Russia continues to pose the greatest threat when it comes to election disinformation, while there are indications that Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously when it comes to 2024.\n\nIran's efforts seem aimed at undermining candidates seen as being more likely to increase tension with Tehran, the officials said. That\u00b4s a description that fits Trump, whose administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of the top Iranian general.\n\nThe influence efforts also coincide with a time of high tensions between Iran and Israel, whose military the U.S. strongly supports.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines said last month that the Iranian government has covertly supported American protests over Israel\u00b4s war against Hamas in Gaza. Groups linked to Iran have posed as online activists, encouraged protests and provided financial support to some protest groups, Haines said.\n\nAmerica\u00b4s foes, Iran among them, have a long history of seeking to influence U.S. elections. In 2020, groups linked to Iran sent emails to Democratic voters in an apparent effort to intimidate them into voting for Trump, intelligence officials said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers David Klepper and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Pressreceives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

It was unclear whether that cyber attack was related to election interference efforts.\n\nIran's UN mission sent The Associated Press an emailed statement: \"Iran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centres, and industries.\n\n\"Iran's cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks.\n\n\"The US presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\"\n\nThe Microsoft report said that as Iran escalates its cyber influence, Russia-linked actors also have pivoted their influence campaigns to focus on the US election, while actors linked to the Chinese Communist Party have taken advantage of pro-Palestinian university protests and other current events in the US to try to raise political tensions.\n\nMicrosoft said it has continued to monitor how foreign foes are using generative AI technology. The increasingly cheap and easy-to-access tools can generate lifelike fake images, photos and videos in seconds, prompting concern among some experts that they will be weaponized to mislead voters this election cycle.\n\nWhile many countries have experimented with AI in their influence operations, the company said, those efforts have not had much impact so far.\n\nThe report said as a result, some actors have \"pivoted back to techniques that have proven effective in the past - simple digital manipulations, mischaracterization of content, and use of trusted labels or logos atop false information\".\n\nMicrosoft's report aligns with recent warnings from US intelligence officials, who say America's adversaries appear determined to seed the internet with false and incendiary claims ahead of November's vote.\n\nTop intelligence officials said last month that Russia continues to pose the greatest threat when it comes to election disinformation, while there are indications that Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously when it comes to 2024.\n\nIran's efforts seem aimed at undermining candidates seen as being more likely to increase tension with Tehran, the officials said.

Iran's United Nations mission denied it had plans to interfere or launch cyberattacks in the US presidential election.\n\nThe report doesn't specify Iran's intentions besides sowing chaos in the United States, though US officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes former President Donald Trump.\n\nAlso Read | Muhammad Yunus Takes Oath of Office As Head of Bangladesh's Interim Government, To Seek Peace and Prepare New Elections.\n\nUS officials also have expressed alarm about Tehran's efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump.\n\nThis week, the Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against a Pakistani man with ties to Iran who's alleged to have hatched assassination plots targeting multiple officials, potentially including Trump.\n\nThe report also reveals how Russia and China are exploiting US political polarisation to advance their own divisive messaging in a consequential election year.\n\nMicrosoft's report identified four examples of recent Iranian activity that the company expects to increase as November's election draws closer.\n\nFirst, a group linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard in June targeted a high-ranking US presidential campaign official with a phishing email, a form of cyberattack often used to gather sensitive information, according to the report, which didn't identify which campaign was targeted.\n\nThe group concealed the email's origins by sending it from the hacked email account of a former senior adviser, Microsoft said.\n\nDays later, the Iranian group tried to log into an account that belonged to a former presidential candidate, but wasn't successful, Microsoft's report said. The company notified those who were targeted.\n\nIn a separate example, an Iranian group has been creating websites that pose as US-based news sites targeted to voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum, the report said.\n\nOne fake news site that lends itself to a left-leaning audience insults Trump by calling him \"raving mad\" and suggests he uses drugs, the report said. Another site meant to appeal to Republican readers centres on LGBTQ issues and gender-affirming surgery.\n\nA third example Microsoft cited found that Iranian groups are impersonating US activists, potentially laying the groundwork for influence operations closer to the election.\n\nFinally, another Iranian group in May compromised an account owned by a government employee in a swing state, the report said. It was unclear whether that cyberattack was related to election interference efforts.\n\nIran's UN mission sent The Associated Press an emailed statement: \"Iran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centres, and industries. Iran's cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks. The US presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\"\n\nThe Microsoft report said that as Iran escalates its cyber influence, Russia-linked actors also have pivoted their influence campaigns to focus on the US election, while actors linked to the Chinese Communist Party have taken advantage of pro-Palestinian university protests and other current events in the US to try to raise US political tensions.\n\nMicrosoft said it has continued to monitor how foreign foes are using generative AI technology. The increasingly cheap and easy-to-access tools can generate lifelike fake images, photos and videos in seconds, prompting concern among some experts that they will be weaponised to mislead voters this election cycle.\n\nWhile many countries have experimented with AI in their influence operations, the company said, those efforts haven't had much impact so far. The report said as a result, some actors have \"pivoted back to techniques that have proven effective in the past -- simple digital manipulations, mischaracterisation of content, and use of trusted labels or logos atop false information.\"\n\nMicrosoft's report aligns with recent warnings from US intelligence officials, who say America's adversaries appear determined to seed the internet with false and incendiary claims ahead of November's vote.\n\nTop intelligence officials said last month that Russia continues to pose the greatest threat when it comes to election disinformation, while there are indications that Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously when it comes to 2024.\n\nIran's efforts seem aimed at undermining candidates seen as being more likely to increase tension with Tehran, the officials said. That's a description that fits Trump, whose administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of the top Iranian general.\n\nThe influence efforts also coincide with a time of high tensions between Iran and Israel, whose military the US strongly supports.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines said last month that the Iranian government has covertly supported American protests over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. Groups linked to Iran have posed as online activists, encouraged protests and provided financial support to some protest groups, Haines said.\n\nAmerica's foes, Iran among them, have a long history of seeking to influence US elections. In 2020, groups linked to Iran sent emails to Democratic voters in an apparent effort to intimidate them into voting for Trump, intelligence officials said.

The report goes a step beyond anything U.S. intelligence officials have disclosed, giving specific examples of Iranian groups and the actions they have taken so far. Iran's United Nations mission denied it had plans to interfere or launch cyberattacks in the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe report doesn't specify Iran's intentions besides sowing chaos in the United States, though U.S. officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes former President Donald Trump. U.S. officials also have expressed alarm about Tehran's efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump. This week, the Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against a Pakistani man with ties to Iran who's alleged to have hatched assassination plots targeting multiple officials, potentially including Trump.\n\nThe report also reveals how Russia and China are exploiting U.S. political polarization to advance their own divisive messaging in a consequential election year.\n\nMicrosoft's report identified four examples of recent Iranian activity that the company expects to increase as November's election draws closer.\n\nFirst, a group linked to Iran's Revolutionary Guard in June targeted a high-ranking U.S. presidential campaign official with a phishing email, a form of cyberattack often used to gather sensitive information, according to the report, which didn't identify which campaign was targeted. The group concealed the email's origins by sending it from the hacked email account of a former senior adviser, Microsoft said.\n\nDays later, the Iranian group tried to log into an account that belonged to a former presidential candidate, but wasn't successful, Microsoft's report said. The company notified those who were targeted.\n\nIn a separate example, an Iranian group has been creating websites that pose as U.S.-based news sites targeted to voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum, the report said.\n\nOne fake news site that lends itself to a left-leaning audience insults Trump by calling him \"raving mad\" and suggests he uses drugs, the report said. Another site meant to appeal to Republican readers centers on LGBTQ issues and gender-affirming surgery.\n\nA third example Microsoft cited found that Iranian groups are impersonating U.S. activists, potentially laying the groundwork for influence operations closer to the election.\n\nFinally, another Iranian group in May compromised an account owned by a government employee in a swing state, the report said. It was unclear whether that cyberattack was related to election interference efforts.\n\nIran's UN mission sent The Associated Press an emailed statement: \"Iran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centers, and industries. Iran's cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks. The U.S. presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\"\n\nThe Microsoft report said that as Iran escalates its cyber influence, Russia-linked actors also have pivoted their influence campaigns to focus on the U.S. election, while actors linked to the Chinese Communist Party have taken advantage of pro-Palestinian university protests and other current events in the U.S. to try to raise U.S. political tensions.\n\nMicrosoft said it has continued to monitor how foreign foes are using generative AI technology. The increasingly cheap and easy-to-access tools can generate lifelike fake images, photos and videos in seconds, prompting concern among some experts that they will be weaponized to mislead voters this election cycle.\n\nWhile many countries have experimented with AI in their influence operations, the company said, those efforts haven't had much impact so far. The report said as a result, some actors have \"pivoted back to techniques that have proven effective in the past -- simple digital manipulations, mischaracterization of content, and use of trusted labels or logos atop false information.\"\n\nMicrosoft's report aligns with recent warnings from U.S. intelligence officials, who say America's adversaries appear determined to seed the internet with false and incendiary claims ahead of November's vote.\n\nTop intelligence officials said last month that Russia continues to pose the greatest threat when it comes to election disinformation, while there are indications that Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously when it comes to 2024.\n\nIran's efforts seem aimed at undermining candidates seen as being more likely to increase tension with Tehran, the officials said. That's a description that fits Trump, whose administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of the top Iranian general.\n\nThe influence efforts also coincide with a time of high tensions between Iran and Israel, whose military the U.S. strongly supports.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines said last month that the Iranian government has covertly supported American protests over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. Groups linked to Iran have posed as online activists, encouraged protests and provided financial support to some protest groups, Haines said.\n\nAmerica's foes, Iran among them, have a long history of seeking to influence U.S. elections. In 2020, groups linked to Iran sent emails to Democratic voters in an apparent effort to intimidate them into voting for Trump, intelligence officials said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers David Klepper and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press\u202freceives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

The report, however, did not specify which campaign was targeted.\n\nThe group masked the email's origin by sending it from the compromised email account of a former senior adviser, according to Microsoft.\n\nA few days later, the same Iranian group attempted to access the account of a former presidential candidate but failed, as stated in Microsoft's report. The company informed those who were targeted.\n\nIn another example, an Iranian group has been developing websites that mimic U.S. news outlets, targeting voters from both sides of the political spectrum, according to the report.\n\nOne such fake news site, aimed at left-leaning audiences, criticizes Trump by calling him \"raving mad\" and insinuates drug use. Another site, targeting Republican readers, focuses on LGBTQ issues and gender-affirming surgeries.\n\nMicrosoft's report also identified Iranian groups posing as U.S. activists, possibly laying the groundwork for influence operations as the election draws near.\n\nLastly, another Iranian group in May compromised an account belonging to a government employee in a swing state, the report stated.\n\nIt remains unclear if this cyberattack was linked to election interference.\n\nIran's UN mission sent an email statement to The Associated Press: \"Iran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centers, and industries. Iran's cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks. The US presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\"\n\nThe Microsoft report also mentioned that as Iran steps up its cyber influence operations, Russian-linked actors have also shifted their focus to the U.S. election, while groups tied to the Chinese Communist Party are leveraging pro-Palestinian university protests and other current events in the U.S. to heighten political tensions.\n\nMicrosoft noted that it continues to track how adversaries are using generative AI technology.\n\nThese increasingly affordable and easy-to-access tools can produce realistic fake images, photos, and videos in seconds, raising concerns among experts that they could be used to mislead voters in this election cycle.\n\nAlthough various countries have experimented with AI in their influence campaigns, the company stated that these efforts have not yet had significant effects.\n\nAs a result, some actors have \"pivoted back to techniques that have proven effective in the past -- simple digital manipulations, mischaracterization of content, and use of trusted labels or logos atop false information,\" according to the report.\n\nMicrosoft's findings are in line with recent warnings from U.S. intelligence officials, who indicate that America's adversaries appear determined to flood the internet with false and inflammatory claims ahead of November's election.\n\nTop intelligence officials reported last month that Russia remains the biggest threat in terms of election disinformation, while Iran seems to be expanding its efforts, and China is approaching the 2024 election with caution.\n\nIran's actions seem to be aimed at undermining candidates who are seen as more likely to increase tensions with Tehran, which describes Trump, whose administration pulled out of a nuclear agreement with Iran, reimposed sanctions, and ordered the assassination of a top Iranian general.\n\nThese influence operations coincide with a period of heightened tensions between Iran and Israel, a nation strongly backed by the U.S. military.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines stated last month that the Iranian government has secretly supported American protests related to Israel's conflict with Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIranian-linked groups have posed as online activists, encouraged demonstrations, and provided financial backing to some protest organizations, according to Haines.\n\nIran, like other U.S. adversaries, has a long history of trying to influence American elections.\n\nIn 2020, groups linked to Iran sent emails to Democratic voters in an apparent attempt to intimidate them into voting for Trump, intelligence officials reported.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"},

Iran\u2019s United Nations mission denied it had plans to interfere or launch cyberattacks in the US presidential election.\n\nThe report does not specify Iran\u2019s intentions besides sowing chaos in the US, though US officials have previously hinted that Iran particularly opposes former president Donald Trump. US officials also have expressed alarm about Tehran\u2019s efforts to seek retaliation for a 2020 strike on an Iranian general that was ordered by Trump.\n\nThis week, the Justice Department unsealed criminal charges against a Pakistani man with ties to Iran who\u2019s alleged to have hatched assassination plots targeting multiple officials, potentially including Trump.\n\nThe report also reveals how Russia and China are exploiting US political polarisation to advance their own divisive messaging in a consequential election year.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s report identified four examples of recent Iranian activity that the company expects to increase as November\u2019s election draws closer.\n\nFirst, a group linked to Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard in June targeted a high-ranking US presidential campaign official with a phishing email, a form of cyberattack often used to gather sensitive information, according to the report, which did not identify which campaign was targeted. The group concealed the email\u2019s origins by sending it from the hacked email account of a former senior adviser, Microsoft said.\n\nDays later, the Iranian group tried to log into an account that belonged to a former presidential candidate, but was not successful, Microsoft\u2019s report said. The company notified those who were targeted.\n\nIn a separate example, an Iranian group has been creating websites that pose as US-based news sites targeted to voters on opposite sides of the political spectrum, the report said.\n\nOne fake news site that lends itself to a left-leaning audience insults Trump by calling him \u201craving mad\u201d and suggests he uses drugs, the report said. Another site meant to appeal to Republican readers centres on LGBTQ issues and gender-affirming surgery.\n\nA third example Microsoft cited found that Iranian groups are impersonating US activists, potentially laying the groundwork for influence operations closer to the election.\n\nFinally, another Iranian group in May compromised an account owned by a government employee in a swing state, the report said. It was unclear whether that cyberattack was related to election interference efforts.\n\nIran\u2019s UN mission sent The Associated Press an emailed statement: \u201cIran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centres, and industries. Iran\u2019s cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyberattacks. The US presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\u201d\n\nThe Microsoft report said that as Iran escalates its cyber influence, Russia-linked actors also have pivoted their influence campaigns to focus on the US election, while actors linked to the Chinese Communist Party have taken advantage of pro-Palestinian university protests and other current events in the US to try to raise US political tensions.\n\nMicrosoft said it has continued to monitor how foreign foes are using generative AI technology. The increasingly cheap and easy-to-access tools can generate lifelike fake images, photos and videos in seconds, prompting concern among some experts that they will be weaponised to mislead voters this election cycle.\n\nWhile many countries have experimented with AI in their influence operations, the company said, those efforts have not had much impact so far. The report said as a result, some actors have \u201cpivoted back to techniques that have proven effective in the past \u2013 simple digital manipulations, mischaracterisation of content, and use of trusted labels or logos atop false information.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s report aligns with recent warnings from US intelligence officials, who say America\u2019s adversaries appear determined to seed the internet with false and incendiary claims ahead of November\u2019s vote.\n\nTop intelligence officials said last month that Russia continues to pose the greatest threat when it comes to election disinformation, while there are indications that Iran is expanding its efforts and China is proceeding cautiously when it comes to 2024.\n\nIran\u2019s efforts seem aimed at undermining candidates seen as being more likely to increase tension with Tehran, the officials said. That is a description that fits Trump, whose administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of the top Iranian general.\n\nThe influence efforts also coincide with a time of high tensions between Iran and Israel, whose military the US strongly supports.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines said last month that the Iranian government has covertly supported American protests over Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in Gaza. Groups linked to Iran have posed as online activists, encouraged protests and provided financial support to some protest groups, Haines said.\n\nAmerica\u2019s foes, Iran among them, have a long history of seeking to influence US elections. In 2020, groups linked to Iran sent emails to Democratic voters in an apparent effort to intimidate them into voting for Trump, intelligence officials said.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType":

Neither site has gained much traction on social media, but that could change as the election draws nearer, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe report - compiled from open-source materials and Microsoft's vast supply of internal data - offers some of the clearest public examples yet of what US intelligence officials described last month as an ongoing covert social media campaign by Iran to undercut Trump's candidacy and to increase \"social discord\" in the US ahead of the November election.\n\nThe report also underscores how the number of foreign actors trying to sow divisions around US elections has continued to grow since the Kremlin's sweeping effort to influence the 2016 election.\n\nThe Iranians have \"laid the groundwork for influence campaigns on trending election-related topics and begun to activate these campaigns in an apparent effort to stir up controversy or sway voters - especially in swing states,\" Clint Watts, general manager of the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, said in a blog post.\n\nA hacking group linked with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in June also tried to break into the email account of a high-ranking official on a US presidential campaign, according to Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft said it notified the campaign of the hacking attempt, but declined to say publicly which campaign it was.\n\n\"Microsoft has not notified us of any campaign accounts having been targeted in this manner,\" an official with Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign told CNN. CNN has requested comment from the Trump campaign.\n\nRussian operatives, meanwhile, have since April, tried to \"drive headlines with fake scandals\" that falsely claim that the CIA told a Ukrainian troll farm to disrupt the upcoming US election, that the FBI wiretapped Trump's residence and that Ukrainian soldiers burned an effigy of Trump, according to Microsoft.\n\nChinese online personas have tried to use hundreds of thousands of online accounts to amplify outrage around the pro-Palestinian protests at US universities this spring, the Microsoft report said.\n\nThe Iranian, Russian and Chinese governments routinely deny allegations of election influence operations.\n\nIt is not unusual during US presidential campaigns for hackers associated with the Iranian, Russian and Chinese intelligence services to try to collect intelligence on campaign positions or personnel. In 2020, Microsoft warned that the same group of Iranian hackers was targeting Trump's reelection campaign, while Chinese hackers were targeting associates of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nEfforts to undermine US election loom\n\nUS officials are bracing for a range for foreign intelligence services to try to influence or undermine confidence in the 2024 US elections by exploiting an already-fraught domestic environment in which many Americans believe lies about voter fraud.\n\nRussia \"remains the predominant threat to U.S. elections,\" the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a recent assessment. US officials have also warned that Russian operatives and propagandists are planning to \"covertly use social media\" in an attempt to undermine support for Ukraine in swing states during the election.\n\nChina \"probably does not plan to influence the outcome\" of the US presidential election, but US intelligence is monitoring the possibility that China-linked propagandists and influence actors could \"denigrate down-ballot candidates,\" the ODNI assessment states.\n\nThe alleged Iranian threats to the Trump candidacy have not just been online.\n\nUS authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president, CNN first reported on July 16. The Justice Department on August 6 announced charges against a Pakistani man with alleged ties to the Iranian government for allegedly seeking to carry out political assassinations.\n\nIran has denied the assassination plot allegations.\n\nAs president, Trump ordered the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, and he withdrew from a multilateral deal aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear program.

It also tried to log into the account of a former presidential candidate. Microsoft didn't name any of the targets.\n\nIn total, four different groups have conducted a range of activities, Microsoft said.\n\nMicrosoft has observed one of the fake news campaigns targeting audiences on both sides of the political spectrum. That revelation comes less than two weeks after U.S. intelligence officials briefed reporters that Iran appears intent on undermining the campaign of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nOne compromise of a county-level government employee looked like part of a broader, less targeted campaign.\n\nThe increase in activity appears to fit a pattern of Iran making a later play at influencing elections than other meddlers, such as Russia, according to the report from the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center.\n\n\"Over the past several months, we have seen the emergence of significant influence activity by Iranian actors,\" the report states. \"Iranian cyber-enabled influence operations have been a consistent feature of at least the last three US election cycles. Iran's operations have been notable and distinguishable from Russian campaigns for appearing later in the election season and employing cyberattacks more geared toward election conduct than swaying voters.\"\n\nThe Iranian activity falls into two categories, Clint Watts, general manager of the Microsoft center, said in a blog post. \"They've laid the groundwork for influence campaigns on trending election-related topics and begun to activate these campaigns in an apparent effort to stir up controversy or sway voters - especially in swing states,\" he wrote, adding that \"they've launched operations that Microsoft assesses are designed to gain intelligence on political campaigns and help enable them to influence the elections in the future.\"\n\nOne fake news site Microsoft identified catered to liberal audiences and called Trump an \"opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop\" and a \"raving mad litigiosaur.\" Another claimed to be a source of conservative news, with a focus on gender reassignment and other LGBTQ issues. Both were the work of one Iranian group, Mcirosoft said.\n\nWatts wrote that another group \"may be setting itself up for activities that are even more extreme, including intimidation or inciting violence against political figures or groups, with the ultimate goals of inciting chaos, undermining authorities, and sowing doubt about election integrity. \"\n\nThe U.S. government has filed charges against Iranians over past alleged election interference.

Second, they've launched operations that Microsoft assesses are designed to gain intelligence on political campaigns and help enable them to influence the elections in the future.\"\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Intelligence Report said Iran is working online to target both U.S. left-leaning political audiences and conservatives.\n\nOne Iranian group is using covert so-called news sites like Nio Thinker to attack Donald Trump as an \"opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA China shop\" and Savannah Time that targets conservatives with LGBTQ+ issues and gender reassignment content, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe report added that Microsoft has found evidence that groups connected to Iran's government are using AI-enabled services to plagiarize content from U.S. publications.\n\nMicrosoft said these efforts seek to stoke discord, to carry out influence campaigns and stir controversy in battleground states while gathering intelligence on U.S. politics, and incite chaos and undermine authorities while sowing doubt about election integrity.\n\nAnother Iranian group, according to Microsoft, has been building the groundwork for influence operations targeting the United States since March \"that are even more extreme, including intimidation or inciting violence against political figures or groups.\"\n\nMicrosoft's report said a group connected with Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps sent out phishing emails in June to \"a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from the compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\"\n\nThe email had a link that would direct traffic through a domain controlled by the group before routing to the website of the provided link.\n\n\"Within days of this activity, the same group unsuccessfully attempted to log into an account belonging to a former presidential candidate,\" Microsoft said. \"We've since notified those targeted.\"\n\nMicrosoft said it is sharing the intelligence on these activities so American voters, candidates, political parties, government institutions and others can be aware of the influence campaigns targeting U.S. elections and the political system.\n\nPrior to the 2020 election, Microsoft's threat assessment team issued similar warnings about \"an Iran-based cybercrime faction\" it believed was working to interfere in the presidential election.\n\nAt that time targeted accounts were associated with a U.S. presidential campaign, journalists covering global politics and prominent Iranians living outside Iran.\n\nIn April a Microsoft report said artificial intelligence threats from China and North Korea were aimed at influencing U.S., South Korean and Indiana elections.\n\nAmong the Chinese malign efforts to influence U.S. elections, according to Microsoft, were AI deep fake videos, audio and false \"news reports\" that had AI-generated phony news anchors.\n\nMicrosoft's assessment of those efforts was that they were used to amplify controversial issues while posting false stories, but the impact in altering voter opinions was low.\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft warned China's \"increasing experimentation in augmenting memes, videos, and audio will continue-and may prove effective down the line.\"", "source": {"uri": "kentucky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexington Herald Leader"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_cunningham@kentucky.com",

While malicious actors had experimented with the technology, many had \"pivoted back\" to simpler things including the mis-characterisation of content, it said.\n\nRussian-backed groups, meanwhile, continued to push false information in the lead up to the election, including by promoting outlandish claims from \"nonexistent whistleblowers\", disinformation and false conspiracy theories, the

Neither site has gained much traction on social media, but that could change as the election draws nearer, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe report - compiled from open-source materials and Microsoft's vast supply of internal data - offers some of the clearest public examples yet of what US intelligence officials described last month as an ongoing covert social media campaign by Iran to undercut Trump's candidacy and to increase \"social discord\" in the US ahead of the November election.\n\nThe report also underscores how the number of foreign actors trying to sow divisions around US elections has continued to grow since the Kremlin's sweeping effort to influence the 2016 election.\n\nThe Iranians have \"laid the groundwork for influence campaigns on trending election-related topics and begun to activate these campaigns in an apparent effort to stir up controversy or sway voters - especially in swing states,\" Clint Watts, general manager of the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, said in a blog post.\n\nA hacking group linked with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in June also tried to break into the email account of a high-ranking official on a US presidential campaign, according to Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft said it notified the campaign of the hacking attempt, but declined to say publicly which campaign it was.\n\n\"Microsoft has not notified us of any campaign accounts having been targeted in this manner,\" an official with Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign told CNN. CNN has requested comment from the Trump campaign.\n\nRussian operatives, meanwhile, have since April, tried to \"drive headlines with fake scandals\" that falsely claim that the CIA told a Ukrainian troll farm to disrupt the upcoming US election, that the FBI wiretapped Trump's residence and that Ukrainian soldiers burned an effigy of Trump, according to Microsoft.\n\nChinese online personas have tried to use hundreds of thousands of online accounts to amplify outrage around the pro-Palestinian protests at US universities this spring, the Microsoft report said.\n\nThe Iranian, Russian and Chinese governments routinely deny allegations of election influence operations.\n\nIt is not unusual during US presidential campaigns for hackers associated with the Iranian, Russian and Chinese intelligence services to try to collect intelligence on campaign positions or personnel. In 2020, Microsoft warned that the same group of Iranian hackers was targeting Trump's reelection campaign, while Chinese hackers were targeting associates of Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nEfforts to undermine US election loom\n\nUS officials are bracing for a range for foreign intelligence services to try to influence or undermine confidence in the 2024 US elections by exploiting an already-fraught domestic environment in which many Americans believe lies about voter fraud.\n\nRussia \"remains the predominant threat to U.S. elections,\" the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in a recent assessment. US officials have also warned that Russian operatives and propagandists are planning to \"covertly use social media\" in an attempt to undermine support for Ukraine in swing states during the election.\n\nChina \"probably does not plan to influence the outcome\" of the US presidential election, but US intelligence is monitoring the possibility that China-linked propagandists and influence actors could \"denigrate down-ballot candidates,\" the ODNI assessment states.\n\nThe alleged Iranian threats to the Trump candidacy have not just been online.\n\nUS authorities obtained intelligence from a human source in recent weeks on a plot by Iran to try to assassinate Trump, a development that led to the Secret Service increasing security around the former president, CNN first reported on July 16. The Justice Department on August 6 announced charges against a Pakistani man with alleged ties to the Iranian government for allegedly seeking to carry out political assassinations.\n\nIran has denied the assassination plot allegations.\n\nAs president, Trump ordered the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, and he withdrew from a multilateral deal aimed at curbing Tehran's nuclear program. Iran has vowed revenge for Soleimani's death.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_lyngaas@cnn.com", "name": "Sean Lyngaas", "type": "author",

A report from the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center highlights evidence of Iranian cyber-influence operations which have already been running for months.\n\nSee also:\n\nMicrosoft says that numerous groups associated with the Iranian government have started the preliminary work in what is expected to be a long campaign of influencing the election. Swing states are key targets for trying to nudge voters' decisions.\n\nSome influence campaigns have already been running for months and there are fears that things could take a dangerous turn as the election draws ever closer. Microsoft warns that:\n\n[An] Iranian group has been setting the groundwork for US-focused influence operations since March. We believe this group may be setting itself up for activities that are even more extreme, including intimidation or inciting violence against political figures or groups, with the ultimate goals of inciting chaos, undermining authorities, and sowing doubt about election integrity.\n\nThe report from the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center says that these groups are using a variety of techniques, including using artificial intelligence to steal and repurpose online content.\n\nThe company says:\n\nOne Iranian group has been launching covert news sites targeting US voter groups on opposing ends of the political spectrum. One of the sites, called Nio Thinker, caters to left-leaning audiences and insults former president Donald Trump, calling him an \"opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop\" and a \"raving mad litigiosaur\". Another, called Savannah Time, claims to be a \"trusted source for conservative news in the vibrant city of Savannah\" and focuses on topics including LGBTQ+ issues and gender reassignment. The evidence we found suggests the sites are using AI-enabled services to plagiarize at least some of their content from US publications.\n\nBut this targeting of voters is not the only objective of the Iranian groups. There is also evidence of information gathering though spear-phishing campaigns which are looking to gain intelligence on political campaigns and thereby enable groups to influence not only the 2024 presidential election, but also future elections.\n\nThe threat intelligence report from Microsoft is entitled \"Iran steps into US election 2024 with cyber-enabled influence operations\", and it makes for sobering reading. It is available to read in its entirety here.\n\nMicrosoft says that it is sharing its finding \"so voters, government institutions, candidates, parties, and others can be aware of influence campaigns and protect themselves from threats\".

In recent weeks, groups linked to the Iranian government have stepped up two types of activity. First, they have laid the groundwork for influence campaigns on election-related news stories and begun activating those campaigns in an apparent effort to stir controversy or influence voters, particularly in swing states. Second, they have launched operations that Microsoft says are designed to gain intelligence on political campaigns and enable them to influence elections in the future.\n\nWe discuss this activity in a new report we released today, which details this activity and four examples illuminate what we can increasingly expect from Iran as we approach November.\n\nAn Iranian group has launched underground news sites targeting groups of American voters from opposing political groups. One site, called Nio Thinker, is aimed at a left-leaning audience and insults former President Donald Trump, calling him an opioid-addled bull in a MAGA china shop and a raving litigator. Another, called Savannah Time, claims to be a trusted source of conservative news in the vibrant city of Savannah and focuses on topics such as LGBTQ+ issues and gender reassignment. Evidence we found suggests that the sites are using AI-powered services to plagiarize at least some of their content from American publications.\n\nSince March, another Iranian group has been laying the groundwork for U.S.-led influence operations. We believe this group may engage in even more extreme activities, including intimidation or incitement to violence against political figures or groups, with the ultimate goal of causing chaos, undermining authorities, and casting doubt on the integrity of the elections.\n\nIn June, another Iranian group, this time linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), sent a spear phishing email to a senior presidential campaign official from the compromised email account of a former senior adviser. The email contained a link that redirected traffic to a domain controlled by the group before redirecting it to the website in the provided link. A few days after this activity, the same group unsuccessfully attempted to log into the account of a former presidential candidate. We have since notified the targeted individuals.\n\nA fourth Iranian group compromised the account of a county government employee in a key state. The compromise was part of a larger password spraying operation, and Microsoft Threat Intelligence did not observe that the actor gained additional access beyond the single account, making it difficult to discern the group's ultimate goals. Since early 2023, the group's operations have focused on strategic intelligence gathering, particularly in the satellite, defense, and healthcare sectors, with a focus on U.S. government organizations, often in key states.\n\nToday's Microsoft Threat Intelligence report comes from the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, or MTAC, which tracks influence operations by specific nation-state groups around the world. MTAC regularly tracks threats to elections as part of Microsoft's broader work on Democracy Forward and builds on the team's work tracking threats to recent elections in India, the United Kingdom, and France. Today's update also includes activity we've observed from actors advancing the geopolitical goals of Russia and China, each to varying degrees of effectiveness.\n\nWe share information like this so that voters, government institutions, candidates, parties, and others can be informed about influence campaigns and protect themselves from threats. We also trained candidates and parties involved in elections this year, building on our longstanding offerings, like AccountGuard. Finally, Microsoft will not endorse any candidate or political party. Our goal in publishing these reports is to highlight the importance of combating election deepfakes and to promote education and learning about potential foreign interference.\n\nKeywords: AI, Iran,

Some of their strategies include setting up fake news sites and targeting government employees and officials.\n\nIran's attempts to meddle in U.S. politics come on top of efforts by groups linked to Russia. But the two countries have notably different approaches, according to Clint Watts, the Center's general manager.\n\n\"Russia is very different. They're very focused on shaping the outcome of the election. Iran is focused as much on just breaking the ability of an election to occur,\" he said.\n\nMicrosoft's Threat Analysis Center tracks influence operations from foreign operatives, mainly from Russia, Iran and China, and their attempts to interfere with elections and political discourse.\n\nAccording to the Center, Iran has tried to sway American voters in at least the past three election cycles.\n\nIn 2021, the Justice Department charged two suspected Iranian hackers for allegedly sending threatening emails and spreading false information to voters ahead of the 2020 presidential race.\n\nMicrosoft researchers found that an Iranian group, Storm-2035, was behind four websites pretending to be American news outlets. The fake sites cater to both liberal and conservative audiences and amplify polarizing messaging on hot-button issues related to LGBTQ rights and the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nOne fake site, Nio Thinker, was created last year and has been pushing out \"sarcastic, long-winded articles insulting Trump,\" according to the report. Another faux news outlet, called Savannah Time, claimed to be a \"trusted source for conservative news in the vibrant city of Savannah.\"\n\n\"The reason they set those up is because if they do a hacking operation later, they want to have usually -- we believe -- places to drop out the hacked materials and narratives they want to advance,\" Watts said.\n\nResearchers also found evidence indicating that some of these fake sites used AI to rephrase or plagiarize content from actual news outlets.\n\nThis past June, Iranian hackers connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), compromised the email account of a former adviser to a U.S. presidential campaign in an attempt to contact a current senior official in that campaign, according to the Microsoft report. That email included a link that would have compromised other accounts.\n\n\"Within days of this activity, the same group unsuccessfully attempted to log into an account belonging to a former presidential candidate,\" the report said.\n\nEarlier in May, another group with links to the IRGC, breached the account of a county-level government employee in a swing state.

In recent weeks, groups connected with the Iranian government have upped two kinds of activity. First, they've laid the groundwork for influence campaigns on trending election-related topics and begun to activate these campaigns in an apparent effort to stir up controversy or sway voters - especially in swing states. Second, they've launched operations that Microsoft assesses are designed to gain intelligence on political campaigns and help enable them to influence the elections in the future.\n\nWe discuss this activity in a new report we released today, which details this activity, and four examples illuminate what we can increasingly expect from Iran as we near November.\n\nOne Iranian group has been launching covert news sites targeting US voter groups on opposing ends of the political spectrum. One of the sites, called Nio Thinker, caters to left-leaning audiences and insults former president Donald Trump, calling him an \"opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop\" and a \"raving mad litigiosaur.\" Another, called Savannah Time, claims to be a \"trusted source for conservative news in the vibrant city of Savannah\" and focuses on topics including LGBTQ+ issues and gender reassignment. The evidence we found suggests the sites are using AI-enabled services to plagiarize at least some of their content from US publications.\n\nA separate Iranian group has been setting the groundwork for US-focused influence operations since March. We believe this group may be setting itself up for activities that are even more extreme, including intimidation or inciting violence against political figures or groups, with the ultimate goals of inciting chaos, undermining authorities, and sowing doubt about election integrity.\n\nYet another Iranian group, this one connected with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from the compromised email account of a former senior advisor. The email contained a link that would direct traffic through a domain controlled by the group before routing to the website of the provided link. Within days of this activity, the same group unsuccessfully attempted to log into an account belonging to a former presidential candidate. We've since notified those targeted.\n\nA fourth Iranian group compromised an account of a county-level government employee in a swing state. The compromise was part of a broader password spray operation and Microsoft Threat Intelligence did not observe the actor gain additional access beyond the single account, making it hard to discern the group's ultimate objectives. Since early 2023, the group's operations have focused on strategic intelligence collection particularly in satellite, defense, and health sectors with some targeting of US government organizations, often in swing states.\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Intelligence Report we're releasing today is from the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, or MTAC, which tracks influence operations from specific nation-state groups around the world. MTAC routinely tracks threats to elections as part of Microsoft's broader Democracy Forward work and this builds on work the team did to track threats to recent elections in India, the UK, and France. Today's update also includes activity we have observed by actors advancing the geopolitical goals of Russia and China, each to varying degrees of effectiveness.\n\nWe share intelligence like this so voters, government institutions, candidates, parties, and others can be aware of influence campaigns and protect themselves from threats. We've also been training candidates and parties involved in elections this year, building on our longstanding offerings, like AccountGuard. Finally, Microsoft will not endorse a candidate or political party. Our goal in releasing these reports is to underscore the importance of combating election deepfakes and promoting education and learning about possible foreign interference.", "source": {"uri":

Noting that \"[O]ver the past several months, we have seen the emergence of significant influence activity by Iranian actors,\" the report, prepared the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, cited four examples of recent Iranian cyber-activity targeting U.S. voters.\n\nIn one case, an Iranian network known as Storm-2035 continues to operate \"four websites masquerading as news sites\" that are \"actively engaging US voter groups on opposing ends of the political spectrum with polarizing messaging on issues such as the US presidential candidates, LGBTQ rights, and the Israel-Hamas conflict,\" the report observed. It pointed out that one of the fraudulent sites created by the network, \"Nio Thinker,\" carries content that \"caters to liberal audiences,\" while another, \"Savannah News,\" purports to be a \"trusted source for conservative news.\" Microsoft researchers discovered \"evidence indicating the sites are using Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled services to plagiarize at least some of their content from US publications,\" frequently deploying search engine optimization tools and content generated by AI to drive traffic.\n\nIn a second case, a malign actor named \"Sefid Flood\" has been engaged \"in impersonating social and political activist groups in a target audience to stoke chaos, undermine trust in authorities, and sow doubt about election integrity.\" The report added that \"this group's operations may go as far as intimidation, doxing, or violent incitement targeting political figures or social/political groups.\" A third case from June involved \"Mint Sandstorm,\" a group operated by the intelligence unit of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which \"sent a spear-phishing email [a targeted attack aimed at obtaining sensitive or restricted information] to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\" The IRGC's intelligence unit was also central to the fourth example cited in the report, which involved compromising \"a user account with minimal access permissions at a county-level government in a swing state\" by a network going by the name \"Peach Sandstorm.\"\n\nThe report warned that \"looking forward ... Iranian actors will employ cyberattacks against institutions and candidates while simultaneously intensifying their efforts to amplify existing divisive issues within the US, like racial tensions, economic disparities, and gender-related issues.\"\n\n\"This recently exposed Iranian influence operation is not a 'spray and pray' campaign. It targets specific U.S. demographics and regions, including swing states. This demonstrates that Iran may be seeking to impact the outcome of the election rather than merely using contentious issues as a means to create a general sense of chaos in the United States.\" -- Max Lesser, Senior Analyst on Emerging Threats, Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation\n\n\"Iranian influence operations are proving themselves to be more tenacious, long-term, and impactful than previously thought. This exposed operation, the foundations of which were laid in 2020 and 2021, shows sophistication, operational planning, and patience. Despite the use of the same host, most of the network domains exhibit comparatively good operational security measures and don't have any obvious failings indicating Iranian involvement.\" -- Ari Ben Am, Adjunct Fellow, Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation\n\nResponding to a query from the Associated Press about the report, Iran's mission to the UN claimed that the Islamic Republic had been the target of \"numerous offensive cyber operations\" targeting its domestic infrastructure. The statement went on to insist that Iran's \"cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyberattacks. The U.S. presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\"\n\n\"Iranian Cyber Warfare Targeting Israel Seeks to Exploit Fears of Military Attack,\" FDD Flash Brief\n\n\"Iran Orchestrating Online Campaign Against Israeli Olympic Athletes,\" FDD Flash Brief\n\n\"Iran Obtains Advanced Cyber Warfare Capabilities from Russia,\" FDD Flash Brief", "source": {"uri": "fdd.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "FDD"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_berman@fdd.org", "name": "Zachary Berman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Conspiracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Conspiracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Zoroastrianism", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.fdd.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1486417529-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803375", "eventUri": "eng-9803375", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-09", "textStart": 114, "textEnd": 122}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later.\n\nIran has stepped up its efforts to interfere in the November election and amp up American polarization, including through hacking attempts and fake news sites aimed at the far left and far right, Microsoft researchers said Friday in a report.\n\nThe Iranian-built news networks include a site launched in October called Nio Thinker, which focused on the Israeli-Hamas war before it started to publish articles on the coming U.S. election. It takes a liberal slant, calling GOP nominee and former president Donald Trump an \"opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop,\" according to the report from Microsoft's Threat Analysis Center.\n\nA related site aimed at conservatives, Savannah Time, writes on Republican politics and LGBTQ issues. Some of the sites use artificial intelligence to plagiarize content from U.S. sites, the company said. The \"about us\" blurb on the site reads, \"We're opinionated, we're noisy, and we're having a good time.\"\n\n\"They've laid the groundwork for influence campaigns on trending election-related topics and begun to activate these campaigns in an apparent effort to stir up controversy or sway voters -- especially in swing states,\" Clint Watts, the Threat Center's general manager, wrote in a blog post accompanying the report. Since March, another Iran-linked group has been posting in the guise of political and social activists and could escalate to intimidation and incitement, he warned.\n\nMicrosoft said another group, run by Iran's Revolutionary Guard, compromised the email account of a former adviser to a U.S. presidential campaign and used that address in June to contact a senior official who was still engaged in the campaign. That email contained a link to a site that could have allowed Iran to intercept the target's other emails, Microsoft said. A spokesman for the company said it would not reveal whether the attack had succeeded.\n\nOne other Iranian group was able to compromise an account belonging to \"a county-level government employee in a swing state,\" Microsoft said, adding that its motive was unclear.\n\nIran involved itself in the 2020 election as well, and Microsoft said it expects the country's activity to escalate in the coming months. Last month, U.S. intelligence agencies told reporters they were seeing Iran use social media personas to sow discord and denigrate Trump.\n\nMicrosoft said it was also continuing to see Russian interference, including through Telegram and X accounts such as \"TEXASvsUSA,\" which uses racial dog whistles and calls for violence. One 30-second video made with AI, titled \"Hold the Line,\" depicted \"a horde of immigrant zombies amassing on the southern US border,\" the threat report said.\n\nThose accounts were created by the contract propagandists formerly associated with a Russian troll factory once indicted by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, according to the report, and echoed that outfit's past techniques in amplifying racial divides and echoing Trump.\n\nMicrosoft's blog noted that the company would not be endorsing any presidential candidate, drawing an implicit contrast with X owner and Trump backer Elon Musk, who has let propaganda flourish on his network.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType":

One website, Nio Thinker, bills itself as \"your go-to destination for insightful, progressive news and analysis that challenges the status quo\" and hosts articles that bash former President Donald Trump and hail Vice President Kamala Harris as \"our unexpected, awkward savior.\"\n\nAnother site identified by researchers, Savannah Time, poses as a voicey conservative local alt-weekly. \"We're opinionated, we're noisy, and we're having a good time,\" the about section of the site says. It hosts articles claiming to be written by \"the spokeswoman for the International League for Women's Rights,\" arguing for more modest Olympics beach volleyball bathing suits, next to articles lauding Iran's military might.\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Analysis Center noted the sites were likely using artificial intelligence tools to lift content from legitimate U.S. news publications and repackage articles in a way that hides the content's source.\n\nThe group behind the sites, according to Microsoft, is part of a larger Iranian operation, active since 2020, that operates more than a dozen other fake news sites targeting English-, French-, Spanish- and Arabic-speaking audiences. The campaign has not found significant success with a U.S. audience, and the sites' content has not been shared widely on social media, according to the researchers. But researchers say the sites could be used closer to the election.\n\nBeyond the effort to sow controversy and divide Americans before the vote, researchers said another group linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps targeted a \"high-ranking official on a presidential campaign\" in June with a spear-phishing email from a compromised email account of a former senior adviser and attempted to access an account belonging to \"a former presidential candidate.\" The report did not name the people who had been targeted.\n\nIran's United Nations mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment but denied the reports of meddling in a statement to The Associated Press: \"Iran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centers, and industries. Iran's cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks. The U.S. presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\"\n\nMicrosoft's report also noted continued activity by Russia, including an operation by a group researchers call Storm-1516, which produces propaganda videos in support of Trump and Russian interests and distributes them through a network of fake news websites connected to a former U.S. police officer. China-linked actors, the report said, had also pivoted increasingly to spreading propaganda via video and had leveraged a network of online accounts to stoke outrage around pro-Palestinian university protests.\n\nThe researchers reported an expectation that Iran, along with China and Russia, would intensify cyberattacks against candidates and institutions and increase efforts to divide Americans

political officials.\n\nFlashback: The same Iranian group also similarly targeted a presidential campaign in May and June 2020, five to six months before the last presidential election, according to the Microsoft report.\n\nThe big picture: Iran is starting to get more aggressive in its targeting of U.S. elections, alongside Russia and China.\n\nBetween the lines: Iran isn't only targeting federal government offices and political campaigns, according to Microsoft.\n\nThe bottom line: Early reports predict that the closer the U.S. gets to Election Day, the more foreign cyberattacks and

According to the tech-giant, one of the sites uncovered, \"Nio Thinker,\" is tailored for left-leaning voters.\n\nIt hosts articles that vehemently criticize former President Donald Trump, employing derogatory language such as calling him an \"opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop\" and a \"raving mad litigiosaur.\"\n\nThis type of inflammatory rhetoric is designed to further polarize the electorate and deepen existing divisions within the country.\n\nOn the other end of the political spectrum, another site named \"Savannah Time\" poses as a conservative news outlet, claiming to be a \"trusted source for conservative news in the vibrant city of Savannah.\"\n\nThis site focuses on hot-button issues like LGBTQ+ rights and gender reassignment, topics that are likely to provoke strong reactions from its target audience.\n\nAccording to Microsoft, the content on these sites is likely being generated using AI-enabled services, with some articles even plagiarizing from legitimate US publications, adding a veneer of credibility to their deceitful operations.\n\nIn the words of Microsoft, \"The evidence we found suggests the sites are using AI-enabled services to plagiarize at least some of their content from US publications.\" This underscores the level of sophistication behind these operations, as the Iranian groups are not just creating false content but are also stealing and repurposing genuine content to make their sites appear more legitimate.\n\nBeyond these influence campaigns, Microsoft has also identified other troubling activities by Iranian groups that suggest a broader strategy aimed at disrupting the US election process. One group has been laying the groundwork for operations that could escalate into more extreme actions, such as intimidation or inciting violence against political figures or groups. Microsoft's report warns that this group's ultimate goal may be \"inciting chaos, undermining authorities, and sowing doubt about election integrity.\"\n\nAnother alarming activity identified by the tech company involves a spear-phishing attempt linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). In June, a group associated with the IRGC sent a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official on a US presidential campaign. The email was sent from the compromised account of a former senior advisor and contained a malicious link that would route through a domain controlled by the attackers before reaching its intended destination.\n\nMicrosoft notes, \"Within days of this activity, the same group unsuccessfully attempted to log into an account belonging to a former presidential candidate.\"\n\nIn a separate incident, another Iranian group compromised the account of a county-level government employee in a swing state as part of a broader password spray operation. Although the group did not gain additional access beyond the single account, this activity is part of a larger pattern of Iranian operations focused on strategic intelligence collection, particularly in key sectors like satellite, defense, and health, often targeting US government organizations in swing states.\n\nMicrosoft's Threat Analysis Center, which tracks influence operations from nation-state groups around the world, has been closely monitoring these developments. Their report on Iran's activities is part of Microsoft's broader Democracy Forward initiative, which aims to protect democratic processes from foreign interference.\n\nAs the company stated, \"We share intelligence like this so voters, government institutions, candidates, parties, and others can be aware of influence campaigns and protect themselves from threats.\"\n\nTo counter these threats, Microsoft has been actively engaging with political candidates and parties, offering training and tools to help them safeguard their campaigns.\n\nThe company also emphasizes the importance of combating election-related deepfakes and misinformation, aiming to promote greater awareness and education among the public.\n\nAs the 2024 US presidential election draws nearer, the findings in Microsoft's report serve as a stark reminder of the ongoing threats to democracy. It is crucial for all stakeholders -- voters, government institutions, and political campaigns -- to remain vigilant and proactive in defending against these sophisticated influence operations.", "source": {"uri": "thecyberexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Cyber Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savannah,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Savannah, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news_website", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fake news website"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT rights in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intimidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://thecyberexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/Microsoft-fake-sites-US-election.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803375", "eventUri": "eng-9803375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Its efforts include stirring up controversy and swaying voters to increase \"social discord\" with just three months until the November election.\n\nOne of the fake news sites that Iranian operatives have created, called \"Nio Thinker,\" includes referring to Trump as an \"opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop\" and a \"raving mad litigious.\" Another, called \"Savannah Time,\" claims to be a \"trusted source for conservative news,\" which focuses on progressive LGBTQ policies and gender-affirming surgeries. The sites use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to plagiarize their content from real U.S. news sites.\n\nMicrosoft said it believes the Iranian group has been \"setting itself up for activities that are even more extreme, including intimidation or inciting violence against political figures or groups, with the ultimate goals of inciting chaos, undermining authorities, and sowing doubt about election integrity.\"\n\nYet another Iranian group, this one connected with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, sent a spear phishing email in June to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign from the compromised email account of a former senior advisor. The email contained a link that would direct traffic through a domain controlled by the group before routing to the website of the provided link. Within days of this activity, the same group unsuccessfully attempted to log into an account belonging to a former presidential candidate. We've since notified those targeted. A fourth Iranian group compromised an account of a county-level government employee in a swing state. The compromise was part of a broader password spray operation and Microsoft Threat Intelligence did not observe the actor gain additional access beyond the single account, making it hard to discern the group's ultimate objectives. Since early 2023, the group's operations have focused on strategic intelligence collection particularly in satellite, defense, and health sectors with some targeting of US government organizations, often in swing states.\n\nThis comes as the U.S. has warned Iran to refrain from launching a retaliatory attack against Israel as tensions heighten between the two regions.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, a U.S. official said there would be \"serious risk\" for Iran's economy and government if the terrorist country strikes back against Israel for the recent killing of a senior Hamas leader in Tehran. Iran has vowed to retaliate. However, it is unclear when they would carry out a strike.\n\nEarlier this week, Israel launched an airstrike in Lebanon, killing four Hezbollah fighters who have doled out attacks on Israel in the past weeks.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sarah_arnold@townhall.com", "name": "Sarah Arnold", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Iran denied the report.\n\nIran is stepping up its influence campaign aimed at the U.S., researchers at Microsoft said in a new report, adding to the ongoing efforts by Russia and China to sway American public opinion before the presidential election.\n\nResearchers identified websites that they attributed to the Iranian operation, aimed at voters on the political left and right. One website, Nio Thinker, bills itself as \"your go-to destination for insightful, progressive news and analysis that challenges the status quo\" and hosts articles that bash former President Donald Trump and hail Vice President Kamala Harris as \"our unexpected, awkward savior.\"\n\nAnother site identified by researchers, Savannah Time, poses as a voicey conservative local alt-weekly. \"We're opinionated, we're noisy, and we're having a good time,\" the about section of the site says. It hosts articles claiming to be written by \"the spokeswoman for the International League for Women's Rights,\" arguing for more modest Olympics beach volleyball bathing suits, next to articles lauding Iran's military might.\n\nThe Microsoft Threat Analysis Center noted the sites were likely using artificial intelligence tools to lift content from legitimate U.S. news publications and repackage articles in a way that hides the content's source.\n\nThe group behind the sites, according to Microsoft, is part of a larger Iranian operation, active since 2020, that operates more than a dozen other fake news sites targeting English-, French-, Spanish- and Arabic-speaking audiences. The campaign has not found significant success with a U.S. audience, and the sites' content has not been shared widely on social media, according to the researchers. But researchers say the sites could be used closer to the election.\n\nBeyond the effort to sow controversy and divide Americans before the vote, researchers said another group linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps targeted a \"high-ranking official on a presidential campaign\" in June with a spear-phishing email from a compromised email account of a former senior adviser and attempted to access an account belonging to \"a former presidential candidate.\" The report did not name the people who had been targeted.\n\nIran's United Nations mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment but denied the reports of meddling in a statement to The Associated Press: \"Iran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centers, and industries. Iran's cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces. Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks. The U.S. presidential election is an internal matter in which Iran does not interfere.\"\n\nMicrosoft's report also noted continued activity by Russia, including an operation by a group researchers call Storm-1516, which produces propaganda videos in support of Trump and Russian interests and distributes them through a network of fake news websites connected to a former U.S. police officer. China-linked actors, the report said, had also pivoted increasingly to spreading propaganda via video and had leveraged a network of online accounts to stoke outrage around pro-Palestinian university protests.\n\nThe researchers reported an expectation that Iran, along with China and Russia, would intensify cyberattacks against candidates and institutions and increase efforts to divide Americans

The specific identities of the targets were not disclosed in the report.\n\nIn addition to these direct cyberattacks, Iranian groups have been using artificial intelligence to create and spread online content designed to inflame political tensions. This includes derogatory posts about former President Donald Trump and incendiary commentary on contentious issues like gender reassignment surgery.\n\nMicrosoft's Threat Analysis Center also reported that since March, these Iranian groups have been gearing up to launch influence operations aimed at undermining trust in the US electoral process. These operations have involved the creation of fake media outlets and the dissemination of polarizing messages on topics such as presidential candidates and Israel's conflict with Hamas.\n\nThe revelations from Microsoft are part of a broader pattern of foreign interference in US elections, with similar efforts being noted from Russia and China. In July, US intelligence officials warned that these countries, along with Iran, were enlisting individuals within the United States to propagate propaganda. The Iranian government, however, has denied any involvement in these activities.\n\nThis is not the first time Iranian hackers have targeted US elections. In 2020, operatives posed as members of the right-wing group Proud Boys in a voter intimidation scheme, leading to charges against two individuals.\n\nThat same year, Iranian hackers also breached a US municipal government's election results website, although they were apprehended before they could cause any harm. The persistence of such threats highlights the ongoing risks posed by state-sponsored hacking groups to the integrity of US political processes.\n\nIn a related development, the US State Department

The report provides examples of actions allegedly taken by Iranian groups and offers insights that go beyond what U.S. intelligence has publicly disclosed. Meanwhile, Iran's U.N. mission has denied any plans to interfere or launch cyberattacks in the upcoming U.S. presidential election.\n\nTensions between the U.S. and Iran have been heightened in recent months amid Israel's ongoing war with Hamas militants in Gaza. The U.S. has shown continued support for Israel while Iran has vowed to get revenge against Israel because they are believed to be behind the assassination of Hamas Political Bureau chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.\n\nThe U.S. has also experienced ongoing tensions with Russia due primarily to its ongoing invasion of Ukraine, as well as with China.\n\n\"MTAC has observed three Russian influence actors involved in campaigns aimed at the 2024 presidential election. MTAC tracks these as (1) Ruza Flood (a.k.a. Doppelganger2 ), (2) Storm1516, and (3) Storm-1841 (a.k.a. Rybar). Each has produced election influence campaigns to varying degrees of effectiveness,\" the MTAC report said. \"Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-linked influence actors continue to engage US audiences on divisive political issues, expanding to new platforms and evolving their tactics to engage new audience spaces ahead of November.\"\n\nThe MTAC report did not specifically state Iran's intentions in spreading misinformation throughout the U.S., however, they have previously expressed distaste for former President Donald Trump.\n\nA report from CNN last month detailed how U.S. intelligence officials uncovered an alleged assassination plot against Trump by Iran after they criticized the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a 2020 strike ordered by Trump.\n\nThe MTAC report provides numerous examples relating to how Iran has attempted to spread fake news throughout the U.S., including a June incident where Mint Sandstorm, a group run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) intelligence unit, \"sent a spear-phishing email to a high-ranking official of a presidential campaign from a compromised email account of a former senior advisor.\"\n\nIn a statement sent to the Associated Press (AP), the Iranian Mission to the United Nations said, \"Iran has been the victim of numerous offensive cyber operations targeting its infrastructure, public service centers, and industries. Iran's cyber capabilities are defensive and proportionate to the threats it faces.\"\n\n\"Iran has neither the intention nor plans to launch cyber attacks.

The research was carried out by its MTAC, or Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, unit. MTAC focuses on tracking online influence operations run by state-backed actors.\n\nThe cyber campaigns detailed in the report are run by four Iranian groups. Two of the groups focus on stirring controversy and swaying U.S. voters. The other two, in turn, are seeking to collect intelligence about political campaigns with the goal of influencing the elections.\n\nThe first group uncovered by Microsoft's MTAC unit created a set of fake news websites focused on political topics. One of the websites, called Nio Thinker, targeted left-leaning voters. Another website called the Savannah Time positioned itself as the \"trusted source for conservative news in the vibrant city of Savannah.\" Microsoft's researchers determined that the websites included content plagiarized from U.S. publications using artificial intelligence.\n\nMTAC also identified a second Iranian group focused on carrying out influence operations. \"We believe this group may be setting itself up for activities that are even more extreme, including intimidation or inciting violence against political figures or groups, with the ultimate goals of inciting chaos, undermining authorities, and sowing doubt about election integrity,\" Microsoft's researchers detailed. The company believes that the group has been been laying the groundwork for this influence campaign since March.\n\nThe two other Iranian cyber groups detailed in today's report have a different goal: collecting intelligence about U.S. political campaigns.\n\nOne of those groups recently sent a spear phishing email to a high-ranking official on a presidential campaign. According to MTAC, the message was sent from the compromised email account of a former senior advisor. The message contained a website link that rerouted the user's traffic through a domain controlled by the hackers.\n\nThe second intelligence gathering group identified by Microsoft compromised an \"account of a county-level government employee in a swing state.\" The company didn't specify the service in which the compromised account was created.

Recent activity suggests the Iranian regime - along with the Kremlin - may be equally engaged in election 2024.\"\n\nMultiple state-sponsored groups and those whose affiliations are unknown are thought to be involved, each with their own objectives and methods. The group Microsoft tracks as Sefid Flood, for example, has been laying the groundwork for influence operations since March 2024.\n\nMicrosoft didn't go into detail about what this staging activity entailed, but Sefid Flood is known for impersonating social and political activist groups with a view to undermining trust in officials and election systems themselves.\n\nIt's perhaps why the US has been so adamant recently that its elections are safer than they've ever been. CISA director Jen Easterly spoke on the topic at Black Hat this week, saying the infrastructure is sound, but influence operations, namely from Russia, are a concern due to their improving sophistication.\n\nSefid Flood may look to use its impersonations as a means to \"stoke chaos\", Microsoft said, and its operations \"may go as far as intimidation, doxxing, or violent incitement targeting political figures or social/political groups.\"\n\nOn the state-sponsored side of things, Mint Sandstorm and Peach Sandstorm are both run by Iranian intelligence, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). As recently as June 2024, Mint Sandstorm was caught trying to spear-phish a presidential campaign official using a former senior advisor's account the group compromised. The email contained a link that could have allowed the IRGC to intercept the official's traffic.\n\nJust days before, on June 13, Mint Sandstorm also tried - and failed - to access the account of a former presidential candidate. While there's no definitive proof this activity was election-related, the timing of it being so close to the targeting of the aforementioned official suggests it might be.\n\nThe group is also known for targeting political figures for reasons other than elections - it has been doing so for years - so no firm conclusions can be drawn officially.\n\nA month earlier in May, its IRGC cousin, Peach Sandstorm, embarked on a wide password spraying mission that helped it gain access to a user account at a county-level government in a US swing state. It didn't actually do a great deal with that access so it may not have been election-related and instead more of a dumb-luck result, but Microsoft noted the county, located in a known swing state, had recently experienced a \"race-related controversy\" that made national news.\n\nThe description is too broad and racism too rife in the US to even draw any kind of conclusions here - it could have been in one of multiple possible states as many fit that description.\n\nIt was part of Russia's recent attempts to influence the Paris Olympics and Iran has also been observed setting up phony news outlets in an apparent attempt to engage voters on each side of the political divide.\n\nOne site has been online and active since 2022, \"covering\" the US mid-terms. EvenPolitics publishes around 10 articles a week and is run by Storm-2035, which also has various other sites set up to influence audiences in Arabic, English, French, and Spanish languages. Microsoft names groups \"Storm-X\" when they're under active development.\n\nNio Thinker was created in October 2023 to cover the Israel-Hamas conflict, but recently shifted to target left-leaning US voters with sarcastic, anti-Trump tirades. It does have some real zingers to be fair, calling the Republican candidate/felon an \"opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop\" and a \"raving mad litigiosaur.\"\n\nSavannah Time, on the other hand, seeks out conservative audiences with pieces on Republican politics and topics such as gender-based issues.\n\n\"Microsoft Threat Analysis Center has not observed significant social media amplification of these sites as of yet, though it is possible they will begin closer to election day,\" the report [PDF] reads.\n\nThe frequency with which the sites are updated suggests that the pro-Iran actors are dedicating a decent amount of resources to the endeavor, although AI is helping them out a smidge.\n\n\"Examination of webpage source code and indicators in the articles themselves suggest the sites' operators are likely using SEO plugins and other generative AI-based tools to create article titles, keywords, and to automatically rephrase stolen content in a way that drives search engine traffic to their sites while obfuscating the content's original source,\" Microsoft said. \u00ae", "source": {"uri": "theregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theregister.com"},

The former candidate has been notified.\n\n\"Looking forward, we expect Iranian actors will employ cyberattacks against institutions and candidates while simultaneously intensifying their efforts to amplify existing divisive issues within the U.S., like racial tensions, economic disparities, and gender-related issues,\" the report said.\n\nAnother Iranian group, Storm-2035, has set up four fake partisan news websites posing as legitimate designed to inflame tensions. One site the group set up, called Nio Thinkers, is designed to look like a left-wing news site. It insulted former President Donald Trump, calling him an \"opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop\" and a \"raving mad litigiosaur.\"\n\nThe Savannah Times, another site they prop up, claims to be a \"trusted source for conservative news in the vibrant city of Savannah.\" It focuses on conservative perspectives on cultural topics, including LGBTQ and trans rights.\n\nMicrosoft said these sites likely use AI-enabled services to plagiarize the articles on them from actual U.S. publications.\n\nAnother group, Sefid Flood, specializes in impersonating activists to stoke chaos, and its efforts may go as far as to try to incite violence against political figures. In May, a different group with links to the IRGC, known as Peach Sandstorm, compromised a county-level official's account as a part of a broader password accumulation operation from the group.\n\nTehran is \"primarily focused on fueling distrust in the U.S. political institutions and increasing social discord,\" an official with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told reporters in late July, though it is also working to avoid a second Trump administration.\n\n\"Since our last update, the IC has observed Tehran working with the presidential election, probably because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive with increased tensions with the United States. Iran's preference is focused on this core interest,\" the ODNI official said.\n\nThe official would not directly affirm that Tehran was working against Trump, instead saying it is operating in the same way it did ahead of the 2020 election. The ODNI revealed back in 2021 that Tehran carried out a multi-pronged covert influence campaign intended to undercut Trump's reelection.\n\nMicrosoft's report also details some Russian interference efforts designed to inflame tension in the U.S. but also to its own benefit in Ukraine. One group, Storm-1516, pushes disinformation via fake news sites as well, and since April, it has pushed false narratives that the CIA directed a Ukrainian troll farm to disrupt the election, that Ukrainian soldiers burned an effigy of Trump, and that the FBI wiretapped Trump's residence.\n\nIranian officials have also publicly vowed to avenge the assassination of Gen. Qasem Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. strike in Iraq in January 2020, by going after the U.S. officials involved in that strike.\n\nMost recently, earlier this week, a Pakistani man with connections to the IRGC was arrested after attempting to hire hitmen, really undercover agents, to carry out the assassination of unnamed government officials.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nSeveral former officials involved in the strike still have government-provided protection, while other lower-level officials do not.\n\nIn 2022, the Department of Justice unsealed charges accusing Shahram Poursafi, an Iranian national and IRGC member, of attempting to arrange the murder of former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who was in that role when the Soleimani strike took place. Poursafi was accused of agreeing to pay an informant $300,000 to kill him, and the Iranian noted he had an additional \"job\" for the individual, which he'd pay a million dollars for the source to

In one instance, the website \"Nio Thinker\" is targeting progressives with content, news, and opinion articles written by \"NioThinker Staff.\" One article called Donald Trump an \"opioid-pilled elephant in the MAGA china shop.\" Another website, \"Savannah Time,\" is also being run by an Iranian backed group, this time posing as a conservative news and opinion page.\n\nThe FBI spoke out about the potential for the activity multiple times already this year to Congress and at speaking engagements.\n\n\"This election cycle the US will face more adversaries moving at a faster pace and enabled by new technology,\" warned F.B.I. Director Christopher Wray in a speech to the Intelligence and National Security Alliance in February.\n\nRob Pritchard, founder of \"The Cyber Security Expert,\" says because they're targeting both Republicans and Democrats, then overall confusion might be the goal.\n\nIt feels more like they probably have the order to interfere, and perhaps it's not particularly thought out about what that should look like or what the end goal is,\" he said.\n\nMicrosoft's researchers said Iran, along with other sites and accounts run by China and Russia, appear to be aided by artificial intelligence to produce and distribute their content.\n\nIt's not just fake news, Microsoft's report says in June, a group run by the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps targeted an official on a Presidential campaign with a spear phishing email and tried to login to a former Presidential candidate's account.

Earlier this year, it said that state actors from China were creating fake news for this type of activity.\n\nThis week, the MTAC posted another report, this time on alleged efforts from Iran-based actors to make fake news about the upcoming election. In a blog post, Microsoft stated that these groups, with ties to the Iranian government, have been increasing these types of efforts in recent weeks:\n\nFirst, they've laid the groundwork for influence campaigns on trending election-related topics and begun to activate these campaigns in an apparent effort to stir up controversy or sway voters - especially in swing states. Second, they've launched operations that Microsoft assesses are designed to gain intelligence on political campaigns and help enable them to influence the elections in the future.\n\nThe report itself (in PDF format) goes into more detail on these activities. The Iran-based actors have been posting fake news sites that target both conservative and liberal political audiences. There's also evidence that these state-sponsored efforts have used AI \"to plagiarize at least some of their content from US publications.\"\n\nOther efforts that have been detected by the MTAC by these Iran-based actors include attempts to log into an email account that belongs to an unnamed former US presidential candidate, and ways to try to incite violence against political figures or groups.\n\nThe report also mentions continued efforts by state-sponsored actors from Russia and China to influence the 2024 elections. One Russia-based group, Storm-1516, is particularly active. Microsoft says they have been making fake news videos that try to create false scandals about the election and they expect this group to continue this kind of activity until the elections in November.", "source": {"uri": "neowin.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Neowin"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_callaham@neowin.net", "name": "John Callaham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fake_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fake news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PDF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Anti-Corporation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2020/04/1585909455_microsoft_3_story.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803375", "eventUri": "eng-9803375", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

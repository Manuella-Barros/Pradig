I snagged a bottle and was gobsmacked at how much softer my hair was \u2014 this stuff truly does what it says it will do. Seriously. I spent the whole day touching my hair, and even my boyfriend agreed that my mane was noticeably silkier. Olaplex was my go-to before I tried K18 and I still stand by it as a product, but I really love that K18 is a leave-in treatment rather than an in-shower mask. Having to let the Olaplex sit for 10 minutes felt like forever, especially when I wasn't taking an everything shower (you know, the ones where you exfoliate and shave). With K18, you let it sit in your hair for four minutes post-shower to activate, and then you can style your hair (or just let it air dry as I do). I've found that my hair is softest the next day, so don't be discouraged if your hair looks or feels the same the day you use it. One last thing: it is pretty pricey, but a little goes a long way. The 50 mL tube lasts a few months, and eventually, K18 can become a maintenance product, so you won't need to use it every time you wash your hair. Promising review: \"I am extremely pleased with this product. As an African-American woman in her 60s, healthy hair is important. After one four-minute process, I could immediately see and feel the difference.\" \u2014influencer2021 Get it from Amazon and Sephora for $29+ (available in two sizes).", "summary": "<h1>*Pushes my way to the front of the line to get my hands on some ceiling fan filters and the beloved Grampa's Weeder*</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-05/20/20/enhanced/1eadf27c57cd/original-892-1716235824-3.jpg?crop=1244:829;0,0\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/melanie_aman/products-so-great-reviewers-ok-me-next\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/melanie_aman/products-so-great-reviewers-ok-me-next", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-05/22/18/campaign_images/ff4a00b690e6/31-products-with-reviews-so-great-youll-say-ok-me-3-1648-1716402098-0_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:01:03", "author": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about,Melanie Aman", "authors": ["https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "Melanie Aman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.073}

He also gave a shout-out to his Ryder Cup teammate, Rory McIlroy, who finished second.\n\n\"I'm feeling good,\" Rahm said during a media session at the LIV Golf Nasville tournament, which begins Friday. \"The main reason for the withdrawal from the two events was the infection I had and just to be precautionary towards not making it worse and seeing what steps I can take to prevent that from happening in the future.\n\n\"The wound is still there. I'm not going to show any graphic pictures, but it's still there. It's manageable now. I'm not going to really make it worse. A lot of things to follow up from what happened to make sure it heals properly and it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nAsked if he was ready to compete, Rahm said: \"I feel ready to walk and hit it. I haven't been able to do much. It doesn't take much for me to feel ready to compete. Looking forward to it. Just happy that I'm here.\"\n\nRahm has not won since his Masters victory last year and although he has been in the top-10 in the seven LIV Golf events in which he has played, he has been unable to break through. The Legion XIII team he captains has won twice.\n\nAt the majors, Rahm tied for 45th at the Masters and missed the cut at the PGA Championship. He'll be returning to his native Spain for LIV Golf's Andalucia event the week prior to the British Open.\n\nWhile happy for his fellow LIV golfer DeChambeau, Rahm also noted that difficulty in seeing Rory McIlroy miss the short putts on the 16th and 18th hole that cost him a chance at victory.\n\nAnd he went into detail about the putt on 18th from just under 4 feet and how it was described on the broadcast.\n\n\"One of the things that absolutely burned me, and I think it was (NBC's) Smylie (Kaufman) who said it, he severely underplayed how difficult Rory's putt on 18 was,\" Rahm said. \"When he said it's a left-center putt, if you hit that putt left-center and miss the hole, you're off the green because of how much slope there is.\n\n\"You could see Rory aiming at least a cup left from 3 feet.

Severely.\n\n\"I think that can happen a few times where unless you've been there on the golf course and you're playing it or you've played it, it's hard to truly explain how difficult the golf course can be, and a lot of times they only have those five seconds to say something quickly, so I also don't blame them.\"", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andalusia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andalusia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Miniature_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Miniature Golf", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5472,h_3078,x_0,y_89/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j0rp7cxm4cfb93d8rz.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665731", "eventUri": "eng-9665731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Since then, he has added a Masters win to his resume and remains one of the best golfers in the world.\n\nLast week, however, Rahm's view was a bit different. An injury forced him to withdraw, leaving him on the couch watching coverage of the third men's major championship of the year.\n\n\"I thought it was quite a show from the comfort of my home,\" Rahm said Wednesday in his pre-tournament press conference ahead of LIV Golf Nashville. \"It's a very enjoyable tournament to watch.

But on Sunday, just like you, he was watching on TV.\n\nRahm said he had a lesion between his fourth and pinkie toes that became infected during LIV Golf's Houston event the weekend before the U.S. Open. He withdrew from the tournament but showed up at Pinehurst No. 2 hopeful to play. He spoke with the media on Monday, but on Tuesday, he withdrew.\n\n\"After consulting with numerous doctors and my team, I have decided it is best for my long term health, to withdraw from this weeks US Open Championship,\" Rahm wrote on X. \"To say I'm disappointed is a massive understatement!\"\n\nSo back to Sunday. When Bryson DeChambeau and Rory McIlroy were battling down the stretch, Rahm was watching on TV. So, what did he think of being a fan?\n\nFor starters, he said he usually watches broadcasts on mute. But he also echoed a common frustration many golf fans share -- it's sometimes extremely difficult to find out where to watch the action, with tournament rounds going from one network to the other and with streaming options -- which are sometimes the only option -- in between.\n\n\"To go from ABC to NBC to Peacock, then back to the next thing, yeah, they should make it a little bit easier,\" he said, speaking at this week's LIV Golf event in Nashville, which Rahm plans to play. \"It is an Open after all. Just turn on one channel and hopefully be able to watch the whole broadcast.\"\n\nRahm's biggest critique, though, came on Rory McIlroy's decisive par miss on the 72nd hole. Tied with DeChambeau at the time, McIlroy had a par putt of 3 feet, 9 inches on the 18th hole on Sunday. It was above the hole -- never where you want to be on the speedy greens of Pinehurst No. 2 -- and McIlroy missed. He didn't play enough break and hit it too softly, as the ball caught the right edge and lipped out. He made bogey. In the pairing behind, DeChambeau made par and won.\n\n\"I thought from the times I had it on and I could hear, I thought [the broadcast] was OK,\" Rahm said. \"One of the things that absolutely burned me, and I think it was Smylie [Kaufman] who said it, he severely underplayed how difficult Rory's putt on 18 was. When he said it's a left-center putt, if you hit that putt left-center and miss the hole, you're off the green because of how much slope there is. You could see Rory aiming at least a cup left from three feet. They severely underplayed how difficult that putt was. Severely.\n\n\"I think that can happen a few times where unless you've been there on the golf course and you're playing it or you've played it, it's hard to truly explain how difficult the golf course can be,\" he continued. \"A lot of times they only have those five seconds to say something quickly, so I also don't blame them. But besides that, I thought it was good.\"\n\nWhat Rahm was referring to was when Kaufman, the on-course reporter, said seconds before McIlroy struck the putt: \"I got behind it, took a read. Not outside the hole. It's a left-center putt, but you can make it if you start it right in the middle too.\"\n\nAlthough analyst Brandel Chamblee never made it sound so easy.\n\n\"Four feet, down the hill, breaking to the right,\" he said, after McIlroy chipped up to the spot. \"That's not exactly the 4-footer you want. It got above the hole.\"\n\nAs for Rahm's prospects this week, he says he hasn't been able to do much, but that he feels ready.\n\n\"I'm feeling good,\" he said. \"I'm feeling good. The main reason for the withdrawal the two events was the infection I had and just to be precautionary towards not making it worse and seeing what steps I can take to prevent that from happening in the future. The wound is still there. I'm not going to show any graphic pictures, but it's still there. It's manageable now. I'm not going to really make it worse.

When he said it's a left-center putt, if you hit that putt left-center and miss the hole, you're off the green because of how much slope there is.\n\n\"You could see Rory aiming at least a cup left from three feet.

Afterwards, DeChambeau described it as the \"best shot of my life\" and Rahm was in full agreement.\n\nHe said: \"If it's not the best up-and-down to win a Major ever made, it's got to be top 3, maybe up there with Tom Watson's chip-in at Pebble on 16, Phil's up-and-down at Baltusrol on 18. There's obviously going to be a few others like Tiger's chip-in at Augusta. But on 18, having to do it to actually win the tournament has got to be one of the best.\"\n\nWhile a troublesome cut between Rahm's toes put paid to his chances of creating his own unforgettable moments in the tournament, he's hopeful that the worst of it is behind him after it initially saw him cut short his appearance at LIV Golf Houston a week earlier.\n\n\"I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good,\" remarked Rahm. \"The main reason for the withdrawal at the two events was the infection I had and just to be precautionary towards not making it worse and seeing what steps I can take to prevent that from happening in the future.\n\n\"The wound is still there.

Although many expected the Spaniard to appear on the big stage and achieve success, Rahm had to withdraw. However, this did not mean that Jon Rahm did not watch the competition at all. He followed the tournament from home from the first day, having his favorites and enjoying the performances of his colleagues.\n\nThe 29-year-old Spaniard, in a media interview, reflected on another edition of the US Open, where his fellow player from LIV Golf, Bryson DeChambeau, clinched victory. The luck factor was missing for Rory McIlroy, who failed to capitalize on his chances and win the competition.\n\nA particularly interesting moment was when a Northern Irishman missed a short putt on the 18th, which ultimately decided the outcome. Rahm commented on that moment, somewhat frustrated with the TV coverage and individual comments that underestimated how tough a job Rory McIlroy had. Rahm, as a golfer with many tournaments behind him, revealed that it wasn't such an easy task for McIlroy.\n\n\"One of the things that absolutely burned me, and I think it was Smylie who said it, he severely underplayed how difficult Rory's putt on 18 was. When he said it's a left-center putt, if you hit that putt left-center and miss the hole, you're off the green because of how much slope there is.\"- Jon Rahm said, as quoted by Golf Monthly.\n\nThe Spaniard emphasized that anyone who has played golf on a golf course knows that executing such a shot is challenging and\n\ndoesn't look as easy as it seems on TV. However, Rahm is aware of the job that TV reporters have and that they must provide certain commentary.\n\n\"You could see Rory aiming at least a cup left from three feet. They severely underplayed how difficult that putt was. Severely.\n\nI think that can happen a few times where unless you've been there on the golf course and you're playing it or you've played it, it's hard to truly explain how difficult the golf course can be, and a lot of times they only have those five seconds to say something quickly, so I also don't blame them.\"- he continued.\n\nDespite McIlroy missing a putt, much of the outcome rested on DeChambeau's shoulders as he had to do something outstanding to claim the title. Bryson's phenomenal bunker shot ultimately decided who would take the crown. Bryson highlighted that he was thrilled with himself, emphasizing that it was the best shot of his career. Jon Rahm also shared a similar opinion, considering that DeChambeau did an excellent job. To be under pressure, just a few steps away from the title, and make such a move is truly impressive.\n\n\"If it's not the best up-and-down to win a Major ever made, it's got to be top 3, maybe up there with Tom Watson's chip-in at Pebble on 16, Phil's up-and-down at Baltusrol on 18. There's obviously going to be a few others like Tiger's chip-in at Augusta. But on 18, having to do it to actually win the tournament has got to be one of the best.\"- Jon Rahm said.\n\nJon Rahm is currently recovering from an injury, and it seems he will soon return to the golf course. The Spaniard admitted to having fears about infection, causing him to take preventive action to avoid things getting worse. In any case, it's better to miss a couple of tournaments and come back in proper form than to create a bigger problem for himself and miss a larger part of the season. Rahm thought carefully, trying to minimize the consequences.\n\nThe 29-year-old confirmed that the wound is still there but that he is coping with the pain. His primary focus is on resting, waiting for the wound to heal properly, and returning to the sport he loves most. Soon, a new challenge will follow for Jon Rahm, who does not want to put huge pressure on himself. The Spaniard is one of the most attractive and best golfers in the world. The previous season was the best proof of that. Since joining LIV Golf, he hasn't particularly impressed, but we have no doubt that Rahm will show his best in the coming period.\n\nIt will be interesting to see what will happen between LIV Golf and the PGA Tour and whether both Tours will reach a final agreement. It will be important for both sides to be open to negotiations and make a decision that is best for the fans of this sport.", "source": {"uri": "tennisworldusa.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tennis World USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sead_dedovic@tennisworldusa.org", "name": "Sead Dedovic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltusrol_Golf_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltusrol Golf Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Watson_(golfer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Watson (golfer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta,_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Augusta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.tennisworldusa.org/world/media/image148794.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665731", "eventUri": "eng-9665731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

An injury forced him to withdraw, leaving him on the couch watching coverage of the third major men's championship of the year.\n\n\"I thought it was quite a spectacle in the comfort of my home,\" Rahm said Wednesday during his pre-tournament press conference ahead of LIV Golf Nashville. \"It's a very enjoyable tournament to watch.

Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\n\nLIV golfer Bryson DeChambeau won his second major title and second U.S. Open with an up-and-down clutch on the final hole. McIlroy, who led by two with five holes to play, made bogeys on three of his last four holes, including the 18th. Many people said McIlroy missed his best chance to win a major since 2014.\n\nRahm doesn't see it that way. Although he watched much of the broadcast on mute, Rahm said he thought the announcers underestimated the degree of difficulty of McIlroy's putt on the final hole.\n\n\"One of the things that absolutely burned me, and I think it was Smylie (Kaufman) who said it, he seriously underestimated the difficulty of Rory's putt on 18,\" Rahm said. \"When he said it was a left-center putt, if you hit that left-center putt and miss the hole, you go off the green because of the slope there is. You could see Rory aiming for at least a cup left from three feet away. They seriously underestimated the difficulty of this putt.

I'm not going to show any graphic images, but it's still there. It's manageable now. I'm not really going to make things worse.

For him to miss that putt, I'd never wish it on anybody. It just happened to play out that way.\"\n\nRahm, meanwhile, will be back in action with his Legion XIII team at The Grove in Nashville.\n\n\"I'm feeling good,\" said the 2023 Masters champion. \"The main reason for the withdrawal from the two events was the infection I had and just to be precautionary towards not making it worse and seeing what steps I can take to prevent that from happening in the future.\n\n\"The wound is still there.

Yet, a trio of bogeys towards the end dashed his hopes, with critical short putts on the 16th and 18th proving costly.\n\nThe initial miss occurred on the 16th green, marking the first time this season McIlroy didn't sink a putt from within three feet after successfully making 496 in a row from that range.\n\nREAD MORE: Tiger Woods theory raised as Team USA still yet to name next Ryder Cup captain\n\nREAD MORE: Rory McIlroy has welcome comfort awaiting him when he returns from golf hiatus\n\nDespite the setback, McIlroy had a shot at redemption and a playoff with DeChambeau after a deft chip, but once more, his putter betrayed him as another short attempt veered off course. It was a tough blow for McIlroy, who had otherwise shown stellar form with the putter all week.\n\nWhile some have been quick to criticise McIlroy's final flub, LIV Golf's Rahm insists that the left-to-right break and the slickness of the greens made the putt far trickier than it appeared. \"One of the things that absolutely burned me,\" Rahm remarked while gearing up for his comeback at LIV Nashville this week.\n\n\"I think it was Smylie [Kaufman] who said it, he severely underplayed how difficult Rory's putt on 18 was.

Paige Spiranac shows her teeth defending one of her best golf friends from malicious comments\n\nRory McIlroy experienced one of the worst moments of his career on Sunday at the US Open when he missed a seemingly easy shot on the final hole, losing the title by a single stroke. The criticism was immediate, but the Irishman received an unexpected defense from one of his biggest rivals, Spanish golfer Jon Rahm.\n\nMcIlroy performed exceptionally at the US Open. With the exception of the second round, where he finished with 72 strokes, he played the rest of the tournament at par. The Irishman still led the tournament by two strokes after the first 13 holes of the final round and reached the final flag one stroke ahead of his closest pursuer, Bryson DeChambeau.\n\nOn the final hole, a par 5, McIlroy left the ball about four feet from the hole. He just needed to hole out to make the birdie and secure the title. However, the pressure and the terrain got the better of McIlroy, who missed the shot, leaving the door open for DeChambeau to win the crown.\n\nControversy has surrounded McIlroy ever since, with analysts scrutinizing the fateful shot from all angles. Many do not understand how a shot that seemed safe missed. For them, Rahm provided a detailed explanation that clarifies the dilemma that even some analysts couldn't grasp and that McIlroy had to solve on the fly.\n\n\"When he said it's a left-center putt, if you hit that putt left-center and miss the hole, you're off the green because of how much slope there is,\" detailed the Spaniard. \"You could see Rory aiming at least a cup left from three feet. They severely underplayed how difficult that putt was. Severely.\"\n\nRahm argued that unless you've played that course, No. 2 at Pinehurst Resort & Country Club, you can't evaluate how difficult it is. However, he did not entirely blame the commentators either, as he understood that \"they only have those five seconds to say something quickly, so I also don't blame them.\"\n\nRegarding his health, the Spaniard said he was ready to play in Nashville. He explained that the infection he suffered between two toes on his left foot has improved. The injury, Rahm noted, has not fully healed but is at least manageable.\n\nHe explained that he withdrew from his last two tournaments, LIV Golf Houston and the US Open, to avoid aggravating his condition. \"I had and just to be precautionary towards not making it worse and seeing what steps I can take to prevent that from happening in the future.\"\n\nHe ruled out that competing in Nashville could cause him to relapse, but admitted that he is still in recovery. \"A lot of things to follow up from what happened to make sure it heals properly and it doesn't happen again,\" said Jon Rahm.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Courses", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed_Products", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Left-Handed Products", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/76f14ec47ef30d8ba93c35b260e064b5/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/06/20/17188509078483.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665731", "eventUri": "eng-9665731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

A par would have been enough to secure a play-off.\n\nThe fall-out from McIlroy's astonishing finish at Pinehurst has been intense, with faces from all over the world of golf stepping up to give their hypotheses on where Rory lost the tournament, or where it all went wrong on the back nine of the US Open.\n\nSome have blamed his caddie, some have blamed his mentality, while some have simply stated the obvious that the image of his putt rolling out on the 18th is one that will haunt McIlroy for the rest of his life.\n\nThere has been plenty of noise amid the low point of McIlroy's chase for the fifth major. However, through it all, his former Ryder Cup teammate Jon Rahm has come to his defence, arguing that the difficulty of his putt on the 18th has been severely underplayed by the golf media.\n\nREAD HERE: Official: Shane Lowry And Rory McIlroy To Reunite For Team Ireland At Paris 2024 Olympics\n\nREAD HERE: Shane Lowry Proud To Bounce Back From 'Lowest Point' In Career With Strong US Open Finish\n\nAs he prepares to return to action with LIV Golf this weekend, Jon Rahm was asked to comment on Rory McIlroy's late collapse at the US Open.\n\nThe Spaniard would strongly defend his ex-Team Europe compatriot McIlroy, saying that the NBC commentary team had misled the public on how easy the decisive putt was for the Northern Irishman.\n\nOne of the things that really burned me...I think it was Smylie [Kaufman] who said it - they severely underplayed how difficult Rory's putt on 18 was.\n\nWhen you say it's a \"left-centre putt\" - if you hit that putt left-centre and you miss the hole, you're off the green because of how much slope there is.\n\nYou could see Rory aiming at least a cup left from three feet.

However, a bit of added perspective from those at the top of the game may not go amiss in the weeks to come.", "source": {"uri": "balls.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.balls.ie"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eoin_harrington@balls.ie", "name": "Eoin Harrington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Par_(score)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Par (score)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_course", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Schauffele", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Schauffele"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Miniature_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Miniature Golf", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch_and_Putt", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Pitch and Putt", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Humor", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://img.resized.co/balls_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL21lZGlhLmJhbGxzLmllXFxcL3VwbG9hZHNcXFwvMjAyNFxcXC8wNlxcXC8yMDExMjcwOVxcXC9VbnRpdGxlZC1kZXNpZ24tMjAyNC0wNi0yMFQxMTE5NDAuMDU4LnBuZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjoxMjAwLFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6NjI3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuYmFsbHMuaWVcXFwvaW1hZ2VzXFxcL2JyYW5kLWltYWdlLmpwZ1wiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJkMjk4NzY2NjU0M2UzM2U1NWM4OTBjNWU0OTFlOWM3ODc1N2FkYjgwIn0=/rahmquestionsnarrativesurroundingrorymcilroysusopennightmareballsie.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665731", "eventUri": "eng-9665731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

A foot infection forced the Spaniard to withdraw from LIV Golf's event in Houston. It's also the same injury that caused him to ultimately take his name out of the field at the recently concluded 2024 U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina.\n\nThe good news for Rahm's fans is that while he is not 100 percent over the injury, he feels good enough to play in this week's LIV Golf event in Nashville.\n\n\"I'm feeling good, Rahm said ahead of the Nashville tournament (h/t Bob Harig of Sports Illustrated).\n\n\"The main reason for the withdrawal from the two events was the infection I had and just to be precautionary towards not making it worse and seeing what steps I can take to prevent that from happening in the future.\"\n\nRahm also confirmed that his foot still has a wound and hinted that more medical attention is needed for his injury to go away completely.\n\n\"The wound is still there. I'm not going to show any graphic pictures, but it's still there. It's manageable now. I'm not going to really make it worse. A lot of things to follow up from what happened to make sure it heals properly and it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nNot being able to play at Pinehurst and compete against the best of both golf worlds -- PGA Tour and LIV Golf -- was not ideal for Jon Rahm. He showed up at Pinehurst ahead of the start of the U.S. Open with the intention to play but ultimately decided to back away from the challenging event in order to ensure that he wouldn't further aggravate his foot injury.\n\n\"After consulting with numerous doctors and my team, I have decided it is best for my long term health, to withdraw from this weeks US Open Championship. To say I'm disappointed is a massive understatement!\" Rahm posted on X (the social media platform formerly known as X) when he announced his final U.S. Open decision.\n\nIt was a tough sacrifice made by Rahm, considering the prestige of the tournament and the missed chance of trying to add to his major haul, but it was something he felt he needed to do. Otherwise, the infection could worsen and put his availability in more future tournaments in jeopardy.\n\nJon Rahm looking to recapture his form\n\nAlthough Rahm is expected to see action this week in Nashville, he's still likely not at his top form. However, being back in action is a big step in the right direction for the golf star, who will be turning 30 this coming November.\n\n\"I feel ready to walk and hit it. I haven't been able to do much. It doesn't take much for me to feel ready to compete. Looking forward to it. Just happy that I'm here,\" Rahm said when he was asked if he was feeling ready to give it a go again.\n\nCurrently ranked ninth overall in the world, Rahm last won a major tournament back in 2023 at the Masters. Since then, he had a couple of top 10s and a missed cut in five major starts, including a runner-up finish at the 2023 edition of The Open Championship. His other major victory was his win at the 2021 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines Golf Course.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rexwell_villas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rexwell Villas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrey_Pines_Golf_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torrey Pines Golf Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Open Championship"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Women", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jon-Rahm-gives-update-on-graphic-foot-infection.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665731", "eventUri": "eng-9665731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

But he also echoed a common frustration that many golf fans share: It's sometimes extremely difficult to know where to watch the action, with tournament rounds jumping from one network to another and with options for streaming which are sometimes the only option between the two.\n\n\"To go from ABC to NBC to Peacock and then back to the next thing, yeah, they should make it a little easier,\" he said, speaking at the LIV Golf event this week in Nashville, which Rahm plans to play. \"It's an Open after all. Just turn on a channel and hopefully you can watch the entire show.\n\nRahm's biggest criticism, however, concerns Rory McIlroy's decisive miss on the 72nd hole. Tied with DeChambeau at the time, McIlroy made a 3-foot-9 par putt on the 18th hole Sunday. It was never above the hole where you wanted to be on the fast greens of Pinehurst No. 2 and McIlroy missed. He didn't play enough of a break and hit it too softly, as the ball caught the right edge and went out. He made a bogey. In the pair behind, DeChambeau made par and won.\n\n\"I thought from the times I wore it and I could hear, I thought [the broadcast] everything was fine,\" Rahm said. \"One of the things that absolutely burned me, and I think it was Smylie [Kaufman] who said it, he seriously underestimated the difficulty of Rory's putt on 18. When he said it was a left-center putt, if you hit that left-center putt and miss the hole, you are off the green because of the slope. You could see Rory aiming for at least a cup left from three feet away. They seriously underestimated the difficulty of this putt. Seriously.\n\n\"I think it can happen many times and unless you've been on a golf course and played it or played it, it's hard to really explain how difficult the golf course can be \", he continued. \"A lot of times they only have five seconds to say something quickly, so I don't blame them either. But other than that, I thought it was good.\n\nWhat Rahm was referring to was when Kaufman, the on-course reporter, said seconds before McIlroy hit the putt: \"I got behind it, I read it. Not outside the hole. It's a left-center putt, but you can make it if you start it in the middle as well.\n\nAlthough analyst Brandel Chamblee never said it sounded that simple.\n\n\"Four feet, down the hill, breaking to the right,\" he said after McIlroy visited the scene. \"It's not exactly the 4-footer you want.\" He went over the hole.\n\nAs for Rahm's outlook this week, he says he hasn't been able to do much, but he feels ready.\n\n\"I feel good,\" he said. \"I feel good. The main reason for dropping out of both events was the infection I had and just as a precaution to not make it worse and see what steps I could take to prevent this from happening again in the future. The injury is still there. I'm not going to show any graphic pictures, but it's still there. It's manageable now. I'm not really going to make it worse. do after what happened to make sure it heals properly and doesn't happen again.\n\nJosh Berhow Golf.com Editor\n\nAs editor-in-chief of GOLF.com, Berhow manages the day-to-day and long-term planning for one of the most widely read news and services websites in sports.

Many of the original LIV members had chosen to resign their memberships due to the increasing fines, including the likes of Ian Poulter and Sergio Garcia.\n\nThis in tuRn made them ineligible to compete on the European Ryder Cup setup. For now, Rahm remains both a DP World Tour player and eligible to represent Luke Donald's team next autumn, but regardless of the politics, the Spaniard believes players' loyalties to LIV should not impact their ability to play in the Ryder Cup.\n\n\"I hope sooner than later there's some resolution to where there's a way for the players here to earn the events like you can pretty much everywhere else and there's a clear pathway,\" Rahm expressed at LIV Nashville. I know LIV is a bit of a different league, but the talent is there, and that's in my mind undeniable, so there should be a pathway for all of us to be able to earn certain points or a way into majors, Ryder Cup and so on.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nRahm's argument was strengthened by DeChambeau's major victory last Sunday, as he became the second LIV player to win a flagship event in 13 months. The two-time Ryder Cupper outplayed PGA Tour rival Rory McIlroy in an intense final-round clash at Pinehurst No. 2, maintaining his winning streak in the 2024 major championships.\n\nDeChambeau represented Team USA at the 2018 and 2021 Ryder Cups but missed out on a spot in Zach Johnson's team last year. Only one LIV member received recognition from captain Johnson, with Brooks Koepka getting a call-up to compete four months after his PGA Championship victory at Oak Hill.\n\nAt the time, DeChambeau accepted his omission from the team but confessed 'it would have been nice to at least just have a call,\" from the captain, echoing the sentiments of a group of PGA Tour players who didn't make the cut.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_lees@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Joshua Lees", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryson_DeChambeau", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bryson DeChambeau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Rahm", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jon Rahm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryder_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryder Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_European_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "PGA European Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Open_(tennis)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "US Open (tennis)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethpage_Black_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bethpage Black Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Poulter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ian Poulter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Garc\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Garc\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Woods", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiger Woods"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_Hill_Country_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oak Hill Country Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senior major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinehurst_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinehurst Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women's_major_golf_championships", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Women's major golf championships"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville,_Tennessee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nashville, Tennessee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PGA Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Koepka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooks Koepka"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/article33073211.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/5_jon-rahm-bryson-dechambeau.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9665731", "eventUri": "eng-9665731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

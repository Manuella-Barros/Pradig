{"id": 232024190, "title": "Jim Ratcliffe's private Thomas Tuchel meeting says it all about Erik ten Hag at Man Utd", "text": "Sir Jim Ratcliffe held a private meeting with Manchester United-linked manager Thomas Tuchel, it has been claimed, in a move which could well worry incumbent Erik ten Hag. United's higher-ups have been conducting an end-of-season review, with Ten Hag's future still uncertain. The former Ajax manager took a holiday after sealing European qualification with victory in the FA Cup final, but an eighth-placed Premier League finish means questions still remain. Tuchel, who managed Chelsea to Champions League glory in 2021, is a free agent after leaving Bayern Munich. There had been suggestions the German might go back on his agreement to leave Bayern Munich after taking them within minutes of this season's Champions League final, but confirmed in May that he would indeed depart. Despite United's cup final win, Tuchel is thought to have remained confident of taking over at Old Trafford. Whether or not he takes over imminently, the mere fact that part-owner Ratcliffe has reportedly held talks with the 50-year-old may well worry Ten Hag. According to Bild, Ratcliffe and Tuchel held a secret meeting in Monaco last week. Among the topics of discussion, the German publication claims, was the manager's plans for getting the best out of Jadon Sancho and Mason Mount. Former Chelsea midfielder Mount was a key part of Tuchel's Champions League winning squad and a regular in the Premier League under the former Paris Saint-Germain boss. However, he struggled with injuries in his first Manchester United season after moving for big money last summer. Sancho, another expensive recruit, fell out with Ten Hag early in the 2023-24 season and finished the campaign on loan at former club Borussia Dortmund. Rather than selling the \u00a373m winger, United could yet look to reintegrate him under a new manager. Should Manchester United replace Ten Hag with Tuchel? Have your say in the comments section \"This is my final press conference from Sabener Strasse,\" Tuchel said when confirming his Bayern departure. \"Our agreement from February still stands. We spoke about it again recently, but we did not reach an agreement.\" Tuchel won the Bundesliga title in his first season, pipping Borussia Dortmund on the final day. This term, though, his team fell short of Xabi Alonso's unbeaten Bayer Leverkusen and saw their European hopes dashed by Real Madrid in a dramatic Champions League semi. The German isn't the only man to be linked with United while speculation continues over Ten Hag's future. Former United coach Kieran McKenna ended speculation over his own future by agreeing an extension with Ipswich Town, but others - including ex-Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino - continue to be linked with the post.

At the time, U.S. officials stressed that the policy was limited to the Kharkiv region, among other restrictions.\n\nUkrainian forces have since used American weapons to strike into Russia at least once, destroying targets in the city of Belgorod, and managed to hold back the Russian assault. But Ukrainian and other European officials have pressed the U.S. to loosen its restrictions even further, allowing Ukraine to strike anywhere inside Russia.\n\nNational security adviser Jake Sullivan told PBS on Tuesday that the agreement with Ukraine about firing American weapons into Russia extends to \"anywhere that Russian forces are coming across the border from the Russian side to the Ukrainian side to try to take additional Ukrainian territory.\"\n\nRussia has in recent days indicated it may soon move on the northeastern city of Sumy, which is also near the Russian border.

Originally, the move was characterized only in the context of the ongoing Kharkiv assault, but that did not exclude the possibility of hitting back against other cross-border attacks, said one of the officials.\n\nStill, Sullivan's language is markedly different from what U.S. officials said in May when the new policy was detailed. At the time a senior U.S. official said: \"The president recently directed his team to ensure that Ukraine is able to use U.S. weapons for counter-fire purposes in Kharkiv so Ukraine can hit back at Russian forces hitting them or preparing to hit them.\"\n\nThe policy of not allowing long-range strikes inside Russia \"has not changed,\" the official stressed.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia\u2013Ukraine_border", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia\u2013Ukraine border"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sumy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sumy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgorod", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgorod"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgorod"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Policy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sKMNAOvwDCejuQAqMymOrQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/fcb221de175917805caad5d837d6dccb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668781", "eventUri": "eng-9668781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Last month, President Joe Biden quietly authorized Kyiv to launch U.S.-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia.\n\nBut officials said at the time that Biden's decision applied only to targets inside Russia near the border with Ukraine's eastern Kharkiv region.

The front lines in Ukraine have barely moved since the end of 2022, despite tens of thousands of dead on both sides in relentless trench warfare, the bloodiest fighting in Europe since World War Two.\n\nAfter initial Ukrainian successes that saw Kyiv repel an assault on the capital and recapture territory in the war's first year, a major Ukrainian counter-offensive using donated Western tanks fizzled last year. Russian forces still hold a fifth of Ukraine and are again advancing, albeit slowly. No peace talks have been held for more than two years.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Pentagon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_Oblast", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv Oblast"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Self-defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trench warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Sullivan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Sullivan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kharkiv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammunition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ammunition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Airspace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety_Engineering", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Safety Engineering", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Military Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Safety", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Safety", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/18_06_2024_12_44_00_0998286.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9668781", "eventUri": "eng-9668781", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

It's about common sense,\" national security adviser Jake Sullivan told PBS. | Susan Walsh/AP\n\nThe U.S. has told Ukraine it can use American-supplied weapons to hit any Russian forces attacking from across the border -- not just those in the region near Kharkiv, according to U.S. officials.\n\nThe subtle shift in messaging -- which officials insist is not a change in policy -- comes just weeks after the U.S. quietly gave Kyiv the green light to strike inside Russia in response to a cross-border assault on the city of Kharkiv. At the time, U.S. officials stressed that the policy was limited to the Kharkiv region, among other restrictions.\n\nUkrainian forces have since used American weapons to strike into Russia at least once, destroying targets in the city of Belgorod, and managed to hold back the Russian assault.

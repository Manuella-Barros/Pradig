{"id": 231950734, "title": "\u2018I dread November\u2019: Election workers worry that federal task force won't keep them safe", "text": "Aiming to send a message, the Biden administration recently spotlighted its indictments and convictions in cases involving threats to election officials or workers. But with no letup in reports of attacks, some elections professionals say federal law enforcement still isn\u2019t doing enough to deter bad actors and ensure that those on the front lines of democracy are protected this fall. \u201cElection officials by and large have no confidence that if something were to happen to them, there would be any consequences,\u201d said Amy Cohen, the executive director of the National Association of State Election Directors. \u201cIt is very clear that we are not seeing a deterrent effect.\u201d A U.S. Justice Department spokesman declined to comment for this story, instead directing States Newsroom to a webpage for the department\u2019s Election Threats Task Force. Launched by the Justice Department in 2021 in response to the wave of harassment of election officials that followed the 2020 election, the Election Threats Task Force works closely with local law enforcement and U.S. attorney\u2019s offices around the country to investigate threats. In going after those who make threats against election workers, the Justice Department is honoring a foundational purpose: The department was created in 1870 in part to protect the voting rights of southern Blacks during Reconstruction. Run by John Keller, a top official in the Justice Department\u2019s Public Integrity Section, the task force also includes the Criminal Division\u2019s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section, the Civil Rights Division, the National Security Division, and the FBI. It also works with several other government agencies, including the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and the Department of Homeland Security. Since its launch, the task force has brought charges in 17 cases, according to the department\u2019s tally. Eight cases have resulted in prison time, with sentencing scheduled in several more. In one case, brought in Nevada, the defendant was acquitted. In March, a Massachusetts man received a three-and-a-half-year sentence \u2014 the longest won by the task force to date \u2014 for sending an online message to an Arizona election official warning her a bomb would be detonated \u201cin her personal space\u201d unless she resigned. A Texas man received the same sentence last August for posting threatening messages targeting two Maricopa County, Arizona officials and their families, and separately calling for a \u201cmass shooting of poll workers\u201d in precincts with \u201csuspect results.\u201d \u2018Each of these cases should serve as a warning\u2019 Attorney General Merrick Garland highlighted these convictions and others in a May 13 speech at a task force meeting. \u201cEach of these cases should serve as a warning,\u201d declared Garland. \u201cIf you threaten to harm or kill an election worker, volunteer, or official, the Justice Department will find you. And we will hold you accountable.\u201d But those prosecutions amount to only a tiny share of what the Justice Department has said is over 2,000 reports of threats or harassment submitted by the election community to the FBI since the task force was launched in 2021. Around 100 of those were investigated, according to the Justice Department. The small number of investigations and prosecutions is largely due to free speech concerns. Legal experts say that anything short of a direct and explicit threat to cause physical harm may well be protected speech under the First Amendment. \u201cA true threat is a serious expression of an intent to commit an act of unlawful violence,\u201d Keller has said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t cross that line into invoking violence, they are generally not going to constitute a criminally prosecutable threat.\u201d Still, as the 2024 vote approaches, there\u2019s little evidence that the volume of attacks against the people who run elections has declined, or that election workers feel safer. A recent Brennan Center survey found that more than half of local election officials said they were concerned about the safety of their colleagues or staff \u2014 around the same number as in 2022, the year of the last federal election. Around a quarter worry about being assaulted at home or at work. \u201cThis is a widespread issue in the elections community,\u201d said Tammy Patrick, the CEO for programs for the National Association of Election Officials, and a former election official in Maricopa County. \u201cIt\u2019s happening all across the country. It\u2019s not just a question of it being in swing states, or just being in the city or whatever. It\u2019s happening in a way that is a concerted campaign to create and sow chaos.\u201d \u201cThere is some feeling that the task force is a political tool,\u201d said another election expert, \u201cthat allows the administration to say they care and they\u2019re doing something.\u201d Troubling episodes but little follow-up In March 2022, anti-fraud activists, accompanied by the local GOP chair, showed up at the office of Michella Huff, the election director for Surry County, North Carolina. Huff said the activists tried to pressure her to give them access to county voting machines, citing what they said were flawed voter rolls. The group repeatedly threatened to have Huff ousted from her job if she didn\u2019t cooperate, and said they planned to return with the local sheriff, though they did not do so. Huff declined to provide access to the machines, and reported the episode to the state election board\u2019s investigations unit. A spokesperson for the board did not respond to an inquiry about whether the report was forwarded to federal law enforcement. Election security advocates have urged the FBI to do more to probe efforts by supporters of former President Donald Trump to gain access to voting machines in other states, warning that the breaches could have allowed for voting machine software to be compromised. Huff said she never heard from law enforcement on any level, despite speaking publicly about the episode. Though Huff wasn\u2019t physically threatened, she said she\u2019d still like to have seen federal authorities do more to respond. \u201cIf it is truly a threat, I think every threat needs to be looked at serious(ly), and it needs to be considered as to what the intent was, if it was successful, and what the repercussions would be if it had been successful,\u201d said Huff. \u201cA threat is a threat.\u201d More overt efforts to physically intimidate election workers also have at times spurred little law enforcement follow-up. The night before South Carolina\u2019s 2022 primaries, a Republican candidate who has promoted lies about the 2020 election posted a message on the conservative social media site Telegram, to a group of anti-fraud activists. \u201cFor all of you on the team tomorrow observing the polls, Good Hunting,\u201d the message said. \u201cWe have the enemy on their back foot, press the attack. Forward.\u201d During the voting period, groups of activists showed up at multiple polling places to verbally harass, photograph, and film election workers as they did their jobs, recounted Aaron Cramer, the executive director of the Charleston County Board of Voter Registration and Elections. The activists called the police to at least one polling site, falsely alleging evidence of fraud by election staff. The police came, but made no arrests \u2014 though the episode left the site\u2019s lead poll manager shaken, Cramer said. Cramer said his office provided detailed reports on both the Telegram message and the harassment at polling sites to the Department of Homeland Security, as well as to the state election commission. \u201cWe took that threat pretty seriously,\u201d he said, referring to the Telegram message. He said he received a response from DHS saying the report was being looked into, but heard nothing after that. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the conclusions were, or what occurred after submitting that information,\u201d Cramer said. But Cramer added that the experience produced a successful effort to increase collaboration with local, state, and federal authorities \u2014 with the result that the county is much better prepared to respond to, and anticipate, similar incidents this year. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the defense, you\u2019re kind of reacting to everything, and I think that\u2019s how the past was,\u201d said Cramer. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re being proactive.\u201d \u2018I dread November for you guys\u2019 Patrick, of the National Association of Election Officials, said that while she understands the need to avoid running afoul of the First Amendment, authorities must balance legitimate free speech concerns with their urgent duty to protect those conducting elections. And, she suggested, they may not always be getting that balance right. \u201cWe need to be really careful that we\u2019re not allowing people to yell fire in a crowded theater,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cAnd that we\u2019re not allowing people to use what they are potentially claiming as their freedom of speech as a way of creating chaos in a system, or to threaten individuals who are just trying to do their job.\u201d In addition, election professionals say they\u2019ve complained for years that after they submit reports about threats and harassment to the FBI, there\u2019s often a lack of follow-up beyond an acknowledgment of receipt. Of course, law enforcement frequently can\u2019t share details about their work, even with those who were targeted, in order not to compromise an investigation. But Patrick said even basic information could be helpful. \u201cEven letting them know that the report is being worked, so it doesn\u2019t just go into the void, and a victim knows there\u2019s going to be a knock-and-talk, gives the individual who made that report some sense of closure,\u201d Patrick said, referring to when federal agents show up to speak with a suspect at their home. The problem may be exacerbated by a lack of understanding among some in the elections world about what federal law enforcement can and can\u2019t do. Many election officials, said Cohen, of the National Association of State Election Directors, want front-end help with steps like bolstering physical security to better prepare for incidents. \u201cLaw enforcement, and especially federal law enforcement, is only coming at the back end,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cTheir goal is not prevention or recovery, their goal is prosecution. And it has taken our community, I think, a long time to understand what we should be expecting from DoJ.\u201d Ultimately, said Cohen, the prosecutions brought by the Justice Department appear to have done little to reduce the number of threats election workers are subject to today. \u201cI\u2019m really grateful that DOJ has secured convictions in Arizona,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think securing convictions in Arizona three years later has actually deterred anything in Arizona.\u201d Indeed, Arizona has been a hotbed for election misinformation, and its election officials continue to be targeted by a consistent stream of threats, according to multiple reports. Huff, the county election director in North Carolina, said that with a major election approaching, members of the public often express sympathy for her and her staff \u2014 an acknowledgement that the vitriol they\u2019ve been facing is only likely to get stronger. \u201cOut in public, I get that,\u201d Huff said \u2014 \u2018Boy, I dread November for you guys.\u2019\u2009\u201d Kansas Reflector is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

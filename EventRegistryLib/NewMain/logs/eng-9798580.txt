Notably, China recorded the highest growth rate. Specifically, shrimp exports to China (including Hong Kong) reached $328 million, a substantial increase of 17 per cent compared to the same period last year.\n\nIn the first half of this year, China significantly increased its purchases of Vietnamese lobster, causing the export value of this crustacean to surge 57-fold on-year. The US market followed with export value reaching $303 million, a slight increase of 1 per cent; exports to Japan totalled $229 million, down 3 per cent; and to the EU, $217 million, up 13 per cent compared to the same period in 2023.\n\nThe Vietnam Association of Seafood Exporters and Producers (VASEP) forecasts strong growth in shrimp exports to the US and EU markets in the final months of this year. This aligns with market trends, as importers typically increase large-scale purchases for the year-end holiday season.\n\nAdditionally, inventory issues and transportation difficulties are expected to ease, with demand recovering and prices likely to rebound. Following this trajectory, Vietnam's shrimp exports are projected to meet the $4 billion target this year.\n\nDespite this recovery, shrimp exports still face numerous challenges. According to congthuong.vn, Ho Quoc Luc, chairman of the Board of Directors at Sao Ta Foods JSC, noted that Vietnamese shrimp are facing increased competition from countries like Ecuador, India, and Indonesia in the US market. Oversupply from India and Ecuador's increased production has led to a continuous sharp decline in shrimp prices.\n\nSimultaneously, sluggish consumer demand due to the global economic recession has created unfavourable conditions in the shrimp export market.\n\nTensions in the Red Sea pose a complex problem for global supply chains, directly impacting Vietnamese shrimp exports to key markets such as the US and Europe. Rising transportation costs and risks in ensuring delivery schedules are forcing export businesses to seek more complex alternative solutions or focus on closer markets.\n\nAccording to Phung Thi Kim Thu, a shrimp market expert from VASEP, businesses need to pay attention to new consumer preferences to increase market share in 2024. For example, China is trending towards reducing imports of frozen warm-water shrimp, rock lobster, other sea shrimp, and frozen lobster, while increasing imports of fresh, live, and chilled lobster. In South Korea, demand for pre-cooked, processed, and ready-to-eat seafood is rapidly increasing.\n\nThe US and China are expected to remain the two largest markets for Vietnamese shrimp exports in 2024, accounting for about 40-45 per cent of the industry's export turnover. Domestic businesses are also actively expanding and seeking new markets to minimise risks associated with dependence on a few traditional markets. Diversifying export markets helps the shrimp industry gain more opportunities for sustainable and stable long-term development.\n\nThe government and relevant agencies are working to support businesses through preferential policies, facilitating exports, and improving product quality. Research and development programmes for new technologies in shrimp farming and processing are also being prioritised to enhance productivity and quality, meeting the stringent standards of demanding markets.\n\nVietnamese shrimp has been exported to about 100 countries and territories, ranking among the top three countries for shrimp exports in the world and accounting for 13-14 per cent of the total global shrimp export value.", "source": {"uri": "vir.com.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vietnam Investment Review -

China imported 436,000 tonnes of shrimp in the first half, 75% of which came from Ecuador.\n\nVietnamese exporters said ocean shipping costs have skyrocketed more than 40% since May, placing their products at a disadvantage in transoceanic markets.\n\nDespite challenges, VASEP said, the industry maintained its export growth in major markets, including China (24%), EU (32%), the US (9%), and Japan (4%).\n\nVASEP forecast better export situation in the coming time on the back of higher demand from the US and China from the end of Q3 to serve holiday.\n\nVietnamese shrimp has kept its competitive edge over supply from India and Ecuador in Japan, the Republic of Korea (RoK), Australia, the UK, the US, and the EU thanks to intensive processing and various added-value products.\n\nInsiders said eco shrimp play an important role in the industry's development as it can easily break into fastidious markets, while farmers should focus on developing farming area, preparing raw materials, and expanding markets, adding they are important measures that help the sector improve its intrinsic strength and stand ready to compete in large markets.\n\nThey further said that enterprises also need support from competent authorities to reduce trade barriers like anti-dumping and anti-subsidy taxes in the US, as well as quota on shrimp export to the RoK, which have adversely impacted on the industry's growth.\n\nDirector General of Minh Phu Seafood Joint Stock Company Le Van Quang said businesses must invest in advanced technologies to create more intensively-processed products with high values to conquer international markets./.\n\nVNA", "source": {"uri": "en.vietnamplus.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "VietnamPlus"}, "authors": [],

The Holy City is a culinary destination, with tourists flocking for reservations at newcomers like Vern's, Marbled & Fin, and Kultura. Many new spots don't serve Southern food -- recently, the city gained restaurants with flavors from Malaysia, Puerto Rico, and Sichuan.\n\nWhen I moved to Charleston in 2005, Southern food dominated the food scene, especially shrimp and grits. Locals made their versions of the dish at home, but visitors couldn't get enough in establishments like Marina Variety Store, 82 Queen, and Magnolias. Reflecting on the iconic dish, I wondered, \"Do tourists still come to the Lowcountry to eat shrimp and grits?\"\n\nGrowing up in Charleston, Southern culinary experts Matt and Ted Lee witnessed the rise of the dish's popularity. \"Shrimp and grits was the leading edge of a whole new idea about food in the South that gave everyone clear permission to explore the foods of their grandparents without feeling like they were out of date, unfashionable, or uncool,\" says Matt.\n\n\"It came to prominence in the late '80s as a restaurant dish and not simply a home cook thing. It was fun in the sense that it wasn't she-crab soup, which is the other culinary icon of the Lowcountry. But unlike she-crab soup, you could play with the shrimp and grits recipe,\" says Ted.\n\nAlthough the dish's origin can be traced back to the contributions of enslaved Africans, it wasn't until 1985 that it rose to national attention when New York Times writer Craig Claiborne visited chef Bill Neal at Chapel Hill institution Crook's Corner. Neal often traveled to Charleston and had shrimp and grits on his menu -- the NYT published the recipe and interest took off.\n\nRobert Stehling, who worked with Neal before running Hominy Grill for 24 years, says that shrimp and grits made up 10 percent of his sales. \"I had long ago resigned myself that certain dishes have a power of their own. It wasn't up to me to take that dish off the menu,\" he says.\n\nWhen Chris Stewart opened the Glass Onion in 2008, he didn't want to put shrimp and grits on the menu because everyone else in town offered it. \"I think the first thing I put on the menu was white beans and rice, a play on red beans and rice, and we put grilled shrimp on top of it. But, you know, people wanted shrimp and grits, and we had grits, and we had shrimp. So very soon after we opened, we gave them what they wanted. That's why it's on our menu. It's really popular,\" he says. Stewart's version includes Creole tomatoes and andouille sausage.\n\nSean Mendes of Gillie's Seafood says shrimp and grits remains one of his most requested orders. He serves a version that mirrors his grandmother's recipe. \"I fell in love with shrimp and grits because my grandmother was an amazing cook. She would make shrimp and grits from scratch, and it filled the house with smells of onions, bell pepper, and bacon. And it was my first love of food. And it's why I do what I do now,\" he says.\n\nChef Raymond England also grew up eating shrimp and grits with his grandmother. When he took over Husk, he wasn't sure about keeping the dish on the menu. \"Everybody has their twists and riffs on shrimp and grits,\" he says, \"I wasn't a fan of it, based on our location, being between Poogan's and 82 Queen, where that's their thing. I wasn't opposed to doing it, but I know people have expectations at Husk to have some very Southern things.\" England switches up his dish depending on the local ingredients available.\n\n82 Queen chief operating officer Patrick Kish says that shrimp and grits is still a best seller at his Lowcountry restaurant, which goes through about 8,000 pounds of grits annually. \"It's still definitely one of the top contenders at the restaurant,\" says Kish. The 82 Queen version, with bacon-infused barbecue sauce and cheesy grits, was created in 1982 by Kish's father, Steve.\n\nFor Nigel Drayton Sr., proprietor of Nigel's Good Food, shrimp and grits is more than a restaurant dish, but a reminder of growing up in the Lowcountry. \"Shrimp and grits was a way to feed your family for cheaper,\" he says, \"The popularity now isn't what it used to be. Back then, our uncles, fathers, and granddads used to go shrimping, or fishing, or crabbing almost every day. Somebody you knew had shrimp nets.\" When he opened Nigel's Good Food in 2011, he knew he wanted to keep his dish traditional with bacon and a light gravy, like his grandmother made.\n\n\"I think for a lot of people, the real revelation of shrimp and grits, if they're visiting Charleston from out of town, is simply like the freshness of the shrimp. It seems so electric for them,\" says Ted Lee, \"And that's why when they come back they'll still get it and it will still seem so special.\"\n\nSo, there's my answer: yes, shrimp and grits is still a popular order in Charleston, or as Matt Lee told me, \"Are people in New Orleans bored of gumbo? No. It's a cultural icon -- just like shrimp and grits.\"", "source": {"uri": "carolinas.eater.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eater Carolinas"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erin_perkins@carolinas.eater.com", "name": "Erin Perkins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp_and_grits", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shrimp and grits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuisine_of_the_Southern_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cuisine of the Southern United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charleston, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina_Lowcountry", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina Lowcountry"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shrimp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chef"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sichuan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sichuan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_bean", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Navy bean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_slave_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic slave trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grits", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andouille", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andouille"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Creole_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana Creole people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_beans_and_rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Red beans and rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tomato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grilling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grilling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seafood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seafood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gumbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbecue_sauce", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barbecue sauce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/For_Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/For Children", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Vegetarian", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Vegetarian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Outdoors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Food_and_Drink", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Food and Drink", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nv1oFa-_nw6KhjCAVA39TXOv3EI=/0x366:4386x2559/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2509952/huskcharleston_shrimpandgrits.0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9798580", "eventUri": "eng-9798580", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

On Thursday, Kellyanne Conway told Fox News viewers that the concept of Trump going after revenge and vengeance for what led him to his hush money trial conviction is \"the new narrative by all the lemmings in the mainstream media.\" Implying that he does not, in fact, want those things. But in an interview with Dr. Phil McGraw that aired that same day, Trump said himself that, yeah, he actually really does. \"Revenge does take time. And sometimes revenge can be justified, Phil. I have to be honest. Sometimes it can,\u201d Trump said, within the topic of his legal woes. New York Times correspondent and CNN analyst Maggie Haberman took a look at this back and forth on Trump's \"revenge\" issue, speaking to host Phil Mattingly on Friday\u2019s edition of CNN\u2019s The Lead. From Haberman's perspective, Trump may be publicly holding back on his vengeance views, but his message is still very clear. \"There\u2019s a difference between being upset about the outcome of a case and saying, therefore, I\u2019m going to go after everybody,\" Haberman said. \"Trump might be tempering, somewhat, his language publicly, but he is very focused on this behind the scenes. He does want to see retribution. He is not in a happy place.\"", "summary": "Journalist Maggie Haberman analyzes the ways in which Trump has been publicly tempering his revenge rhetoric", "url": "https://www.salon.com/2024/06/08/expert-donald-is-not-in-a-happy-place/", "image": "https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/06/donald-trump-2156409315jpg.jpg ?>", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:09:13", "author": "Kelly McClure", "authors": ["Kelly McClure"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.163}

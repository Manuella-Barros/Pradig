smashing sale of Neymar to Paris St Germain and how Barcelona react to the departure of one of their leading players will define the new season in Spain.\n\nBarca outscored Real Madrid last season with their ferocious attacking trident of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar but still surrendered the title to Zinedine Zidane's side.\n\nPurists at Barcelona hope the virtuoso Brazilian's departure will lead to new coach Ernesto Valverde building a more balanced side and reverting to the possession-based style of play perfected under former coach Pep Guardiola to try and wrestle the title back from Madrid.\n\nThe champions are also grappling with questions over their strongest formation.\n\nThey looked at their most powerful last campaign playing a four-man midfield lead by playmaker Isco rather than with their usual three-pronged attack, which has left question marks about the future of Gareth Bale.\n\nThere is little doubt about the quality of Real's nucleus of players that last season won the league and became the first team to successfully defend the European Cup since 1990, however, and they looked as unbeatable as ever in their 2-1 win over Manchester United to win the European Super Cup.\n\nThe range of talent in Real's squad explains why their recent transfer activities have been geared towards building for the future rather than the immediate present, bringing in 19-year-old full back Theo Hernandez from Atletico Madrid and Spain under-21 midfielder Dani Ceballos.\n\nBarca have added more pace to their side with the return of winger Gerard Deulofeu after stints in England and Italy although the Spaniard cannot be expected to be a replacement for Neymar.\n\nValverde has strengthened in the one key area they were lacking last term by recruiting Portugal right back Nelson Semedo, although he still faces a huge task in hunting down Zidane's all conquering side who show no sign of letting up.\n\n\"I don't know if we can play even better than we have been, but we're going to keep trying,\" Zidane said after the Super Cup win. \"Our ambition is to keep getting better and better.\"\n\nThe title race is set to be even more of a two horse race

their new Wanda Metropolitano stadium.\n\nCompeting with Atletico for third will be Sevilla, who spent much of the last campaign competing for top spot until dropping out of the title race and finishing fourth and have had a summer of change, bringing in former Celta coach Eduardo Berizzo to replace Jorge Sampaoli.\n\nThey have also parted ways with Spain winger Vitolo, captain Vicente Iborra and, more crucially, long time sporting director Monchi, who has been credited with unearthing so many of the players responsible for the team's many successes in the 21st century.\n\nValencia will expect a big improvement on a chaotic last season with the appointment of Marcelino, who built a rock solid defence and consistent side in his years at Villarreal, while Athletic Bilbao are also primed for a new era after losing Valverde, their longest running coach, who has been replaced by reserve team manager Jose Angel Ziganda.\n\nElsewhere, Catalan side Girona are gearing up for their

football talent has been bruised by the world record smashing sale of Neymar to Paris St Germain and how Barcelona react to the departure of one of their leading players will define the new season in Spain.\n\nBarca outscored Real Madrid last season with their ferocious attacking trident of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar but still surrendered the title to Zinedine Zidane's side.\n\nNew Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde. AP\n\nPurists at Barcelona hope the virtuoso Brazilian's departure will lead to new coach Ernesto Valverde building a more balanced side and reverting to the possession-based style of play perfected under former coach Pep Guardiola to try and wrestle the title back from Madrid.\n\nThe champions are also grappling with questions over their strongest formation.\n\nThey looked at their most powerful last campaign playing a four-man midfield lead by playmaker Isco rather than with their usual three-pronged attack, which has left question marks about the future of Gareth Bale.\n\nThere is little doubt about the quality of Real's nucleus of players that last season won the league and became the first team to successfully defend the European Cup since 1990, however, and they looked as unbeatable as ever in their 2-1 win over Manchester United to win the European Super Cup.\n\nThe range of talent in Real's squad explains why their recent transfer activities have been geared towards building for the future rather than the immediate present, bringing in 19-year-old full back Theo Hernandez from Atletico Madrid and Spain under-21 midfielder Dani Ceballos.\n\nBarca have added more pace to their side with the return of winger Gerard Deulofeu after stints in England and Italy although the Spaniard cannot be expected to be a replacement for Neymar.\n\nValverde has strengthened in the one key area they were lacking last term by recruiting Portugal right back Nelson Semedo, although he still faces a huge task in hunting down Zidane's all conquering side who show no sign of letting up.\n\n\"I don't know if we can play even better than we have been, but we're going to keep trying,\" Zidane said after the Super Cup win. \"Our ambition is to keep getting better and better.\"\n\nThe title race is set to be even more of a two horse race than in previous seasons as third force Atletico Madrid have been unable to strengthen due to a ban on registering new players until January, while Diego Simeone's side may also take time to bed into their new Wanda Metropolitano stadium.\n\nCompeting with Atletico for third will be Sevilla, who spent much of the last campaign competing for top spot until dropping out of the title race and finishing fourth and have had a summer of change, bringing in former Celta coach Eduardo Berizzo to replace Jorge Sampaoli.\n\nThey have also parted ways with Spain winger Vitolo, captain Vicente Iborra and, more crucially, long time sporting director Monchi, who has been credited with unearthing so many of the players responsible for the team's many successes in the 21st century.\n\nValencia will expect a big improvement on a chaotic last season with the appointment of Marcelino, who built a rock solid defence and consistent side in his years at Villarreal, while Athletic Bilbao are also primed for a new era after losing Valverde, their longest running coach, who has been replaced by reserve team manager Jose Angel Ziganda.\n\nElsewhere, Catalan side Girona are gearing up for their first season in the top flight while Levante and Getafe made swift returns to La Liga after being relegated in 2016.\n\nPublished Date: Aug 11, 2017 06:20 pm | Updated Date: Aug 11, 2017 06:20 pm\n\nTags :#Barcelona#Dani ceballos#Ernesto valverde#Football#Kickingaround#La liga#Nelson semedo#Real madrid#Theo hernandez#Zinedine zidane", "time": "12:53:00"}

Madrid when the two giants of Spanish football meet on Sunday at the Nou Camp in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nBarca beat Real 3-2 in a pre-season 'Clasico' friendly in Miami in July but the stakes will be far higher in the Super Cup, the annual curtain raiser in Spain between the Liga champions and King's Cup holders.\n\nThe second leg takes place next Wednesday in Madrid.\n\nThe two teams have not met in the competition since 2012, which was the last time Real lifted the trophy. One of the most defining images in the recent history of the rivalry came in the 2011 edition, when Jose Mourinho poked Barca's then assistant coach Tito Vilanova in the eye as tensions boiled over following a dramatic 3-2 win for the Catalans.\n\nBarca beat Juventus and Manchester United in addition to the Spanish champions in a promising pre-season tour of the United States, but have since been rocked by losing Neymar, one third of the 'MSN' strike force including Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi that routinely battered Liga defences,\n\nBarca have so far failed in their efforts to spend the 222 million euros Paris St Germain paid them for Neymar, seeing bids rejected for Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund's Ousmane Dembele which leave the club wracked with doubts before facing a supremely confident Madrid side.\n\nWith Paco Alcacer or Gerard Deulofeu as his only options to join Messi and Suarez in a front three, Valverde may stray from the 4-3-3 formation his predecessor Luis Enrique preferred in order to bolster the midfield to counter Real.\n\nMadrid outclassed Manchester United to win the European Super Cup 2-1 with a powerful four-man midfield although they will be without Luka Modric in the first leg due to a suspension dating back to Madrid's last appearance in the Super Cup in 2014.\n\nThe Croatian's absence gives Real coach Zinedine Zidane a dilemma over whether to bring in another midfielder against Barca, such as Mateo Kovacic or new signing Dani Ceballos, or revert to a front three to accommodate Gareth Bale, with Cristiano Ronaldo set to make his first start for Real since the Champions League final.\n\nRonaldo will be the centre of attention at the Nou Camp after a summer in which he reportedly threatened to leave Madrid although Valverde's tactics should also focus on how to shackle Isco, the chief conductor of Real's win over United and who has been in scintillating form in 2017.\n\nZidane's side, meanwhile, will be equally attentive to the movements of Messi, the all-time top scorer in the Clasico who stunned the Bernabeu with a last-minute 3-2 winner but who has not scored against Real at the Nou Camp since 2012.", "time": "06:30:00"}

Valverde will get his first proper taste of the scorching rivalry between Barcelona and Real Madrid when the two giants of Spanish football meet on Sunday at the Nou Camp in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup.\n\nBarca beat Real 3-2 in a pre-season 'Clasico' friendly in Miami in July but the stakes will be far higher in the Super Cup, the annual curtain raiser in Spain between the Liga champions and King's Cup holders.\n\nThe second leg takes place next Wednesday in Madrid.\n\nThe two teams have not met in the competition since 2012, which was the last time Real lifted the trophy. One of the most defining images in the recent history of the rivalry came in the 2011 edition, when Jose Mourinho poked Barca's then assistant coach Tito Vilanova in the eye as tensions boiled over following a dramatic 3-2 win for the Catalans.\n\nBarca beat Juventus and Manchester United in addition to the Spanish champions in a promising pre-season tour of the United States, but have since been rocked by losing Neymar, one third of the 'MSN' strike force including Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi that routinely battered Liga defences,\n\nBarca have so far failed in their efforts to spend the 222 million euros Paris St Germain paid them for Neymar, seeing bids rejected for Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund's Ousmane Dembele which leave the club wracked with doubts before facing a supremely confident Madrid side.\n\nWith Paco Alcacer or Gerard Deulofeu as his only options to join Messi and Suarez in a front three, Valverde may stray from the 4-3-3 formation his predecessor Luis Enrique preferred in order to bolster the midfield to counter Real.\n\nMadrid outclassed Manchester United to win the European Super Cup 2-1 with a powerful four-man midfield although they will be without Luka Modric in the first leg due to a suspension dating back to Madrid's last appearance in the Super Cup in 2014.\n\nThe Croatian's absence gives Real coach Zinedine Zidane a dilemma over whether to bring in another midfielder against Barca, such as Mateo Kovacic or new signing Dani Ceballos, or revert to a front three to accommodate Gareth Bale, with Cristiano Ronaldo set to make his first start for Real since the Champions League final.\n\nRonaldo will be the centre of attention at the Nou Camp after a summer in which he reportedly threatened to leave Madrid although Valverde's tactics should also focus on how to shackle Isco, the chief conductor of Real's win over United and who has been in scintillating form in 2017.\n\nZidane's side, meanwhile, will be equally attentive to the movements of Messi, the all-time top scorer in the Clasico who stunned the Bernabeu with a last-minute 3-2 winner but who has not scored against Real at the Nou Camp since 2012.

stakes will be far higher in the Super Cup, the annual curtain raiser in Spain between the Liga champions and King's Cup holders.\n\nThe second leg takes place next Wednesday in Madrid.\n\nThe two teams have not met in the competition since 2012, which was the last time Real lifted the trophy. One of the most defining images in the recent history of the rivalry came in the 2011 edition, when Jose Mourinho poked Barca's then assistant coach Tito Vilanova in the eye as tensions boiled over following a dramatic 3-2 win for the Catalans.\n\nBarca beat Juventus and Manchester United in addition to the Spanish champions in a promising pre-season tour of the United States, but have since been rocked by losing Neymar, one third of the 'MSN' strike force including Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi that routinely battered Liga defences,\n\nBarca have so far failed in their efforts to spend the 222 million euros Paris St Germain paid them for Neymar, seeing bids rejected for Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund's Ousmane Dembele which leave the club wracked with doubts before facing a supremely confident Madrid side.\n\nWith Paco Alcacer or Gerard Deulofeu as his only options to join Messi and Suarez in a front three, Valverde may stray from the 4-3-3 formation his predecessor Luis Enrique preferred in order to bolster the midfield to counter Real.\n\nMadrid outclassed Manchester United to win the European Super Cup 2-1 with a powerful four-man midfield although they will be without Luka Modric in the first leg due to a suspension dating back to Madrid's last appearance in the Super Cup in 2014.\n\nThe Croatian's absence gives Real coach Zinedine Zidane a dilemma over whether to bring in another midfielder against Barca, such as Mateo Kovacic or new signing Dani Ceballos, or revert to a front three to accommodate Gareth Bale, with Cristiano Ronaldo set to make his first start for Real since the Champions League final.\n\nRonaldo will be the centre of attention at the Nou Camp after a summer in which he reportedly threatened to leave Madrid although Valverde's tactics should also focus on how to shackle Isco, the chief conductor of Real's win over United and who has been in scintillating form in 2017.\n\nZidane's side, meanwhile, will be equally attentive to the movements of Messi, the all-time top scorer in the Clasico who stunned the Bernabeu with a last-minute 3-2 winner but who has not scored against Real at the Nou Camp since 2012.\n\n(Reporting by Richard Martin; Editing by Andrew Bolton)", "time": "13:07:00"}

The last time the sides met in competitive action back in April the Catalans emerged victorious at the Santiago Bernabeu even without the then suspended Neymar as Messi won an incredible encounter 3-2 with the last kick of the game.\n\nBarca also edged last month's Miami friendly between the two in Neymar's last game for Barca 3-2.\n\n\"The friendly game during the tour is a reference point,\" said Valverde. \"But it is different now there is a title at stake.\"\n\nGerard Deulofeu scored and provided two assists in just 45 minutes in Neymar's role as Barca completed their pre-season preparations by sweeping aside Chapecoense 5-0 on Monday.\n\nHowever, Valverde also has the option to strengthen Barca's midfield by sacrificing a forward to add Sergi Roberto to the normal midfield three of Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta.\n\nMadrid's relentless winning streak under Zinedine Zidane continued in midweek as Los Blancos beat Manchester United 2-1 to win the UEFA Super Cup 2-1.\n\nCasemiro and Isco were on target as Madrid's midfield dazzled in Skopje, Macedonia, but Zidane will be forced into at least one change from the side that started in midweek as Luka Modric is suspended.\n\nMateo Kovacic is the favourite to replace his Croatian teammate in midfield.\n\nHowever, Modric's absence increases Cristiano Ronaldo's chances of returning to the Madrid starting XI after making just a brief cameo appearance as a substitute against his former club in Macedonia.\n\n\u2708\ufe0f\u1f44b\u1f6b6 #RMSupercopa\n\n\u00a1Rumbo a Barcelona!\n\nWe're off to Barcelona!#HalaMadrid pic.twitter.com/aLKZo0vMzK\n\n-- Real Madrid C.F.

on Saturday he will sign a contract extension in the near future with the club he has guided to back-to-back Champions League titles.\n\n\"I'm happy because it's a sign of confidence, that we have done good work,\" Zidane told a pre-match press conference ahead of Real's Spanish Super Cup showdown with Barcelona when quizzed on reports over his future.\n\nMadrid sports daily AS reported the Frenchman will be rewarded with a three-year deal for his feats in not only delivering two Champions Leagues in just 20 months in charge, but also Real's first La Liga title for five years.\n\n\"I enjoy every day here,\" added Zidane, who also ended his illustrious playing career at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\n\"I'm lucky enough to have this extraordinary squad and I am very happy with it.\"\n\nZidane added a sixth trophy to his burgeoning collection as a coach when Madrid saw off Manchester United 2-1 to retain the UEFA Super Cup on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that even his future will depend on maintaining his winning streak given the high demands placed on coaches at Madrid.\n\n\"You could sign a contract for 10 or 20 years, but I know where I am and what I have to do,\" he continued.\n\n\"Within a year you could be gone.\"\n\nZidane also warned the European champions against a Barcelona backlash at the Camp Nou on Sunday (kick off 2000GMT).\n\nBarca are still reeling from the loss of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record 222 million euros ($262 million) with their attempts to land a replacement in Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund so far falling short.\n\nZidane admitted \"there aren't many players\" with Neymar's individual qualities, but claimed his absence wouldn't give Madrid the upper hand over two El Clasico clashes in four days with the second leg of the Super cup to come at the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\n\n\"They have had changes but Barcelona are Barcelona. We know how they play and their idea of how to play isn't going to change,\" said Zidane.\n\n\"Neymar isn't replaceable but there will be others that will do very well. If we think it is going to be easier tomorrow we will be mistaken.\"\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "time": "12:59:00"}

Zinedine Zidane confirmed on Saturday he will sign a contract extension in the near future with the club he has guided to back-to-back Champions League titles.\n\n\"I'm happy because it's a sign of confidence, that we have done good work,\" Zidane told a pre-match press conference ahead of Real's Spanish Super Cup showdown with Barcelona when quizzed on reports over his future.\n\nMadrid sports daily AS reported the Frenchman will be rewarded with a three-year deal for his feats in not only delivering two Champions Leagues in just 20 months in charge, but also Real's first La Liga title for five years.\n\n\"I enjoy every day here,\" added Zidane, who also ended his illustrious playing career at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\n\"I'm lucky enough to have this extraordinary squad and I am very happy with it.\"\n\nZidane added a sixth trophy to his burgeoning collection as a coach when Madrid saw off Manchester United 2-1 to retain the UEFA Super Cup on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that even his future will depend on maintaining his winning streak given the high demands placed on coaches at Madrid.\n\n\"You could sign a contract for 10 or 20 years, but I know where I am and what I have to do,\" he continued.\n\n\"Within a year you could be gone.\"\n\nZidane also warned the European champions against a Barcelona backlash at the Camp Nou on Sunday (kick off 2000GMT).\n\nBarca are still reeling from the loss of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record 222 million euros ($262 million) with their attempts to land a replacement in Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund so far falling short.\n\nZidane admitted \"there aren't many players\" with Neymar's individual qualities, but claimed his absence wouldn't give Madrid the upper hand over two El Clasico clashes in four days with the second leg of the Super cup to come at the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\n\n\"They have had changes but Barcelona are Barcelona.

needing to dispel doubts they have fallen further behind their rivals following Neymar's departure.\n\nThe Brazilian's world record 222 million euro ($261 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain just days before the start of the campaign deprives a Barca side that missed out to Madrid for the Spanish title for the first time in five years last season one of their most dangerous weapons.\n\nBarca's immediate attempts to find a replacement in Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund have so far fallen short.\n\nNew Barca coach Ernesto Valverde therefore has a tactical conundrum on his Camp Nou bow to fill the void alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez up front.\n\nAnd influential defender Gerard Pique admitted Barca must compensate for Neymar's absence collectively rather than looking for a saviour in the transfer market.\n\n\"More than replacing him, we have to make ourselves stronger. There isn't a replacement for Neymar in the market,\" said Pique, who also recognised on Saturday his desperate attempts at talking Neymar out of moving had failed.\n\nPique is hoping Barca will be motivated by the pain of missing out to Madrid for the biggest titles last season as Real also became the first side to retain the Champions League.\n\n\"When your rivals win more than you, you have to turn the situation around,\" added Pique.\n\n\"History shows we have known how to do that, but history also shows you can't always win.\"\n\nRecent clashes between the two do favour Barca. The last time the sides met in competitive action back in April the Catalans emerged victorious at the Santiago Bernabeu even without the then suspended Neymar as Messi won an incredible encounter 3-2 with the last kick of the game.\n\nBarca also edged last month's Miami friendly between the two in Neymar's last game for Barca 3-2.\n\n\"The friendly game during the tour is a reference point,\" said Valverde. \"But it is different now there is a title at stake.\"\n\nGerard Deulofeu scored and provided two assists in just 45 minutes in Neymar's role as Barca completed their pre-season preparations by sweeping aside Chapecoense 5-0 on Monday.\n\nHowever, Valverde also has the option to strengthen Barca's midfield by sacrificing a forward to add Sergi Roberto to the normal midfield three of Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta.\n\n- Ronaldo 'ready' to return -\n\nMadrid's relentless winning streak under Zinedine Zidane continued in midweek as Los Blancos beat Manchester United 2-1 to win the UEFA Super Cup 2-1.\n\nCasemiro and Isco were on target as Madrid's midfield dazzled in Skopje, Macedonia, but Zidane will be forced into at least one change from the side that started in midweek as Luka Modric is suspended.\n\nMateo Kovacic is the favourite to replace his Croatian teammate in midfield.\n\nHowever, Modric's absence increases Cristiano Ronaldo's chances of returning to the Madrid starting XI after making just a brief cameo appearance as a substitute against his former club in Macedonia.\n\nRonaldo only returned to training with his teammates last weekend on their return from a tour of the USA having been given an extended break following Portugal's participation in the Confederations Cup and a court appearance in Madrid over allegations of tax evasion.\n\n\"He had his holiday and has been with us only five or six days, but physically he worked very hard during his holidays and he is ready,\" said Zidane.", "time": "07:48:00"}

he will sign a contract extension in the near future with the club he has guided to back-to-back Champions League titles.\n\n\"I'm happy because it's a sign of confidence, that we have done good work,\" Zidane told a pre-match press conference ahead of Real's Spanish Super Cup showdown with Barcelona when quizzed on reports over his future.\n\nMadrid sports daily AS reported the Frenchman will be rewarded with a three-year deal for his feats in not only delivering two Champions Leagues in just 20 months in charge, but also Real's first La Liga title for five years.\n\n\"I enjoy every day here,\" added Zidane, who also ended his illustrious playing career at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\n\"I'm lucky enough to have this extraordinary squad and I am very happy with it.\"\n\nZidane added a sixth trophy to his burgeoning collection as a coach when Madrid saw off Manchester United 2-1 to retain the UEFA Super Cup on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that even his future will depend on maintaining his winning streak given the high demands placed on coaches at Madrid.\n\n\"You could sign a contract for 10 or 20 years, but I know where I am and what I have to do,\" he continued.\n\n\"Within a year you could be gone.\"\n\nZidane also warned the European champions against a Barcelona backlash at the Camp Nou today .\n\nBarca are still reeling from the loss of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record 222m euros ($262m) with their attempts to land a replacement in Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund so far falling short.\n\nZidane admitted \"there aren't many players\" with Neymar's individual qualities, but claimed his absence wouldn't give Madrid the upper hand over two El Clasico clashes in four days with the second leg of the Super Cup to come at the Bernabeu later this week on Wednesday.", "time": "00:09:00"}

"body": "BARCELONA: Barcelona host rivals Real Madrid in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday (2000GMT) badly in need of a morale-boosting win following the world record sale of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nDespite banking 222 million euros ($261 million) for the Brazilian, Barca's scattergun approach to finding a replacement has so far been unsuccessful with bids for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund so far rebuffed.\n\nNew Barca coach Ernesto Valverde must therefore try to down the European and Spanish champions with a weaker squad than the one which missed out to Real for the La Liga title last season.\n\nHowever, Barca did manage to beat Madrid without the then suspended Neymar the last time the sides met in competitive action back in April as Lionel Messi won an incredible encounter 3-2 with the last kick of the game.\n\nThe Catalans also edged last month's Miami friendly between the two in Neymar's last game for Barca 3-2.\n\nValverde's men completed a perfect pre-season on the field with a fourth straight win by sweeping aside Chapecoense 5-0 on Monday in a match to raise funds for the stricken Brazilian club who lost 19 players and 24 club officials in a plane crash last year.\n\n\"We've had a good pre-season and we are coming into the game in good condition,\" said Valverde.\n\n\"But on Sunday the real thing starts, with a competitive game and a title at stake against our biggest rivals.\"\n\nGerard Deulofeu was handed Neymar's role alongside Messi and Luis Suarez up front against Chapecoense on his return to the club after spells at Everton and AC Milan.\n\nAnd the Spanish international took his chance with a goal and two assists in just 45 minutes on the field.\n\n\"It is always a pleasure to play here and even more so with these players,\" said Deulofeu.\n\nValverde is likely to stick with Deulofeu, but the former Athletic Bilbao coach could also strengthen Barca's midfield by sacrificing a forward to add Sergi Roberto to the normal midfield three of Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta.\n\nRonaldo return an option\n\nDespite failing to win any of their pre-season games, Madrid started the new campaign as they ended last season with another trophy as Zinedine Zidane's men proved too strong for Manchester United to win the UEFA Super Cup 2-1 on Tuesday.\n\nCasemiro and Isco were on target as Madrid's midfield dazzled in Skopje, Macedonia, but Zidane will be forced into at least one change from the side that started in midweek as Luka Modric is suspended.\n\nShould Zidane wish to maintain the 4-4-2 system he has utilised to huge success in 2017, Mateo Kovacic is the favourite to replace his Croatian teammate in midfield.\n\nHowever, Modric's absence increases Cristiano Ronaldo's chances of returning to the Madrid starting XI after making just a brief cameo appearance as a substitute against his former club in Macedonia.\n\nRonaldo only returned to training with his teammates last weekend on their return from a tour of the USA having been given an extended break following Portugal's participation in the Confederations Cup and a court appearance in Madrid over allegations of tax evasion.", "time": "02:19:00"}

outscored Real Madrid last season with their ferocious attacking trident of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar but still surrendered the title to Zinedine Zidane's side.\n\nPurists at Barcelona hope the virtuoso Brazilian's departure will lead to new coach Ernesto Valverde building a more balanced side and reverting to the possession-based style of play perfected under former coach Pep Guardiola to try and wrestle the title back from Madrid.\n\nThe champions are also grappling with questions over their strongest formation.\n\nThey looked at their most powerful last campaign playing a four-man midfield lead by playmaker Isco rather than with their usual three-pronged attack, which has left question marks about the future of Gareth Bale.\n\nThere is little doubt about the quality of Real's nucleus of players that last season won the league and became the first team to successfully defend the European Cup since 1990, however, and they looked as unbeatable as ever in their 2-1 win over Manchester United to win the European Super Cup.\n\nThe range of talent in Real's squad explains why their recent transfer activities have been geared towards building for the future rather than the immediate present, bringing in 19-year-old full back Theo Hernandez from Atletico Madrid and Spain under-21 midfielder Dani Ceballos.\n\n\"I don't know if we can play even better than we have been, but we're going to keep trying,\" Zidane said after the Super Cup win. \"Our ambition is to keep getting better and better.\"\n\nThe title race is set to be even more of a two horse race than in previous seasons as third force Atletico Madrid have been unable to strengthen due to a ban on registering new players until January, while Diego Simeone's side may also take time to bed into their new Wanda Metropolitano stadium.\n\nValencia will expect a big improvement on a chaotic last season with the appointment of Marcelino, who built a rock solid defence and consistent side in his years

leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday (2000GMT, 2300 EAT) badly in need of a morale-boosting win following the world record sale of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nDespite banking 222 million euros ($261 million) for the Brazilian, Barca's scattergun approach to finding a replacement has so far been unsuccessful with bids for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund so far rebuffed.\n\nNew Barca coach Ernesto Valverde must therefore try to down the European and Spanish champions with a weaker squad than the one which missed out to Real for the La Liga title last season.\n\nHowever, Barca did manage to beat Madrid without the then suspended Neymar the last time the sides met in competitive action back in April as Lionel Messi won an incredible encounter 3-2 with the last kick of the game.\n\nThe Catalans also edged last month's Miami friendly between the two in Neymar's last game for Barca 3-2.\n\nValverde's men completed a perfect pre-season on the field with a fourth straight win by sweeping aside Chapecoense 5-0 on Monday in a match to raise funds for the stricken Brazilian club who lost 19 players and 24 club officials in a plane crash last year.\n\n\"We've had a good pre-season and we are coming into the game in good condition,\" said Valverde.\n\n\"But on Sunday the real thing starts, with a competitive game and a title at stake against our biggest rivals.\"\n\nGerard Deulofeu was handed Neymar's role alongside Messi and Luis Suarez up front against Chapecoense on his return to the club after spells at Everton and AC Milan.\n\nAnd the Spanish international took his chance with a goal and two assists in just 45 minutes on the field.\n\n\"It is always a pleasure to play here and even more so with these players,\" said Deulofeu.\n\nValverde is likely to stick with Deulofeu, but the former Athletic Bilbao coach could also strengthen Barca's midfield by sacrificing a forward to add Sergi Roberto to the normal midfield three of Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta.\n\nRONALDO RETURN AN OPTION\n\nDespite failing to win any of their pre-season games, Madrid started the new campaign as they ended last season with another trophy as Zinedine Zidane's men proved too strong for Manchester United to win the Uefa Super Cup 2-1 on Tuesday.\n\nCasemiro and Isco were on target as Madrid's midfield dazzled in Skopje, Macedonia, but Zidane will be forced into at least one change from the side that started in midweek as Luka Modric is suspended.\n\nShould Zidane wish to maintain the 4-4-2 system he has utilised to huge success in 2017, Mateo Kovacic is the favourite to replace his Croatian teammate in midfield.\n\nHowever, Modric's absence increases Cristiano Ronaldo's chances of returning to the Madrid starting XI after making just a brief cameo appearance as a substitute against his former club in Macedonia.\n\nRonaldo only returned to training with his teammates last weekend on their return from a tour of the USA having been given an extended break following Portugal's participation in the Confederations Cup and a court appearance in Madrid over allegations of tax evasion.",

football match between Barcelona FC and Chapecoense at the Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona on August 7, 2017. -- AFP picBARCELONA, Aug 13 -- Barcelona host Real Madrid in the Spanish football season's opening act in the Super Cup, first leg today (2000GMT) needing to dispel doubts they have fallen further behind their rivals following Neymar's departure.\n\nThe Brazilian's world record \u20ac222 million (approx RM1.13 billion) move to Paris Saint-Germain just days before the start of the campaign deprives a Barca side that missed out to Madrid for the Spanish title for the first time in five years last season one of their most dangerous weapons.\n\nBarca's immediate attempts to find a replacement in Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund have so far fallen short.\n\nNew Barca coach Ernesto Valverde therefore has a tactical conundrum on his Camp Nou bow to fill the void alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez up front.\n\nAnd influential defender Gerard Pique admitted Barca must compensate for Neymar's absence collectively rather than looking for a saviour in the transfer market.\n\n\"More than replacing him, we have to make ourselves stronger. There isn't a replacement for Neymar in the market,\" said Pique, who also recognised on Saturday his desperate attempts at talking Neymar out of moving had failed.\n\nPique is hoping Barca will be motivated by the pain of missing out to Madrid for the biggest titles last season as Real also became the first side to retain the Champions League.\n\n\"When your rivals win more than you, you have to turn the situation around,\" added Pique.\n\n\"History shows we have known how to do that, but history also shows you can't always win.\"\n\nRecent clashes between the two do favour Barca. The last time the sides met in competitive action back in April the Catalans emerged victorious at the Santiago Bernabeu even without the then suspended Neymar as Messi won an incredible encounter 3-2 with the last kick of the game.\n\nBarca also edged last month's Miami friendly between the two in Neymar's last game for Barca 3-2.\n\n\"The friendly game during the tour is a reference point,\" said Valverde. \"But it is different now there is a title at stake.\"\n\nGerard Deulofeu scored and provided two assists in just 45 minutes in Neymar's role as Barca completed their pre-season preparations by sweeping aside Chapecoense 5-0 on Monday.\n\nHowever, Valverde also has the option to strengthen Barca's midfield by sacrificing a forward to add Sergi Roberto to the normal midfield three of Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta.\n\nRonaldo 'ready' to return\n\nMadrid's relentless winning streak under Zinedine Zidane continued in midweek as Los Blancos beat Manchester United 2-1 to win the UEFA Super Cup 2-1.\n\nCasemiro and Isco were on target as Madrid's midfield dazzled in Skopje, Macedonia, but Zidane will be forced into at least one change from the side that started in midweek as Luka Modric is suspended.\n\nMateo Kovacic is the favourite to replace his Croatian teammate in midfield.\n\nHowever, Modric's absence increases Cristiano Ronaldo's chances of returning to the Madrid starting XI after making just a brief cameo appearance as a substitute against his former club in Macedonia.\n\nRonaldo only returned to training with his teammates last weekend on their return from a tour of the USA having been given an extended break following Portugal's participation in the Confederations Cup and a court appearance in Madrid over allegations of tax evasion.\n\n\"He had his holiday and has been with us only five or six days, but physically he worked very hard during his holidays and he is ready,\" said Zidane. -- AFP", "time": "07:02:00"}

a contract extension in the near future with the club he has guided to back-to-back Champions League titles.\n\n\"I'm happy because it's a sign of confidence, that we have done good work,\" Zidane told a pre-match press conference ahead of Real's Spanish Super Cup showdown with Barcelona when quizzed on reports over his future.\n\nMadrid sports daily AS reported the Frenchman will be rewarded with a three-year deal for his feats in not only delivering two Champions Leagues in just 20 months in charge, but also Real's first La Liga title for five years.\n\n\"I enjoy every day here,\" added Zidane, who also ended his illustrious playing career at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\n\"I'm lucky enough to have this extraordinary squad and I am very happy with it.\"\n\nZidane added a sixth trophy to his burgeoning collection as a coach when Madrid saw off Manchester United 2-1 to retain the UEFA Super Cup on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that even his future will depend on maintaining his winning streak given the high demands placed on coaches at Madrid.\n\n\"You could sign a contract for 10 or 20 years, but I know where I am and what I have to do,\" he continued.\n\n\"Within a year you could be gone.\"\n\nZidane also warned the European champions against a Barcelona backlash at the Camp Nou on Sunday (kick off 2000GMT).\n\nBarca are still reeling from the loss of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record 222 million euros ($262 million) with their attempts to land a replacement in Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund so far falling short.\n\nZidane admitted \"there aren't many players\" with Neymar's individual qualities, but claimed his absence wouldn't give Madrid the upper hand over two El Clasico clashes in four days with the second leg of the Super cup to come at the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\n\n\"They have had changes but Barcelona are Barcelona. We know how they play and their idea of how to play isn't going to change,\" said Zidane.\n\n\"Neymar isn't replaceable but there will be others that will do very well. If we think it is going to be easier tomorrow we will be mistaken.\"\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "time": "17:05:00"}

million euros ($261 million) for the Brazilian, Barca's scattergun approach to finding a replacement has so far been unsuccessful with bids for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund so far rebuffed.\n\nNew Barca coach Ernesto Valverde must therefore try to down the European and Spanish champions with a weaker squad than the one which missed out to Real for the La Liga title last season.\n\nHowever, Barca did manage to beat Madrid without the then suspended Neymar the last time the sides met in competitive action back in April as Lionel Messi won an incredible encounter 3-2 with the last kick of the game.\n\nThe Catalans also edged last month's Miami friendly between the two in Neymar's last game for Barca 3-2.\n\nValverde's men completed a perfect pre-season on the field with a fourth straight win by sweeping aside Chapecoense 5-0 on Monday in a match to raise funds for the stricken Brazilian club who lost 19 players and 24 club officials in a plane crash last year.\n\n\"We've had a good pre-season and we are coming into the game in good condition,\" said Valverde.\n\n\"But on Sunday the real thing starts, with a competitive game and a title at stake against our biggest rivals.\"\n\nGerard Deulofeu was handed Neymar's role alongside Messi and Luis Suarez up front against Chapecoense on his return to the club after spells at Everton and AC Milan.\n\nAnd the Spanish international took his chance with a goal and two assists in just 45 minutes on the field.\n\n\"It is always a pleasure to play here and even more so with these players,\" said Deulofeu.\n\nValverde is likely to stick with Deulofeu, but the former Athletic Bilbao coach could also strengthen Barca's midfield by sacrificing a forward to add Sergi Roberto to the normal midfield three of Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta.\n\n- Ronaldo return an option -\n\nDespite failing to win any of their pre-season games, Madrid started the new campaign as they ended last season with another trophy as Zinedine Zidane's men proved too strong for Manchester United to win the UEFA Super Cup 2-1 on Tuesday.\n\nCasemiro and Isco were on target as Madrid's midfield dazzled in Skopje, Macedonia, but Zidane will be forced into at least one change from the side that started in midweek as Luka Modric is suspended.\n\nShould Zidane wish to maintain the 4-4-2 system he has utilised to huge success in 2017, Mateo Kovacic is the favourite to replace his Croatian teammate in midfield.\n\nHowever, Modric's absence increases Cristiano Ronaldo's chances of returning to the Madrid starting XI after making just a brief cameo appearance as a substitute against his former club in Macedonia.\n\nRonaldo only returned to training with his teammates last weekend on their return from a tour of the USA having been given an extended break following Portugal's participation in the Confederations Cup and a court appearance in Madrid over allegations of tax evasion.", "time": "04:53:00"}

time whatever the length of contract he signs.\n\n\"I know it will end at some point, but I am very happy at the moment,\" Zidane told a news conference.\n\n\"A contract could be 10 years, or 20, but I know where I am and what I must do.\n\n\"Maybe in a year's time, I might be gone. I will never argue with Madrid about this. I'm very happy with their confidence in me. The objectives are always the same. We want to win all the games and titles possible.\"\n\nZidane is seventh coach in the last 10 years at Madrid, who are notoriously demanding of their managers.\n\nSince being appointed in 2016, the Frenchman has led the club to two Champions League trophies and last season's La Liga title, as well as two Uefa Super Cups and one Club World Cup.\n\nZidane has the chance on Sunday to take a step towards another trophy, in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup against rivals Barcelona at the Nou Camp.\n\nThe Frenchman confirmed striker Cristiano Ronaldo is fit to start, after he appeared from the bench against Manchester United on Tuesday as Madrid won the Uefa Super Cup in Skopje.\n\n\"He is very good, he has had his holidays,\" said Zidane. \"He worked very hard physically during his break and he is ready to play now. But we will see the team tomorrow.\" -- Reuters", "time": "15:39:00"}

Super Cup, first leg on Sunday (2000GMT) needing to dispel doubts they have fallen further behind their rivals following Neymar's departure.\n\nThe Brazilian's world record 222 million euro ($261 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain just days before the start of the campaign deprives a Barca side that missed out to Madrid for the Spanish title for the first time in five years last season one of their most dangerous weapons.\n\nBarca's immediate attempts to find a replacement in Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund have so far fallen short.\n\nNew Barca coach Ernesto Valverde therefore has a tactical conundrum on his Camp Nou bow to fill the void alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez up front.\n\nAnd influential defender Gerard Pique admitted Barca must compensate for Neymar's absence collectively rather than looking for a saviour in the transfer market.\n\n\"More than replacing him, we have to make ourselves stronger.

It's very soon,\" said Valverde.\n\nInstead the coach might look to Paco Alcacer to play on the left, or change formation from 4-3-3 to 4-4-2 to match Real Madrid, and incorporate an extra midfielder, which could be Sergi Roberto, whom Valverde praised.\n\nReplacing Neymar in the long term is a difficult task, though, and defender Gerard Pique told a news conference of his desperate attempt to get him to stay.\n\nPique tweeted a picture of himself and Neymar with the caption, \"he stays\", little over a week before the Brazilian departed.\n\n\"I don't feel tricked by Neymar. The day I said 'he stays' I knew that he was going 100 per cent. It was the final shot,\" said Pique.\n\n\"He got angry with me but we worked it out.

at the Camp Nou stadium in Barcelona, on August 7, 2017 \u00a9 AFP/File / Josep LAGO\n\nBarcelona, Spain, Aug 12 - Barcelona host Real Madrid in the Spanish football season's opening act in the Super Cup, first leg on Sunday (2000GMT) needing to dispel doubts they have fallen further behind their rivals following Neymar's departure.\n\nThe Brazilian's world record 222 million euro ($261 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain just days before the start of the campaign deprives a Barca side that missed out to Madrid for the Spanish title for the first time in five years last season one of their most dangerous weapons.\n\nBarca's immediate attempts to find a replacement in Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund have so far fallen short.\n\nNew Barca coach Ernesto Valverde therefore has a tactical conundrum on his Camp Nou bow to fill the void alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez up front.\n\nAnd influential defender Gerard Pique admitted Barca must compensate for Neymar's absence collectively rather than looking for a saviour in the transfer market.\n\n\"More than replacing him, we have to make ourselves stronger. There isn't a replacement for Neymar in the market,\" said Pique, who also recognised on Saturday his desperate attempts at talking Neymar out of moving had failed.\n\nBarcelona's players take part in a training session at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Florida, on July 28, 2017 \u00a9 AFP/File / HECTOR RETAMAL\n\nPique is hoping Barca will be motivated by the pain of missing out to Madrid for the biggest titles last season as Real also became the first side to retain the Champions League.\n\n\"When your rivals win more than you, you have to turn the situation around,\" added Pique.\n\n\"History shows we have known how to do that, but history also shows you can't always win.\"\n\nRecent clashes between the two do favour Barca. The last time the sides met in competitive action back in April the Catalans emerged victorious at the Santiago Bernabeu even without the then suspended Neymar as Messi won an incredible encounter 3-2 with the last kick of the game.\n\nBarca also edged last month's Miami friendly between the two in Neymar's last game for Barca 3-2.\n\n\"The friendly game during the tour is a reference point,\" said Valverde. \"But it is different now there is a title at stake.\"\n\nGerard Deulofeu scored and provided two assists in just 45 minutes in Neymar's role as Barca completed their pre-season preparations by sweeping aside Chapecoense 5-0 on Monday.\n\nHowever, Valverde also has the option to strengthen Barca's midfield by sacrificing a forward to add Sergi Roberto to the normal midfield three of Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta.\n\n- Ronaldo 'ready' to return -\n\nReal Madrid's Gareth Bale takes part in a training session with teammates at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, Florida, on July 28, 2017 \u00a9 AFP/File / HECTOR RETAMAL\n\nMadrid's relentless winning streak under Zinedine Zidane continued in midweek as Los Blancos beat Manchester United 2-1 to win the UEFA Super Cup 2-1.\n\nCasemiro and Isco were on target as Madrid's midfield dazzled in Skopje, Macedonia, but Zidane will be forced into at least one change from the side that started in midweek as Luka Modric is suspended.\n\nMateo Kovacic is the favourite to replace his Croatian teammate in midfield.\n\nHowever, Modric's absence increases Cristiano Ronaldo's chances of returning to the Madrid starting XI after making just a brief cameo appearance as a substitute against his former club in Macedonia.\n\nRonaldo only returned to training with his teammates last weekend on their return from a tour of the USA having been given an extended break following Portugal's participation in the Confederations Cup and a court appearance in Madrid over allegations of tax evasion.\n\n\"He had his holiday and has been with us only five or six days, but physically he worked very hard during his holidays and he is ready,\" said Zidane.\n\nShares", "time": "05:21:00"}

the possession-based style of play perfected under former coach Pep Guardiola to try and wrestle the title back from Madrid.\n\nThe champions are also grappling with questions over their strongest formation.\n\nReal Madrid looked at their most powerful last campaign playing a four-man midfield lead by playmaker Isco rather than with their usual three-pronged attack, which has left question

Valverde must therefore try to down the European and Spanish champions with a weaker squad than the one which missed out to Real for the La Liga title last season.\n\nHowever, Barca did manage to beat Madrid without the then suspended Neymar the last time the sides met in competitive action back in April as Lionel Messi won an incredible encounter 3-2 with the last kick of the game.\n\nThe Catalans also edged last month's Miami friendly between the two in Neymar's last game for Barca 3-2.\n\nValverde's men completed a perfect pre-season on the field with a fourth straight win by sweeping aside Chapecoense 5-0 on Monday in a match to raise funds for the stricken Brazilian club who lost 19 players and 24 club officials in a plane crash last year.\n\nAnd the Spanish international took his chance with a goal and two assists in just 45 minutes on the field.\n\n\"It is always a pleasure to play here and even more so with these players,\" said Deulofeu.\n\nValverde is likely to stick with Deulofeu, but the former Athletic Bilbao coach could also strengthen Barca's midfield by sacrificing a forward to add Sergi Roberto to the normal midfield three of Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta.\n\n- Ronaldo return an option -\n\nHowever, Modric's absence increases Cristiano Ronaldo's chances of returning to the Madrid starting XI after making just a brief cameo appearance as a substitute against his former club in Macedonia.\n\nRonaldo only returned to training with his teammates last weekend on their return from a tour of the USA having been given an extended break

Super Cup, first leg on Sunday needing to dispel doubts they have fallen further behind their rivals following Neymar's departure.\n\nThe Brazilian's world record 222 million euro ($261 million) move to Paris Saint-Germain just days before the start of the campaign deprives a Barca side that missed out to Madrid for the Spanish title for the first time in five years last season one of their most dangerous weapons.\n\nBarca's immediate attempts to find a replacement in Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund have so far fallen short.\n\nNew Barca coach Ernesto Valverde therefore has a tactical conundrum on his Camp Nou bow to fill the void alongside Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez up front.\n\nAnd influential defender Gerard Pique admitted Barca must compensate for Neymar's absence collectively rather than looking for a saviour in the transfer market.\n\n\"More than replacing him, we have to make ourselves stronger. There isn't a replacement for Neymar in the market,\" said Pique, who also recognised on Saturday his desperate attempts at talking Neymar out of moving had failed.\n\nPique is hoping Barca will be motivated by the pain of missing out to Madrid for the biggest titles last season as Real also became the first side to retain the Champions League.\n\n\"When your rivals win more than you, you have to turn the situation around,\" added Pique.\n\n\"History shows we have known how to do that, but history also shows you can't always win.\"\n\nRecent clashes between the two do favour Barca. The last time the sides met in competitive action back in April the Catalans emerged victorious at the Santiago Bernabeu even without the then suspended Neymar as Messi won an incredible encounter 3-2 with the last kick of the game.\n\nBarca also edged last month's Miami friendly between the two in Neymar's last game for Barca 3-2.\n\n\"The friendly game during the tour is a reference point,\" said Valverde. \"But it is different now there is a title at stake.\"\n\nGerard Deulofeu scored and provided two assists in just 45 minutes in Neymar's role as Barca completed their pre-season preparations by sweeping aside Chapecoense 5-0 on Monday.\n\nHowever, Valverde also has the option to strengthen Barca's midfield by sacrificing a forward to add Sergi Roberto to the normal midfield three of Sergio Busquets, Ivan Rakitic and Andres Iniesta.\n\n- Ronaldo 'ready' to return -\n\nMadrid's relentless winning streak under Zinedine Zidane continued in midweek as Los Blancos beat Manchester United 2-1 to win the UEFA Super Cup 2-1.\n\nCasemiro and Isco were on target as Madrid's midfield dazzled in Skopje, Macedonia, but Zidane will be forced into at least one change from the side that started in midweek as Luka Modric is suspended.\n\nMateo Kovacic is the favourite to replace his Croatian teammate in midfield.\n\nHowever, Modric's absence increases Cristiano Ronaldo's chances of returning to the Madrid starting XI after making just a brief cameo appearance as a substitute against his former club in Macedonia.\n\nRonaldo only returned to training with his teammates last weekend on their return from a tour of the USA having been given an extended break following Portugal's participation in the Confederations Cup and a court appearance in Madrid over allegations of tax evasion.\n\n\"He had his holiday and has been with us only five or six days, but physically he worked very hard during his holidays and he is ready,\" said Zidane.", "time": "04:41:00"}

done good work,\" Zidane told a pre-match press conference ahead of Real's Spanish Super Cup showdown with Barcelona when quizzed on reports over his future.\n\nMadrid sports daily AS reported the Frenchman will be rewarded with a three-year deal for his feats in not only delivering two Champions Leagues in just 20 months in charge, but also Real's first La Liga title for five years.\n\n\"I enjoy every day here,\" added Zidane, who also ended his illustrious playing career at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\n\"I'm lucky enough to have this extraordinary squad and I am very happy with it.\"\n\nZidane added a sixth trophy to his burgeoning collection as a coach when Madrid saw off Manchester United 2-1 to retain the UEFA Super Cup on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, he acknowledged that even his future will depend on maintaining his winning streak given the high demands placed on coaches at Madrid.\n\n\"You could sign a contract for 10 or 20 years, but I know where I am and what I have to do,\" he continued.\n\n\"Within a year you could be gone.\"\n\nZidane also warned the European champions against a Barcelona backlash at the Camp Nou on Sunday (kick off 2000GMT).\n\nBarca are still reeling from the loss of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record 222 million euros ($262 million) with their attempts to land a replacement in Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund so far falling short.\n\nZidane admitted \"there aren't many players\" with Neymar's individual qualities, but claimed his absence wouldn't give Madrid the upper hand over two El Clasico clashes in four days with the second leg of the Super cup to come at the Bernabeu on Wednesday.\n\n\"They have had changes but Barcelona are Barcelona. We know how they play and their idea of how to play isn't going to change,\" said Zidane.\n\n\"Neymar isn't replaceable but there will be others that will do very well.

Barca start life without Neymar in Super Cup\n\nLast Updated: 13/08/17 9:04am\n\nBarcelona host rivals Real Madrid in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup on Sunday, live on Sky Sports Football, in need of a morale-boosting win following the departure of Neymar.\n\nDespite banking \u00a3198m for the Brazilian, Barca's quest to finding a replacement has so far been unsuccessful with bids for Liverpool's Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele of Borussia Dortmund rejected.\n\nNew Barca coach Ernesto Valverde must therefore try to down the European and Spanish champions with a weaker squad than the one which missed out to Real for the La Liga title last season.\n\nHowever, Barca did manage to beat Madrid without the then-suspended Neymar the last time the sides met in competitive action back in April as Lionel Messi won an incredible encounter 3-2 with the last kick of the game.\n\nThe Catalans also edged last month's Miami friendly between the two in Neymar's last game for Barca 3-2.\n\n\"We've had a good pre-season and we are coming into the game in good condition,\" said Valverde.\n\nBarcelona vs R Madrid\n\nAugust 13, 2017, 8:55pm\n\nLive on\n\nGet Sky Sports Get a Sky Sports pass\n\n\"But on Sunday the real thing starts, with a competitive game and a title at stake against our biggest rivals.\"\n\nDespite failing to win any of their pre-season games, Madrid started the new campaign as they ended last season with another trophy as Zinedine Zidane's men proved too strong for Manchester United to win the UEFA Super Cup 2-1 on Tuesday.\n\nShould Zidane wish to maintain the 4-4-2 system he has utilised to huge success in 2017, Mateo Kovacic is the favourite to replace his suspended Croatian team-mate Luka Modric in midfield.\n\nHowever, Modric's absence increases Cristiano Ronaldo's chances of returning to the Madrid starting XI after making just a brief cameo appearance as a substitute against his former club in Macedonia.\n\nSky Sports Pass\n\nWatch the Premier League for just \u00c2\u00a36.99\n\nRonaldo only returned to training with his teammates last weekend on their return from a tour of the USA having been given an extended break following Portugal's participation in the Confederations Cup and a court appearance in Madrid over allegations of tax evasion.\n\nZidane confirmed on Saturday he will sign a contract extension in the near future with the club he has guided to back-to-back Champions League titles.\n\n\"I'm happy because it's a sign of confidence, that we have done good work,\" Zidane said.\n\n\"I enjoy every

But in the end, Barcelona is Barcelona. We know how they play, and this will not change.\n\n\"Neymar cannot be replaced -- there is nobody like him. But whoever comes in will play very well too.\n\n\"If we think it will be easier [to face Barcelona without Neymar], we are mistaken. The Spanish Super Cup has a special value, and even more against Barcelona. It is a game against the best rival we have.\"\n\nZidane said Cristiano Ronaldo was ready to start despite less than a week of preseason training, adding; \"He is very good, he has had his holidays.\n\n\"He worked very hard physically during his holidays, and he is ready to play now. But we will see the team tomorrow.\"\n\nReports in Spain on Saturday claimed Zidane had agreed a new three-year contract that would see his annual salary double to almost \u20ac8 million.\n\nBut he said: \"I am not worried about this. With my history with this club, it is not about money or contract or anything like that.\n\n\"I know it will end at some point, but I am very happy at the moment. A contract could be 10 years, 20. But I know where I am and what I must do.\n\n\"Maybe in a year's time, you could be gone. Madrid and I, we will never argue about this.\"\n\nAmid discussion over whether playmaker Isco can line up alongside Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, Zidane said all four could play together.\n\nHowever, he did not confirm whether Isco would replace the suspended Luka Modric at the Camp Nou on Sunday.\n\n\"He can be compatible [with Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo], maybe,\" he said. \"You need a mix. It can be done. I can do many things. But we will see.\"\n\nZidane suggested he would prefer the Spanish Super Cup to be decided over a single game rather than two fixtures in the build up to next weekend's La Liga kick-off.\n\n\"It is the way it is,\" he said. \"I would prefer it in one game, but we must play the two games.\"", "time": "11:55:00"}

August.\n\nAndres Iniesta has given Barcelona a major boost ahead of the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup against Real Madrid on Sunday [13 August], returning to training on Friday with the rest of his available teammates. Meanwhile, Los Blancos starlet Jesus Vallejo is expected to miss El Clasico after suffering a muscle injury.\n\nIniesta only made 33 appearances under former manager Luis Enrique last season after he was hit by a series of fitness problems.\n\nThe 33-year-old midfielder set alarms bells ringing at the Nou Camp on Thursday after Barcelona revealed that the captain didn't train with the rest of his teammates - just three days before the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup clash.\n\nBarcelona said that Iniesta had been granted permission from Ernesto Valverde but there was still some uncertainty as the club failed to specify the reasons behind his absence.\n\nHowever, Iniesta allayed any fears on Friday after being pictured back in training as the Catalans continue their preparations for the visit of Real Madrid.\n\nThe Spanish international should therefore be ready to feature in Valverde's starting midfield alongside Sergio Busquets and Ivan Rakitic. Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez are tipped to lead the attack while Gerard Deulofeu could be the chosen one to complete the attacking trident following the shocking departure of Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nThomas Vermaelen and Rafinha Alcantara are expected to be the only Barcelona absentees to face Real Madrid, with the latter having been out of action since undergoing a knee operation in April.\n\nMeanwhile, Zinedine Zidane is likely to be without Vallejo for the first leg of the Super Cup after the club revealed that young centre-back has suffered a muscle injury during their final preparations for the game.\n\n\"Following tests carried out on Jes\u00fas Vallejo at the Sanitas La Moraleja University Hospital, he has been diagnosed with a muscle strain in his left thigh. His recovery will continue to be assessed,\" the club have confirmed.\n\nVallejo, 20, has returned to Real Madrid this summer to fill the gap left by the departure of Pepe after an impressive loan spell at Eintracht Frankfurt. His absence shouldn't be a major concern for Zidane however as he also has Sergio Ramos, Raphael Varane and Nacho to cover the position.\n\nThe boss, however, faces a dilemma over how he forms his midfield with Luka Modric suspended due to a red card picked up in the Spanish Super Cup played against Atletico Madrid three years ago.\n\nMateo Kovacic or new summer signing Dani Ceballos could replace the Croatia international if the Real Madrid boss decides to stick to the 4-4-2 formation that beat Manchester United in the Uefa Super Cup on Tuesday.\n\nZidane also has the option to return to a 4-3-3 formation if Cristiano Ronaldo is 100% ready to start. The reigning Ballon D'or only returned to training last week following his participation in the Confederation Cup with Portugal but did make a cameo appearance against United.\n\nIn that case, Isco could cover Modric's absence in the middle of the park, with Ronaldo forming an attacking trident alongside Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema.", "time": "11:47:00"}

Real Madrid fights Barcelona in the first game of the 2017 Spanish Super Cup on Aug. 13 at 4:00 PM ET. It doesn't get any better than this!\n\nLa Liga doesn't officially start until Aug. 18, but this game might as well be a preview of the two teams competing for the championship: reigning champs Real Madrid will meet their arch-rivals FC Barcelona on the field of Camp Nou in the first leg of the Spanish Super Cup. Yes, two editions of El Clasico before the Spanish Primera Division even begins - how amazing is that? Fans better tune in to see ever kick, block and goooooooal!\n\nThe Reds shot down Barca's offers, the second of which topped \u20ac100, according to ESPN FC. Unlike Neymar, Philippe doesn't have a release clause to the five-year contract he signed in Jan. 2017. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp recently said Barcelona can \"save their energy,\" because the young man was not for sale.\n\nBarcelona still remains an offensive threat, even though one of their better players is now in a different country. Still, they'll have their hands full when they take on Los Blancos. Though Barcelona won El Clasico Miami, 3-2, Real was without Ronaldo. Now, the current reigning Ballon d'Or winner will rejoin his team for this match. Plus, Real has the momentum, having beaten Manchester United in the UEFA Super Cup. Is Real Madrid just currently too much for Barcelona to handle, or will the Blaugrana prove that, even without Neymar, they're still a dangerous threat,\n\nWho do you want to win, HollywoodLifers? Do you think Barcelona will get someone to replace Neymar? Will it even matter?", "time": "17:27:00"}

"body": "As Barcelona veer from one failed transfer move to the next in their desperate attempts to reconstruct a squad reeling from the departure of Neymar, they appear underprepared for the new season, which kicks off in intimidating style with Sunday's Spanish Super Cup first leg against old foes Real Madrid.\n\nIn these uncertain times, losing a key player and scrambling around to replace him, facing the supremely confident European and Spanish champions twice in four days is the last thing Barca need.\n\nThe Catalans may have had a far better preseason tour of the United States than Madrid, who they beat 3-2 in Miami as well as defeating Juventus and Manchester United, but all the positive feeling has dissipated since Neymar left and the mood as the campaign approaches is clouded by pessimism.\n\nPresident Josep Maria Bartomeu put on a brave face at a fans' forum last week by saying the club thought they were in a win-win situation as the Neymar saga was unfolding, insisting they would be in healthy shape thanks to the sudden availability of \u20ac222 million.\n\nBut their transfer dealings in the days that followed have been embarrassing. All has gone quiet on the proposed move for Inigo Martinez, while the club's attempts to bring in Ousmane Dembele and Philippe Coutinho to fill the void left by Neymar have left them looking like bumbling fools.\n\nAnd that's before we even mention the disastrous pursuit of Marco Verratti earlier in the summer and its possible consequences.\n\nThe consensus after losing out on the title last season was that Barca needed two or three signings to be able to wrestle the league back from Madrid, above all a quality right-back and a dynamic midfielder -- maybe two.\n\nSo far, only Gerard Deulofeu and Nelson Semedo have arrived, leaving the midfield, which looked in major need of surgery last season, untouched.\n\nFirst impressions of Semedo, meanwhile, are not exactly glowing and there are many questions about whether Deulofeu has the right attitude to succeed at Barca, even though he was one of the top performers in the 5-0 friendly win over Chapecoense.\n\nBarca's dithering in the transfer market contrasts with the shrewd business Madrid have done in continuing to snap up the best young talent in Spanish football, pipping the Catalans to the signatures of Theo Hernandez and Dani Ceballos.\n\nThe Merengues' dismal preseason was quickly forgotten as they walked all over Manchester United in the Super Cup and Ernesto Valverde's biggest task in his first competitive game in charge of Barca is countering this all powerful Madrid side.\n\nShould the coach persist with the 4-3-3 formation he used for most of preseason, with Deulofeu replacing Neymar, or try and match Madrid in midfield?\n\nPlaying the livewire but unpredictable Deulofeu leaves a midfield three with obvious physical weaknesses exposed against a colossal Madrid containing the muscle of Casemiro, slick passing of Toni Kroos, the energy of Mateo Kovacic (Luka Modric is suspended) and the brilliance of Isco.\n\nBringing in Andre Gomes or the lightweight Denis Suarez will not necessarily solve that problem, and could slow down the team's play.\n\nOf course, Barca have won their last two encounters with Real and with Lionel Messi still at the peak of his powers, they are not exactly underdogs. Yet there is an inescapable feeling they could do with a little more time to work out what type of team they want to be after the seismic departure of Neymar.\n\nSome have argued that Barca are better off without a player who apparently values individual prizes such as the Ballon d'Or and an increased salary above wining trophies with his team.\n\nRivaldo, who also had a painful split from Barca although for very different reasons, has suggested the team's spirit might be better off without Neymar. What nonsense. Neymar was hugely liked in the dressing room and had a brilliant relationship with Messi and Luis Suarez, which the 364 goals the trio scored together in three seasons is testament to.\n\nThe way the Brazilian left the Camp Nou, without making any public declaration or hosting a farewell news conference, has angered Xavi Hernandez, which should be little surprise given the former captain's vision of what type of club Barca should be and what values they should espouse.\n\nBut Barca are unquestionably weaker without the Brazilian, who was such a vital part of the club's present and future. They are still trying to figure out what type of team they want to be now he has gone. And on Sunday night, they may start to realise exactly how much they miss him.", "time": "12:39:00"}

Real would actually be able to speak to him from January onwards about a potential free transfer at the end of the term, while our league rivals would have to wait until the final month of his current deal.\n\nBookmakers are not in belief that our star player will join the Galacticos this summer, despite the obvious whole in their squad following the departure of Morata to Chelsea. He is priced to move to the Bernabeu at between 33/1 (34.0) and 66/1 (67.0), which seems worth a little bet considering the Mbappe deal looks in jeopardy...\n\nCould Zidane convince his board that they need Alexis if Kylian joins PSG or stays put?", "time": "01:15:00"}

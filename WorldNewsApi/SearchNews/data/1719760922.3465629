The extreme turbulence was so severe it caused people and items to be thrown around the cabin. Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old British man, died of a suspected heart attack and dozens more were treated for their injuries. The incident involved a Boeing 777 flying from London's Heathrow airport to Singapore on May 21. The plane, carrying 211 passengers and 18 crew members, was forced to make an emergency landing in Bangkok.

Early findings indicate that the aircraft was passing over the south of Myanmar at 37,000 feet when it began to experience vibration due to changes in the gravitational force. The plane then climbed to an altitude of up to 37,362 feet and increased speed, possibly due to an updraft. The plane's autopilot then sought to pitch the jet downwards to its earlier altitude. \"The aircraft experienced a rapid change in G (gravitational force) ... this likely resulted in the occupants who were not belted up to become airborne\" before falling back down later as the plane rose and fell, said the Ministry. \"The rapid changes in G over the 4.6 second duration resulted in an altitude drop of 178 feet ... this sequence of events likely caused the injuries to the crew and passengers.\" Whilst the turbulence unfolded, a pilot was overheard announcing that the fasten seat belt sign had been activated. The data indicated the pilots manually controlled the plane for 21 seconds in order to stabilise it before re-engaging autopilot. The plane undertook a typical, managed descent and didn't undergo further turbulence until it touched down in Bangkok nearly one hour later, noted the Ministry, adding that the investigation is still ongoing. Passengers recounted the \"sheer terror\" of the aircraft shuddering, items becoming loose and flying about, and injured passengers laying motionless on the cabin floor. Twenty-six individuals were still hospitalised in Bangkok on Wednesday, with earlier reports from hospital authorities indicating that injuries range from spinal or spinal cord damage, head or brain injuries, to damage to bones or internal organs. The cause of the turbulence remains uncertain. While many associate turbulence with severe storms, the most perilous type is known as clear air turbulence. This can occur in thin cirrus clouds or even in clear air near thunderstorms, as temperature and pressure differences generate strong currents of fast-moving air. A 2021 report by the US National Transportation Safety Board revealed that turbulence was responsible for 37.6 per cent of all accidents on larger commercial airlines between 2009 and 2018. The Federal Aviation Administration reported 146 serious injuries from turbulence from 2009 to 2021. Last week, Mr Kitchen's family and friends paid tribute to him, describing him as \"the most wonderful human being that you could ever know\". Lizzie Atkins, a friend of Mr Kitchen, said he and his wife had been planning to go on a cruise in Indonesia before travelling to Australia, describing the pair as \"adventurous travellers\". She told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \"I just can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m having to do this. He was the most wonderful human being that you could ever know, really one of the top ones \u2013 he was stable and reliable and you always knew you were in safe hands with Geoff. He was just a remarkable man, really.\" Singapore Airlines chief executive, Goh Choon Phong, said he offered his \"deepest condolences\" to Mr Kitchen\u2019s family. \"We are deeply saddened by this incident,\" he said. \"We are very sorry for the traumatic experience that everyone on board SQ321 went through.\"", "summary": "Geoff Kitchen, a 73-year-old British man, died of a suspected heart attack", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/world-news/officials-issue-update-cause-singapore-29258253", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/world-news/article29228574.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_thailand-singapore-britain-aviation-accident.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:27:23", "author": "Fionnula Hainey", "authors": ["Fionnula Hainey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.662}

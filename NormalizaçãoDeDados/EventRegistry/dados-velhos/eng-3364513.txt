BMW Concept Z4 is the BMW Group's vision of an ideal modern roadster\n\nThis year's Concours d'Elegance was special for BMW as the company used this iconic car show at Pebble Beach to unveil the new generation BMW Z4 roadster. The new roadster that was revealed is still a concept and the new aggressive design and proper proportions will make it to the production version as well. BMW Concept Z4 gets a dynamic silhouette with large kidney shaped grille, front bumper with huge air-intakes and overall the design impresses and follows the BMW VISION NEXT 100 design philosophy. BMW Z4 will go into production next year and that's when the production model will be revealed but expects it to be very similar to this BMW Z4 Concept. \"The BMW Concept Z4 in an all-out driving machine,\" said Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design. \"Stripping the car back to the bare essentials allows the driver to experience all the ingredients of motoring pleasure with supreme directness. This is total freedom on four wheels.\" BMW Concept Z4 has been co-developed with the 2018 Toyota Supra (Coupe-only) which is also expected to hit the global markets in 2018. BMW Concept Z4 is the BMW Group's vision of an ideal modern roadster \"The BMW Concept Z4 expresses the new BMW design language from all perspectives and in all details. From the dynamic-looking front to the striking flanks to the clean-cut tail end: a few lines and the subtle interplay between surfaces are enough to generate a sense of power and emotion,\" adds van Hooydonk.\n\nNow the new roadster does follow the classical roadster design cues, such as a long wheelbase, a low-slung, stretched silhouette and a compact rear end. The concept Z4 gets shorter bonnet than the previous generation Z4 and crisp overhangs ensure the driver sits closer to the centre of the car than in previous BMW roadsters. This has lead to getting new proportions to enhance sporty and agile feel. It features large domes stretching out rearwards from the cabin integrating the function of rollover bars and provide a sporting conclusion to the low-to-the-road silhouette at the rear.\n\nIf reports are to be believed then both Toyota Supra and BMW Z4 will get a hybrid engine that will combine the power from both petrol and electric motor built by BMW. It will be powered by a four-wheel drive engine and the electric motor will help to improve the acceleration of the respective cars. BMW has also confirmed that Z4 will get rear-drive with regular petrol engine too. Reports suggest that the platform of the car will be shared by both BMW and Toyota and is built by BMW after the company was successful in building a light-weight platform by using aluminum and carbon-fibre which is used in its BMW i8. BMW concept Z4 gets 20-inch light-alloy wheels.\n\nThe chemistry between the interior and exterior of the BMW Concept Z4 is evident in both forms and colour scheme. On the inside, BMW has given a three-dimensional character and adopts the colour of the car body, creating a clear visual link between the interior and exterior. The instrument cluster and central information display form a cluster of screens that are integrated into the driver's cockpit. The two displays are now positioned at almost the same height and in close proximity to one another, which gives the impression of a single, cohesive unit. It also features a head-up display giving key driving information within the driver's direct field of view.", "id": "9877094", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "BMW Concept Z4 unveiled, to hit production in 2018", "image": "http://images.financialexpress.com/2017/08/BMW-Concept-Z4-small.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota"}, "id": "303971", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer"}, "id": "304041", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Electric motor"}, "id": "305540", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_motor"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheelbase"}, "id": "307157", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coup\u00e9"}, "id": "307533", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup\u00e9"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}, "id": "308030", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Four-wheel drive"}, "id": "308032", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-wheel_drive"}, {"label": {"eng": "Car classification"}, "id": "316483", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_classification"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}, "id": "331901", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_layout#Rear_wheel_drive_layouts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hood (vehicle)"}, "id": "338861", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hood_(vehicle)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota Supra"}, "id": "339778", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Supra"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW i8"}, "id": "349600", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_i8"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hybrid vehicle"}, "id": "362311", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_vehicle"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M4"}, "id": "386136", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrian van Hooydonk"}, "id": "438406", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_van_Hooydonk"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "11:01:00"}

To say it's starting ...\n\nHaving debuted in 2009, the current E89-generation BMW Z4 is the Bavarian brand's oldest car on sale by a long shot. To say it's starting to show its age would be an understatement. While it's still actually a good looking car on the outside, absolutely everything else about it is getting old. The cabin, while different and still interesting, just feels so dated. The power, performance, handling and response all feel old and not in the good, classic-BMW way. The BMW Z4 is in desperate need of replacement. Thankfully, a replacement is coming.\n\nAt this year's Concours d'Elegance at Pebble Beach, BMW will be showing off its plans for the Z4's future. While we won't actually see the new Z4 at Pebble, the BMW Concept Z4 will debut, giving us a glimpse of the direction for the upcoming roadster replacement. And it looks good.\n\n\"The BMW Concept Z4 in an all-out driving machine,\" said Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design. \"Stripping the car back to the bare essentials allows the driver to experience all the ingredients of motoring pleasure with supreme directness. This is total freedom on four wheels.\"\n\nIn these Concept Z4 photos, you can see that BMW is focused on driving more than tech, features or luxury. This does seem like a more driver-focused machine than many other concepts to come from the Bavarians in recent memory. It gets all of the typical BMW roadster design cues, aggressive lines and a simple, driver-oriented cabin. All of which make it the classic BMW roadster, just with a more modern twist. \"The BMW Concept Z4 expresses the new BMW design language from all perspectives and in all details. From the dynamic looking front to the striking flanks to the clean-cut tail end: a few lines and the subtle interplay between surfaces are enough to generate a sense of power and emotion,\" adds van Hooydonk.\n\nThe classic elements are there. A short rear deck, long hood, compact size and short overhangs. It's all there to remind you that this is an old-school sports car. But its aggressive flanks, massive air intakes and nostrils show that this is a modern, real-deal sports car. This isn't a roadster for grannies. The new Z4 means business. Just look at the guy kicking sand, he's no joke.\n\nBMW's also going back to some of its roots with the new Concept Z4. According to the Bavarians, a lot of this concept's design was inspired by older cars, such as the original Mille Miglia-winning roadster, the BMW 328. I personally love the double-bubble style roofline, which looks like a proper racing roadster and really gives it character. We know those two humps won't make it to the production car, as we've seen spy photos of that car and they aren't there but they still look great. Maybe if Zagato makes another Z4, they'll return.\n\nOut back, the extremely thin horizontal taillights accentuate how wide and low this car is. Yet, the classic BMW \"L-shape\" is still present, just simpler than ever. The look really good, as they flank the built-in decklid spoiler. The massive vertical air intakes are reminiscent of the 8 Series Concept that recently debuted, which shows that BMW does have a specific design language moving forward. The exhaust pipes look better on this Concept Z4 than on the 8 Series Concept as well. They're simple and horizontal but look perfectly sporty.\n\nInside, the classic sports car with a modern twist theme carries on. The three-spoke steering wheel is simple and elegant, yet futuristic and modern. I do like how the horizontal spokes are floating and don't touch the horn. It looks sort of like a McLaren steering wheel, actually, which is a compliment. The instrument binnacle is completely digital, and similar to that of the 8 Series Concept as well, but is simple with just two digital dials. Looking down at the center console and you'll see a lot of familiar BMW Concept traits. The starter button is not next to the shifter. The shift lever is new and not the same oddly-shaped level we're used to today. And the iDrive controller is there as well.\n\nAside from those massive red paddle shifters add some flamboyance but this is a simple cockpit, overall. While this is a very concept-y cabin, it does have a lot of modern BMW elements that could make it to production. Just look at the triangular shapes on the dash and the way the iDrive screen meets the dashboard, it's reminiscent of the new BMW X3 we've recently seen. Also, much like the current Z4 and old-school BMWs, the center stack and iDrive system seem angled toward the driver, proving that this is a driver-oriented cabin.\n\nWe don't know how myuch of this design will make it to the final production car, though BMW insists that there are a lot of elements on this Concept Z4 that will make it to production. We're hoping a lot of it does, as this is a very pretty car, indeed. It brings back the old-school roadster styling that we love from classic BMWs like the Z3 and Z4, yet adds a modern twist and BMW's current design language. I think it's safe to say that if the upcoming Z4 looks anything like this BMW Concept Z4, we're in for a real treat.", "id": "9654171", "details": {"liCnt": 91}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "WORLD PREMIERE: BMW Concept Z4", "image": "http://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/BMW-Z4-Concept-11.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sports car"}, "id": "307173", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}, "id": "307528", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}, "id": "308030", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Semi-automatic transmission"}, "id": "308035", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_transmission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IDrive"}, "id": "357583", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDrive"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW X3"}, "id": "362331", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_X3"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M4"}, "id": "386136", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z4"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW 328"}, "id": "438331", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_328"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrian van Hooydonk"}, "id": "438406", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_van_Hooydonk"}, {"label": {"eng": "1956 Mille Miglia"}, "id": "485143", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Miglia"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW Z4 (E89)"}, "id": "570864", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z4_(E89)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "09:38:00"}

BMW rethought the proportions in a bid to provide it with a more focused look. \"A shorter bonnet and crisp overhangs ensure the driver sits closer to the centre of the car than in previous BMW roadsters,\" said van Hooydonk. The approach signals BMW's determination to shift the Z4 further upmarket. During the car's development, BMW board members considered renaming it. However, the German car maker's naming system groups even numbers among its coupe\u0301s and cabriolets, so the long-mooted Z5 badge was never seriously considered.\n\nA BMW source said: \"We would have had to call it the Z6. And while there has been a move upmarket, it's not quite big enough to warrant that name. In the end, we settled on retaining the Z4 name.\"\n\nThe Concept Z4 features another interpretation of BMW's signature kidney grille, seen recently on the Concept X2 and Concept 8 Series.\n\nIn place of the customary vertical bars, the insides of the kidney grille feature a new mesh that van Hooydonk said was inspired by the functional treatment used on early BMW roadsters, including the iconic 328 Mille Miglia.\n\nThe long bonnet, meanwhile, retains the clamshell design of previous Z4 models. On the concept, it features two vents. However, these are unlikely to make production, according to Autocar's sources.\n\nCertain licence has also been taken with the concept's windscreen, which does not have the sturdy surround of the production version, and the two metallic domes conceived to act as rollover protection will be replaced by more conventional rollover hoops on the production roadster.\n\nAlthough BMW has yet to officially confirm it, the new Z4 eschews the folding hard-top of today's model for a traditional fabric hood. Already sighted on prototype versions of the two-seater, the hood folds and stows underneath a dedicated tonneau cover at the rear of the cabin.\n\nBMW has provided a clear glimpse of the look and layout of the new Z4's interior. The production car will have a flowing dashboard and relatively wide centre console resembling those of the concept. Features such as the digital instrument panel and head-up display included in the show car will also make their way on to the new roadster. However, the brushed aluminium and carbonfibre trims will be replaced by more cost-effective composite plastic materials.\n\nAccommodation is said to have improved thanks to the car's increased overall dimensions. Boot capacity is also claimed to top the 310 litres of the outgoing Z4.\n\nThe new Z4 is underpinned by BMW's CLAR (cluster architecture) platform. It is already used by the 2, 5 and 7 Series and is also set to be adopted by the upcoming 8 Series and the successor to today's 3 Series. The CLAR platform is allied to a multi-material body structure, featuring a combination of high-strength steel, aluminium and magnesium. Insiders suggest the new roadster will tip the scales at under 1400kg in its most basic form, despite the increase in dimensions.\n\nAn internal BMW document seen by Autocar revealed that the new Z4 will be offered with a choice of two petrol engines from the start of sales. The first is a turbocharged 2.0-litre four-cylinder unit expected to develop around 181bhp in the Z4 sDrive20i and 248bhp in the Z4 sDrive30i. The second engine powers the Z4 M40i and is the latest incarnation of BMW's B58 turbocharged 3.0-litre in-line six-cylinder engine. It is rumoured to develop the same 355bhp as it does in the X4 M40i.\n\nA full-blown M version of the roadster, running the BMW performance car division's 425bhp twin-turbo 3.0-litre in-line six-cylinder, has also been mooted, but it has yet to be officially confirmed by BMW.\n\nTrue to tradition, the three initial Z4 models retain the rear-wheel-drive layout that has been part of the two-seat roadster's appeal since its introduction in 2002. Buyers are set to be offered the choice of a six-speed manual or eight-speed automatic in combination with all engines.\n\nProduction of the new Z4 and Supra will start at the plant of Austrian manufacturing specialist Magna in early 2018.", "id": "9766280", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW Concept Z4 shows bold design direction of upcoming roadster", "image": "https://images.cdn.autocar.co.uk/sites/autocar.co.uk/files/images/car-reviews/first-drives/legacy/bmw-z4-2017-0076.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "76", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}, "id": "302572", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aluminium"}, "id": "304043", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aluminium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twin-turbo"}, "id": "307162", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-turbo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inline-four engine"}, "id": "307168", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline-four_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}, "id": "307580", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}, "id": "308030", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Convertible"}, "id": "314839", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible"}, {"label": {"eng": "Magnesium"}, "id": "318288", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head-up display"}, "id": "327071", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Straight-six engine"}, "id": "327073", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-six_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW 3 Series"}, "id": "327076", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_3_Series"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "339744", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota Supra"}, "id": "339778", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Supra"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Geneva Motor Show"}, "id": "362317", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Motor_Show"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW 7 Series"}, "id": "372316", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_7_Series"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tonneau"}, "id": "373944", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonneau"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hardtop"}, "id": "422944", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardtop"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrian van Hooydonk"}, "id": "438406", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_van_Hooydonk"}, {"label": {"eng": "1956 Mille Miglia"}, "id": "485143", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Miglia"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 659, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "08:06:00"}

It is a preview of the production car that BMW says is set \"to be revealed over the course of next year.\" The next-generation Z4 is expected to go on sale in the U.S. in the first half of 2019.\n\nBMW Group design chief Adrian van Hooydonk says the Z4 concept \"expresses the new BMW design language from all perspectives and in all details.\"\n\n\"Stripping the car back to the essentials allows the driver to experience all the ingredients of motoring pleasure with supreme directness,\" Hooydonk said in a statement. \"This is total freedom on four wheels.\"\n\nCompact, sporty cars are a small but bright spot in an overall U.S. car market that is expected to shrink for the fourth consecutive year in 2017. U.S. sales of small sporty cars, largely behind the Mazda MX-5 Miata and Fiat Spider, are up 9 percent this year while the overall car market has slumped 12 percent.\n\nThe last Z4 went out of production in August 2016. BMW is working with Toyota to jointly develop the Z4's replacement and a Toyota sports coupe speculated to be a revived Toyota Supra. The cars will use a new lightweight platform, and the next-generation Z4 is expected to grow in size.\n\nThe Concept Z4 has classic roadster design cues such as a long wheelbase, a low-slung and stretched silhouette and a compact rear end. But a shorter hood and \"crisp\" overhangs in the wedge-shaped concept put the driver closer to the center of the car than in previous BMW roadsters, the company says.\n\nIt also notes that juxtaposition of the low-set kidney grille and higher-up headlights makes for a deliberate association with the old BMW Z8. Instead of the customary bars, the inside of the kidney grille uses an elaborate mesh meant to recall the design of early BMW roadsters such as the BMW 328 Mille Miglia. The vehicle's interior is designed for a total focus on the driving experience. Display screens are integrated into the driver's cockpit, and all controls are grouped into what are called function islands.\n\nThere had been speculation that the Z4's successor would be named the Z5, but that will not happen. Whether the new car will include a manual transmission had been in question. But reports indicate that a manual will be offered, along with new four- and six-cylinder engines. A plug-in hybrid variant is possible. A fabric roof will replace the retractable hard top on the previous-generation Z4.", "id": "9741844", "details": {"liCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW remaps the roadster with Concept Z4", "image": "http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CA/20170817/OEM03/170819821/AR/0/AR-170819821.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1152, "date": "2016-08-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1163}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "227084", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota"}, "id": "303971", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheelbase"}, "id": "307157", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coup\u00e9"}, "id": "307533", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup\u00e9"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manual transmission"}, "id": "307839", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concept car"}, "id": "319256", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota Supra"}, "id": "339778", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Supra"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mazda MX-5"}, "id": "354960", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazda_MX-5"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW 328"}, "id": "438331", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_328"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrian van Hooydonk"}, "id": "438406", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_van_Hooydonk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fiat 124 Sport Spider"}, "id": "445817", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_124_Sport_Spider"}, {"label": {"eng": "1956 Mille Miglia"}, "id": "485143", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Miglia"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW Z8 (E52)"}, "id": "706328", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z8_(E52)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Monterey Car Week"}, "id": "1425191", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Car_Week"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 420, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Thematic", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Thematic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}], "time": "17:14:00"}

Nevertheless, the four-eyed cluster design carries on.\n\nCould the new Concept Z4 be taking design cues from the 2001 Z8 too?\n\nSandwiched between the headlights is a re-interpretation of the kidney grille, which trades its renowned vertical slats for a mesh look, similar to higher-spec versions of the new-gen Hyundai i30.\n\nA large dome stretches rearwards from either passenger seat's headrest, incorporating rollover bars while enhancing the rear-wheel drive Z4's sporting intent.\n\nThe large domes stretch back from the seats to enhance the Concept Z4's sporting intent.\n\nAir breathers behind the front wheel arches aid aerodynamic flow, and add an aggressive styling cue.\n\nSlim L-shaped tail-lights feature at the rear end, as well as an integrated bootlid spoiler and prominent carbon-fibre diffuser, complementing the Z4's swollen rear wheelarches.\n\nA series of creases and precise lines fold into one, creating an overall sculpted, muscular exterior.\n\nFinished in 'Energetic Orange' matte paint, the Z4 concept rides on bi-colour 20-inch double-spoke alloy wheels.\n\nThe Z4 Concept's driver focused interior.\n\nInside, the driver-focused cockpit is blacked out in contrast to the passenger-side's orange highlights, while the digital displays for the instrument cluster and multimedia system are parallel.\n\nA head-up display is also included, while all in-car controls are grouped by function, contributing to the cabin's minimalist approach.\n\nAccording to BMW Group Design senior vice-president Adrian van Hooydonk, the Concept Z4 is an example of open-top motoring in its purest form.\n\n\"The BMW Concept Z4 in an all-out driving machine,\" he said.\n\n\"Stripping the car back to the bare essentials allows the driver to experience all the ingredients of motoring pleasure with supreme directness. This is total freedom on four wheels.\n\n\"The BMW Concept Z4 in an all-out driving machine\"\n\n\"The BMW Concept Z4 expresses the new BMW design language from all perspectives and in all details. From the dynamic-looking front to the striking flanks to the clean-cut tail end, a few lines and the subtle interplay between surfaces are enough to generate a sense of power and emotion.\"\n\nEngine options are yet to be confirmed, but a BMW internal document leaked recently suggests a pair of 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder petrol engines and one 3.0-litre turbo-petrol six will be on offer.\n\nFurthermore, a six-speed manual gearbox or eight-speed automatic transmission is likely to be offered.\n\nThe Z4 could break out in production trim as soon as the Geneva motor show in March next year, with a local debut to likely take place later in 2018.\n\nToyota is expected to introduce its sportscar from the aforementioned partnership at the Tokyo motor show in October, with the rumour mill speculating the Supra nameplate will be resurrected.", "id": "9769545", "details": {"liCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW Z4 concept revealed ahead of Pebble Beach Concours",

The sides of the roadster are heavily sculpted, and the large vent behind the front wheels forms the basis for body creases that extend to the rear wheels. Out back, the lights and overall design mimic that of the Concept 8 Series, only on a smaller scale.\n\n\"The BMW Concept Z4 in an all-out driving machine,\" said Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design. \"Stripping the car back to the bare essentials allows the driver to experience all the ingredients of motoring pleasure with supreme directness.

In addition, the Z4 will continue to be powered by four- or six-cylinder engines. More specifically, there will be a Z4 sDrive 30i, which has a turbocharged inline-4 rated at around 250 horsepower. There will also be the Z4 M40i powered by a turbocharged inline-6 generating in excess of 350 horsepower.\n\nWe should also mention that the Z4 will form the basis for the next generation Toyota Supra (MKV).

The Concept Z4, like the Concept 8 Series before it, gives us a preview of the new BMW Z4, which should debut in the next year or so -- again, just like the 8 Series.\n\nIn terms of traditional roadster aesthetics, it's all here. There's a low-slung body, a long hood, room for just two people and a roof that doesn't look like it'll be all that fun to have up. The seats are practically resting atop the rear axle, which makes the car look fast even while sitting still. The headlights sit rather high on the car -- BMW points to the Z8 for inspiration here.\n\nInside is actually pretty straightforward. It's very car-like, with a collection of physical switches for certain vehicle and infotainment functions. There's a somewhat-standard-looking shifter in place, and an infotainment screen that rises from the dash just as it would in other new Bimmers.\n\nOf course, there are some ridiculous flourishes in there. There's a lap timer built into the bottom of the steering wheel, the gauges look like they're from a different decade, and the seats are two different colors -- and two different materials entirely. It's a very serious car, since it's destined for production, but BMW still had a load of fun putting this together, it appears.\n\nBeing a concept, BMW didn't really delve into powertrains. It's believed that when the Z4 comes to production, it will carry both four- and six-cylinder engines, like most of the rest of BMW's lineup. The Z4's underpinnings, which were developed in a joint venture with Toyota, will also live on as the next-generation Toyota Supra.\n\nIt's a weird world we're in, where a BMW Z4 can also be a Toyota Supra.

As its name clearly implies, the Concept Z4 is an early look at the next-generation BMW Z4 that the German company is currently developing with partner Toyota.\n\nThe Concept Z4 is sharp, sporty, and futuristic. It remains a two-seater, but it's considerably more low-slung than the last Z4 BMW stopped building about a year ago. Its front end signals the return of the so-called shark nose, a styling cue that defined BMWs of all shapes and sizes from the 1960s to the 1990s. Wide kidney grilles with mesh inserts and swept-back headlights bring the Concept Z4 in line with the company's current design language.\n\nWhen viewed from the side, the concept is characterized by a low front end that suggests the engine is front-mid-mounted, a long hood, and a raked A-pillar. It boasts the traditional roadster proportions that get an enthusiast's heart pumping. The roll bars are integrated into a pair of tunnels that begin right after the passenger compartment and gently slope down towards the rear of the car to echo some of BMW's classic roadsters.\n\nBased on the snazzy looks alone, the Concept Z4 will fit right in at Pebble Beach, where it will share lawn space with some of the world's most sought-after vintage machines. BMW chose to focus on design, and it's not telling us what's under the hood. The company nonetheless suggests the Concept Z4 is one of the most driver-focused two-seater roadsters it has ever built.\n\n\"The BMW Concept Z4 is an all-out driving machine. Stripping the car back to the bare essentials allows the driver to experience all the ingredients of motoring pleasure with supreme directness. This is total freedom on wheels,\" said Adrian van Hooydonk, the senior vice president of BMW's design department.\n\nWe have good news if you like what you see. You can't buy the Concept Z4, but it will spawn a production model that's tentatively scheduled to go on sale in 2018. That means we'll likely see the third-generation Z4 for the first time next year at the Geneva Auto Show, and it will arrive in showrooms in time for the 2019 model year. Toyota's version of the car will resurrect the storied Supra nameplate when it arrives at about the same time.\n\nThe concept isn't the only thing we'll see from BMW in Pebble Beach. The company will show the 8 Series Concept in the United States for the very first time. Introduced at the Villa d'Este Concours d'Elegance, it accurately previews an upcoming production model. It is also entering two classic race cars -- a 1975 3.0 CSL and a 1972 Alpina 2002ti -- in the Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion.", "id": "9766271", "details": {"liCnt": 4, "pinCnt": 4}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "The BMW Z4 concept promises to bring shark-nose styling back to the brand", "image": "https://icdn5.digitaltrends.com/image/bmw-concept-z4-2-510x0.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "228859", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach,_California", "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Heart"}, "id": "302554", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Departments of France"}, "id": "303465", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Departments_of_France"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota"}, "id": "303971", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "311537", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Model year"}, "id": "312864", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_year"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "id": "313955", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark"}, {"label": {"eng": "Convertible"}, "id": "314839", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kidney"}, "id": "316248", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "339744", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pillar (automobile)"}, "id": "344568", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pillar_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Geneva Motor Show"}, "id": "362317", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Motor_Show"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M4"}, "id": "386136", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrian van Hooydonk"}, "id": "438406", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_van_Hooydonk"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "15:06:00"}

The air intakes are low and wide, giving a focused look. Carbon-fiber elements grace the front and the rear diffuser while the car is painted in a BMW Frozen color, Energetic Orange, a theme that is repeated inside the car.\n\nThe 20-inch wheels on Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 rubber are perfect for the sporty character of the car.\n\nInside, the classic sports car with a modern twist theme carries on. The three-spoke steering wheel is simple and elegant, yet futuristic and modern. Aside from those massive red paddle shifters add some flamboyance but this is a simple cockpit, overall. Instrumentation is displayed via a TFT screen, with a clockwise speedometer on the left and a counterclockwise tachometer on the right. While this is a very concept-y cabin, it does have a lot of modern BMW elements that could make it to production.\n\nBMW didn't really delve into powertrains for the concept.

(Our first look was the Concept 8 Series, which was unveiled in May at the Concorzo Villa d'Este and made its North American debut alongside the Concept Z4.)\n\nAccording to BMW, classical roadster design cues adopted by the Concept Z4 include a long wheelbase, low-slung and stretched silhouette, and a compact rear end. BMW wrapped all these in a fresh, confident package with big brakes, aggressive styling (including a shorter hood and crisper overhangs that ensure the driver sits closer to the center of the car than in previous BMW roadsters), and a low roofline to signal the two-door's performance credentials.\n\nDouble speed humps project an old school roadster charm while directing your eyes toward the rear of the car, which resembles Infiniti's Q60 coupe except with slimmer, L-shaped lights.\n\nInside the cabin, there's a two-tone duality that separates the driver and passenger with contrasting brown and black leather...and that's where BMW's fresh design flourishes end, as the rest of the cabin is very similar to the rest of the current BMW lineup. This isn't a wild concept in any stretch of the imagination. We do like the integrated red paddle shifters and what appears to be a lap-timer at the base of the steering wheel.\n\nThe car is finished in a coat called Energetic Orange Frozen that helps showcase the contrasts of \"light and shade\" in the car's surfaces and accentuates the \"three-dimensionality of the exterior.\" 20-inch light-alloy wheels provide the last touches.\n\nShow more\n\nAs for drivetrains and specific mechanicals, BMW has remained mum about what moves this concept or what the future production will be motivated by. What we do know is that the upcoming Z4 is a joint venture with Toyota that will share its chassis with the reimagined Supra that's set to debut sometime in the very near future. Both are likely to receive some form of turbocharged six-cylinder, but whether that is a BMW powerplant or a new engine from Toyota is yet to be seen.\n\nFor now, all we have are the beautiful pictures and stunning lines of the Concept Z4 and van Hooydonk adding, \"Stripping the car back to the bare essentials allows the driver to experience all the ingredients of motoring pleasure with supreme directness. This is total freedom on four wheels.\" If that's the plan for the production car, we can't wait to get behind the wheel.", "id": "9742607", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Hello, Beautiful: BMW Concept Z4 Unveiled in Monterey | Automobile Magazine", "image": "http://st.automobilemag.com/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/BMW-Concept-Z4-Moving-Side-.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Carmel-by-the-Sea"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "227146", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel-by-the-Sea,_California", "label": {"eng": "Carmel-by-the-Sea"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheel"}, "id": "303773", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota"}, "id": "303971", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheelbase"}, "id": "307157", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}, "id": "307528", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coup\u00e9"}, "id": "307533", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup\u00e9"}, {"label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}, "id": "307580", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger"}, {"label": {"eng": "Leather"}, "id": "307592", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather"}, {"label": {"eng": "Semi-automatic transmission"}, "id": "308035", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_transmission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Powertrain"}, "id": "314837", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain"}, {"label": {"eng": "Straight-six engine"}, "id": "327073", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-six_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "339744", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infiniti"}, "id": "348309", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infiniti"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrian van Hooydonk"}, "id": "438406", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_van_Hooydonk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Villa d'Este"}, "id": "535706", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_d'Este"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 420, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Thematic", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Thematic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "17:18:00"}

Under the hood, there will be a range of turbocharged four and six cylinder engines. The rear-wheel drive system will be retained while the transmission will be an eight-speed automatic.

The two cars share a common platform, suspension and driveline but have been conceived to appeal to differing buyers, with the latter set to be offered exclusively in coupe form so as not to compete directly with the BMW Z4.\n\nThe unveiling of the Concept Z4 comes more than six months before BMW plans to unveil the production version of the new Z4 at the Geneva auto show in 2018, with North American sales launching during the second half of next year.\n\nWhile some of its more flamboyant design flourishes are to be toned down before the Z4 reaches showrooms, the overall styling and detailing of the concept is claimed to be very close to the production version.\n\n\"It expresses the new BMW design language from all perspective and in all details,\" says Adrian van Hooydonk, senior vice president-BMW Group Design. \"From the dynamic-looking front to the striking flanks to the clean-cut tail: a few lines and the subtle interplay between surfaces are enough to generate a sense of power.\"\n\nIt is bigger, too, with a longer wheelbase and wider tracks adding greater confidence to its appearance. Van Hooydonk says his design team rethought the proportions in a bid to provide the new car with a more focused look. \"A shorter bonnet and crisp overhangs ensure the driver sits closer to the center of the car than in previous BMW roasters,\" he says, adding, \"The outline of the car follows a distinct wedge shape.\"\n\nThe new approach signals BMW's determination to move the new Z4, codenamed G29, further upmarket. At various stages during its development BMW board members considered renaming it. However, the German automaker's naming system groups even numbers among its coupes and cabriolets, so the long-discussed Z5 name never was seriously considered.\n\n\"We would have had to call it the Z6. And while there has been a move upmarket, it's not quite big enough to warrant that name. In the end, we settled on the retaining the Z4 name,\" a BMW source tells WardsAuto.\n\nUp front, the Concept Z4 features yet another interpretation of BMW's signature kidney grille - the third in less than a year after that of the Concept X2 and Concept 8-Series. In place of the customary vertical bars, the insides of the low-set kidney grille feature a new mesh treatment van Hooydonk says was inspired by the functional treatment used on early BMW roadsters, including the iconic 328 Mille Miglia.\n\nBookmarking the new-look grille are large headlamps housing separate vertically stacked LED corona lamps for the daytime running lamps and main beams. The indicator units point diagonally toward the kidney grille from above. The long hood, meanwhile, retains the clamshell design of previous Z4 models. On the concept, it features two longitudinal vents to accentuate its length.", "id": "9739741", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW Unveils Concept Z4 Roadster at Pebble Beach",

It's a long, low, wide design, with big air intakes and massive wheels hinting at its performance focus. In fact, says van Hooydonk, \"the car has become a lot more dynamic than any Z4\" before it.\n\nUp front, a new headlight design and a wider grille shape redefine the nose of BMW roadsters: \"Overall we have a completely new facial expression,\" says van Hooydonk. And moving to the side, note that the clamshell hood's shutline runs into a body crease that stretches toward the rear of the car. \"There is really only one line that matters,\" van Hooydonk explains, with a \"very interesting play, we believe, between sharp lines and soft body areas.\"\n\nMoving inside, it's notable that the driver's side is finished in black while the left-hand side of the interior is finished in tan. Van Hooydonk says that's a way to emphasize that this car is aimed at performance driving. \"The cockpit is really center around the driver, both in geometry and in color,\" he says. There's an automatic transmission shifter in the console - a bummer for anyone hoping for a stick-shift Z4 - and a racy steering wheel with a red \"race\" button on its rim.\n\nThis concept car - along with the 8 Series concept - is our first look at BMW's next generation of styling cues. Van Hooydonk says one of the big goals with the new design language was making it \"cleaner.\" Where car design had for several years been adding ever more lines and creases, the new BMW language will have fewer of them. He says that BMW realized it could still create striking cars but without using as many lines.\n\n\"The form language will become cleaner, more precise,\" he says.\n\nHe also notes that previously, BMW would wait a long time to introduce new styling cues, often as long as a decade. Now, he says, designers try to push out new design language as soon as possible on new vehicles.\n\nBMW Z4\n\nMSRP $50,695\n\nExplore Build More photos BMW Z4 Concept BMW Z4 Concept official pics leaked 2018 BMW Z4 new spy images from the Nurburgring 2018 BMW Z4 screenshots from spy video 2019 BMW Z4 new spy photos BMW Z4 Viper Swap\n\nVan Hooydonk - who has spent his entire car-design career at BMW since starting in 1992 - draws a distinction between concepts like this, which are a realistic impression of an upcoming vehicle, and BMW's \"Vision\" concepts, which give a much more fanciful, forward-looking idea of how BMW could tackle future design issues. (See last year's Vision Next 100 concept, for instance.)\n\nAs a result, what you see here is very close to what you'll see in a BMW showroom in 2018.

The last Z-model was released almost nine years ago, and the BMW Z4 Concept is finally back again with a bold design. The concept study of the new two-seater from Munich will be celebrating its world debut today at the 2017 the Concours d'Elegance Pebble Beach and was not only eagerly awaited by BMW enthusiasts all over the world, but also by many Japanese customers - the BMW Z4 G29 represent the technical basis of the new Toyota Supra J29 and thus provides some indications as to the cornerstones of the upcoming Nippon sports car.\n\nBoth in Europe and in Asia, the focus is on the essentials of a roadster - a long bonnet, a compact interior with space for two people and a short rear end which is indispensable, above all, in relation to the driving pleasure. Compared to previous Z models, the hood and overhangs are somewhat shorter, the occupants tend to be slightly more advanced than before. All side-dominant design features point towards the driven rear wheels, emphasizing the agility of the BMW Z4.\n\n20-inch wheels and the matte paint finish in Frozen Energetic Orange all contribute to the fact that the BMW Z4 will attract a lot of attention among the rare cars of the Concours d'Elegance in Pebble Beach. The narrow, L-shaped taillights look futuristic and deflect the eye on the rear spoiler integrated into the trunk hood.\n\nThe cockpit of the 2018 BMW Z4 Concept was designed primarily for an optimal driving experience. The cockpit is clearly oriented to the driver, a large free-standing infotainment touchscreen is practically at a height with the full-digital instrument display behind the steering wheel and a head-up display provides another way to display information to the driver.\n\nAs usual, BMW does not express itself as a driving force behind the concept car. Finally, the focus of the study is on design. An open secret, however, is that the serial vehicle planned for 2018 will provide both variants of the turbo four-cylinder engine B48 and the six-cylinder petrol engine B58 for propulsion.", "id": "9654179", "details": {"liCnt": 71}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "LEAKED: New BMW Concept Z4", "image": "http://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/BMW-Z4-Concept-27.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "M\u00fcnchen"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "106391", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich", "label": {"eng": "M\u00fcnchen"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "228859", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach,_California", "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "id": "302869", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303048", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303540", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sports car"}, "id": "307173", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}, "id": "307528", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "311537", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Touchscreen"}, "id": "312182", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchscreen"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cockpit"}, "id": "316353", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockpit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concept car"}, "id": "319256", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head-up display"}, "id": "327071", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota Supra"}, "id": "339778", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Supra"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M4"}, "id": "386136", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Paint sheen"}, "id": "1290513", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint_sheen"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 658, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 659, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 785, "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Store Fixtures", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Store_Fixtures"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "09:38:00"}

BMW sources say the Concept Z4 is fairly close to the upcoming production car, which is slated to launch as a 2019 model by this time next year. The concept shows the typical BMW roadster design cues, aggressive lines and a simple, driver-oriented cabin. All of which make it the classic BMW roadster, just with a more modern twist.\n\n\"The BMW Concept Z4 expresses the new BMW design language from all perspectives and in all details. From the dynamic looking front to the striking flanks to the clean-cut tail end: a few lines and the subtle interplay between surfaces are enough to generate a sense of power and emotion,\" says Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design.\n\nThe classic elements are there. A short rear deck, long hood, compact size and short overhangs. It's all there to remind you that this is an old-school sports car. But its aggressive flanks, massive air intakes and nostrils show that this is a modern, real-deal sports car. According to the Bavarians, a lot of this concept's design was inspired by older cars, such as the original Mille Miglia-winning roadster, the BMW 328.\n\nInside, the classic sports car with a modern twist theme carries on. The three-spoke steering wheel is simple and elegant, yet futuristic and modern. Aside from those massive red paddle shifters add some flamboyance but this is a simple cockpit, overall. While this is a very concept-y cabin, it does have a lot of modern BMW elements that could make it to production.", "id": "9763746", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW Z4 Concept - First Video", "image": "http://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/BMW-Z4-Concept-28.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sports car"}, "id": "307173", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}, "id": "307528", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Semi-automatic transmission"}, "id": "308035", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_transmission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW 328"}, "id": "438331", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_328"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrian van Hooydonk"}, "id": "438406", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_van_Hooydonk"}, {"label": {"eng": "1956 Mille Miglia"}, "id": "485143", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Miglia"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 420, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Thematic", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Thematic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "19:33:00"}

The orange droptop will brighten the Concept Lawn of the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance for its only North American public showing on Sunday, August 20.\n\n\"The BMW Concept Z4 expresses the new BMW design language from all perspectives and in all details,\" Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design, said in the roadster's announcement. \"From the dynamic- looking front to the striking flanks to the clean-cut tail end: a few lines and the subtle interplay between surfaces are enough to generate a sense of power and emotion.\"\n\nBMW says that the Z4 Concept takes inspiration from the company's past roadsters, but there's nothing retro about this shape. In fact, the design team moves away from some of the firm's traditional styling cues. For example, the vertically oriented headlights diverge from the horizontal layout that's generally the norm for the German brand's vehicles. In addition, rather than bars in the kidney grille, there's an intricately shaped mesh.\n\nUp front, the roadster features a fascia that appears to float below the hood. A V-shaped piece of carbon fiber dominates the center section and lends a visual flourish with the body-color sections on each side. The fascia's angular design contrasts with the long, clamshell hood's rounded shape. Long slits keep things from appearing too boring.\n\nGills behind each wheel create contours that run up each side. A hard crease starts at the upper portion of these outlets and flows diagonally up the body until the taillights pick up this shape.\n\nNacelles are a common feature of modern roadster, but the Z4 Concept has a unique spin on them by leaving them open in the center. Plus, a gorgeous curve on the inside of each one pleases the eye.\n\nInside, the Z4 Concept is pretty weird. The driver's side looks aggressive by being entirely black except for some metallic trim and red paddle shifters. A digital instrument cluster and wide infotainment display are the same height so that a person has all of these details easily within his/her vision. However, the concept's passenger side is a shade of light brown leather that matches the Energetic Orange Frozen exterior paint. The bi-color layout creates an odd effect visually because it appears that the cabin comes from two different vehicles.\n\nBMW doesn't offer any powertrain details about the Z4 Concept, but a recent leak hints at what motivates the production model. In the United States, customers would be able to choose from an entry-level four cylinder with 195 horsepower (145 kilowatts), a 248-hp (185 kW) four banger, and an inline six with 335 hp (250 kW). Z4 buyers will be able to get a manual or automatic gearbox, unlike the potentially auto-only Toyota Supra.\n\n\"The attention-grabbing design study offers a look ahead to the series-production version of the car set to be unveiled over the course of next year,\" according to BMW's release. The concept at least tells us that the road-going model should look good.\n\nSource: BMW\n\nBe part of something big", "id": "9747514", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW Z4 Concept Debuts, Suggests Sublime Shape For Future Roadster", "image": "https://icdn-6.motor1.com/images/mgl/4zJAo/s1/bmw-z4-concept.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 321, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false, "textEnd": 330}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer"}, "id": "304041", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inline-four engine"}, "id": "307168", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline-four_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automatic transmission"}, "id": "307523", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}, "id": "307583", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower"}, {"label": {"eng": "Leather"}, "id": "307592", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}, "id": "308030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Semi-automatic transmission"}, "id": "308035", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_transmission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Powertrain"}, "id": "314837", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain"}, {"label": {"eng": "Straight-six engine"}, "id": "327073", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-six_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automotive lighting"}, "id": "328539", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "339744", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M4"}, "id": "386136", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrian van Hooydonk"}, "id": "438406", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_van_Hooydonk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Z4 (computer)"}, "id": "858298", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z4_(computer)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 43, "label": "dmoz/Shopping", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 455, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1225, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Design", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Design"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1358, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Electronics"}], "time": "17:50:00"}

There are elements of the Concept that won't make production but approximately 80 per cent of this 'Energetic Orange Matt' design study will morph into a showroom-ready machine during the course of next year.\n\nIt's a bold statement by BMW and coupled with the recently revealed 8 Series Concept clearly previews how the next generation of BMWs will look. The overall effect is one of lithe aggression and should suit the Z4 perfectly with a low shark-nosed front-end that rises in a wedge shape to the muscular rear haunches. Like the 8 Series there's a delicate sliver of carbon fibre jutting out as a front spoiler element.\n\n* Best convertibles on sale\n\nThe Concept Z4 has a number of styling elements not seen before on a BMW, particularly around the front of the car. The traditional BMW kidney grilles are still present but they're wider than ever before and feature a new mesh type design rather than the familiar slatted look that we're accustomed to. The width of the kidneys has forced the headlights to the extremities and while they still contain the expected twin light setup the lights themselves are stacked one on top of the other which is a first for a BMW.\n\nThe bonnet is a wide clamshell design which stretches part way down the front wings and the bonnet itself is devoid of design elements bar two bold strakes designed to allow heat from the engine bay to escape. Where the clamshell bonnet ends on the wings is the start of a powerful swage line that runs up the side of the car, through the doors, and ends at the top of the L-shaped LED rear light clusters. Aft of the front wheels are large air-breathers capped with a piece of carbon fibre and these are the start of a scalloped area on the Z4's flanks, which again rises up the to accentuate the powerful rear arches and rear-wheel drivetrain.\n\nIn profile it's apparent the driver is more centrally situated in this generation of Z4 than in the previous two incarnations and Marc Girard, the car's designer, says this is to really accentuate the fact that the driver is the main focus. This Z4 should be lighter than the outgoing car too as it now features a fabric hood rather than a folding hardtop. For the Concept the hood has been removed which allowed the design team to fit the sculpted fairings behind the headrests which look wonderful, but we're not sure whether it will be possible to integrate these with the hood for the production car.\n\n* Best sports cars on the market\n\nIt's been designed first and foremost to be a driver's car and this is echoed within the cockpit where the passenger side features the same hue as the outside of the Z4 but the driver's side has its own black colour scheme, again focussing on the driver. Like the 8 Series Concept the major controls are sited in what BMW calls 'islands' so all the driving modes are clustered around the stubby gear lever and the heating controls are around the air vents. The dashpod is an all-digital affair while the main central monitor butts up to the dashpod allowing a flow of information from the main monitor to the instrument cluster with the driver able to choose what information is displayed.\n\nAs this is a Concept BMW is keeping tight-lipped over what engines will power the Z4 but both the 2.0-litre four-cylinder and 3.0-litre six-cylinder turbocharged units will feature with outputs ranging from 187 to 355bhp and we would expect a PHEV 'e'-badged version too. Whether there will be an M version remains to be seen - the last Z4 didn't feature a full-fat M version - but as this next generation Z4 promises a more focussed driving experience we would expect an M Performance version at the very least.\n\nWhat is the inspiration behind the Concept Z4?\n\n\"From our heritage, but we want to reinterpret everything at the same time. We're not doing retro, we want to reinvent key items like the kidneys and headlights and the goal is to make all our cars full of character, keeping the iconic design cues but newly translated for each model.\"\n\nHow would you say the Concept Z4 differs from the outgoing model?\n\n\"The top topic when designing the car was the 'Ultimate Driving Machine'. To make it more agile we reduced the wheelbase - from a semantic standpoint it clearly tells the story that the driver is in the middle of everything.\"\n\nSo it sounds like it will be sportier than the previous Z4?\n\n\"What we want to convey with the proportions is clearly performance - it's a driver's car, it's a sports car, it's super agile, it's light-footed and extremely dynamic.\"\n\nHow close is the Concept to the production car?\n\n\"We are basically previewing the production car. Here we have 80 per cent of the hard core engineering requirements in terms of aerodynamics and cooling and things like that so we are, in effect, previewing a close to production model.\"\n\nWhat's your favourite part?\n\n\"That's hard to say, but I particularly like the fairings behind the headrests with the carbon fibre insert that goes all the way inside and the milled one-piece aluminium which is semi clear coated and semi matt - they're gorgeous pieces of sculpture.\"", "id": "9768020", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "New 2018 BMW Z4 previewed by bold concept at Pebble Beach", "image": "http://cdn2.autoexpress.co.uk/sites/autoexpressuk/files/2017/08/p90273625_highres.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spoiler (automotive)"}, "id": "304027", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_(automotive)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer"}, "id": "304041", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Textile"}, "id": "306916", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheelbase"}, "id": "307157", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inline-four engine"}, "id": "307168", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline-four_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sports car"}, "id": "307173", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}, "id": "307580", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}, "id": "308030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "id": "313955", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark"}, {"label": {"eng": "Convertible"}, "id": "314839", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kidney"}, "id": "316248", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gear stick"}, "id": "327067", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gear_stick"}, {"label": {"eng": "Straight-six engine"}, "id": "327073", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-six_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "339744", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Plug-in hybrid"}, "id": "369890", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_hybrid"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M"}, "id": "373878", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hardtop"}, "id": "422944", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardtop"}, {"label": {"eng": "Swaging"}, "id": "579816", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaging"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}], "time": "20:01:00"}

Of course, it's still a low-slung car with a longer wheelbase for a more sporting stance. The four headlights are now vertically stacked instead of side-by-side, air vents dominate the front fenders and hood and the kidney grille is wider than other BMWs. At the rear, slim tail lights fold around the rear fender and the seats have integrated roll bars that stretch aerodynamically back. Inside, all the controls are grouped into \"function islands\" for less distraction for the driver.\n\n\"The BMW Concept Z4 expresses the new BMW design language from all perspectives and in all details. From the dynamic-looking front to the striking flanks to the clean-cut tail end: a few lines and the subtle interplay between surfaces are enough to generate a sense of power and emotion,\"says Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design.\n\nBMW is partnering with Toyota to develop this new roadster, with the Japanese brand likely going for a hard top version and calling it the Supra. And while BMW goes on about the concept's \"dramatic surface contouring\" and \"emotionally engaging impression\" in a press release, nothing is said of what kind of engine will lie underneath that long hood.

Although the BMW Concept Z4 is a show car that's currently being premiered at Concours d'Elegance in Pebble Beach, California this week, it's a thinly disguised version of the production-ready article due next year.\n\nAside that imposing front grille, the headlights have been given an angrier look for a true shark-like face. As well, the rear lamps are designed in a slimmer and horizontal manner helping for racy and broad stance for the body, with additional thanks going to the two domes behind the front seats.\n\nBMW says the laid-back profile remains but with a shorter snout this time for increased driving agility --something sorely missing in today's preceding model.\n\nOh, and any suggestion that the next-generation Z4 will be dubbed Z5 can now be totally dismissed. The name of the concept car confirms the roadster's badging and conformation to the brand's even-numbered designation for sports cars.\n\nBMW isn't discussing about this matter, although it is now well-known that it is planning to ditch the folding hard-top in favour of the classic soft-top type.\n\nIn fact, word has it that the next 4-series Convertible - due around 2019 - will also revert to a rag-top. The folding tin-tops in today's 4-series Convertible and Z4 have complex operations, erode into luggage space and add substantial weight to the cars. A BMW insider says canvas-tops can now be developed to offer cruising refinement level nearly as well when driving roof-up.\n\nLike in the classic Z car tradition of BMW, the new Z4 will be a strict two-seater with probably better levels of cargo-carrying ability. As seen in the picture of the interior, the fascia design and two digital screens - one on the centre and the other behind the showy steering wheel - are production certs.\n\nNope, as BMW hasn't discussed it about either. But it shouldn't be hard to envisage the engine lineup for the new Z4 should the strategy on today's model is taken into consideration.\n\nApart from an eight-speed automatic and rear-wheel-drive transmission, there should be 2.0-litre four- and 3.0-litre six-cylinder petrol-turbo engines propelling the Z4 with an expected power range of some 200-340hp.\n\nWe know what you're about to ask, but a potential 400hp-plus Z4 M is unlikely, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nAs you now well know, the new Z4 will be made alongside a jointly-developed sports car from Toyota highly likely to revive the legendary Supra nameplate last used some 15 years back. However, the new Supra is likely to only come as a fixed-top coupe, whereas the Z4 will be purely a roadster.\n\nAnd because BMW and Toyota have joined hands in producing the new cars at the same factory (in Austria, it is claimed) to boost economies of scales, production there is set to be tight to really be able to accommodate special versions with reworked bodies and drivetrains.", "id": "9806091", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW previews new Z4 at 2017 Concours d'Elegance in Pebble Beach", "image": "http://www.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20170817/c1_1308039_620x413.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "228859", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach,_California", "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}, "id": "302572", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brand"}, "id": "302722", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheel"}, "id": "303773", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota"}, "id": "303971", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inline-four engine"}, "id": "307168", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline-four_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Steering"}, "id": "307172", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sports car"}, "id": "307173", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automatic transmission"}, "id": "307523", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coup\u00e9"}, "id": "307533", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup\u00e9"}, {"label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}, "id": "307580", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}, "id": "307862", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "311537", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "id": "313955", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark"}, {"label": {"eng": "Convertible"}, "id": "314839", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concept car"}, "id": "319256", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Straight-six engine"}, "id": "327073", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-six_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Hardtop"}, "id": "422944", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardtop"}, {"label": {"eng": "Show car"}, "id": "425544", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Show_car"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}], "time": "18:24:00"}

A head-up display is also featured.\n\nBMW has yet to reveal any technical details about the concept or its next-generation production roadster, although it is known the new two-door will ride on a platform developed together with Toyota - the latter using it to form the basis of its spiritual successor to the popular Supra.\n\nSpy photos obtained in May also revealed a development sheet taped to a prototype's dashboard, revealing that at least one variant will be an s20i model with a 145kW/320Nm B48 2.0-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine powering the rear wheels via a six-speed manual transmission.\n\nIn all, BMW will reportedly offer the new Z4 with a choice of turbocharged four- and six-cylinder petrol engines. Toyota's version, said to revive the Supra name, will be offered as a coupe and may feature a hybrid drivetrain.\n\nWatch for more on the new roadster come in the weeks and months ahead.", "id": "9741203", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "2018 BMW Z4: New-generation roadster previewed for Pebble Beach show | CarAdvice", "image": "http://s3.caradvice.com.au/thumb/1200/630/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017_bmw_z4-concept_03a.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheel"}, "id": "303773", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}, "id": "303787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota"}, "id": "303971", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer"}, "id": "304041", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Evolution"}, "id": "305138", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alloy"}, "id": "306528", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inline-four engine"}, "id": "307168", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline-four_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}, "id": "307528", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}, "id": "307580", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manual transmission"}, "id": "307839", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}, "id": "308030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "311537", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kidney"}, "id": "316248", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concept car"}, "id": "319256", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head-up display"}, "id": "327071", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Stack (abstract data type)"}, "id": "430254", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)"}, {"label": {"eng": "1956 Mille Miglia"}, "id": "485143", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Miglia"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trapezoid"}, "id": "546617", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoid"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 99, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 371, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 718, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Engineering", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Engineering"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 785, "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Store Fixtures", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Store_Fixtures"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1225, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Design", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Design"}], "time": "17:11:00"}

BMW describes the Z4 concept as \"dynamic, progressive and an irresistible purveyor of thrills.\"\n\nFrom nearly every angle the Z4 concept borrows styling cues from the recent 8 Series concept and previews the next-generation Z4, which is coming sometime next year. With its low-slung styling and stretched wheelbase, the Z4 concept has the classic roadster cues. The Z4 concept's hood is shorter than the last generation, moving the driver closer to the center of the car than before.\n\nFrom the front, the Z4 concept features a sculpted shark nose and there are large Air Breathers behind the front wheels. The concept is painted in Energetic Orange frozen that is meant to accentuate the three-dimensionality of the exterior, while the concept rides on 20-inch alloy wheels with a bi-color double-spoke design.\n\nInside the driver's seat, door trim panels, instrument panel and center stack are finished entirely in black. The passenger seat is finished in orange. The instrument cluster and central information display are now positioned at almost the same height and in close proximity to one another, which gives the impression of a single, cohesive unit.\n\nBMW hasn't revealed what will power the next Z4, but we expect it to be available with BMW's 2.0L four-cylinder and 3.0L six-cylinder engines.

By Kyle CheromchaAugust 15, 2017NewsBMWBMW Z4concept carPebble Beachtoyota supraFacebook | BMWSHAREKyle CheromchaView Kyle Cheromcha's Articles\n\nBMW has taken a few knocks lately over whether or not the brand has been faithful to the whole \"Ultimate Driving Machine\" ethos, and many are eagerly waiting to see if the Bavarian half of the Toyota-BMW sports car collaboration will help balance out all those crossovers. Now, ahead of its planned debut at Pebble Beach later this week, here's a generous sneak peek of the rumored BMW Z4 concept via the company's Facebook page.\n\nThe high-contrast photo only reveals part of the roadster, but there are a few things we can glean from it regardless. BMW's signature kidney grilles are back and, in a move that's sure to please purists, actually narrower than the previous-generation Z4. The double headlights are also more sharply angled now, giving the car a more aggressive face than its predecessor.\n\nThat angry stance continues back down the whole body, with wider fender flares and a more upswept beltline. From spy photos, we know the BMW Z4 concept will rock an old-school cloth roof instead of the retractable hardtop found in the last iteration. Ditching that complex setup will likely save at least a couple hundred pounds, further adding to its sports car credentials.\n\nAs we reported last week, the rumored drivetrains also mirror a more back-to-basics approach. Engine options on the BMW Z4 allegedly range from a 2.0-liter, four-cylinder powerplant to the company's 3.0-liter B58 inline-six on top trims, which current puts out 335 horsepower in the BMW 540i. Unlike its Toyota Supra platform-mate, the BMW Z4 will reportedly offer a manual transmission option.\n\nOf course, BMW hasn't confirmed any of these details, so check back here on August 17th for the full reveal.", "id": "9766311", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-14", "title": "New BMW Z4 Concept All But Revealed Ahead of Pebble Beach Debut", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/20863458_10155700342222269_313956811325555880_o.jpg?quality=85", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 1922, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1933}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Facebook"}, "id": "302866", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota"}, "id": "303971", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inline-four engine"}, "id": "307168", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline-four_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sports car"}, "id": "307173", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}, "id": "307583", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower"}, {"label": {"eng": "Engine"}, "id": "307770", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kidney"}, "id": "316248", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Straight-six engine"}, "id": "327073", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-six_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota Supra"}, "id": "339778", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Supra"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW 5 Series (E39)"}, "id": "374604", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_5_Series_(E39)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M4"}, "id": "386136", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Retractable hardtop"}, "id": "406582", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible#Retractable_hardtop_roof"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "22:00:00"}

The first concept car unveiled is the BMW Concept 8 Series that was first shown at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este in May. The second is the World Premiere of the BMW Concept Z4. Both concepts are previews of the series production cars set to be revealed over the course of next year.\n\nThe BMW Concept Z4 Roadster is sporty and progressive BMW design study encapsulating the BMW Group's vision of a modern roadster. According to Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design, \"The concept expresses the new BMW design language from all perspectives and in all details. From the dynamic-looking front to the striking flanks to the clean-cut tail end: a few lines and the subtle interplay between surfaces are enough to generate a sense of power and emotion.\"\n\nThe BMW Concept Z4 Roadster adopts classical roadster design cues, such as a long wheelbase, a low-slung, stretched silhouette and a compact rear end, wraps them in a fresh, confident package and enriches them with the contemporary BMW design language. A shorter bonnet and crisp overhangs ensure the driver sits closer to the center of the car than in previous BMW roadsters. This gives the new proportions a focused, sporty and agile feel. The outline of the car follows a distinct wedge shape, which fills the BMW Concept Z4 with dynamism before it even pulls away. The large domes stretching out rearwards from the cabin elegantly integrate the function of rollover bars and provide a sporting conclusion to the low-to-the-road silhouette at the rear.\n\nAfter an eighteen year hiatus, the '8 Series' name returns to the BMW portfolio with the BMW Concept 8 Series that serves as a preview of a forthcoming BMW model - the new BMW 8 Series Coupe, slated for launch in 2018. \"The number 8 and cars like the Z8 Roadster and i8 have represented the pinnacle of sports performance and exclusivity at BMW,\" explains Chairman of the Board of Management of BMW AG Harald Kru\u0308ger. \"The forthcoming BMW 8 Series Coupe will demonstrate that razor-sharp dynamics and modern luxury can go hand-in-hand. This will be the next model in the expansion of our luxury-car offering and will raise the benchmark for coupes in the segment. In the process, we will strengthen our claim to leadership in the luxury class.\"\n\nThe BMW Concept 8 Series is immediately recognizable as a BMW, but also displays new design ideas and form-building techniques. \"The design of the BMW Concept 8 Series provides a fresh interpretation of iconic BMW styling cues,\" adds van Hooydonk. \"And it also showcases a new approach to the use of forms which is reflected particularly prominently in the car's surfacing. A handful of crisp lines mark out clear surfaces, and the car's volumes are powerfully sculpted. Together, these elements make a forceful statement and create a model brimming with character. In short, this is a driver's car.\"\n\nThe BMW Concept 8 Series will be shown publicly at The Quail, A Motorsports Gathering on Friday, August, 18th and on the Concept Lawn at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance on Sunday August 20th.

Previewing, as the name suggests, the third-generation Z4 that will replace the seven year old second-gen car, the droptop two-seater is being shown off for the first time at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance 2017 this week. It's a chance to bring the sporty convertible bang up to date with BMW's current design language.\n\nThe familial resemblance with the second-generation Z4 is clear. Like that car, it has a long hood and short trunk, pushing the cabin back and extending out the wheelbase. This time around, though, BMW has truncated the overhangs and trimmed the hood length, which it says puts the driver closer to the center of the Z4 Concept.\n\nUp front, the shark nose fascia is even more aggressive, with the oversized kidney grille lower and broader than before. BMW says it wanted to trigger associations with the Z8 and give the Z4 Concept \"a certain flamboyance.\" It's not the only heritage touch, mind: the mesh that fills those kidneys is a nod to the BMW 328 Mille Miglia classic.\n\nUnusually, the headlamps have been spun 90-degrees and stack two overlapping tubes on each size. The turn signals have been integrated, pointing into the grilles diagonally, while their shape and angles are echoed in the gill-vents on the clamshell hood. Bigger front apron vents and a sizable carbon-fiber insert borrow from BMW's motorsports division.\n\nAt the back, meanwhile, the twin domes that stretch back from the headrests help hide the rollover bars. Wide hips over flared wheel arches are offset by slim, L-shaped rear lamps. A wider-than-normal spoiler helps emphasize the overall width of the car, while the carbon-fiber diffuser picks up the motorsports theme from the front. BMW says the goal was to emphasize the car's rear-wheel drive nature, while the lowered door sills help to underscore how close to the road the Z4 Concept is.\n\nInside, meanwhile, the Energetic Orange exterior paint continues, along with chrome and leather. BMW opted to make the driver's seat, plus the door trim, instrument panel, and center stack all black, making a visual cocoon that wraps around the driver. Twin displays are mounted - one behind the wheel, one atop the center stack - at almost the exact same height, with the ability to move graphics between the two as if they were a single ribbon of screen.\n\nA head-up display projects key data right into the driver's eyeline, Controls are grouped into what BMW is calling \"function islands\" that can be easily identified and reduce distraction. Laser-cut motifs bring a hexagonal pattern into the cabin, while there's carbon-fiber on the door sills.\n\n\"The BMW Concept Z4 in an all-out driving machine,\" Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President of BMW Group Design, said of the car. \"Stripping the car back to the bare essentials allows the driver to experience all the ingredients of motoring pleasure with supreme directness. This is total freedom on four wheels.\"\n\nThat freedom will see a few changes, most likely, before it's available for sale. BMW says it's a \"look ahead\" to the production Z4, that will be unveiled officially next year. Expect the same sort of overall styling and proportions, but a more straightforward cabin, at the very least.", "id": "9744251", "details": {"liCnt": 8}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW Concept Z4 teases 2018 rear-wheel drive droptop", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}, "id": "303787", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer"}, "id": "304041", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheelbase"}, "id": "307157", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Leather"}, "id": "307592", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "id": "313955", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark"}, {"label": {"eng": "Convertible"}, "id": "314839", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head-up display"}, "id": "327071", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automotive lighting"}, "id": "328539", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}, "id": "331901", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_layout#Rear_wheel_drive_layouts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "339744", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW 328"}, "id": "438331", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_328"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrian van Hooydonk"}, "id": "438406", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_van_Hooydonk"}, {"label": {"eng": "Gill"}, "id": "448171", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gill"}, {"label": {"eng": "1956 Mille Miglia"}, "id": "485143", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Miglia"}, {"label": {"eng": "AWD (vehicle)"}, "id": "1271606", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWD_(vehicle)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 9, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theaters"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 20, "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Driving", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Driving"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 420, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Thematic", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Thematic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "17:28:00"}

The striking Concept Z4 Roadster wears some of the creased, angular bodywork previewed on the Concept 8 Series on its compact roadster body, creating an open two-seater that begs equally for straight, open strips of traffic-free desert road and furious, bluff-hugging twists high above smashing waves.\n\nLike the Concept 8 Series, which is also at Monterey Car Week making its North American debut, the Concept Z4 Roadster previews a production model and wears the latest hints of BMW's evolving design language. The styling is considerably crisper and more angular than what we're used to seeing in BMW dealerships, defined by neatly pinched edges and character lines and precision-sliced aerodynamics.\n\nThe Z4's compact body is set on a long wheelbase, a short hood keeping the driver positioned closer to the center of the car to add to the dynamism and drama. The car's plunging, forward-rushing lines give it much the same feeling of springing forward off the rear wheels that we get from the Concept 8.\n\nThose lines and curves eventually wrap their way into a shark nose with a broad, mesh-filled kidney grille working as a set of huge flared nostrils. The vertically stacked four-eye headlamps rise up and out toward the sides, in contrast to the usual horizontally set BMW headlamps.\n\nThe heavily sculpted rear-end stretches wide and low, its L-shaped taillights wrapping around into the bulging rear fenders. The upper edge of the trunk is pinched gently into a smooth spoiler, and sliced air vents provide an exit for all the heat being generated below the skin.\n\nThe Concept Z4's interior raises the bar on driver-focused design and mirrors the exterior colors and angles. Two high-contrast colors create a very defined split between driver and passenger, the black with red accents providing a sporty, dynamic feel on the driver side and the body-matching orange creating a more sedate passenger compartment.\n\nThe driver-passenger divide is furthered by the empty, uncluttered design of the passenger area, hosting little more than the seat and single air vent. All of the controls are neatly contained inside the black edge of the driver's area, a sharply angled border around the infotainment display putting a final punctuation mark on the division of active and passive. BMW has placed the digital instrument panel and infotainment screen close together at virtually the same height to create the impression of one seamless digital information cluster. A head-up display adds an upper layer.\n\nBMW debuted the Concept Z4 Roadster at its Monterey Car Week press conference on Thursday and says the car's appearance on the Pebble Beach Concept Lawn on Sunday will be its only North American public showing. Much as it's done with the Concept 8 Series, it's letting the Z4's styling stand on its own without details about the powertrain or other systems.\n\nThe Z4 successor has long been the subject of speculation, the expected fruits (along with a Toyota Supra successor) of the ongoing collaboration between BMW and Toyota. The two automakers announced that team-up way back in 2012 with very general stated goals like \"joint development of architecture and components for a future sports vehicle\" and \"joint research and development on lightweight technologies.\" Neither automaker has made public many details about the efforts since then, leaving things open for a steady stream of rumors, spy shots and speculation.\n\nBMW says the production Z4 will arrive next year. The car is expected to have four- and six-cylinder engine options, along with a possible all-wheel drive hybrid option.", "id": "9816924", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "BMW lets the California air in with Concept Z4 Roadster", "image": "https://img.newatlas.com/bmw-concept-z4-roadster-22.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&ch=Width%2CDPR&fit=crop&h=347&q=60&rect=1375%2C2203%2C5154%2C2899&w=616&s=1e5db49050662ef84d28c1c7bef5ada6", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "228859", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach,_California", "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}, "id": "302572", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}, "id": "303478", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota"}, "id": "303971", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheelbase"}, "id": "307157", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infotainment"}, "id": "307176", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infotainment"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aerodynamics"}, "id": "307587", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}, "id": "308030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Punctuation"}, "id": "310181", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "id": "313955", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark"}, {"label": {"eng": "Powertrain"}, "id": "314837", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kidney"}, "id": "316248", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head-up display"}, "id": "327071", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automotive lighting"}, "id": "328539", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota Supra"}, "id": "339778", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Supra"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coachbuilder"}, "id": "377660", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coachbuilder"}, {"label": {"eng": "Short hood"}, "id": "868109", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_hood"}, {"label": {"eng": "Monterey Car Week"}, "id": "1425191", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Car_Week"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 420, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Thematic", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Thematic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "03:20:00"}

The BMW Group is using the Concours d'Elegance at Pebble Beach to present its exciting new take on a BMW roadster. Dynamic, progressive and an irresistible purveyor of thrills, the BMW Concept Z4 boasts lithe and compact proportions, a dynamic silhouette and an emotionally appealing use of forms. The attention-grabbing design study offers a look ahead to the series-production version of the car set to be unveiled over the course of next year.\n\nAfter an eighteen year hiatus, the '8 Series' name returns to the BMW portfolio with the BMW Concept 8 Series shown on the Concept Lawn at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance this year. The BMW Concept 8 Series serves as a preview of a forthcoming BMW model - the new BMW 8 Series Coupe, slated for launch in 2018.\n\nA statement of unbridled driving pleasure.\n\nThe sporty and progressive BMW Concept Z4 encapsulates the BMW Group's vision of a modern roadster. \"The BMW Concept Z4 expresses the new BMW design language from all perspectives and in all details. From the dynamic-looking front to the striking flanks to the clean-cut tail end: a few lines and the subtle interplay between surfaces are enough to generate a sense of power and emotion,\" adds van Hooydonk.\n\nBMW's roadster tradition, reloaded.\n\nThe BMW Concept Z4 adopts classical roadster design cues, such as a long wheelbase, a low-slung, stretched silhouette and a compact rear end, wraps them in a fresh, confident package and enriches them with the contemporary BMW design language. A shorter bonnet and crisp overhangs ensure the driver sits closer to the centre of the car than in previous BMW roadsters. This gives the new proportions a focused, sporty and agile feel. The outline of the car follows a distinct wedge shape, which fills the BMW Concept Z4 with dynamism before it even pulls away. The large domes stretching out rearwards from the cabin elegantly integrate the function of rollover bars and provide a sporting conclusion to the low-to-the-road silhouette at the rear.\n\nReimagining the design language and surfaces.\n\nThe clearly sculpted shark nose at the front end spawns dramatic surface contouring that extends the full length of the flanks. The new direction taken by BMW's design language can be seen here in just a few precise lines that form clear surfaces, while the body's volumes are powerfully sculpted. The surfaces and forms therefore create an extremely modern and emotionally engaging impression. The large Air Breathers rearwards of the front wheels act as the source of the flanks' elaborately modelled surfaces (they appear to be shaped by the flow of air as it exits the Air Breathers). Light and shaded surfaces develop in a rising movement towards the rear, then twist to form muscular wheel arches and athletic volumes. All of which shines a bright stylistic spotlight on the car's rear-wheel drive. The dramatic interplay of lines and surfaces underscores the wedge shape of the flanks and infuses them with even greater dynamism. And the low door sills, with their distinctive crease, makes the body appear closer to the road, emphasising the low-slung sensation when viewing the car from the side.\n\nLow and progressive - the front end.\n\nThe design of the BMW Concept Z4's front end is undeniably sporty in nature. The relationship between the low-set, broad kidney grille and the positioning of the headlights higher up sparks deliberate associations with the BMW Z8 and lends the BMW Concept Z4 a certain flamboyance. In place of the customary bars, the inside of the kidney grille features elaborately designed mesh, whose vertical orientation recalls the sporty, functional kidney design of early BMW roadsters such as the BMW 328 Mille Miglia. In a departure from the BMW norm, the Concept Z4 provides a vertical interpretation of the classical four-eyed headlight look, with two overlapping tubes on each side. The turn signal indicators point diagonally towards the kidneys from above and underline the dynamic flair of the front end. And the clamshell bonnet with stylised gill vents curves over the wheels, creating an intriguing and virtually seamless sweep over the front end as a whole. The front apron cuts a genuinely athletic figure with its sculptural design language. Its trio of large air intakes are a nod to the powerful engine further back and so carry the promise of a dynamic driving experience. The large carbon-fibre insert in the central air intakeis straight out of the motor sport playbook and champions the use of detail to emphasise the front end's dynamic presence. Together, these design elements compose a fresh and memorable face for the Concept Z4 - one which pays a very modern and sporting tribute to the celebrated roadsters of BMW's past.\n\nAthletic and eye-catching - the rear end.\n\nThe design of the BMW Concept Z4 likewise references details and qualities from BMW's rich roadster tradition and updates them for the years ahead. The wide and low design of the rear picks up the lines of the car's flanks and massages them into a modern rear of beguiling clarity in terms of surfaces and styling elements. The powerfully flared wheel arches give the car broad haunches, which are emphasised by the slim, L-shaped rear lights and therefore further enhance the car's sporting stance. Above the rear lights, the boot lid - complete with prominent spoiler - stretches across to the burly wheel arch extensions, sending out a message of power-infused agility. Below, large air outlets in the rear apron create their own dynamic impression. The carbon-fibre diffuser adds a sporty and exclusive flourish and signs off the rear end at its lowest point to the road.\n\nExterior and interior in unison.\n\nThe kinship between the interior and exterior of the BMW Concept Z4 is evident in both forms and colour scheme. The design language of the interior takes the powerful, three-dimensional character of the exterior and adds another voice to the dynamic chorus. Much of the interior adopts the colour of the car body, creating a clear visual link between the interior and exterior. Only a classy chrome trim strip provides separation.\n\nMaximum focus on the driving experience.\n\nAt the same time, the interior serves to reinforce the total focus on the driving experience too. The driver's seat as well as the door trim panels, instrument panel and centre stack that encircle the driver are finished entirely in black, meaning that they stand out prominently from the coordinated orange shades of the exterior and the rest of the interior. Together they form a clearly defined area that wraps around the driver like a capsule, producing a very sporty sensation. This creates a pure-of-purpose driving environment with a pronounced \"cone of vision\", where the steering wheel as well as the surrounding black surfaces appear to be surging forward and, in so doing, accentuate the cabin's powerful driver focus.\n\nThe instrument cluster and central information display form a high-quality cluster ofscreens that are integrated into the driver's cockpit to flawless ergonomic effect. The two displays are now positioned at almost the same height and in close proximity to one another, which gives the impression of a single, cohesive unit. They work together to deliver the right information at the right time. The driver can choose which elements they wish to call up (via touch command) from the content available in the information display-route guidance, playlists or other infotainment features. Above the instrument cluster, the Head-Up Display presents the key driving information within the driver's direct field of view.\n\nProminent surfacing.\n\nEmerging from the driver's side of the cabin is a sporty instrument panel of inherent lightness. The clever arrangement of surfaces and edging breaks up the considerable volumes and engenders the impression of a powerfully chiselled muscle. The clear wraparound design from the doors to the instrument panel enhances the sporty, cocooned feeling in both seats.\n\nIn keeping with the focus on the essentials, all the controls are grouped into \"function islands\". Nothing distracts from the driving experience. Trim elements inside the cabin are likewise minimalist in nature. Indeed, it is instead the classy materials, carefully applied polished chrome accents and swish, hexagonal laser-cut motifs in the seats that do most to create the interior's exclusive ambience. Carbon-fibre door sill finishers and embossed asymmetrical logos in the seats and instrument panel set the seal on the interior's sporting profile.", "id": "9847382", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "STUD or DUD: Is BMW's All-New Z4 Concept Leaving You IMPRESSED or DEPRESSED?

So far, the brand has been mum on details about the upcoming roadster, its version of a jointly developed platform that has a reborn Supra for Toyota as its other offspring.\n\nWhile the Supra, judging from the spy pictures we've seen so far, will be characterized by round and bubbly shapes, BMW has gone for a far more chiseled and angular look. One thing is for sure: Nobody will confuse the two on the road.\n\nWe are told the Concept Z4 is a faithful preview of the upcoming production car, which is slated to launch as a 2019 model by this time next year. And we must say we like what we see here. Reaching even further than the X2, the Z4 (it won't be called Z5, as once rumored) marks a clear departure from BMW's current, all too conservative styling language, both inside and out.\n\nThe revolution begins in the front, where the Concept Z4 displays the most aggressive shark nose since the original 6-series. The air intakes are low and wide, and the headlights have their light signatures stacked on top of each other. BMW tries to pass off this look as a nod to the Z8. The Concept Z4's grille replaces the typical vertical slats with a three-dimensional mesh pattern that might not make it into production.\n\nThe side view reveals a new take on a roadster's proportions. The front and rear overhangs are short, and the cabin moves slightly forward, doing away with the cartoonish proportions of the Z3 and the first two generations of the Z4, in which the driver and passenger sit almost atop the rear axle. The vertical air outlets on the front fenders shape the entire side, and the taillights evoke the BMW i8 plug-in hybrid. We love the faired headrests that hide the roll bars. The 20-inch wheels on Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 rubber underscore the roadster's wide stance.\n\nCarbon-fiber elements grace the front and the rear diffuser, and the front spoiler displays Z4 lettering. The clamshell-style hood can be interpreted as a nod to the entire 2002 series -- one also appeared on the Z3 -- but in reality, it was probably necessitated by pedestrian-protection regulations.\n\nThe BMW Concept Z4 is painted in a BMW Frozen (matte) color, Energetic Orange, a hue that is repeated inside the car. Most of the dashboard on the passenger side is covered in orange suede, but in front of the driver it's finished in black leather, as is the driver's seat. BMW speaks of a \"cone of vision,\" and this approach to color is supposed to be a fresh take on driver orientation. The driver's seat sports additional wild decorative patterning that we attribute to the conceptual nature of this car; it is unlikely to reach dealerships.\n\nRead More\n\nBy itself, the dashboard is a convincing evolution of BMW's current interior design. It's cleaner, but it retains familiar elements such as the iDrive control knob and the vertical screen protruding from the center console. Instrumentation is displayed via a TFT screen, with a clockwise speedometer on the left and a counterclockwise tachometer on the right. The ultrasporty steering wheel has a recessed center section and is fitted with red paddles to operate that automatic transmission, which we hope won't be the only gearbox choice in the production car.\n\nThe option of a manual is pretty much our only ask at this point.

At first glance, we were expecting it to be a convertible version of BMW's 8 Series concept. Not only did the long nose and wheelbase seem appropriate for a large car like the 8 Series, BMW announced the 8 Series coupe concept would make its U.S. debut at Pebble Beach. But after seeing this new teaser photo, we're thinking it's actually a Z4 concept, as we think we've seen this face before under camouflage.\n\nGet ready for something big. Find out more on August 17th. #BMW pic.twitter.com/HQsSAACw56 -- BMW (@BMW)\n\nAugust 15, 2017\n\nWell, maybe not this exact face, but one very similar to that of the BMW Z4 prototypes that our spy photographers have been capturing for the past few months. Comparing what's visible in the teaser with recent spy shots, we can see that both cars feature thin, wide kidney grilles, while the 8 Series concept has somewhat more pursed kidneys. The headlights on this roadster concept and the Z4 prototypes are swept back and more vertically oriented than many BMWs. The 8 Series concept has decidedly horizontal headlights. Finally, while the angle of the teaser photo isn't the best for judging size, the car looks much smaller than we expected, more like a Z4 than an 8 Series roadster.\n\nWhatever the car is, we'll know very soon, as the Pebble Beach Concours is this weekend. Hopefully, if this is a Z4 concept, we'll get some idea of what kind of performance it will have. Since it's based on the upcoming Toyota Supra, it will likely share engines with the Japanese sports car. We hope both the BMW and the Toyota have more potent engines than the rumored 248-horsepower four-cylinder and 335-horsepower V6.\n\nRelated Video:", "id": "9370399", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "BMW Pebble Beach concept looks a lot like the Z4 prototype in new teaser photo", "image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/1024x577+0+99/resize/800x450!/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/b3eedc5a899bca7af669dff64ff30e9a/205569416/DHR25f1XcAQVVOA.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 597, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 608}, {"textStart": 657, "date": "2017-08-15", "amb": false, "textEnd": 672}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-15", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 5, "id": "228859", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach,_California", "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twitter"}, "id": "302546", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota"}, "id": "303971", "score": 1, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheelbase"}, "id": "307157", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coup\u00e9"}, "id": "307533", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup\u00e9"}, {"label": {"eng": "Convertible"}, "id": "314839", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kidney"}, "id": "316248", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "339744", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota Supra"}, "id": "339778", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Supra"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M4"}, "id": "386136", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z4"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW 8 Series (E31)"}, "id": "755744", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_8_Series_(E31)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 420, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Thematic", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Thematic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "22:48:00"}

A shorter bonnet and crisp overhangs ensure the driver sits closer to the centre of the car than in previous BMW roadsters. This gives the new proportions a focused, sporty and agile feel. The outline of the car follows a distinct wedge shape, which fills the BMW Concept Z4 with dynamism before it even pulls away. The large domes stretching out rearwards from the cabin elegantly integrate the function of rollover bars and provide a sporting conclusion to the low-to-the-road silhouette at the rear.\n\nReimagining the design language and surfaces\n\nThe clearly sculpted shark nose at the front end spawns dramatic surface contouring that extends the full length of the flanks. The new direction taken by BMW's design language can be seen here in just a few precise lines that form clear surfaces, while the body's volumes are powerfully sculpted. The surfaces and forms therefore create an extremely modern and emotionally engaging impression. The large Air Breathers rearwards of the front wheels act as the source of the flanks' elaborately modelled surfaces (they appear to be shaped by the flow of air as it exits the Air Breathers). Light and shaded surfaces develop in a rising movement towards the rear, then twist to form muscular wheel arches and athletic volumes. All of which shines a bright stylistic spotlight on the car's rear-wheel drive. The dramatic interplay of lines and surfaces underscores the wedge shape of the flanks and infuses them with even greater dynamism. And the low door sills, with their distinctive crease, makes the body appear closer to the road, emphasising the low-slung sensation when viewing the car from the side.\n\nThe expressive Energetic Orange frozen exterior paint finish showcases the contrasts of light and shade in the surfacing, accentuating the three-dimensionality of the exterior. And the 20-inch light-alloy wheels in a sporty bi-colour double-spoke design provide harmonious finishing touches to the styling of the flanks.\n\nLow and progressive - the front end\n\nThe design of the BMW Concept Z4's front end is undeniably sporty in nature. The relationship between the low-set, broad kidney grille and the positioning of the headlights higher up sparks deliberate associations with the BMW Z8 and lends the BMW Concept Z4 a certain flamboyance. In place of the customary bars, the inside of the kidney grille features elaborately designed mesh, whose vertical orientation recalls the sporty, functional kidney design of early BMW roadsters such as the BMW 328 Mille Miglia. In a departure from the BMW norm, the Concept Z4 provides a vertical interpretation of the classical four-eyed headlight look, with two overlapping tubes on each side. The turn signal indicators point diagonally towards the kidneys from above and underline the dynamic flair of the front end. And the clamshell bonnet with stylised gill vents curves over the wheels, creating an intriguing and virtually seamless sweep over the front end as a whole.\n\nThe front apron cuts a genuinely athletic figure with its sculptural design language. Its trio of large air intakes are a nod to the powerful engine further back and so carry the promise of a dynamic driving experience. The large carbon-fibre insert in the central air intake is straight out of the motor sport playbook and champions the use of detail to emphasise the front end's dynamic presence. Together, these design elements compose a fresh and memorable face for the Concept Z4 - one which pays a very modern and sporting tribute to the celebrated roadsters of BMW's past.\n\nAthletic and eye-catching - the rear end\n\nThe design of the BMW Concept Z4 likewise references details and qualities from BMW's rich roadster tradition and updates them for the years ahead. The wide and low design of the rear picks up the lines of the car's flanks and massages them into a modern rear of beguiling clarity in terms of surfaces and styling elements. The powerfully flared wheel arches give the car broad haunches, which are emphasised by the slim, L-shaped rear lights and therefore further enhance the car's sporting stance. Above the rear lights, the boot lid - complete with prominent spoiler - stretches across to the burly wheel arch extensions, sending out a message of power-infused agility. Below, large air outlets in the rear apron create their own dynamic impression. The carbon-fibre diffuser adds a sporty and exclusive flourish and signs off the rear end at its lowest point to the road.\n\nExterior and interior in unison\n\nThe kinship between the interior and exterior of the BMW Concept Z4 is evident in both forms and colour scheme. The design language of the interior takes the powerful, three-dimensional character of the exterior and adds another voice to the dynamic chorus. Much of the interior adopts the colour of the car body, creating a clear visual link between the interior and exterior. Only a classy chrome trim strip provides separation.\n\nMaximum focus on the driving experience\n\nAt the same time, the interior serves to reinforce the total focus on the driving experience too. The driver's seat as well as the door trim panels, instrument panel and centre stack that encircle the driver are finished entirely in black, meaning that they stand out prominently from the coordinated orange shades of the exterior and the rest of the interior. Together they form a clearly defined area that wraps around the driver like a capsule, producing a very sporty sensation. This creates a pure-of-purpose driving environment with a pronounced \"cone of vision\", where the steering wheel as well as the surrounding black surfaces appear to be surging forward and, in so doing, accentuate the cabin's powerful driver focus.\n\nThe instrument cluster and central information display form a high-quality cluster of screens that are integrated into the driver's cockpit to flawless ergonomic effect. The two displays are now positioned at almost the same height and in close proximity to one another, which gives the impression of a single, cohesive unit. They work together to deliver the right information at the right time. The driver can choose which elements they wish to call up (via touch command) from the content available in the information display - route guidance, playlists or other infotainment features. Above the instrument cluster, the Head-Up Display presents the key driving information within the driver's direct field of view.\n\nProminent surfacing\n\nEmerging from the driver's side of the cabin is a sporty instrument panel of inherent lightness. The clever arrangement of surfaces and edging breaks up the considerable volumes and engenders the impression of a powerfully chiselled muscle. The clear wraparound design from the doors to the instrument panel enhances the sporty, cocooned feeling in both seats.\n\nPared back to the essentials\n\nIn keeping with the focus on the essentials, all the controls are grouped into \"function islands\". Nothing distracts from the driving experience. Trim elements inside the cabin are likewise minimalist in nature. Indeed, it is instead the classy materials, carefully applied polished chrome accents and swish, hexagonal laser-cut motifs in the seats that do most to create the interior's exclusive ambience. Carbon-fibre door sill finishers and embossed asymmetrical logos in the seats and instrument panel set the seal on the interior's sporting profile.", "id": "9762565", "details": {"liCnt": 14}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW Z4 Concept (2017)", "image": "https://www.netcarshow.com/BMW-Z4_Concept-2017-wallpaper.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer"}, "id": "304041", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}, "id": "308030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Shark"}, "id": "313955", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark"}, {"label": {"eng": "Car classification"}, "id": "316483", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_classification"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automotive lighting"}, "id": "328539", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}, "id": "331901", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_layout#Rear_wheel_drive_layouts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Design language"}, "id": "393288", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW 328"}, "id": "438331", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_328"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrian van Hooydonk"}, "id": "438406", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_van_Hooydonk"}, {"label": {"eng": "1956 Mille Miglia"}, "id": "485143", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Miglia"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW Z8 (E52)"}, "id": "706328", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z8_(E52)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trunk (car)"}, "id": "1275900", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(car)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 168, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 662, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Design", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Design"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "19:28:00"}

In addition, while BMW explains the crew took inspiration from roadsters of the past for the new Concept, the Z4 has not a single retro element visible.\n\nMore so, we can see the reinterpretation of some of the company's iconic cues - the headlights feature a vertical instead of horizontal arrangement and the kidney grille bars have been ditched for mesh elements. The shark-face makes another apparition, with a firm look into the future - there's a V-shaped piece of carbon fiber in the center section and there are long vents on the hood for ventilation and styling purposes. The idea of having a gill behind each wheel as seen on the 7 and 5 Series is taken up, with design lines stemming from it. The rear is just as pleasing as the front - with huge vents in the bumper and stylish, elongated taillights.\n\nMoving inside, we can see BMW has taken an interesting two-tone approach - the driver's side is singled out via the entirely black appearance, save for some metallic trim and red paddle shifters. A digital instrument cluster and a large infotainment display are common now, with the concept's passenger side dressed up in light brown leather to complement the Energetic Orange Frozen exterior shade.

It also has a short bonnet and \"crisp overhangs\", helping the driver sit closer to the center of the car than in previous BMW roadsters.\n\n\"The BMW Concept Z4 expresses the new BMW design language from all perspectives and in all details,\" said designer Adrian van Hooydonk.\n\n\"From the dynamic-looking front to the striking flanks to the clean-cut tail end; a few lines and the subtle interplay between surfaces are enough to generate a sense of power and emotion.\"\n\nWhile the sculpted shark nose at the front was at least partly visible in previous teaser or leaked images, now we can also admire the Concept Z4's eye-catching rear end in high resolution, a rear that sees the car's flanks interacting with the flared wheel arches and L-shaped taillights, enhancing the roadster's sporty appearance.\n\nAbove the rear lights, the boot lid stretches all the way to the wheel arch extensions, while the large air outlets in the rear apron are meant to create their own \"dynamic impression\", according to the automaker. Last but not least, there's a carbon fiber diffuser flanked by a pair of angular exhaust tips.\n\nThe front end is at least just as exciting to look at as the rear, with a low-set broad kidney grille (featuring an elaborately designed mesh) that takes us back to early BMW roadsters such as the 328 Mille Miglia. As for the headlights, positioned higher up than on recent models, they spark a friendly association with the BMW Z8.\n\nMoving on to the interior, BMW say that much of the cabin was intended to adopt the color of the car's exterior, thus creating a visual connection between the outside and inside of the concept - with only a chrome trim strop providing some separation. What's particularly interesting is that BMW finished the driver's seat, as well as the door trim panels, instrument panel and center stack on the driver's side in black, whereas the passenger seat, half the dashboard and the other door panel were dipped in orange, matching the exterior of the car.\n\nBoth the instrument cluster as well as the central information display are angled towards the driver and positioned at almost the same height, almost giving the impression of a single, cohesive unit. The driver can also receive information in his or her direct field of view via the concept's Head-Up Display. Overall, none of the controls are meant to distract from the driving experience, which is why trim elements within the cabin are also minimalist in nature.\n\nIn the end, the Concept Z4 is simply meant to offer a preview of the series-production version, which is set to be unveiled sometime next year.\n\nPHOTO GALLERY", "id": "9766298", "details": {"pinCnt": 14}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW's Concept Z4 Breaks Cover At Pebble Beach", "image": "https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_aZKGIToKTM/WZXPwdY7urI/AAAAAAABHwA/IuwgOYLsIHQfkbw-wffwnipLpodsff-jQCLcBGAs/w1200-h628-p-k-no-nu/bmw-z4-concept-unveiled-officially-26.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}, "id": "302572", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer"}, "id": "304041", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheelbase"}, "id": "307157", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}, "id": "308030", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Head-up display"}, "id": "327071", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automotive lighting"}, "id": "328539", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrian van Hooydonk"}, "id": "438406", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_van_Hooydonk"}, {"label": {"eng": "1956 Mille Miglia"}, "id": "485143", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Miglia"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW Z8 (E52)"}, "id": "706328", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z8_(E52)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Trunk (car)"}, "id": "1275900", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trunk_(car)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "16:06:00"}

Coated in a frozen \"Energetic Orange\" paint, the auto features a host of new styling features that will more than likely end up on the production version, due out sometime in 2018. The Z4 Concept gets a unique design of the kidney grille and there are the double headlights which sit upwards compared to the current models, which makes us think if it is the beginning of a design language change at BMW.\n\nAfter a lot of technical specs and teasers, BMW has finally stepped into the light to show what they have been building so far and their future idea of how cars should look like.

Calling this flashy design study \"an all-out driving machine,\" Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design, says it also \"expresses the new BMW design language from all perspectives and in all details.\"\n\nRoadster redefined\n\nWhile retaining the proportions seen in the current Z4, this forward-looking one-off boasts a new sculpted edginess to complement its orange finish. It starts with a shorter, lower hood and a new interpretation of BMW's classic twin-kidney grille which is framed by bolder quad headlamps mounted higher in the fascia as well as a deeper apron and larger air intakes. Sweeping character lines, prominent gill vents, smartly flared fenders, twin integrated headrest buttresses that house rollover bars and 20-inch light-alloy wheels add interest to the profile while the rear end features slim, L-shaped LED lights positioned above dual air outlets. A tasteful integrated decklid spoiler lip and functional carbon fiber diffuser that also houses the dual exhausts complete the theme.\n\nAlso: Get your first look at the new and redesigned cars of 2018\n\nThe Concept Z4 Roadster's cabin embodies a similar kind of stylized flair, color-coordinated to reflect its functionality. The driver's cockpit area is all rendered in black with the remainder of the passenger compartment done in orange with carbon fiber accents. Dual, multi-mode digital displays handle the main instrumentation and infotainment while a supplemental head-up display allows the person behind the 3-spoke sport wheel to focus on the road ahead.

At the rear, domes stretch out towards the back in order to integrate the rollover bars and give the roadster a sportier derriere.\n\nThe biggest styling change from BMW's current design cues breaks away from the classic four-eyed headlights lined up with the kidney-shaped grille. Instead, the headlight clusters sweep upwards with two stacked headlights on each side. The grille itself adopts a mesh pattern instead of the traditional vertical slats. According to the BMW, this design pays tribute to their roadsters of the past, such as the BMW 328 Mille Miglia and the BMW Z8.\n\nInside, stylists blended a two-tone colour scheme that extends to the seats -- black for the driver, orange for the passenger. The driver-focused controls include a fully digital driver instrument panel, a deep-dish steering wheel and an iDrive infotainment system with a wide screen on the centre stack.\n\nNo word yet on what type of powertrain would equip the production Z4, but BMW confirmed it would retain its rear-wheel-drive layout.", "id": "9781417", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW Concept Z4 Unveiled at Pebble Beach", "image": "https://a.gaw.to/photos/3/0/4/304531_2017_BMW_Concept.jpg?1024x640", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Buttocks"}, "id": "306504", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks"}, {"label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}, "id": "307528", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Dashboard"}, "id": "308030", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concept car"}, "id": "319256", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "IDrive"}, "id": "357583", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDrive"}, {"label": {"eng": "Long hood"}, "id": "422740", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_hood"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW 328"}, "id": "438331", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_328"}, {"label": {"eng": "1956 Mille Miglia"}, "id": "485143", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mille_Miglia"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW Z8 (E52)"}, "id": "706328", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z8_(E52)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 20, "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Driving", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Driving"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 393, "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 440, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Barbecues", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Barbecues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1225, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Design", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Design"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1358, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Electronics"}], "time": "21:37:00"}

The next-generation Z4 will share its platform and mechanical bits with a reborn Toyota Supra.\n\nThe Z4's look is all sports car. At first blush, a distinct wedge shape is apparent, with the classic proportions of a long hood, short rear deck, and short overhangs. The hood is shorter than the outgoing Z4 and that, combined with shorter overhangs, mean the driver sits closer to the center of the car instead of farther back.\n\nThe details start to define what could be next for BMW design. The grille is tilted forward, with the headlights set high and the twin kidneys lower, taking on the shark-nose look of the BMW Z8. The nose is finished off with three large air intakes, a slimmer central one and two wider ones at the edges of the face. That central intake has a carbon fiber insert.\n\nA clamshell-type hood has gill-style vents at its edges. Its lower cutline matches the body character line that defines the car's wedge shape. It also sits above an air breather aft of the front wheel. The character line rises over the rear wheel, and another lower-set character line curves up to meet the rear wheel haunch. From the top view, dome-shaped roll bars mimic the seat design and flow back into the body.\n\nThe flared wheel arches give the car a wider rear aspect, and a slightly flared rear spoiler completes the wedge look. Slim LED taillights point inward, and combine with the license plate panel and the shape of the dual exhaust to create an X shape at the back. A carbon fiber diffuser finishes off the rear end.\n\nBMW has painted the car in a flat, or \"frozen,\" Energetic Orange paint and set it on 20-inch alloy wheels with a double-spoke design.\n\nThe orange exterior color is carried over into the interior, with the transition separated by a chrome strip. The driver's seat, door trim panels, instrument panel, and center stack are all finished in black, and BMW says these components wrap around the driver to create what BMW calls a \"cone of vision.\" The driver's seat has a laser-cut hexagonal pattern, while the passenger seat is orange, and the trim includes carbon fiber door sills.\n\nThe dash features two screens, one for the instrument panel and one on the center stack. A head-up display is also provided. The controls are grouped into \"function islands\" so nothing distracts from the driving experience. We see no pictures of the top, but it is supposed to be a soft top this time around instead of a retractable hard top, which should help cut weight.\n\nBMW doesn't mention the engine, but we expect the 2018 Z4 to offer 2.0-liter 4-cylinder and 3.0-liter inline-6 engines, both turbocharged, making 248 and 335 horsepower, respectively.

The concept version of the Z4 will be revealed at the 2017 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance scheduled to take place this weekend.\n\nThe automobile brand launched the teaser image a month ago but it was fully camouflaged and had very little to show. The black photograph showed the car's bold front end and the sharp appearance of the vehicle. However, the latest teaser image released shows the striking orange colored body of the car, the front grille and many of its design elements teasing people to the core.\n\nAfter all, if you are looking forward to the launch of the 2017 BMW Z4 Roadster, it's hard to not get too excited about these teaser images even though they don't reveal too much. If sources are to be believed, BMW has planned to reveal the new Z4 in a similar fashion as their popular 8 series models. The car will go head on with Audi TT Roadster and the Mercedes SLC, both of which are direct competitors to the BMW concept model.\n\nAlso Read : 2018 BMW Z4 is Being Rigorously Tested in Snow Before Official Launch\n\nIn the new teaser image, it is easy to spot that the Z4 concept model features the popular kidney grille in the front combined with a long row of LED Daytime running lights. It also features alloy wheels and has some unique body cuts making it look very aggressive. However, it is not wise to come to a conclusion as the teaser image is limited and doesn't show the overall design in well-lit conditions. Based on the previous images, it can be confirmed that the car uses Targe style folding roof and uses a fixed bulkhead on top of it.\n\nMultiple spy shots of the 2017 BMW Z4 Roadster has emerged which complies with the official teaser images released by the brand. It will be the big replacement for the second generation model that needs a dire refresh so as to keep buyers glued to the BMW brand and not lose them to immediate competitors like the Toyota Supra and the Porsche 718 Boxster.", "id": "9766332", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-15", "title": "2017 BMW Z4 Showcased in New Teaser Images", "image": "https://www.nashvillechatterclass.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/2017-BMW-Z4-e1502863083617.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Brand"}, "id": "302722", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bulkhead (partition)"}, "id": "311846", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulkhead_(partition)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concept car"}, "id": "319256", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Daytime running lamp"}, "id": "327494", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_running_lamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "339744", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M4"}, "id": "386136", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Audi TT"}, "id": "388769", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_TT"}, {"label": {"eng": "Alloy wheel"}, "id": "436136", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alloy_wheel"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 93, "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora and Fauna", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Flora_and_Fauna"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 406, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Photography", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Photography"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 407, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Consulting", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Consulting"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 659, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "22:00:00"}

High-set headlights and deep-dished steering wheel bring a little Z8 back from the late 1990s, while the grille mesh delves deeper into BMW's history and the original 328 Mille Miglia.\n\nNew Z4, 8 Series, and X7 details leaked in apparent BMW document\n\nDisappointingly, nothing is spoken of the drivetrain and whether the next Z4 will share any oily bits with the forthcoming Toyota Supra, which is said to be powered by a hybrid powertrain and auto-only transmission.\n\nThe Z4 Concept appears to have an auto but, if the car is the \"pared back, all-out driving machine\" BMW describes it to be, expect the production version to be on offer with a manual gearbox as well. The car maker does at least confirm it has a rear-wheel drive setup.\n\nOn the outside, its sharp appearance and styling is complemented by unapologetic Energetic Orange satin paint and 20-inch wheels that wear Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 rubber. The front wheels conceal large Z4-branded four-piston brake calipers and iron rotors.\n\nAs you might expect from any discerning sports concept, carbonfibre features heavily throughout including rear diffuser, door sill trims, broad front air dam, roll-over hoop inserts, and the so-called side 'air breather' vents.\n\nBesides the spectacular two-tone interior, which is reminiscent of a David Bowie off one shoulder outfit, the Z4 cabin has some neat details in the form of organic hide-covered seats with a laser etched hexagon pattern for the driver's perch and a stopwatch display that is incorporated into the steering wheel rim.\n\nWith its aerodynamic pods over its rear deck, the concept is either a strictly fair weather proposition with a permanent open-top or there is a folding roof mechanism cleverly hidden away somewhere we can't identify.", "id": "9766351", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW Z4 Concept rolls out", "image": "https://d3lp4xedbqa8a5.cloudfront.net/s3/digital-cougar-assets/wheels/2017/08/17/112173/Concept-BMW-Z4.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Iron"}, "id": "302515", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}, "id": "302572", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sport"}, "id": "302606", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Atmosphere of Earth"}, "id": "302705", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cover version"}, "id": "302797", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "History"}, "id": "303747", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History"}, {"label": {"eng": "Spoiler (automotive)"}, "id": "304027", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_(automotive)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Diffuser (automotive)"}, "id": "304037", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuser_(automotive)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer"}, "id": "304041", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon-fiber-reinforced_polymer"}, {"label": {"eng": "Natural rubber"}, "id": "307272", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rubber"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brake"}, "id": "307276", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake"}, {"label": {"eng": "David Bowie"}, "id": "307488", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowie"}, {"label": {"eng": "Steering wheel"}, "id": "307528", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steering_wheel"}, {"label": {"eng": "Aerodynamics"}, "id": "307587", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manual transmission"}, "id": "307839", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Front-wheel drive"}, "id": "308037", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-wheel_drive"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "311537", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Powertrain"}, "id": "314837", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concept car"}, "id": "319256", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 371, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}], "time": "16:06:00"}

This being a concept, the wing mirrors and windscreen surround are both stupendously thin.\n\nSome interesting details about both the BMW Z4 and the Toyota Supra emerged from an internal BMW coding sheet revealed at supramkv.com, which looks to be legit. While the Supra will only be a coupe, the Z4 will remain a roadster.\n\nAlong with confirmation that it will keep its Z4 badge, the big news is the current car's retractable metal hardtop will be ditched for a far lighter fabric roof. What we know for sure is that the new Z4 will be a rear-wheel drive auto, as standard.\n\nEngine options for the new Z4 are expected to include a 2.0 litre four-cylinder petrol engine in the sDrive30i and a 3.0 litre six-cylinder with around 330bhp, with rear-wheel drive and a ZF eight-speed automatic. A hybrid and a performance variant are also on the cards, but those will arrive later in the roadster's life cycle.\n\nThe last Z-model was released nearly nine years ago, and the BMW Z4 Concept is finally back again with a bold design.

It has become a symbol of freedom and the technological wilderness.\n\nThe BMW company is at Pebble Beach where its latest roadster is being showcased to the masses. It is sleek, elegant and a thrilling ride. With flexible and fitted parts, the cool form of this car holds great appeal for the male ego. The car will be unveiled over the next year in incremental form.\n\nDon't Miss: New SNES Classic Book with Case on Sale for $26.99\n\n\"The BMW Concept Z4 in an all-out driving machine,\" said Adrian van Hooydonk, Senior Vice President BMW Group Design. \"Stripping the car back to the bare essentials allows the driver to experience all the ingredients of motoring pleasure with supreme directness. This is total freedom on four wheels.\"\n\nThe Z4 is a vehicle that possesses tons of force and personality. To see it is to gaze at superiority and luxury in a definitive manner. It is literally a fantastic source of freedom on four wheels. It holds in its design and functionality the BMW philosophy.\n\nModern, masculine and muscular, it embodies a number of angles in a fluid form. The dynamic front melds in with the remarkable flank.\n\nThe crystal clear tail end is also tops. Via a few simple lines and shapes, this car lends an aura of greatness and poise. It is both potent and an alluring thing for powerful men and women everywhere.\n\n\"The BMW Concept Z4 expresses the new BMW design language from all perspectives and in all details. From the dynamic-looking front to the striking flanks to the clean-cut tail end: a few lines and the subtle interplay between surfaces are enough to generate a sense of power and emotion,\" adds van Hooydonk.\n\nThis car has a long wheelbase, a low elongated silhouette and a compact back end, all of which are combined in an elegant and well-defined shape.\n\nThe driver will have a more stable center of gravity in this automobile. He will sit closer to the center. Thus it will feel like a sports car as well as possess greater maneuverability.\n\nThe outline is clear, clean and crisp. The dome-like protrusions make it a visually pleasing object of desire. The shark nose at the frontal space shows some special contours too.\n\nIt almost seems to be a sculpted object. The impression it leaves behind in the human mind thanks to its expression is something which few cars can match.\n\nThe outer form of this car has a play of light and shade about it due to the edges and curves overlapping into each other. The wedges, the low door sills and the creases make it a car worthy of driving down the road.\n\nThe vehicle contains many other specifications. These include: wheel arches, L-shaped rear lights and a ton of other features.\n\nBMW Concept Z4 vehicle will surpass others due to its sheer looks and leave them miles behind in the dust that arises in its wake.", "id": "9890422", "details": {"gpCnt": 3}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "BMW Concept Z4 Unveiled", "image": "https://static1.i4u.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/main_image_large/images/2017/08/bmw-concept-z4.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}, "id": "303478", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheelbase"}, "id": "307157", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sports car"}, "id": "307173", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Force"}, "id": "307271", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force"}, {"label": {"eng": "Super Nintendo Entertainment System"}, "id": "316888", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tail"}, "id": "318614", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail"}, {"label": {"eng": "Luxury vehicle"}, "id": "319947", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxury_vehicle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M4"}, "id": "386136", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Design language"}, "id": "393288", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrian van Hooydonk"}, "id": "438406", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_van_Hooydonk"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 420, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Thematic", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Thematic"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 462, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Autos"}], "time": "12:19:00"}

It will be a mechanical sibling to the upcoming Toyota Supra, which excites many fans. What's known for sure so far is that it will be rear-wheel drive as-standard, will come in four-cylinder and six-cylinder variants and will regain its soft-top roof, rather than the folding hard-top of the current car. It will also be lighter, faster and sharper than the car it replaces.\n\nUnder the hood, we'll have a range of 2-liter 4-cylinder engines and 3-liter straight six ones. The entry-level model will most likely be the sDrive20i with a near-200 HP engine under the hood. The sDrive30i will come with 252 PS while in the 3-liter straight six we'll have the B58 mill tuned to make probably 340 HP in a likely M Performance version of the Z4.\n\nThe teaser image shows a unique design of the kidney grille, while the double headlights are sitting upwards compared to current models.

The width of the kidney grilles pushes the headlights to the extremities which has resulted in headlights positioned one above the other - another first for BMW. Like the recently revealed 8 Series Concept there's a carbon fibre front lower spoiler that rises up at each extremity and when viewed in profile one can see a pronounced shark-nosed profile. With the Z4 Girard has taken inspiration from previous BMW design icons and reinterpreted them; \"We definitely want to reinvent everything,\" he says, \"We're not doing retro though, we always reinterpret key cues such as the kidney grilles.\"\n\nThere's a distinct wedge shape about its profile and where the clamshell bonnet joins the front wings there's a strong swage line that runs up the car, through the doors before meeting the L-shaped LED rear light clusters. The 20-inch alloys are a reinterpretation of BMW's twin spoke design while the large air-breather aft of the front wheels leads to scalloped sides rising up to the rear arches. An integrated ducktail spoiler completes the rear end, itself an aggressive amalgamation of air outlets, twin exhausts and a carbon diffuser.\n\n> Click here for all you need to know about the new Toyota Supra\n\nFor this generation of Z4 the folding hardtop has been ditched for a fabric hood and for the Concept there are a pair of buttresses aft of the headrests constructed from milled aluminium and carbon fibre - they're very striking and would look great on the production car but Girard won't be drawn on whether they'll make production.\n\nInside the cockpit is clearly driver-orientated with its black leather driving area and like the recent 8 Series Concept the Z4 features 'islands' of controls with the driving tools located by the stubby gear lever and the HVAC controls sited by the air vents and so on. The on-board monitor is larger and links up with BMW's new-style dashpod to allow a flow of information between the two and Girard says this will feature on future production cars.\n\nAs this is still a Concept car, albeit one that's destined for production, BMW remains tight-lipped on engines and performance figures but expect BMW's familiar four- and six-cylinder turbocharged petrol units to feature with outputs ranging from 190 to 350hp. Will there be a Z4 M this time around though? There's no doubt the M3 and M4's twin-turbo S55 engine would fit... but it may be more likely we'll see an M Performance version \u00e0 la M140i/M240i.

The BMW Z4 Concept Coupe rendering comes from X-Tomi Design and it is simply stunning to look at. Sure, he had a good basis to start with but the new roadster is an absolute beauty, no matter how you look at it. This could very well be a close take on what the upcoming Toyota Supra could look like and fans definitely have plenty of reasons to rejoice.\n\nLooking at it, one couldn't help but wonder why BMW didn't invest a bit more so that the Z4 could be turned into a Mercedes-AMG GT rival. Given a hardtop that would turn it into a Coupe together with a 4-liter V8 or a more powerful straight six 3-liter engine, this thing could definitely take on the AMG GT. And I'm not talking only about the way it looks but also about the elastokinematics hiding underneath.\n\nHowever, all is not lost. Since the new Z4 will surely get the B58 engine of the 540i once it comes out, being sold as the M40i version of the Roadster, there's surely enough room in the engine bay to fit an M-developed mill in there. With the upcoming S58 engine that is rumored to have 450 HP and some weight loss, the Z4 even in Roadster guise and not as a Coupe, could turn out to be quite the driver's car.\n\nThe Z4 is bound to enter production next year so there's still time for BMW to develop a high-performance version that could rise to the title of supercar, something fans of the brand have been waiting for since the original M1 came out.

Long gone are also the extended design cycles between cars and a push towards new design language as soon as a refresh is needed.\n\nThe photo gallery below gives us a better look at the design lines of the Concept Z4.", "id": "9786929", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Studio, close-up shots of the BMW Concept Z4", "image": "http://cdn.bmwblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/BMW-Z4-Concept-studio-shots-01.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Geometry"}, "id": "306157", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheelbase"}, "id": "307157", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Cockpit"}, "id": "316353", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockpit"}, {"label": {"eng": "Facial expression"}, "id": "344698", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_expression"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Design language"}, "id": "393288", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_language"}, {"label": {"eng": "Adrian van Hooydonk"}, "id": "438406", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_van_Hooydonk"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW 8 Series (E31)"}, "id": "755744", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_8_Series_(E31)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 662, "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Design", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Design"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 844, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Graphic Design", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Graphic_Design"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 985, "label": "dmoz/Business/Textiles and Nonwovens/Textiles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Textiles_and_Nonwovens/Textiles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1225, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Design", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Design"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 1358, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Electronics", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Electronics"}], "time": "22:23:00"}

Then, there's the resurrected 8 Series, which broke cover at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este in Italy earlier this year.\n\nFOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE.\n\nBoth vehicles are wide, wedge-shaped and low-slung with sharp, LED-accented headlights as well as sculpted side and rear flanks. Each also features a unique spin on BMW's signature double-kidney grille, with the 8 Series using a blown-up version of the commonly-used vertical bar design and making it taper down on the sides while the Z4 also uses a broader shape but instead fills it in with an intricate mesh design.\n\nElsewhere on the Z4's front fascia, BMW has given it a unique, double-stacked headlight design that makes it look like some type of alien species. The rounded-nose protrudes only slightly beyond the front wheels and three sizeable air intakes feed what will most likely be a powerful engine.\n\nInside, the Z4 is house divide, with one side in all orange, including the sporty passenger seat, and the other draped in black, driver's seat and all. A flat-bottomed steering wheel with a slightly top, chrome thumb grips and red paddle shifters affirm the performance nature conveyed by the exterior.\n\nWhile similar, with its large front air intakes and tapering design, the 8 Series concept has a more elongated hood and a sharper design on the front end while the rear features prominent fenders. In profile, it looks like the prototypical sports coupe and, given the 8 Series history, it might just live up to its looks.\n\n12 photos view gallery First Pictures: BMW Concept 8 Series 10 photos view gallery First Pictures: BMW Concept Z4\n\nBMW confirmed that it is also working on an all-new M8, which will sport even larger air intakes, performance brakes and its own exhaust system that flows through four tailpipes.\n\nThe M8 will take over as BMW's endurance race vehicle with a GTE that is expected to make its competition debut at the Dayton 24 Hours race in January.\n\nTags: auto news bmw 8 series bmw 8 series concept cars\n\nDid you find this article helpful?

planning to steal a generous chunk of the attention at the Pebble Beach automotive extravaganza this weekend, with a two-seater convertible concept that is expected to herald a new-generation Z4.\n\nAll will be revealed at the Concours d'Elegance in California on the 17th when the German car maker wheels out the flashy concept in full, but until then, this moody image, released via its social media pages, should keep sexy sportscar fans happy.\n\nThe single image shows a classic long-bonnet, short rear overhang and topless accommodation for two in keeping with the Z4 mantra of two generations previous, as well as an evolution of its trademark broad BMW kidney grille.\n\nOther notable features include typical slender concept car door mirrors that will certainly not make the production cut, fibre-optic side lights similar to the i8's, and aerodynamic shrouds behind each headrest for a touch of race car prestige.\n\nAll details including drivetrain specification, performance and dimensions will have to await the official reveal but, even then, just how much metal will make it to the production version will not be fully known until a reveal of the third-gen Z4.\n\nWhen it arrives, the new Z4 will share a platform with Toyota's similarly hyped Supra, in a technical collaboration similar to the deal between Mazda and Fiat to produce the mechanically related MX-5 and 124 Spider.\n\nIn the case of the Japanese version, the sportscar is expected to be offered with a hybrid powertrain and auto-only transmission, but the BMW is rumoured to kick off with a turbo four-cylinder petrol and manual option with a six-pot coming further down the line.\n\nAlso yet to be confirmed is the Z4's return to classic fabric top, which if true, will be a departure from the second-gen version and its folding hard top.\n\nBoth the Toyota and BMW will be built by contract vehicle manufacturer Magna Steyr at its main production facility in Graz Austria.",

Why? Because the new Z4 is in many ways a reincarnation of the first Z3 roadster that rolled off the line at the automaker's Spartanburg, South Carolina, factory back in the mid 1990s. It sheds the last Z4's bulky and ill-conceived retractable hardtop in favor of an electrically operated soft top. There are no more ungainly cutlines segmenting the elegant silhouette, and cargo volume increases by 50 percent with the top down, though the rear blind spot just about doubles in acreage with it up. But this is a what-the-heck automobile not a two-seat driving-school car; it's made to be driven alfresco.\n\nLike every new rear-wheel-drive BMW, the next Z4 is underpinned by a spinoff of the automaker's modular CLAR architecture and will get adaptive dampers and an optional M Sport kit. Don't expect air springs or rear-wheel steering. To keep the car's weight in the roughly 3,000- to 3,200-pound target bracket, all-wheel drive never entered the equation, sources say. Wheel sizes should range from standard 17-inchers to an optional 19-inch package offered in a bundle with bigger brakes.\n\nThe Munich grapevine suggests three different versions of the Z4. The base s20i will likely be powered by the brand's 2.0-liter turbo inline-four presently rated at 180 horsepower and 200 lb-ft of torque in the BMW 320i. The s30i features the same engine in 248 hp, 258 lb-ft guise, with the Z4 M40i using a version of the 320 hp, 340 lb-ft straight-six from the 340i. Not yet confirmed is a Competition Pack, which would kick up the 3.0-liter's output by some 40 horses and 30 lb-ft. Although the base model will come with a six-speed manual gearbox, higher-end versions will relay torque via an eight-speed ZF auto box.\n\nA BMW spokesperson says there won't be a Z4 M. It would require too much mechanical and plastic surgery to justify a price that would have likely been close to six-figure territory. Although CLAR is set up for plug-in hybrid and full-EV applications, we expect the Z4 to rely exclusively on the aforementioned combustion engines. The only hybrid you'll get is a mild one so the engine doesn't also have to power auxiliary equipment. Don't expect any autonomous-driving gadgetry, either; this is a purebred driver's car honed at the N\u00fcrburging.\n\nUnlike the outgoing Z4, the new model is significantly more spacious and digitally up to date. The main monitor sits high on the dash, the instrument cluster can be adjusted within reason, and there is an available augmented-reality head-up display. If you must, you can specify neck warmers and a pop-up wind deflector. The sixth generation of BMW's iDrive boasts additional features and more intuitive access, but it retains the trademark controller between the seats and the driving experience selector next to it.\n\nAs for the progress of the BMW/Toyota partnership signed in 2011 to produce a new sports car for each brand, sources tell us Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda has been to Munich testing Toyota's version of the car, also known as the next Supra. More than once, the approachable tycoon and avid high-performance driver reportedly walked away impressed. To avoid cannibalization, BMW opted for the roadster while Toyota favored the coupe, which is expected to make its debut later this year in prototype form at the Tokyo auto show. A role swap later in the life cycle is still possible. The cars share BMW's engines and will be built at a neutral site, the Magna factory in Graz, Austria.\n\nAs it stands, expect the new Z4 to ring in around the same price as the last-gen model at just north of $50,000 and move up from there when it hits the streets, likely late next year.\n\nShow more", "id": "9846415", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "2019 BMW Z4: What to Expect |

The front snout is canted forward, with some saying it resembles the E28 6-Series \"Shark Nose.\"\n\nThe front and rear lights appear to feature LED elements, though don't rule out laser lights.\n\nThe cabin is basic, yet modern with a futuristic BMW feel to it. The digital gauge cluster is digital with most switches and controls appearing to be touch-based. Perhaps most interesting are the red buttons on the steering wheel labeled Race/Stop. There also appears to be a digital lap timer of sorts on the bottom of the steering wheel.\n\nSet to be the replacement for the current Z4, one can expect turbocharged power to be under the hood in production form, with both a 2.0-liter turbo-4 and likely a 3.0-liter turbo-6.

The back is similarly svelte and features a small lip spoiler, narrow taillights, and dual silver exhaust tips.\n\nThe cabin is akin to BMW's current production cars with a large infotainment screen subtlely angled toward the driver and an alike dashboard layout.

A chunky, flat bottom steering wheel with a white 12 o'clock marking hammers home the car's sporting aspirations.\n\nSEE ALSO: 2017 Monterey Car Week and Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance Coverage\n\nThis is only a design study, so it's reasonable to assume the production Z4 will be a bit dialed back compared to what you're seeing here.

Word is also that the BMW will only be offered as a drop-top, and the Toyota a coupe, to keep both offerings distinct.\n\nNo official mention yet of the engines that will go on the series production offering, but the car is expected to enter the market with BMW's range of four- and six-cylinder turbocharged engines, in this case the B48 four-cylinder turbo petrol in two states of output tune and a B58 turbocharged inline-six.\n\nAlso set to come about is a range-topping variant featuring a hybrid powertrain with capacitors and all-wheel-drive.

At this week's Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, BMW will debut the new Concept Z4, a design study that previews the next generation of compact BMW convertibles. The new platform will also underpin the next gen Toyota Supra.\n\nTowards the rear of the vehicle the visual fest continues with sharp creases running from the fender to the rear of the auto to emphasis the Z4's new muscular haunches. BMW wrapped all these in a fresh, confident package with big brakes, aggressive styling (including a shorter hood and crisper overhangs that ensure the driver sits closer to the center of the auto than in previous BMW roadsters), and a low roofline to signal the two-door's performance credentials. Instead of vertical bars, the grille is filled with mesh that the designers say recalls that of the BMW 328 Mille Miglia. BMW need not worry though - it looks absolutely gorgeous. The nose is finished off with three large air intakes, a slimmer central one and two wider ones at the edges of the face. The clean interior design is accented with minimal flourishes - a spare amount of chrome and carbon-fiber trim, and a laser-cut pattern in the upholstery. The turn signals have been integrated, pointing into the grilles diagonally, while their shape and angles are echoed in the gill-vents on the clamshell hood. The side profile appears carefully sculpted, with two character lines jetting toward the rear of the vehicle.\n\nSlashes in the bonnet, \"Air Breathers\" behind the front wheels and LED taillights that wrap right around the rear make it a proper eye-catcher. The character line rises over the rear wheel, and another lower-set character line curves up to meet the rear wheel haunch. We'll be sure to update you with any new information, as it comes in.

Angular LED headlights with BMW's new hexagonal lighting signature are pushed out to the very farthest corner of the car's face.\n\nRunning down the sides of the car are a pair of angled creases, while long, wide but thin mirrors sprout from the tops of the doors. At the back, the roll hoops are bolstered by a pair of buttresses sweeping into the flat deck behind the driver and passenger, with wide LED taillights and an aggressive looking rear bumper also added.\n\nThe new Audi TT Roadster and Mercedes SLC rival will make its debut in the metal on 17 August. BMW is expected to unfurl the new Z4 in a similar manner to the all-new 8 Series, with a revealing concept vehicle to whet the appetite for the production model.\n\nThe production car has already been spotted testing on multiple occasions, with the most recent spyshots showing it in snowy conditions with a slightly more revealing disguise compared to earlier mules lapping the Nurburgring.\n\nThe new Z4 Roadster will replace the ageing second-generation model, in production since 2009, and be a fresh rival for the likes of the Porsche 718 Boxster, as well as a reborn Toyota Supra currently being developed in parallel and set to use the same platform.\n\nDespite the complex shape, it's likely the new car will ditch the current Z4's heavy metal folding roof for a lighter, more traditional fabric hood. This could mean it's being aimed more towards the Boxster and away from softer, more refined cars like the SLC.\n\nAn insider previously told us that \"this car will use the same lightweight body construction as the i3 and i8. And even with that type of construction, you can expect a price around the same as that of the current Z4.\"\n\nMounted behind the front axle will be a range of BMW's 'TwinPower' turbo petrol engines which will be offered in both four and six-cylinder forms. Expect at least 200bhp from base models, with top-end turbocharged straight-six variants nudging 300bhp. As before, all cars will be rear-wheel drive.\n\nThe Z4 will also use the same rear axle design as the M3 and M4, and it's likely that a full M version will follow within a year, possibly using the M2's 365bhp 3.0-litre straight-six.\n\nBMW's next-generation roadster will also provide a base for a reborn Toyota Supra, designed to sit above the slow selling GT 86. Though unlike the Z4 Roadster it'll be a hard-top coupe, influenced by the FT-1 concept from 2014.\n\nThe Toyota version has potential to receive a plug-in hybrid model, with electric motors boosting output instead of a turbocharger.", "id": "9686509", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW Z4 Concept leaks ahead of Pebble Beach reveal", "image": "http://cdn2.autoexpress.co.uk/sites/autoexpressuk/files/2017/08/p90273625_highres.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 979, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 988}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota"}, "id": "303971", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Heavy metal music"}, "id": "305215", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mercedes-Benz"}, "id": "307153", "score": 3, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz"}, {"label": {"eng": "Axle"}, "id": "307259", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}, "id": "307580", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger"}, {"label": {"eng": "Convertible"}, "id": "314839", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convertible"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kidney"}, "id": "316248", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Petrol engine"}, "id": "318362", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrol_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concept car"}, "id": "319256", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Straight-six engine"}, "id": "327073", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-six_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automotive lighting"}, "id": "328539", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting"}, {"label": {"eng": "Rear-wheel drive"}, "id": "331901", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile_layout#Rear_wheel_drive_layouts"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota Supra"}, "id": "339778", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Supra"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW i8"}, "id": "349600", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_i8"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mid-engine design"}, "id": "356689", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-engine_design"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roll cage"}, "id": "363656", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll_cage"}, {"label": {"eng": "N\u00fcrburgring"}, "id": "380214", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N\u00fcrburgring"}, {"label": {"eng": "Audi TT"}, "id": "388769", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_TT"}, {"label": {"eng": "Porsche Boxster/Cayman"}, "id": "1277449", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_Boxster/Cayman"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 659, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Models/Scale"}], "time": "12:33:00"}

If the versions you'll find on the forecourt are even close to these concepts, there are going to be a lot of very happy movie producers and hedge fund managers (thanks to the probable high price and outstanding, but aggressive looks).\n\nBoth cars show off the automaker's new cleaner design language with fewer but sharper lines. The result is beautiful. They look like they'll slice through the wind with hardly any turbulence thanks to the smoother surface. But the Z4 with its larger footprint but shorter bonnet is especially magnificent. When it does become available, it'll be in high demand.\n\nThe Series 8 concept sees the return of that line after an 18 year hiatus. It, along with the larger more aggressive Z4 signal the return of \"sports cars\" to the BMW family.\n\nWhile the cars are built for speed, we expect them to be filled with the current tech found in the rest of the line-up, including BMW's semi-autonomous adaptive cruise control with \"Stop & Go\" feature for heavy traffic.\n\nAlso don't be surprised to see the gesture-control feature that lets you turn up the volume by spinning a finger make an appearance -- at least in the Series 8 when it drops in 2018. It might be a bit tougher to get the cameras and sensors needed for that feature to work on the open air Z4 though.\n\nBoth of the cars look outstanding and while we only have to wait about a year for the Series 8, when we'll see a final version of the Z4 is still up in the air.

As an interesting way to cut production costs through collaboration while avoiding getting into direct competition, BMW will reportedly produce only a roadster version (don't look for another M Coup\u00e9) with both manual and automatic, paddle-shift, transmissions, while Toyota will release the new Supra only as a auto-transmission coup\u00e9.\n\nIOL Motoring\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "id": "9854290", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "First pictures: Sexy BMW Concept previews new Z4 | IOL Motoring", "image": "https://image.iol.co.za/image/1/process/620x349?source=https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/2017/08/18/iol/434/IOL-mot-pic-aug18-BMW-Concept-Z4-1.jpg&operation=CROP&offset=258x393&resize=1100x617", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Gen\u00e8ve"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "93926", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "label": {"eng": "Gen\u00e8ve"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Monterey"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "228556", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey,_California", "label": {"eng": "Monterey"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "228859", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach,_California", "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota"}, "id": "303971", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wheelbase"}, "id": "307157", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelbase"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automatic transmission"}, "id": "307523", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coup\u00e9"}, "id": "307533", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup\u00e9"}, {"label": {"eng": "Manual transmission"}, "id": "307839", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_transmission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transmission (mechanics)"}, "id": "307841", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Semi-automatic transmission"}, "id": "308035", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_transmission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Maria Sharapova"}, "id": "316790", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sharapova"}, {"label": {"eng": "Z3 (computer)"}, "id": "324360", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota Supra"}, "id": "339778", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Supra"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M Coupe"}, "id": "818911", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M_Coupe"}, {"label": {"eng": "Z4 (computer)"}, "id": "858298", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z4_(computer)"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Monterey"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 106, "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Industrial Supply", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Industrial_Supply"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "08:44:00"}

You like? Revealed at the world's poshest garden party - the Concours d'Elegance at Pebble Beach - it leaves precious little to the imagination about what the production version will look like when it lands in 2018.\n\nBMW has been criticised of late for its lack of design cojones, mainly by us to be fair (see new BMW 5 Series and 6 Series Gran Turismo for drab proof), but correct us if we're wrong... this is a bit of a return to form. All the classic roadster cues are there: long bonnet, short overhangs, no roof, while the whole package has been marinated in a refreshingly aggressive take on BMW's latest design themes.\n\nSlashes in the bonnet, 'Air Breathers' behind the front wheels and LED taillights that wrap right around the rear make it a proper eye-catcher. But let's not get ahead of ourselves... this is the concept, the showroom version will inevitably be toned down a bit. No word on whether it'll keep the current Z4's weighty folding tin top, or return to the Z3's canvas. We're hoping the latter.\n\nWhat we do know is it'll be rear driven. \"Light and shaded surfaces develop in a rising movement towards the rear, then twist to form muscular wheel arches and athletic volumes. All of which shines a bright stylistic spotlight on the car's rear-wheel drive,\" says BMW's overly-elaborate press release. This is interesting because we know this car has been co-developed with the new (coupe-only) Toyota Supra, also due on sale in 2018, and both cars will share hybrid technology.\n\nCorrect us if we're wrong... this is a bit of a return to form\n\nIt's rumoured that both BMW and Toyota will deploy a petrol-electric version using BMW's four-cylnder turbocharged petrol engine with electric motors on the front axle fed by supercapacitors. So, four-wheel drive and instant acceleration. The suggestion from this press release is that the BMW at least will get rear-drive, conventionally-powered versions, too.\n\nThe shared platform is believed to harness BMW's expertise in carbon-fibre and aluminium learned from its i3/i8 venture, but we're speculating here. BMW is intentionally keeping its lights on tech nuggets at this stage, to give the styling a chance to shine.\n\nOn the inside there's no attempt to reinvent the wheel, but the way the digital instrument cluster and central screen butt up against each other, giving you options to place vital information wherever you feel most comfortable with it, is a nice touch. A contrasting colour scheme for the driver and a lap timer on the base of the steering wheel, ditto, although we doubt either of these will make the final cut.\n\nSo what do you think?

Even more importantly, its platform will also underpin the new Toyota Supra, or whatever Toyota ends up calling that thing.\n\nWe don't know much else for now, except that if it is indeed related to the Supra a range of four- and six-cylinder turbo engines are expected.

In 2013, the German and Japanese automakers have signed an agreement under which the companies will work together to the power plant on fuel cells, a platform for mid-size sports cars, and light composite materials and new type batteries.\n\nThe production version of the prototype will have a powertrain and electronics developed by BMW, while a number of chassis components, including suspension and brake systems, the model will share with the future Toyota sports car - the alleged successor to the Supra coupe.", "id": "9766300", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Published the first photos of the new BMW Roadster - micetimes.asia", "image": "http://micetimes.asia/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/35b7d0768bd7565626ddfba30890714b.jpeg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 218, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 227}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}, "id": "302572", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry"}, {"label": {"eng": "Internet"}, "id": "302869", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet"}, {"label": {"eng": "Power station"}, "id": "303205", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_station"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota"}, "id": "303971", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Design"}, "id": "304413", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design"}, {"label": {"eng": "Composite material"}, "id": "305484", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_material"}, {"label": {"eng": "Electronics"}, "id": "306532", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics"}, {"label": {"eng": "Mid-size car"}, "id": "307079", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-size_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Suspension (vehicle)"}, "id": "307170", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(vehicle)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Chassis"}, "id": "307177", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chassis"}, {"label": {"eng": "Prototype"}, "id": "311802", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype"}, {"label": {"eng": "Powertrain"}, "id": "314837", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powertrain"}, {"label": {"eng": "Concept car"}, "id": "319256", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Fuel cell"}, "id": "330237", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_cell"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sports car racing"}, "id": "337289", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car_racing"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "339744", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M4"}, "id": "386136", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Big Three (automobile manufacturers)"}, "id": "402319", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Three_(automobile_manufacturers)"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 144, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 871, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Manufacturing", "uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Manufacturing"}], "time": "16:06:00"}

It's a key component of the Munich-based carmaker's shift into \"attack mode\" after Mercedes outsold BMW for the first time in more than a decade last year to take the global lead in luxury cars.\n\nChief Executive Officer Harald Krueger, who took charge in 2015, is seeking to shake off a rocky start to his tenure through an ambitious plan to overhaul the manufacturer's lineup with 40 new or refreshed vehicles in the coming two years in what BMW describes as the biggest model offensive in its history.\n\nReloading the Z4 shows BMW's desire to restore sporty credentials after a run of utilitarian models like the Gran Tourer minivan and cautious revamps of mainstays such as the 7-Series and 5-Series sedans. It will challenge the Mercedes SLC and be flanked by BMW's new 8-Series luxury coupe, which will vie for elite drivers with the likes of the Maserati GranTurismo, Porsche 911 and Mercedes AMG GT. The carmaker also plans to re-enter Le Mans GT-class racing next year to challenge Porsche, just as Audi is quitting the famed 24-hour endurance contest.\n\n\"We've been hearing big words for months, and Krueger made the claim about getting back to No. 1 some time ago,\" Juergen Pieper, a Frankfurt-based analyst at Bankhaus Metzler. \"Words are one thing, action another. How claims of a truly new design will impress customers remains to be seen.\"\n\nRacy cachet is crucial for BMW to woo wealthy consumers after Mercedes undertook a well-received design overhaul and brands from Alfa Romeo to Volvo started targeting that clientele with aggressive growth plans.\n\n\"The concept Z4 shows off from all angles BMW's new design language,\" said Adrian van Hooydonk, who heads design for the manufacturer. \"It's an absolute driving machine.\"\n\nThe German carmaker is also shifting more upscale to maintain profitability amid the financial strain of developing self-driving electric vehicles, which will take years to recoup upfront investment.\n\nWhile the Z4 will shore up BMW's image, sales will be small as demand for open-top vehicles shrinks. Deliveries might peak at 22,150 in 2020, according to forecaster IHS Automotive. That compares to an annual high of about 48,600 for the car's first-generation model, and a total of 2.4 million deliveries for the BMW group last year.\n\nConvertibles, once the ultimate expression of a carefree lifestyle, are falling out of favor as pollution and congestion sour the appeal of open-air driving. Instead, buyers are increasingly opting for an expanding range of upscale SUVs, ranging from sporty coupe-like models to opulent full-sized cruisers.\n\nTo save on costs, BMW co-developed the Z4's main components and chassis with Toyota Motor Corp. as part of a 2013 partnership. The Japanese manufacturer plans to present its version, the Toyota Supra, at the Tokyo Motor Show in October, as part of its own project to shed its utilitarian image.\n\n\"It is still important to build these kinds of dream cars that build on brand values for marketing cachet,\" said Tim Urquhart, a London-based analyst with IHS Automotive. \"It's an intelligent move to do this car with a partner and have common underpinnings, reaping cost savings and gain scale.\"", "id": "9745175", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "BMW Abandons Boring With Shark-Nose Roadster to Counter

As an interesting way to cut production costs through collaboration while avoiding getting into direct competition, BMW will reportedly produce only a roadster version (don't look for another M Coup\u00e9) while Toyota will release the new Supra only as a coup\u00e9.\n\nCheck back for more details as we get them.\n\nIOL Motoring\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "id": "9841856", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "First pictures: BMW Concept previews new Z4 | IOL Motoring", "image": "https://image.iol.co.za/image/1/process/620x349?source=https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/2017/08/18/iol/434/IOL-mot-pic-aug18-BMW-Concept-Z4-1.jpg&operation=CROP&offset=258x393&resize=1100x617", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Gen\u00e8ve"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "93926", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva", "label": {"eng": "Gen\u00e8ve"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Monterey"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "228556", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey,_California", "label": {"eng": "Monterey"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "228859", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach,_California", "label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota"}, "id": "303971", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 5, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Coup\u00e9"}, "id": "307533", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup\u00e9"}, {"label": {"eng": "Maria Sharapova"}, "id": "316790", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Sharapova"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota Supra"}, "id": "339778", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Supra"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M4"}, "id": "386136", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z4"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M Coupe"}, "id": "818911", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_M_Coupe"}], "location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Monterey"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 150, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 372, "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 440, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Barbecues", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Barbecues"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "07:23:00"}

You may also know that they won't be going at it alone, as they've partnered up with BMW for this epic journey.\n\nThe benefits of doing so are pretty obvious. Both companies get to share research and development costs, as well as make a better platform overall. Two brains think better than one is the way the saying goes I believe.\n\nOriginally, everyone thought that BMW would be supplying the chassis and Toyota will be in charge of the drivetrain, but it seems the roles have since reversed. The brand-new BMW Z4 will be officially unveiled at Pebble Beach during Monterey Automotive week in a couple of days, but here's what we know so far.\n\nThe teaser image confirms what everyone already knew: it's a roadster. Although it follows BMW's current design vision, you can tell it also deviates quite a lot. It's moving towards that Vision Future concept we saw a while back, with its aggressive lines and side mirrors that wouldn't look out of place on a jet fighter.\n\nIt's a handsome car, no doubt about that, but if rumors are to be believed, it's more than adequately quick too. The sDrive20i and the sDrive30i get a 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbocharged engine from the BMW family, making anywhere between 200 and 300 horsepower.\n\nAt the top of the offering, you have the 3.0-liter turbocharged six-cylinder (BMW M3/M4 engine?), producing somewhere between 330 and 350 horsepower. If it is indeed a detuned M-unit engine like I'm hoping it is, we could have a serious platform that's open to a lot of mods. Over 450 horsepower will be easily attainable with effectively just a tune and nothing else.\n\nPower will be sent to the rear wheels, but knowing Toyota, I'm willing to bet they offer an all-wheel drive version of their Supra competitor somewhere down the road. As far as transmissions are concerned, if you're a Supra fan, you might cry at the fact that Toyota has decided to leave out the manual stick shift for the new one.\n\nBMW will offer their trusty six-speed in addition to the lightning-quick BMW ZF-box, but the Supra will be an auto-only proposition. This doesn't mean it will be less intriguing, especially knowing full well how good the ZF transmission is, but the absence of a manual will definitely be felt.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on the situation as the event unfolds and BMW releases more information. So, what would you choose? Is the automatic-only Supra effectively flawed from the start for not offering a manual, or is the Z4 badge not as good as the Supra's either way? And is the Supra lacking a manual purely to let BMW have that share of the market?

This being a concept, the wing mirrors and windscreen surround are both stupendously thin.\n\nStay tuned for more details as the day progresses.\n\nPHOTO GALLERY", "id": "9642872", "details": {"gpCnt": 4, "pinCnt": 13}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Say Hello To The Long-Awaited BMW Z4 Concept", "image": "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tU9CJQGCDqA/WZVN7OGzf2I/AAAAAAAAzOQ/qlbGx-BOhdgSVlKLWYv6-5Gst1LeFV9mQCLcBGAs/w1200-h628-p-k-no-nu/BMW-Z4-Concept-1-.jpg", "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 3, "id": "56", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "label": {"eng": "Federal Republic of Germany"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Brand"}, "id": "302722", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand"}, {"label": {"eng": "Color"}, "id": "302907", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automobile"}, "id": "303315", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile"}, {"label": {"eng": "Vehicle"}, "id": "303478", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Exhaust system"}, "id": "304042", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhaust_system"}, {"label": {"eng": "Silver"}, "id": "304216", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sports car"}, "id": "307173", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car"}, {"label": {"eng": "Kidney"}, "id": "316248", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney"}, {"label": {"eng": "Windshield"}, "id": "318359", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windshield"}, {"label": {"eng": "Daytime running lamp"}, "id": "327494", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytime_running_lamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Headlamp"}, "id": "327497", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headlamp"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automotive lighting"}, "id": "328539", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_lighting"}, {"label": {"eng": "Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance"}, "id": "339744", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebble_Beach_Concours_d'Elegance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Production vehicle"}, "id": "376417", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_vehicle"}, {"label": {"eng": "Wing mirror"}, "id": "400692", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_mirror"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 416, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 418, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 420, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Thematic", "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Thematic"}], "time": "08:31:00"}

It is the new Z4 concept that you see in the attached image above.\n\nAggressive eyes with LED technology and more pronounced nostrils than ever, the roadster pictured here is not lacking aggressiveness or muscularity, that's for sure. No official details are available at the moment, except for the study's official debut date - August 17. A date that coincides with the Monterey Car Week.\n\nThe first photo of the roadster, a design sketch revealed a few days ago, suggested that we will see a concept in Monterey and not the production variant. However, it will be very close to the design of the serial model that is currently under development and was spied several times.\n\nJust as a reminder, the new Bavarian roadster will share a common platform with the new Toyota Supra, which means most of the engines will be identical for the two models. A leaked internal document revealed the BMW will be offered with both a manual and an automatic transmission, while its Japanese brother will be getting only an auto gearbox.\n\nLesser versions of the still unnamed roadster will be powered by a four-cylinder turbo engine with 195 horsepower (145 kilowatts), while the range-topper will have a biturbo 3.0-liter inline-six with 335 hp (250 kW).\n\nGiven the Z4 concept's debut tomorrow, we expect to see the production version of the vehicle next year. The Geneva Motor Show in March 2018 looks like a very possible event for the grand premiere of the roadster, but we will have to wait at least a couple of months for more information.\n\nSource: BMW\n\nBe part of something big", "id": "9433198", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-16", "title": "BMW Z4 Concept Previewed In Substantial Teaser", "image": "https://icdn-5.motor1.com/images/mgl/2zgJz/s1/bmw-z4-teaser.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"imp": true, "textStart": 547, "date": "2017-08-17", "amb": false, "textEnd": 556}, {"textStart": 1591, "date": "2018-03-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1601}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Monterey"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "228556", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey,_California", "label": {"eng": "Monterey"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW"}, "id": "304029", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW"}, {"label": {"eng": "Twin-turbo"}, "id": "307162", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin-turbo"}, {"label": {"eng": "Inline-four engine"}, "id": "307168", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline-four_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Automatic transmission"}, "id": "307523", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_transmission"}, {"label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}, "id": "307580", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger"}, {"label": {"eng": "Horsepower"}, "id": "307583", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsepower"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transmission (mechanics)"}, "id": "307841", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_(mechanics)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Straight-six engine"}, "id": "327073", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight-six_engine"}, {"label": {"eng": "Toyota Supra"}, "id": "339778", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Supra"}, {"label": {"eng": "Roadster (automobile)"}, "id": "346204", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadster_(automobile)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Geneva Motor Show"}, "id": "362317", "score": 1, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva_Motor_Show"}, {"label": {"eng": "BMW M4"}, "id": "386136", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_Z4"}, {"label": {"eng": "Monterey Car Week"}, "id": "1425191", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Car_Week"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 415, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 419, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Enthusiasts"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 461, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Makes_and_Models"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 463, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts and Accessories", "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Vehicles/Parts_and_Accessories"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 964, "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes and Models", "uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Makes_and_Models"}], "time": "08:24:00"}

The concept vehicle has a 'speedster' design that appears to have a roof section stored beneath it\n\nAs well as the bold seat colour choices, there are a number of other elements that are all-new for the German car maker.\n\nMost notable is the widened kidney grilles at the front, which push the headlights out to the front corners. As with BMW tradition, it's a double headlamp setup, but the arrangement - with one stacked on top of the other - is a first for the brand.\n\nMoving up the front end, the bonnet is a clam-shell design that stretches part-way down the front wings, helping to form a deep aerodynamic indent running down the flanks of the Z4.\n\nThe new Z4 looks set to be more wedge-shaped than before with deep indents running up the flanks of the car\n\nThe Z4 concept was officially showcased at this year's Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance in California on Thursday\n\nInside, the cabin is very much focussed towards the driver, with the passenger having a more minimalist dash in front of them\n\nIn all, the design is far more aggressive than the model currently in showrooms, with the wedge-shaped panels, muscular rear haunches and shark-nosed front end echoing the bigger 8 Series sports car concept.\n\nAs well as being better looking, expect it to be lighter than the outgoing Z4 too, as it is set to feature a fabric folding roof design rather than a shape-shifting hard-top used for the current car.\n\nThe Z4 will have some stiff competition from rival premium-car brands. The Audi TT roadster (left) is the dominant roadster at a similar price point, while the Mercedes SLC (right) is another option\n\nAt the more affordable end of the market, the Mazda MX-5 (left) has been the dominant roadster for years. However, the Fiat 124 Spider (right), which uses the same chassis as the Mazda, has become another option for buyers at this price point\n\nWhat that also means is that the glorious 'speedster' look of the concept, with sculpted buttresses behind the seat headrests, is unlikely to be retained for production.\n\nAs with many next-generation models, the dash is an all-digital affair with high-definition screens replacing the traditional instrument clocks and function buttons. It's very much directed towards the driver too, providing an elegant and minimal dashboard section in front of the passenger.\n\nHigh-definition displays dominate the interior, replacing the traditional instrument cluster of clocks\n\nThe wide kidney grilles - synonymous with BMW - are very similar to the 8 Series Concept. It means the headlights are pushed to the corners of the car\n\nThe concept featured an obscure split interior colour scheme, with the driver seat and cockpit section in black and the passenger side of the cabin lavished in 'Energetic Orange' materials\n\nThe rear LED light design is very similar to that of the 8 Series concept, suggesting this is the direction BMW is intending to go with its future styling\n\nBeing a concept, BMW gave has given no details away about engine range or price.\n\nThat said, you can expect the 2018 Z4 to feature the 2.0-litre four-cylinder and 3.0-litre six-cylinder turbocharged petrol engines currently being offered across today's model range, meaning a power output of up to 350bhp.\n\nThere is also talk of a plug-in hybrid model to be in-keeping with BMW's drive for electrification, though there is no mention of a hot-blooded M Performance model as yet.\n\nThe existing Z4 price range starts from \u00a330,010, so expect there to be a slight premium on top of this.\n\nBut if the next Z4 roadster looks as good as this, most buyers are unlikely to be deterred by a mild price increase.\n\nSAVE MONEY ON MOTORING Car insurance Compare policies

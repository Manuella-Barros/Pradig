{"id": 243298740, "title": "UK weather: Exact areas Met Office forecasts miserable washout after 30Cs highs", "text": "Rain will batter some regions of the UK this gloomy weekend - a huge contrast to the 30C highs many areas enjoyed in the week. The Met Office has shared its forecast for today and tomorrow and, in a video on YouTube, meteorologist Aidan McGivern details a band of low pressure moving in from the west. It will linger slowly across Wales, the Midlands and some parts of northwest England on Saturday, the forecaster said. And it means it will feel considerably cooler today, with temperatures as low as 11C in the Shetland Islands, 14C in Cumbria and 15C in Pembrokeshire. Even in warmer parts, such as London where the mercury will peak at 23C, it will be colder than Wednesday's scorcher - when many places sizzled in 30C heat. But while the rain will be persistent, it won't be heavy today, the Met Office added. Mr McGivern said: \"We have still got showers going across northern and western Scotland by the way, that's going to be the feature going into the weekend. This weak frontal zone then just sort of meanders across central and southern parts of England and Wales and fizzles out. \"It's likely to be a relatively cloudy picture in many of these areas, although there could be some sunshine coming through across the Southeast England, and then later towards north Wales and Northwest England, but the rainfall amounts [are] not exceptional. [There will be] outbreaks of mostly light, moderate rain, later on there is the small chance that it could break out into some heavy showers by Sunday in the Southeast of England, but what that means is through the weekend, it's generally cloudy skies with a few light to moderate showers was associated with that frontal system.\" Significant rain, at this early stage, is also forecast for the end of next week in southern areas. Early indications are it could be thundery across the Home Counties on Friday - the day after Brits go to vote. Forecasters say it could be a hint of what is to come for large parts of July. Writing on its website, the Met Office states weather for the period of July 12 and 26 will be unsettled. The long-range forecast reads: \"Any more significant rainfall would most likely occur in the northwest, with thunderstorms possible elsewhere. There is a slightly higher than normal chance of heatwaves developing during this period.\" Heatwaves, though, would mirror the weather Brits experienced this week. The mercury exceeded 30C across multiple regions, notably eastern and southern parts, on Tuesday and Wednesday, the warmest days of the year so far. Beaches were packed, parks were busy and outdoor tourist attractions enjoyed a booming week of trade. Festival-goers, meanwhile, have been able to enjoy Glastonbury in the sunshine and without any rain - so far - but tomorrow presents a risk of showers. Nevertheless, it is unlikely to dampen spirits and all eyes are on Dua Lipa, who is expected to be supported by a large pro-Palestine presence, sources say. The singer has previously hit out at military operations in Gaza as \u201c Israeli genocide\u201d. A concentration of Palestinian flags is expected to greet her performance on the Pyramid stage. The 28-year-old previously said she repeatedly checked herself before making a statement, but did so if she felt it was for the \u201cgreater good\u201d and worth the risk. The Grammy award-winner last month reposted to her 88 million Instagram followers a graphic from the group Artists4Ceasefire, along with the hashtag #AllEyesOnRafah, which trended in the days after Israel\u2019s bombing of the city in Gaza.", "summary": "The Met Office has also alluded to the possibility of frequent thunderstorms in July, a stark contrast from the warm end to June, during which temperatures exceeded 30C", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-weather-exact-areas-met-33132572", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33132722.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Tourists-shelter-from-wind-and-rain-under-umbrellas-on.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 04:00:00", "author": "Bradley Jolly,Bradley-Jolly", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Bradley-Jolly"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.002}

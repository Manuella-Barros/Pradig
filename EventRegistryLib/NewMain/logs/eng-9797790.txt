Cori Bush on Tuesday, Aug. 6, 2024, in St. Louis. (Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP)\n\nBy JIM SALTER Associated Press\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell has defeated U.S. Rep. Cori Bush in a Democratic primary in St. Louis, marking the second time this year that one of the party's incumbents has been ousted in an expensive contest that reflected deep divisions over the war in Gaza.\n\nBush, a member of the progressive congressional group known as the \"Squad,\" was seeking a third term in Missouri's 1st Congressional District, which includes St. Louis city and part of St. Louis County. Bell is heavily favored to carry this overwhelmingly Democratic district in November, when his party is aiming to retake control of the U.S. House.\n\n\"I am committed to serving the St. Louis region in Congress with integrity, transparency, and dedication,\" Bell said in a statement. \"Together, we will tackle the challenges ahead and build a community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\"\n\nBush, in a fiery concession speech, said she still has work to do, even if she'll no longer be in Congress.\n\n\"At the end of the day, whether I'm a congresswoman or not, I'm still taking care of my people,\" Bush said.\n\nBell's campaign received a big boost from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, whose super political action committee, United Democracy Project, spent $8.5 million to oust Bush. She was targeted after repeated criticism of Israel's response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.\n\nIt was a gameplan that worked earlier this year in New York. In June, United Democracy Project spent $15 million to defeat another Squad member -- U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman. Bowman lost to George Latimer, a pro-Israel centrist.\n\nA statement from United Democracy Project said the wins by Bell and Latimer, along with John McGuire's defeat of U.S. Rep. Bob Good in a Republican primary last week in Virginia, \"is further proof that being pro-Israel is good policy and good politics on both sides of the aisle. UDP will continue our efforts to support leaders working to strengthen the U.S.-Israel alliance while countering detractors in either political party.\"\n\nBush, in her concession speech, said she won't change.\n\n\"We will keep supporting a free Palestine,\" Bush said. A crowd member answered back: \"Free, free Palestine.\"\n\nIn October, Bush called the Israeli retaliation an \"ethnic cleansing campaign.\" Soon after the Hamas attack, Bush wrote on social media that Israel's \"collective punishment against Palestinians for Hamas's actions is a war crime.\"\n\nHer comments prompted backlash, even among some supporters in her district. Bell, who had been planning a Senate run against incumbent Republican Josh Hawley, instead opted to challenge Bush. He told The Associated Press last month that Bush's comments about Israel were \"wrong and offensive.\"\n\nBush responded by saying that the donors behind AIPAC support former President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\n\n\"This is only the beginning,\" Bush told the AP. \"Because if they can unseat me, then they're going to continue to come after more Democrats.\"\n\nBush and Bell both honed their leadership skills in Ferguson, Missouri, in the unrest that followed Michael Brown's death at the hands of a police officer in 2014. Friday marks the 10th anniversary of Brown's death.\n\nBrown, a Black 18-year-old, was walking with a friend on Aug. 9, 2014, when a white officer, Darren Wilson, confronted them. Wilson said he fired in self-defense because Brown was so enraged. Some witnesses said Brown, who was unarmed, had his hands up in surrender. Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing and resigned, and Brown's death led to months of protests.\n\nBush, 48, became a protest leader. She was outspoken and critical of how police in Ferguson and other parts of the St. Louis region treated Black people. Her activism prompted an unsuccessful run against longtime incumbent 1st District Democrat William Lacy Clay in 2018, before she defeated him in 2020. She easily won reelection in 2022.\n\nBell, 49, began hosting conversations about community policing after Brown's death. The lawyer, who previously served as a municipal prosecutor and judge, ran successfully for a seat on the Ferguson City Council before defeating seven-term incumbent St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch in the August 2018 Democratic primary.\n\nAs prosecutor, Bell reopened an examination into Brown's death. He announced in July 2020 that while the investigation didn't exonerate Wilson, there wasn't enough evidence to charge him.\n\n\"My heart breaks\" for Brown's parents, Bell said at the time. \"I know this is not the result they were looking for and that their pain will continue forever.\"\n\nBrown's father, Michael Brown Sr., was featured in an ad for Bush.\n\n\"He used my family for power,\" Brown says of Bell in the ad. \"And now he's trying to sell out St. Louis.\"\n\nBush's campaign focused on what she's accomplished for St. Louis. She said her efforts have brought $2 billion to the 1st District and that it was her protest on the steps of the Capitol in 2021 that helped extend the federal eviction moratorium as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, aiding thousands of St. Louisans.\n\nBell touted his own progressive credentials. He noted that as a prosecutor he has said he will not prosecute any abortion cases in a state that bans the procedure in most instances. He created diversion programs to point people with mental health and substance abuse problems toward treatment instead of jail. And his office has expanded efforts to examine potential cases of wrongful convictions.\n\nIn Missouri's 3rd District, which stretches from the western outskirts of the St. Louis region through central Missouri, the candidate with Trump's endorsement won. Bob Onder, a physician and also a former state senator, defeated former state Sen. Kurt Schaefer.\n\nTrump wrote on Truth Social last month that Onder was \"an incredible America First Patriot.\" The former president wrote that Schaefer \"is WEAK ON MAGA,\" adding, \"That's all you have to know!\"\n\nThe 3rd District is heavily Republican, and Onder will be favored against Democrat Bethany Mann, a political newcomer, in November. ___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct that Onder won in Missouri's 3rd District, not Schaefer\n\n___\n\nSummer Ballentine in Columbia, Missouri, contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "kurv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "710

Bush is the second member of the \"squad,\" an informal group of nine far-left House members, to be ousted by a primary challenger after Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York lost his primary bid against Westchester County Executive George Latimer on June 25.\n\n\"At the end of the day, whether I'm a congresswoman or not, I'm still taking care of my people,\" Bush said.\n\n*I am deeply honored and humbled by the trust the people of this district have placed in me,\" Bell said in a statement. \"This victory belongs to every volunteer, every supporter, and every voter who believes in our vision for a better future.\"\n\nJust a week out of the race, Bush was trailing six points behind Bell, according to a survey conducted by the Wellman Group from July 29. Prior to the latest poll, Bush was facing an over 20-point deficit against Bell, according to a survey conducted by McLaughlin & Associates from July 14.\n\nBush, like her fellow \"squad\" member Bowman, faced criticism and a significant polling deficit after taking a pro-Palestinian stance in the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nBush has continuously called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and has referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a \"war criminal\" who \"stood for genocide.\" Bush, along with other \"squad\" members, voted against a resolution condemning Hamas for starting an \"unprovoked war on Israel\" on Oct. 7.\n\nAs a result of Bush's remarks and her voting record, various pro-Israeli groups, like the American Israel Affairs Public Committee (AIPAC) and the Jewish Democratic Council of America, have opted to back Bell. AIPAC alone has spent nearly $9 million on ads against Bush in support of Bell in the race.\n\n\"AIPAC's grassroots members are proud to support strong pro-Israel progressive Democrats like Wesley

actively worked to undermine mainstream Democratic support for the U.S.-Israel relationship.\"\n\n\"I am committed to serving the St. Louis region in Congress with integrity, transparency, and dedication,\" Bell said in the statement. \"Together, we will tackle the challenges ahead and build a community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\"", "source": {"uri":

LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell has defeated U.S. Rep. Cori Bush in a Democratic primary in St. Louis, marking the second time this year that one of the party's incumbents has been ousted in an expensive contest that reflected deep divisions over the war in Gaza.\n\nBush, a member of the progressive congressional group known as the \"Squad,\" was seeking a third term in Missouri's 1st Congressional District, which includes St. Louis city and part of St. Louis County. Bell is heavily favored to carry this overwhelmingly Democratic district in November, when his party is aiming to retake control of the U.S. House.\n\n\"I am committed to serving the St. Louis region in Congress with integrity, transparency, and dedication,\" Bell said in a statement. \"Together, we will tackle the challenges ahead and build a community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\"\n\nBush, in a fiery concession speech, said she still has work to do, even if she'll no longer be in Congress.\n\n\"At the end of the day, whether I'm a congresswoman or not, I'm still taking care of my people,\" Bush said.\n\nBell's campaign received a big boost from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, whose super political action committee, United Democracy Project, spent $8.5 million to oust Bush. She was targeted after repeated criticism of Israel's response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.\n\nIt was a gameplan that worked earlier this year in New York. In June, United Democracy Project spent $15 million to defeat another Squad member -- U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman. Bowman lost to George Latimer, a pro-Israel centrist.\n\nA statement from United Democracy Project said the wins by Bell and Latimer, along with John McGuire's defeat of U.S. Rep. Bob Good in a Republican primary last week in Virginia, \"is further proof that being pro-Israel is good policy and good politics on both sides of the aisle. UDP will continue our efforts to support leaders working to strengthen the U.S.-Israel alliance while countering detractors in either political party.\"\n\nBush, in her concession speech, said she won't change.\n\n\"We will keep supporting a free Palestine,\" Bush said. A crowd member answered back: \"Free, free Palestine.\"\n\nIn October, Bush called the Israeli retaliation an \"ethnic cleansing campaign.\" Soon after the Hamas attack, Bush wrote on social media that Israel's \"collective punishment against Palestinians for Hamas's actions is a war crime.\"\n\nHer comments prompted backlash, even among some supporters in her district. Bell, who had been planning a Senate run against incumbent Republican Josh Hawley, instead opted to challenge Bush. He told The Associated Press last month that Bush's comments about Israel were \"wrong and offensive.\"\n\nBush responded by saying that the donors behind AIPAC support former President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\n\n\"This is only the beginning,\" Bush told the AP. \"Because if they can unseat me, then they're going to continue to come after more Democrats.\"", "source": {"uri":

Friday marks the 10th anniversary of Brown's death.\n\nBrown, a Black 18-year-old, was walking with a friend on Aug. 9, 2014, when a white officer, Darren Wilson, confronted them. Wilson said he fired in self-defense because Brown was so enraged. Some witnesses said Brown, who was unarmed, had his hands up in surrender. Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing and resigned, and Brown's death led to months of protests.\n\nBush, 48, became a protest leader. She was outspoken and critical of how police in Ferguson and other parts of the St. Louis region treated Black people. Her activism prompted an unsuccessful run against longtime incumbent 1st District Democrat William Lacy Clay in 2018, before she defeated him in 2020. She won reelection in 2022.\n\nBell, 49, began hosting conversations about community policing after Brown's death. The lawyer, who previously served as a municipal prosecutor and judge, ran successfully for a seat on the Ferguson City Council before defeating seven-term incumbent St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch in the August 2018 Democratic primary.\n\nAs prosecutor, Bell reopened an examination into Brown's death. He announced in July 2020 that while the investigation didn't exonerate Wilson, there wasn't enough evidence to charge him.\n\n\"My heart breaks\" for Brown's parents, Bell said at the time. \"I know this is not the result they were looking for and that their pain will continue forever.\"\n\nBrown's father, Michael Brown Sr., was featured in an ad for Bush.\n\n\"He used my family for power,\" Brown says of Bell in the ad. \"And now he's trying to sell out St. Louis.\"\n\nBush's campaign focused on what she's accomplished for St. Louis. She said her efforts have brought $2 billion to the 1st District and that it was her protest on the steps of the Capitol in 2021 that helped extend the federal eviction moratorium as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, aiding thousands of St. Louisans.\n\nBell touted his own progressive credentials. He noted that as a prosecutor he has said he will not prosecute any abortion cases in a state that bans the procedure in most instances. He created diversion programs to point people with mental health and substance abuse problems toward treatment instead of jail. And his office has expanded efforts to examine potential cases of wrongful convictions.\n\nIn Missouri's 3rd District, which stretches from the western outskirts of the St. Louis region through central Missouri, the candidate with Trump's endorsement won. Bob Onder, a physician and also a former state senator, defeated former state Sen. Kurt Schaefer.\n\nTrump wrote on Truth Social last month that Onder was \"an incredible America First Patriot.\" The former president wrote that Schaefer \"is WEAK ON MAGA,\" adding, \"That's all you have to know!\"\n\nThe 3rd District is Republican, and Onder will be favored against Democrat Bethany Mann, a political newcomer, in November.", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news",

LOUIS (AP) -- St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell has defeated U.S. Rep. Cori Bush in a Democratic primary in St. Louis, marking the second time this year that one of the party's incumbents has been ousted in an expensive contest that reflected deep divisions over the war in Gaza.\n\nREAD MORE: Progressive Democrats break fundraising records in election fight against pro-Israel PACs\n\nBush, a member of the progressive congressional group known as the \"Squad,\" was seeking a third term in Missouri's 1st Congressional District, which includes St. Louis city and part of St. Louis County. Bell is heavily favored to carry this overwhelmingly Democratic district in November, when his party is aiming to retake control of the U.S. House.\n\n\"I am committed to serving the St. Louis region in Congress with integrity, transparency, and dedication,\" Bell said in a statement. \"Together, we will tackle the challenges ahead and build a community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\"\n\nBush, in a fiery concession speech, said she still has work to do, even if she'll no longer be in Congress.\n\n\"At the end of the day, whether I'm a congresswoman or not, I'm still taking care of my people,\" Bush said.\n\nBell's campaign received a big boost from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, whose super political action committee, United Democracy Project, spent $8.5 million to oust Bush. She was targeted after repeated criticism of Israel's response to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack.\n\nIt was a gameplan that worked earlier this year in New York. In June, United Democracy Project spent $15 million to defeat another Squad member -- U.S. Rep. Jamaal Bowman. Bowman lost to George Latimer, a pro-Israel centrist.\n\nA statement from United Democracy Project said the wins by Bell and Latimer, along with John McGuire's defeat of U.S. Rep. Bob Good in a Republican primary last week in Virginia, \"is further proof that being pro-Israel is good policy and good politics on both sides of the aisle. UDP will continue our efforts to support leaders working to strengthen the U.S.-Israel alliance while countering detractors in either political party.\"\n\nBush, in her concession speech, said she won't change.\n\n\"We will keep supporting a free Palestine,\" Bush said. A crowd member answered back: \"Free, free Palestine.\"\n\nIn October, Bush called the Israeli retaliation an \"ethnic cleansing campaign.\" Soon after the Hamas attack, Bush wrote on social media that Israel's \"collective punishment against Palestinians for Hamas's actions is a war crime.\"\n\nHer comments prompted backlash, even among some supporters in her district. Bell, who had been planning a Senate run against incumbent Republican Josh Hawley, instead opted to challenge Bush. He told The Associated Press last month that Bush's comments about Israel were \"wrong and offensive.\"\n\nBush responded by saying that the donors behind AIPAC support former President Donald Trump and other Republicans.\n\n\"This is only the beginning,\" Bush told the AP. \"Because if they can unseat me, then they're going to continue to come after more Democrats.\"\n\nBush and Bell both honed their leadership skills in Ferguson, Missouri, in the unrest that followed Michael Brown's death at the hands of a police officer in 2014. Friday marks the 10th anniversary of Brown's death.\n\nBrown, a Black 18-year-old, was walking with a friend on Aug. 9, 2014, when a white officer, Darren Wilson, confronted them. Wilson said he fired in self-defense because Brown was so enraged. Some witnesses said Brown, who was unarmed, had his hands up in surrender. Wilson was cleared of wrongdoing and resigned, and Brown's death led to months of protests.\n\nBush, 48, became a protest leader. She was outspoken and critical of how police in Ferguson and other parts of the St. Louis region treated Black people. Her activism prompted an unsuccessful run against longtime incumbent 1st District Democrat William Lacy Clay in 2018, before she defeated him in 2020. She easily won reelection in 2022.\n\nBell, 49, began hosting conversations about community policing after Brown's death. The lawyer, who previously served as a municipal prosecutor and judge, ran successfully for a seat on the Ferguson City Council before defeating seven-term incumbent St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch in the August 2018 Democratic primary.\n\nAs prosecutor, Bell reopened an examination into Brown's death. He announced in July 2020 that while the investigation didn't exonerate Wilson, there wasn't enough evidence to charge him.\n\n\"My heart breaks\" for Brown's parents, Bell said at the time. \"I know this is not the result they were looking for and that their pain will continue forever.\"\n\nBrown's father, Michael Brown Sr., was featured in an ad for Bush.\n\n\"He used my family for power,\" Brown says of Bell in the ad. \"And now he's trying to sell out St. Louis.\"\n\nBush's campaign focused on what she's accomplished for St. Louis. She said her efforts have brought $2 billion to the 1st District and that it was her protest on the steps of the Capitol in 2021 that helped extend the federal eviction moratorium as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, aiding thousands of St. Louisans.\n\nREAD MORE: How St. Louis tapped federal funds to help people travel who need abortions\n\nBell touted his own progressive credentials. He noted that as a prosecutor he has said he will not prosecute any abortion cases in a state that bans the procedure in most instances. He created diversion programs to point people with mental health and substance abuse problems toward treatment instead of jail. And his office has expanded efforts to examine potential cases of wrongful convictions.\n\nIn Missouri's 3rd District, which stretches from the western outskirts of the St. Louis region through central Missouri, the candidate with Trump's endorsement won. Bob Onder, a physician and also a former state senator, defeated former state Sen. Kurt Schaefer.\n\nTrump wrote on Truth Social last month that Onder was \"an incredible America First Patriot.\" The former president wrote that Schaefer \"is WEAK ON MAGA,\" adding, \"That's all you have to know!\"\n\nThe 3rd District is heavily Republican, and Onder will be favored against Democrat Bethany Mann, a political newcomer, in November.\n\nSummer Ballentine in Columbia, Missouri,

Cori Bush is in real danger of losing her reelection bid as Missouri voters head to the polls today.\n\nThe controversial Democrat is in a hotly-contested race against a centrist challenger who has been hammering Bush for her record of supporting pro-Gaza protests and causes.\n\nPolls close in Missouri at 7:00 p.m. ET on Tuesday, and her fate will be sealed by tonight.\n\nIf Bush loses her primary next week it would make her the second Squad member to lose reelection this year.\n\nRep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., lost his primary to a more moderate Democrat earlier this summer.\n\nA shocking survey last week showed Bush's campaign trailing by a massive six points as she looks to avoid being the second progressive Squad member ousted this year.\n\nThe Mellman Group on behalf of the Democratic Majority For Israel PAC released a poll showing Bush's challenger St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell ahead of her 48 percent to 42 percent.\n\nSimilar to Bush's race against Bell, Bowman's race in New York hinged on a key issue: the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nBowman, a fellow member of the Squad (at least for now before he leaves Congress this winter), fiercely defended Palestinians and decried the Israeli's actions as 'genocide.'\n\nHis reward for repeatedly attacking the Jewish nation's wartime conduct: a pro-Israel SuperPAC coming after him.\n\nAIPAC, a pro-Israel political group, spent massively against Bowman, pumping millions upon millions into the campaign of a local county executive.\n\nWith the support of the group, Westchester County Executive George Latimer, a moderate Democrat, sailed to an easy primary win, securing over 59 percent of the vote compared to Bowman's 40 percent.\n\nMeanwhile in Missouri, Bell has had a much tamer tone on the Israel-Hamas war while Bush has loudly advocated for pro-Gaza policies and has thrown her support by anti-Israel protestors, a difference that is expected to impact the race.\n\nAnd AIPAC is clearly looking to replicate their maneuver against Bowman to strong arm Bush out of office.\n\n'AIPAC's grassroots members are proud to support strong pro-Israel progressive Democrats like Wesley Bell,' an AIPAC wrote statement recently.\n\n'Cori Bush has been one of the most hostile critics of Israel since she came to Congress in 2021 and has actively worked to undermine mainstream Democratic support for the U.S.-Israel relationship.'\n\nIn the spring Bush even hosted an event for anti-Israel protestors that were removed by police from George Washington University for squatting on campus property in an encampment for a week.\n\nShe and fellow Squad mate Rep. Rashida Tlaib celebrated the students's heroics at a press conference in front of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore recently Bush skipped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's joint address to Congress last week.\n\nThe prosecutor has beat Bush in recent polls for months, showing the former Black Lives Matter organizer consistently behind him.\n\nThe poll, which was conducted from July 21-24 among 400 in-district voters, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9%.\n\nThe bad news for Bush is that this poll is a major improvement for her opponent Bell.\n\nIn June a poll from the same group found him leading the incumbent by a narrow one point margin, up 43 percent to Bush's 42 percent.\n\nIn addition to Bush and Bowman, Squad founding member Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., is also facing a difficult Democratic primary challenger who she narrowly beat in 2022.\n\nThe Democratic primary between Bush and Bell is scheduled for August 6.", "source":

Bush is the second member of the \"squad,\" an informal group of nine far-left House members, to be ousted by a primary challenger after Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York lost his primary bid against Westchester County Executive George Latimer on June 25. (RELATED: 'Squad' Dem Fighting For Survival Wants To 'Be Careful' About Labeling Hamas As Terrorists)\n\n\"At the end of the day, whether I'm a congresswoman or not, I'm still taking care of my people,\" Bush said.\n\n*I am deeply honored and humbled by the trust the people of this district have placed in me,\" Bell said in a statement. \"This victory belongs to every volunteer, every supporter, and every voter who believes in our vision for a better future.\"\n\nJust a week out of the race, Bush was trailing six points behind Bell, according to a survey conducted by the Wellman Group from July 29. Prior to the latest poll, Bush was facing an over 20-point deficit against Bell, according to a survey conducted by McLaughlin & Associates from July 14.\n\nBush, like her fellow \"squad\" member Bowman, faced criticism and a significant polling deficit after taking a pro-Palestinian stance in the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nBush has continuously called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and has referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as a \"war criminal\" who \"stood for genocide.\" Bush, along with other \"squad\" members, voted against a resolution condemning Hamas for starting an \"unprovoked war on Israel\" on Oct. 7. (RELATED: Cori Bush Still Using Campaign Cash To Pay Husband, Despite Ongoing Federal Investigation)\n\nAs a result of Bush's remarks and her voting record, various pro-Israeli groups, like the American Israel Affairs Public Committee (AIPAC) and the Jewish Democratic Council of America, have opted to back Bell. AIPAC alone has spent nearly $9 million on ads against Bush in support of Bell in the race.\n\n\"AIPAC's grassroots members are proud to support strong pro-Israel progressive Democrats like Wesley Bell,\" AIPAC said in a statement to The Associated Press on Aug. 1 ahead of the election. \"Cori Bush has been one of the most hostile critics of Israel since she came to Congress in 2021 and has actively worked to undermine mainstream Democratic support for the U.S.-Israel relationship.\" (RELATED: Dem Leaders Back 'Squad' Member One Week After Major Blow To Group)\n\n\"I am committed to serving the St. Louis region in Congress with integrity, transparency, and dedication,\" Bell said in the statement. \"Together, we will tackle the challenges ahead and build a community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Cori Bush in Missouri Democratic primary", "body": "This story was originally published by St. Louis Public Radio., a BND news partner.\n\nSt. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell defeated Congresswoman Cori Bush in the Democratic primary on Tuesday, capping off an expensive and contentious campaign that ended the two-term lawmaker's tenure in the U.S. House.\n\nBell captured 51% of the vote, compared to 45% for Bush and 2.6% for former state Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal. Since the St. Louis and St. Louis County-based 1st District is heavily Democratic, Bell will be heavily favored to win in November.\n\n\"This district is ready for better and more accountable representation in Washington, D.C.,\" Bell said at a victory celebration in St. Louis. \"Progressives should actually make progress. And that's what I've done my entire career.\"\n\nBell's victory is a win for pro-Israel groups who spent millions of dollars to boost his candidacy because of Bush's stance on the Israel-Hamas war. It's a loss for the St. Louis progressive movement that's gained power in recent years.\n\nAnd it's the second time a member of \"the Squad\" has lost reelection, after New York Congressman Jamaal Bowman lost to George Latimer in June.\n\n\"I try to stay away from the labels because I think that's part of the problem that leads to the political gridlock in our government now, which results in nothing getting done,\" said Bell, when asked what it meant to defeat another member of \"the Squad.\" \"I'm old enough to remember when Democrats and Republicans butted heads, reached that 11th hour compromise, and they went and had a beer together. I believe I'm cut from that cloth.\"\n\nThe victory caps off a tumultuous 2024 election cycle for Bell.\n\nLast year, Bell announced he was running for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate, joining a field that ultimately included Independence attorney Lucas Kunce and state Sen. Karla May. Despite having high name recognition in the St. Louis area, Bell struggled to match Kunce's fundraising and also failed to consolidate support among Black elected officials who endorsed either Kunce or May.\n\nBut Bell's political trajectory changed after Hamas launched a deadly attack on Israel. Bush condemned Hamas but also called for an end to the U.S. government's support for \"Israel's military occupation and apartheid.\"\n\nShe also said she wouldn't be silent over \"Israel's ethnic cleansing campaign\" after the country launched a military offensive in Gaza.\n\nThose comments provoked outrage both locally and nationally from Jewish groups. And Bell cited Bush's criticism of Israel as one of the reasons he chose to end his U.S. Senate campaign and instead run against Bush. But he also contended that Bush wasn't effective, and promised to be more collaborative in order to bring more money to the St. Louis region.\n\n\"I believe in leading from the front and setting the example,\" Bell said. \"I don't want anybody that's working with me to think that they're outworking me, because you're not going to do that.\"\n\nBush ended up winning the city of St. Louis by around 4,000 votes, but lost St. Louis County by nearly 11,000 votes.\n\n\"We need to build the community back because what just happened helped to rip the community apart,\" Bush said. \"I don't want to feed into that because we have to be one St. Louis. I just hope he actually takes the time to learn about our Palestinian and our Arab and our Muslim community, that he actually speaks to you and that he sees the beauty in what we have created.\"\n\nBush said she had no regrets about speaking up for Palestinians and criticizing Israel's military actions in Gaza.\n\nWhile Bush managed to attract key endorsements from Democratic leaders such as House Minority Whip Katherine Clark and a number of local Black elected officials including St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones, Bell received the backing of St. Louis County municipal leaders like Ferguson Mayor Ella Jones. He also received support from prominent trade unions who are still upset with Bush for voting against a major federal infrastructure bill in 2021.\n\nBush counterattacked with ads questioning Bell's Democratic credentials, pointing to how he helped try to get a Republican elected to the 1st Congressional District in 2006.\n\nBush also contended that her opposition was so \"weak,\" that they needed millions of dollars in order to defeat her.\n\n\"Pulling me away from my position as congresswoman, all you did was take the strings off,\" Bush said.\n\nBell benefited from a substantial increase in fundraising. He also received a massive amount of help from pro-Israel groups like the United Democracy Fund, which is the political arm of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\n\nThose third-party groups spent millions of dollars on ads that primarily attacked Bush's voting and attendance record. They didn't mention her criticism of Israel, which was likely purposeful since the 1st Congressional District contains a plurality of African American voters who often don't cite the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a reason to support or oppose a candidate.\n\nAIPAC said in a statement that \"a progressive pro-Israel Democrat has prevailed over a candidate who represents the extremist fringe that is hostile to the Jewish state.\"\n\n\"Voters across America are rejecting anti-Israel voices in favor of candidates who understand the vital importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship,\" the statement said.\n\nBush ran an ad featuring Michael Brown Sr., who lambasted Bell for not charging former Ferguson Police officer Darren Wilson with shooting and killing his son Michael Brown Jr. Both Bush and Bell were considered major political success stories of the Ferguson protest movement. The ad sought to resonate with Black voters who Bush needed to retain to prevail.\n\n\"They want to represent all the people of this district. I am asking that they do right by Mike Brown's family,\" Bush said.\n\nIf Bell is elected in November, St. Louis County Executive Sam Page will choose his replacement as prosecutor.\n\nOne potential person who could succeed Bell is Beth Orwick, who currently serves as Page's chief of staff. Orwick also worked as an assistant U.S. attorney and as a longtime assistant circuit attorney. She also served as St. Louis County counselor before Page elevated her to chief of staff.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Cori Bush, D-Missouri, became the second member of the informal group of Democrats known as \"The Squad\" to lose a primary this summer. Bush was defeated on Tuesday by challenger Wesley Bell, who becomes the favorite to win the heavily Democratic St. Louis-area district.\n\nAs of early Wednesday, Bell led 51-46 in polling with nearly all of the votes counted.\n\nBush is the second member of \"The Squad\" to lose a primary bid after Rep. Jamaal Bowman lost to George Latimer earlier this year.\n\nBush had earned her seat by ousting an incumbent in the Democratic primary. In 2020, she defeated 10-term Rep. Lacy Clay in a tight Democratic primary. Bush wound up winning the 2020 general election by defeating Anthony Rogers by a 79-19 margin.\n\nShe easily won both the primary and general election in her first reelection bid in 2022.\n\nRELATED STORY | What Walz's record in Congress tells us about his politics\n\nThe two-term member of Congress rose to prominence before 2020 as she took an active role amid the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in Ferguson, Missouri. She organized protests in the town in the wake of the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old shot by Ferguson Police on Aug. 9, 2014.\n\nBell, the St. Louis prosecuting attorney, garnered over $4.1 million in contributions in the race, according to data obtained by Open Secrets. Additionally, the campaign was supported with loads of outside money from pro-Israel groups. According to Open Secrets, more than $7.3 million was spent opposing Bush's reelection, while nearly $5 million was provided to support Bell.\n\nOver $8.5 million in funds came from the United Democracy Project, which strongly opposed Bush's reelection. The group opposed Bush due to her criticism of providing funds for Israel's military. She has said that Israel has committed war crimes in its fight with Hamas, a stance that has angered pro-Israel groups in the U.S.\n\nIsrael has been retaliating against Hamas since the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack.\n\nThe United Democracy Project called Bell's win \"further proof that being pro-Israel is good policy and good politics on both sides of the aisle. UDP will continue our efforts to support leaders working to strengthen the U.S.-Israel alliance while counter detractors in either political party.\"\n\nMembers of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee were responsible for providing over $600,000 for Bell's campaign.

First, they lost Jamaal Bowman and now Cori Bush has been defeated in the Democratic primary in Missouri by St. Louis County prosecuting attorney Wesley Bell. It appears that the only issue that really was in contention was the war in Gaza. Bell ran as a pro-Israel alternative to Bush, while she was unwilling to even call Hamas a terrorist organization. The race wasn't a complete blowout for Cori Bush, but it also wasn't particularly close. The AP called it for Bell by 11 o'clock last night when the margin was too wide for Bush to make up the difference with the remaining, uncounted ballots. Apparently you can get away with being pro-terrorist with the Democrats in Michigan, but not in Missouri. (National Review)\n\nRepresentative Cori Bush (D., Mo.), the progressive \"Squad\" member who recently stopped short of calling Hamas a terrorist organization, lost a competitive House primary bid Tuesday night against St. Louis County prosecuting attorney Wesley Bell, who positioned himself as a pro-Israel alternative during the race.\n\nThe Associated Press called Bell's primary victory at 11 p.m. EDT. He will now vie for Bush's place in the House come November, facing the winner of Tuesday's GOP primary in a district that President Joe Biden won by more than 60 points in 2020.\n\nThe congresswoman has represented Missouri's first congressional district, which covers St. Louis and the northern part of St. Louis County, since 2021.\n\nBell had plenty of help in launching and executing his primary challenge. Much like Westchester County executive George Latimer, who defeated Jamaal Bowman earlier this summer in New York, Bell was backed by AIPAC and the pro-Israel lobbying group's political arm, United Democracy Project. Those groups invested at least nine million dollars into promoting Bell's campaign and touting his pro-Israel bona fides.\n\nOn Monday, when the polls were strongly suggesting that Bush was on the way to defeat, Bowman expressed his sympathy for her during a conference call held by the Squad. He reportedly said that he knew \"exactly what you're going through.\" He told her, \"I know what it feels like to be constantly bombarded with ads and mailers and lies and B.S. that completely distorts who you are and your record.\"\n\nNot for nothing, but that's a fairly pathetic example of wallowing in self-pity. Being \"bombarded with ads and mailers\" is nothing more than a textbook example of waging a political campaign against a rival. In this case, the rival may have been from the same party, but it was someone who had taken such an extreme position regarding Israel and Hamas that her own people were moved to stage a revolt. Despite the breathless media coverage of all of the pro-Hamas riots on college campuses and in a few communities around Detroit, supporting Hamas and opposing Israel is a broadly unpopular position in the United States. That apparently includes the St. Louis area.\n\nOf course, this primary defeat isn't going to wind up producing any significant shift in the congressional landscape. Cori Bush represents a district that Joe Biden carried by more than 60 points in 2020, as noted above. They won't suddenly all turn into Trump voters this year. And aside from supporting Israel, Bell will support all of the same policies that Bush did.

The Associated Press projected Bush's loss three hours after polls closed, while she trailed by about five points.\n\nRep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., similarly lost his primary to a more moderate Democrat earlier this summer. Bush had faced millions in outside money dumped into her race from pro-Israel groups who opposed her staunch pro-Palestinian stance.\n\n'Wesley Bell's (pictured) victory and Cori Bush's defeat underscore what we've seen in races across the country and throughout this election cycle -- being pro-Israel is not just wise policy, but also smart politics,' said Mark Mellman, chairman of the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, in a statement. Similar to Bush's race against Bell, Bowman's race in New York hinged on a key issue: the Israel-Hamas war. Bowman, a fellow member of the Squad (at least for now before he leaves Congress this winter), fiercely defended Palestinians and decried the Israeli's actions as 'genocide.'\n\nHis reward for repeatedly attacking the Jewish nation's wartime conduct: a pro-Israel SuperPAC coming after him. AIPAC, a pro-Israel political group, spent massively against Bowman, pumping millions upon millions into the campaign of a local county executive.\n\nWith the support of the group, Westchester County Executive George Latimer, a moderate Democrat, sailed to an easy primary win, securing over 59 percent of the vote compared to Bowman's 40 percent. Meanwhile in Missouri , Bell has had a much tamer tone on the Israel-Hamas war while Bush has loudly advocated for pro-Gaza policies and has thrown her support by anti-Israel protestors, a difference that is expected to impact the race.\n\nAnd AIPAC is clearly looking to replicate their maneuver against Bowman to strong arm Bush out of office. 'AIPAC's grassroots members are proud to support strong pro-Israel progressive Democrats like Wesley Bell,' an AIPAC wrote statement recently. 'Cori Bush has been one of the most hostile critics of Israel since she came to Congress in 2021 and has actively worked to undermine mainstream Democratic support for the U.S.-Israel relationship.'\n\nIn the spring Bush even hosted an event for anti-Israel protestors that were removed by police from George Washington University for squatting on campus property in an encampment for a week. She and fellow Squad mate Rep. Rashida Tlaib celebrated the students's heroics at a press conference in front of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nMore recently Bush skipped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's joint address to Congress last week. The prosecutor has beat Bush in recent polls for months, showing the former Black Lives Matter organizer consistently behind him.\n\nThe poll, which was conducted from July 21-24 among 400 in-district voters, has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9%. The bad news for Bush is that this poll is a major improvement for her opponent Bell. In June a poll from the same group found him leading the incumbent by a narrow one point margin, up 43 percent to Bush's 42 percent.\n\nIn addition to Bush and Bowman, Squad founding member Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., is also facing a difficult Democratic primary challenger who she narrowly beat in 2022. The Democratic primary between Bush and Bell is scheduled for August 6.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Cori Bush lost a primary challenge to St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell, who benefitted from huge spending on his behalf by pro-Israel groups.\n\nIt's the Israel lobby's second ouster of a Squad member in just six weeks. In June, New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman lost the Democratic nomination to Westchester County executive George Latimer. In that race, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) poured an astonishing $14 million into the race -- helping to make it the most expensive House primary contest ever.\n\nNot far behind, the Bell-Bush contest ended as the fourth-priciest such race in US history. The AIPAC-affiliated but opaquely-named United Democracy Project spent almost $9 million to ensure that Bush was removed from Congress. Democratic Majority for Israel chipped in almost $500,000. It paid off: With more than 95% of the votes counted, Bell had won 51.2% of the vote to Bush's 45.6%. The district is deep blue, so you can go ahead and pencil Bell in the seat now.\n\nBush and Bowman have been among the most vocal critics of the Israeli government's response to the Oct. 7 Hamas invasion of southern Israel. The campaign in Gaza has killed an estimated 39,000 people, with most of them said to be civilians. About 90% of the population has been internally displaced at least once, with some moving 10 times, per the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Using satellite imagery, US university researchers estimate that, through April 21, 57% of all buildings in Gaza had been damaged or destroyed.\n\nIn a statement last week about its quest to cleanse Congress of Bush and other Israel-critical voices, AIPAC told Associated Press:\n\n\"AIPAC's grassroots members are proud to support strong pro-Israel progressive Democrats like Wesley Bell. Cori Bush has been one of the most hostile critics of Israel since she came to Congress in 2021 and has actively worked to undermine mainstream Democratic support for the U.S.-Israel relationship.\"\n\nOf course, contrary to AIPAC's suggestion, Wesley Bell being a progressive Democrat has nothing to do with the group's support, which also flows to the most conservative Republicans. All that matters is alignment with the Israeli agenda, which is why AIPAC recently spent $300,000 on ads targeting Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who has voted against several pro-Israel bills in recent months. AIPAC wasn't even trying to hand him a loss in his primary, which he won handily. Rather, it was AIPAC's opening salvo against a potential Massie 2026 run for the Senate seat of retiring Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, AIPAC took to social media to spike the football over Bush's loss -- and send a tacit warning to every other politician on either side of the aisle who might dare criticize Israel or vote against redistributing American wealth to it:\n\nIn another social media post boasting about Bush's defeat, AIPAC repeated its frequent election-year claim that \"being pro-Israel is good policy and good politics!\" However, that claim is defied by an odd and unsettling aspect of the Israel lobby's participation in these races: Advertising that pro-Israel groups inject into these campaigns almost never mentions Israel. If pro-Israel policies were so essential to winning votes, why would AIPAC and its allies avoid making them a campaign issue?\n\nBush did have non-Israel-related electoral vulnerabilities, such as voting against Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure bill because it didn't include progressive giveaways like free community college and universal family leave. She was also seen as a major hypocrite, promoting \"defund the police\" policies only to find herself the subject of a DOJ investigation into her campaign spending more than $130,000 on private security, with tens of thousands for \"security services\" paid to a man she ended up marrying. Bell's campaign portrayed Bush as an unproductive representative principally focused on cultivating her Squad celebrity status.\n\n...and we'd be remiss if we didn't remind you she isn't the sharpest tool in the drawer:\n\nIn the home stretch of her race, Bush -- who won her seat in 2020 -- could clearly see the handwriting on the wall. Contemplating her political future last weekend, Bush told NBC News, \"One thing I don't do is go away.\" Maybe not, but her choice of where to go will be defined in no small part by groups promoting the interests of a tiny country 6,400 miles from St. Louis.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell -- a progressive himself -- outraised Bush and led in most polls heading into Election Day.\n\nNow, the race has been called, and Bell has been declared the winner. With 52 percent of the vote reported, Bell leads Bush by 12 points. The signs were there ahead of Tuesday's results.\n\nOne of the key factors in the race (aside from Bush's penchant for being a sensationalist) was her embrace of the progressive anti-Israel stance following the horrific October 7 attack by Hamas. As I noted at the time Bell announced his entry into the race:\n\nMoreover, Bush has taken heavy criticism for her stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict, something for which Bell provides a welcome contrast.\n\nNone of which is to characterize Bell as a moderate. But given that the First District votes overwhelmingly Democrat (Bush beat her Republican challenger in 2022 by almost 50 points and nearly 60 points in 2020), Bell is likely to be seen as a viable alternative to Bush.\n\nAgain, Bell should not be mistaken as a moderate. He is, however, sane and competent and will almost certainly be a better representative for Missouri's 1st Congressional District than Bush has been.\n\nAnd soon, Bush will join her fellow Squad member, Jamaal Bowman, in the Congressional Alumni Club.\n\nUpdate - 11:20 p.m. Eastern:\n\nWith 95 percent of the vote counted, the race has tightened somewhat, but Bell still retains a solid lead of roughly 5.5 points.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_Bush", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cori Bush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri's_1st_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Missouri's 1st congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Bell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wesley Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaal_Bowman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamaal Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania's_1st_congressional_district", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania's 1st congressional district"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2018/219/3c43c9c6-ca62-4ab7-afb6-ebc0388dc466.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797790", "eventUri": "eng-9797790", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-07", "textStart": 725, "textEnd": 734}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

A man beating a woman in a primary election apparently is not.\n\nMissouri Congresswoman Cori Bush, a prominent member of the progressive \"Squad,\" has been defeated in the Democratic primary for Missouri's 1st Congressional District. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Wesley Bell emerged victorious after a highly contested race marked by significant outside spending and intense political rivalries.\n\nBush, who first gained national attention in 2020 when she unseated longtime incumbent William Lacy Clay, was defeated in a race that saw millions of dollars in spending from pro-Israel groups, particularly the United Democracy Project, a super PAC affiliated with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). These groups injected over $8 million into the primary, focusing on issues other than the Israel-Hamas conflict to amplify Bush's vulnerabilities.\n\nBush's speech was filled with pointed critiques of the forces she believes contributed to her defeat, particularly the influence of pro-Israel groups like AIPAC. \"APAC, I'm coming to tear your kingdom down,\" she declared, promising to hold corporations accountable for their actions. Despite the substantial financial backing of her opponent, Bush took pride in the grassroots nature of her campaign. \"Because your side was so weak, you had to spend $19 million,\" she said, emphasizing that her campaign operated with integrity and character, achieving significant support with far less funding.\n\nBell, running as a progressive candidate himself, criticized Bush's legislative record, highlighting her vote against the bipartisan infrastructure law in 2021 and her missed votes in Congress. Despite support from the Squad-supporting Justice Democrats, who spent nearly $2 million on her behalf, Bush could not overcome the financial and political onslaught. Bell's campaign successfully resonated with voters who were swayed by the barrage of ads and his critiques of Bush's effectiveness in Congress).\n\nBush did not shy away from discussing the broader implications of her defeat, particularly the role of outside money in local elections. \"The flood of outside Republican money into this district, this Democratic district, was staggering,\" she noted, highlighting the $19 million spent by far-right-funded super PACs against her campaign. Despite this, she affirmed the resilience and vibrancy of the St. Louis community and its refusal to be undermined.\n\nIn her concession speech, Bush remained defiant, condemning the massive outside spending that contributed to her defeat. \"Because your side is so weak, you had to spend $19 million,\" she told her supporters, emphasizing her continued commitment to her community regardless of her congressional status.\n\nThroughout her speech, Bush reiterated her commitment to various social justice causes, both domestically and internationally. She pledged to continue fighting for the rights of marginalized communities, including the unhoused, elders, children, families, and veterans. Bush also reaffirmed her stance on international issues, such as supporting a free Palestine and opposing genocide and human rights abuses worldwide.\n\nBell's victory marks the second time this year that a member of the Squad has been ousted in a primary, following Rep. Jamaal Bowman's defeat in New York. The results reflect the deepening divisions within the Democratic Party, particularly around issues of foreign policy and progressive politics.\n\nLooking ahead, Bell is expected to be the heavy favorite in the general election this November, given the district's strong Democratic leanings. For Bush, this defeat signals a significant shift in the political landscape of Missouri's 1st Congressional District and raises questions about the future direction of the progressive movement within the Democratic Party.", "source": {"uri": "shorenewsnetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shore News Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But he was boosted by more than $8 million in spending from a super PAC affiliated with the country's largest pro-Israel lobby, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, and other similar entities. That outside money transformed the race into one of the most expensive House primaries in history.\n\nThe contentious contest came just weeks after Representative Jamaal Bowman of New York, another outspoken progressive and vocal Israel critic, suffered a stinging primary defeat. The same pro-Israel groups that poured $15 million into defeating Mr. Bowman were aiding Mr. Bell, and all eyes were on Ms. Bush to see if she would be the next member of the ultraliberal \"squad\" to see defeat.\n\nMs. Bush, a former nurse, was first elected in 2020 as part of a wave of progressive victories over establishment figures that elevated forceful Black voices, including Mr. Bowman, during a summer of protests against police brutality. Ms. Bush first made a name for herself in her community in 2014, as a leading Black activist who took to the streets in Ferguson after the killing of Michael Brown, a Black teenager, by a white police officer.\n\nThe district is solidly Democratic, and Mr. Bell is expected to easily win the general election.\n\nBut since Ms. Bush's first election, the political terrain has shifted, in large part because of Israel's war against Hamas. The country's retaliation for the deadly massacre on Oct. 7 carried out by Hamas has divided mainstream Democrats from progressives like Ms. Bush, who has vocally condemned Israel's government over its military campaign and the rising civilian death toll in Gaza.\n\nMs. Bush made herself vulnerable to a serious primary challenge through a string of controversial votes and positions. She was one of two Democrats who voted in January against a resolution to bar members of Hamas and anyone who participated in the attacks against Israel on Oct. 7 from the United States.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, she declined to call Hamas a terrorist organization.\n\n\"Would they qualify to me as a terrorist organization? Yes. But do I know that? Absolutely not,\" Ms. Bush said. \"I have no communication with them. All I know is that we were considered terrorists, we were considered Black identity extremists and all we were doing was trying to get peace. I'm not trying to compare us, but that taught me to be careful about labeling if I don't know.\" Later, a spokeswoman walked back the comment, saying: \"The congresswoman knows Hamas is a terrorist organization.\"\n\nAnd while her race ultimately had little to do with Israel -- abortion is illegal in Missouri and crime is high in St. Louis, where downtown is overrun by boarded-up storefronts, giving voters more pressing concerns -- her positions and votes regarding the country and its war in Gaza made her a prime target for AIPAC.\n\nSome of the spending against her highlighted her vote against President Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure law. She opposed the bill because many initiatives liberals wanted, such as universal family leave and free community college, were severed from the legislative package to attract the backing of Republicans, whose votes were needed for it to clear Congress.\n\nThe race turned heated, and Ms. Bush refused to debate Mr. Bell, who has said he supports the United States sending military aid to Israel. \"We do have to stand by our allies,\" he said.\n\nMs. Bush, in an earlier interview, said she would not debate him because \"I'm not going to platform a Republican. If he was not taking all of this Republican money for a Democratic district, then there would be a conversation.\"\n\nMr. Bell, in his challenge, argued that Ms. Bush had been ineffective in Washington, prioritizing her \"squad\" fame in Congress over local results.\n\n\"It was a no-brainer; it's a good piece of legislation,\" Mr. Bell said of the infrastructure bill, noting that it had brought hundreds of millions of dollars into the district for jobs, roads and bridges and clean water. \"She had her own protest vote as opposed to what's in the best interest of her district.\"",

In Missouri Democratic Rep. Cori Bush's case, it was a few things.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bush became the second member of the so-called \"squad\" to lose her seat during the 2024 election cycle in a primary. With 99 percent of the vote counted as of roughly midnight Eastern Time, challenger Wesley Bell, a former St. Louis County prosecutor, had an insurmountable lead of 51.2 percent to 45.6 percent, with two other candidates receiving 3.2 percent of the vote, according to The Washington Post vote counts.\n\nOver 120,000 ballots were cast in the race in Missouri's 1st Congressional District for the Democratic nomination.\n\nOn the Republican side, businessman Andrew Jones Jr. is in the lead. However, given that Bush managed to beat Jones in the 2022 general election by 72.9 percent to 24.3 percent and defeated another GOP competitor by 78.8 percent to 19.0 percent in 2020, it seems all but certain that the Democratic nomination is tantamount to election in the district.\n\nShe became the second \"squad\" member to lose a primary this year, with Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York losing big to Westchester County Executive George Latimer in June.\n\nSo, what went so wrong for Bush that she lost a primary -- and one where well over a hundred thousand votes were cast, at that? What motivated those in her district to go out to the polls? Was it unpopular policy stances? Too far left for even her district? Scandal?\n\nYes, yes and yes, which is why her own Democratic constituents deserted her.\n\nPerhaps most important was the issue of the Israeli-Hamas war; Bush, long one of Israel's most venomous critics in Congress, has defended Hamas in the wake of the Oct. 7 attacks. The race became the target of pro-Israel groups, who pumped money into Bell's campaign. The tit-for-tat in spending between progressives on Bush's side and more moderate Democrats on Bell's side made the race likely the most expensive House primary ever, according to the Post.\n\nBush and her \"squad\" cohorts tried to label it a smear campaign by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and its allies, but she didn't do herself any favors in this department: In an article published earlier this week in The New York Times, just before voters went to the polls, she declined to call Hamas a terrorist organization.\n\n\"Would they qualify to me as a terrorist organization? Yes. But do I know that? Absolutely not,\" Bush said.\n\n\"I have no communication with them. All I know is that we were considered terrorists. We were considered black identity extremists, and all we were doing was trying to get peace. I'm not trying to compare us, but that taught me to be careful about labeling if I don't know.\"\n\n\"We were called terrorists during Ferguson,\" she said, referencing the death of Michael Brown back in 2014 -- one of the events that brought Bush to prominence as a left-wing activist.\n\n\"Have they hurt people? Absolutely. Has the Israeli military hurt people? Absolutely.\"\n\nApparently, this whataboutism on Hamas was too much for even the Democratic Party to stomach, which is pretty impressive.\n\nBut that wasn't all! Bush, who was one of the most ardent supporters of the \"defund the police\" movement, was very much about funding her own security in the form of private guards.\n\n\"I'm going to make sure I have security because I know I have had attempts on my life, and I have too much work to do. There are too many people that need help right now for me to allow that,\" Bush said in 2021 after an inordinate amount of public spending on her protection was revealed.\n\n\"[S]o suck it up, and defunding the police has to happen. We need to defund the police and put that money into social safety nets because we are trying to save lives,\" she continued. \"My security is to keep me safe from those racist attempts made against my life.\"\n\nThe people of her district in St. Louis -- described by even the Times as a place where \"crime is high and downtown is made up of mostly boarded-up storefronts\" -- probably didn't look too fondly upon this. They looked even less fondly upon it when she ended up marrying Cortney Merritts, who had been part of her security detail for quite some time.\n\nIt wasn't just that Bush was far from transparent, wedding Merritts in secret and not being forthcoming about when their relationship began. (He was with her security detail from at least her start in office, with social media posts showing him with her at President Joe Biden's January 2021 inauguration, just weeks after she had taken office herself.)\n\nMerritts, it was reported last July, lacked a private security license in the the city of St. Louis, in St. Louis County or in Washington, D.C. As of January, the Department of Justice, the Federal Election Commission and the House Ethics Committee were all investigating Bush's use of funds.\n\nIn short, this looked like a prime moment for the Democrats to ditch some dead weight heading into November -- and ditch her they did.\n\nBell's margin of victory over Bush almost exactly matched a survey released last week by the Mellman Group and the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC that showed him ahead 48 percent to 42 percent. The same group had a poll in June that found him only ahead slightly, 43 percent to Bush's 42 percent, the U.K.'s Daily Mail noted.\n\nThose could be dismissed among the far left as being opposition-run. The problem is that the election definitely wasn't, and it was right on the money.

Pro-Hamas ticking time bomb and infamous fire alarm puller Rep.

I'm coming with all the people that's in here, that's doing the work.\"\n\nJustice Democrats, a progressive organization that helped propel Bush to victory in 2020 and backed her reelection bid, said following Tuesday's contest that \"no matter what a singular super PAC can spend to try and buy an election, nothing can take away from the transformational effect Cori Bush has directly had on the people of St. Louis.\"\n\n\"That power -- of everyday people to transform what we can expect from our political system -- is such a threat to right-wing power, corporate interests, and AIPAC's influence, that a coalition of GOP-funded Super PACs had to spend over $12 million to even have a chance at defeating it,\" the group said in a statement posted to social media. \"As AIPAC's influence in Congress wanes and the right-wing network propping it up is exposed, AIPAC has to spend historic amounts to continue advancing their interests at the expense of the Democratic mainstream that overwhelmingly supports a ceasefire and an end to genocide in Gaza.\"\n\nBush was one of the original sponsors of a congressional resolution calling for an end to Israel's assault on the Gaza Strip, which has dragged on for 10 months and left nearly 40,000 Palestinians dead, according to official tallies that are likely a vast undercount given the number of people missing under ruins and in mass graves.\n\n\"We can't bomb our way to peace, equality, and freedom,\" Bush said as she introduced the resolution alongside her progressive House colleagues on October 16. \"With thousands of lives lost and millions more at stake, we need a cease-fire now.\"\n\n\"Cori Bush had the moral courage to speak out against her constituents' taxpayer dollars funding war crimes in Gaza.\"\n\nAru Shiney-Ajay, executive director of the Sunrise Movement, said Tuesday that \"without the deluge of misleading advertisements\" attacking Bush, she \"would be headed to Congress for another term next year.\"\n\n\"Tonight's results should be a warning sign to anyone who cares about our democracy,\" said Shiney-Ajay. \"If Democratic Party leaders don't stand against AIPAC and right-wing billionaires, they undermine our democracy and risk disillusioning the young voters and voters of color we need to defeat the far-right.\"\n\nOur Revolution executive director Joseph Geevarghese echoed that message, saying in a statement that \"tonight's outcome puts the blatantly undemocratic nature of Democratic Party primaries on full display.\"\n\n\"Cori Bush had the moral courage to speak out against her constituents' taxpayer dollars funding war crimes in Gaza. As a result, AIPAC and its MAGA Republican-funded super PAC spent more than $8.4 million to buy her congressional seat,\" said Geevarghese.\n\n\"Democratic Party elites have spent years decrying Trump as an existential threat to democracy,\" he added, \"yet they are resoundingly silent when wealthy conservative donors unseat a true working-class champion who was among the first federal lawmakers to endorse Kamala Harris in her historic candidacy for president.\"", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Cori Bush's Race-and Our Elections | Common Dreams", "body": "The progressive lawmaker's defeat in her Democratic primary is a tremendous blow to progressives and to the U.S. electoral process itself.\n\nRepresentative Cori Bush, a progressive black woman from St. Louis, Missouri who is a member of \"the Squad\" in the U.S. House and has been a powerful voice in Congress for poor people, women's rights, healthcare, housing-and Palestine -- just lost her primary because pro-Israel lobby groups flooded the race with outside funding. Her loss is a tremendous blow to progressives and to the U.S. electoral process itself.\n\nThis is the pro-Israel lobby's second \"win\" of the season. The first was the June defeat of progressive, black congressman from Westchester County, N.Y., Jamaal Bowman, who was a forceful critic of Israel's attacks on Gaza. AIPAC and its mis-named super PAC, the United Democracy Project, barged into Westchester County to anoint an opponent -- white, pro-Israel Westchester County Executive George Latimer -- and then shower him with cash.\n\nThe ads against Bowman were not about Israel. Instead, AIPAC smeared the congressman's character and criticized him as a \"hot head\" who was not a reliable member of the Democratic team. In the words of President of the Arab American Institute Jim Zogby, the race became \"the angry, frightening young black man versus the calm, thoughtful older white guy.\"\n\nBy throwing $17 million into the race, pro-Israel groups turned Bowman's primary into the most expensive one in U.S. history. When Bowman was defeated, AIPAC declared the outcome showed that the pro-Israel position is \"both good policy and good politics.\" On the contrary, what it really showed was that pro-Israel groups can buy elections and send a frightening message to all elected officials that if they criticize Israel, even during a genocide, they may well pay with their careers.\n\nAIPAC hides the Israel issue and then claims the \"win\" is a victory for Israel.\n\nBuoyed by its success, AIPAC then took on Cori Bush, marching into her district determined to defeat a black woman who was one of the most unique voices in all of congress. Once a unhoused single mother of two, and a survivor of gun violence, domestic violence and sexual assault, Bush became a nurse and a pastor, and in the wake of the killing of the unarmed black man Michael Brown in Ferguson in 2014, she became an activist on the frontlines of the movement to save black lives. After protesting in the streets for 400 days, she jumped into the political arena. In 2020 made a successful run for Congress, becoming the first black representative from Missouri.\n\nIn Bush's two terms in Congress, she demonstrated leadership on many fronts, including reproductive justice and abortion rights. At a House of Representatives committee hearing in 2021, Bush was one of three congresswomen to share her abortion story publicly. And after the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, she introduced a host of bills, including the Reproductive Health Care Accessibility Act, the Protecting Access to Medication Abortion Act, the Reproductive Health Travel Fund Act, and the Protect Sexual and Reproductive Health Act.\n\nShe also championed housing rights. When the Covid-19 moratorium on evictions was about to expire, she grabbed her sleeping bag and lawn chair, and organized a \"sleep in\" on the steps of the U.S. Capitol that resulted in an extension of the moratorium on evictions.\n\nForeign policy was not her focus, but in the wake of the Hamas attack on October 9, 2023 and Israel's subsequent bombing of civilians in Gaza, Bush felt compelled to speak out. Just nine days after the October 7 Hamas attack, she had the courage to introduce a ceasefire resolution in the House. She was one of only nine House members who opposed a resolution supporting Israel. She boycotted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress, calling him a \"war criminal.\"\n\nAs a result of defending Palestinians, she found herself in AIPAC's crosshairs. \"Cori Bush has been one of the most hostile critics of Israel since she came to Congress in 2021 and has actively worked to undermine mainstream Democratic support for the U.S.-Israel relationship, \" AIPAC claimed.\n\nAIPAC's super PAC spent nearly $9 million, much of it coming from Republican mega-donors, to buy ads smearing Bush and shoring up contender Wesley Bell, a St. Louis County Prosecutor. The attacks were vicious, including ads that darkened Bush's skin and manipulated her racial features. They also distorted her domestic voting record, condemning her for not supporting Biden's Infrastructure Bill instead of explaining that her vote was part of a strategy to gain leverage for key social programs in the Build Back Better Act.\n\nCuriously, in the cases of both Bowman and Bush, the attack ads did not even mention Israel. But if Israel is AIPAC's singular focus, why did the ads avoid the issue? That's because most Americans, especially in those liberal Democrat districts, agree with their positions. Most Americans want a ceasefire and disapprove of Israel's military actions in Gaza. As Jewish Voice for Peace executive director Stephanie Fox said during a call to rally support for the Congresswoman Bush, \"She has been a life raft for our values and principles in Congress and she has been under attack because far right extremist groups like AIPAC are scared.\"\n\nJim Zogby of the Arab American Institute agrees. \"Pro-Israel groups are running scared,\" he said. \"They are losing the public debate over policy -- especially among Democrats. Most Democrats are deeply opposed to Israeli policies in Gaza and the Occupied Palestinian lands. Majorities want a ceasefire and an end to settlements. And they want to stop further arms shipments to Israel.\" So AIPAC hides the Israel issue and then claims the \"win\" is a victory for Israel.\n\nIf we are going to stop U.S. support for Israel's genocide, prevent the Middle East from erupting in flames and reclaim our elections here at home, we have to stop AIPAC.", "source": {"uri": "commondreams.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Common Dreams"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_lobby_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel lobby in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "American Israel Public Affairs Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_Bush", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cori Bush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westchester_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Westchester County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Westchester County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

Omar finds herself on stronger footing than Bowman or Bush, who both faced well-funded challengers and millions of dollars in spending by a pro-Israel super PAC. The PAC hasn't aired ads against Omar in this race.", "source": {"uri": "kion546.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KION546"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kion546.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cori_Bush", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cori Bush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaal_Bowman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamaal Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilhan_Omar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ilhan Omar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Treehouses", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners/Treehouses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://kion546.b-cdn.net/2023/10/kionlogog-860x540.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9797790", "eventUri": "eng-9797790", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 460898576, "relevance": 2}

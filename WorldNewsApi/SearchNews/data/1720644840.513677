A total of 7,580 votes have been tallied so far - 76% of boxes. Note: This is a partial tally and not a certified count results. It shows, currently, new candidate Joe Sheridan (Fianna Fail) in a very commanding position, followed by sitting councillor Joe Lyons (Fine Gael). Peter 'Chap' Cleere - currently away from the count centre in his capacity as camogie bainisteoir - is hovering around that third seat alongside Fianna Fail's Deirdre Cullen. They are closely followed by Michael Doyle (FG) and then it's Sinn Fein's Stephanie Doheny who is next best placed. There's a gap then between them and the next Fine Gael candidate Kelly, Sinn Fein's David Kennedy, and Kristina Doyle of the Green Party. Chief tallyman Pat O'Neill snr reckons it will be three Fianna Fail, two Fine Gael, and possibly Sinn Fein to take the last seat. That's the nine candidates for six seats.

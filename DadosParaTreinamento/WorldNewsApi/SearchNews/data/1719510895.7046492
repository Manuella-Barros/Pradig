A post on Instagram shared a way to boost hair growth. It mentions, \"Massage the scalp every day by flipping the head upside down to increase blood flow in hair follicles.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Fashion| Art| Diy| Beauty Tips (@fashionartdiy) Nidhi Govil, CEO at Orive Organics says, \u201cIncorporating upside-down scalp massage into a wellness routine offers several primary benefits. Firstly, it promotes better blood circulation to the scalp, which improves nutrient delivery to the hair follicles and supports healthier hair growth. Additionally, it helps to relieve tension in the scalp muscles, and neck area, thus reducing headaches and promoting overall relaxation.\u201d Dr Mikki Singh, a celebrity cosmetic dermatologist, a specialist in CoolSculpting, and an architect of Bodycraft Clinic adds, \u201cIncorporating upside-down scalp massage into a wellness routine can enhance blood flow to the scalp, which is beneficial for delivering more nutrients and oxygen to hair follicles. This increased circulation can promote healthier hair growth and improve scalp vitality.\u201d Contribution to scalp and hair health Upside-down scalp massage temporarily increases circulation, Dr Singh says, through the inversion of the head, may help in distributing natural oils along the hair shaft, moisturising the hair and potentially reducing dryness and brittleness. This massage technique may also assist in loosening and removing dead skin cells and product buildup, which can encourage a healthier scalp environment, she remarks. Dr Govil says that increased circulation can lead to stronger, healthier hair growth and may even help to prevent hair loss by promoting follicle health. Promotion of relaxation and stress relief Upside-down scalp massage promotes relaxation and stress relief, Dr Govil informs, through its combination of gentle pressure and soothing movements. The inversion aspect of the massage can also help to relieve tension in the neck and shoulders, further enhancing the overall relaxation experience. \"The physical stimulation of the scalp nerves can trigger the release of stress-relieving hormones like serotonin and endorphins, contributing to overall relaxation and a sense of well-being,\" Dr Singh says. Addressing specific scalp conditions Dr Singh adds, \u201cUpside-down scalp massage might be beneficial for individuals experiencing sluggish hair growth or those with tight scalp muscles that contribute to tension headaches.\u201d \u201cUpside-down scalp massage can be particularly beneficial for addressing scalp conditions such as dandruff or dryness. The increased blood flow to the scalp helps to nourish and moisturise the skin, while the massage action can help to exfoliate dead skin cells and unclog hair follicles\u201d, explains Dr Govil. However, it's important to note that this technique should be avoided in conditions like scalp infections, open wounds, or severe hair fall, as it can exacerbate these issues, suggests Dr Singh. Comparison with other techniques According to Dr Govil, compared to other scalp massage techniques, upside-down scalp massage may offer unique benefits due to the inversion aspect, which can further enhance circulation and relaxation. However, the effectiveness of any scalp massage technique ultimately depends on individual preferences and needs. Potential long-term effects Consistent use of this technique might also aid in maintaining a naturally moisturised scalp, reducing occurrences of dryness and flaking. However, as with any routine, moderation is key, and monitoring for any adverse effects such as dizziness or increased hair fall is important, suggests Dr Singh.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/hair-care-routine-upside-down-scalp-massage-9328317/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/medium-shot-woman-giving-herself-scalp-massage.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:38:40", "author": "Lifestyle Desk", "authors": ["Lifestyle Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.165}

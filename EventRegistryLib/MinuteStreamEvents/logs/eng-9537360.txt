The operation was peaceful. Campus is opening, students are returning to prepare for finals, and commencement set-up is in full swing,\" USC President Carol Folt said in a statement released around midday Sunday.\n\n\"Over the last few weeks, the university exercised patience and restraint as we worked to de-escalate a volatile situation. We've spoken to the occupiers daily, issued repeated warnings, and offered opportunities and locations for them to protest lawfully. We've supported their right to express strong opinions and passions for their cause, as always,\" she continued.\n\n\"Yet when free speech protests devolve into illegal occupations, violating the rights of others, we must draw a line. ... We are in the critical period from the end-of-term quiet study week, through finals and our commencement ceremonies.\n\n\"Despite our efforts to de-escalate, the occupation was spiraling in a dangerous direction over the last several days. Areas of campus were blocked, people walking down Trousdale, our main thoroughfare, were harassed, and iconic Trojan symbols were defaced. In addition, university property was stolen, and commencement structures were dismantled. Residence halls, campus throughfares, and libraries had become places of confrontation. Some finals were disrupted with noise and chanting during mandated quiet periods. Yesterday afternoon, outside agitators jumped the perimeter fencing and assaulted our officers.\n\n\"This had to stop. With no resolution in sight, I requested the LAPD to assist DPS in removing the encampment as peacefully and safely as possible. At 4:10 a.m., an order to disperse was issued, providing the trespassers one last opportunity to leave voluntarily. In 64 minutes, the encampment was abandoned and cleared. The operation was peaceful with no arrests. We will not tolerate illegal encampments of any kind at USC.\"\n\nThe encampment had been rebuilt after previously being cleared on April 24.\n\nProtesters shouted \"Free Palestine\" at 4:17 a.m. Sunday, as officers began surrounding the encampment, according to Annenberg Media. Officers subsequently started to remove the banners hung by protesters, moving them to the side of the park.\n\nDuring this time USC officials alerted students that the campus was temporarily closed, but school officials later announced that it had re-opened to authorized personnel.\n\n\"The University Park Campus is now open to students, faculty, and staff upon presentation of valid identification,\" USC posted on social media at 10:37 a.m. Sunday. \"As an important reminder: tents and related equipment remain prohibited on campus and will be subject to immediate confiscation; camping and other non-permitted event(s).\"\n\nOn Thursday, USC implemented updated campus-entry procedures as it remained under a state of heightened security. The decision came a day after the school revealed plans for a \"Trojan Family Graduate Celebration\" at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum this Thursday, to replace the previously canceled main stage commencement ceremony amid the pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nUSC announced late Friday afternoon it was also pausing visitor registration because the \"campus is very busy with events and construction work to prepare for commencement,\" but existing visitor passes would be honored. Pre-registered guests must show a QR code available from the visitor.usc.edu website, as well as a government-issued ID.\n\nUniversity officials said all bags will be subject to search. People wearing masks will be asked to lower them briefly to verify identification, according to the university.\n\nThe USC campus had been relatively calm in the days prior to Sunday's clean-up operation.\n\nOn Wednesday, dozens of USC faculty members marched through the campus in support of protesters, calling in part for amnesty for those who were arrested on April 24. The march remained peaceful, with some students joining the faculty in the late-afternoon procession. It happened hours after a virtual meeting between members of the campus Academic Senate and Folt, who was joined by Provost Andrew Guzman.\n\nFolt wrote on social media Wednesday afternoon that the meeting was \"to explain our reasoning and answer their thoughtful and direct questions about our recent decisions.\n\nIn her letter, Folt wrote that \"the university has initiated disciplinary review processes for individuals who have violated both our policies and the law. We will take any further actions required to maintain campus safety and security, consistent with our legal obligations.\n\n\"The university is legally obligated to ensure that students, faculty, and staff can move freely throughout our campus while pursuing their studies, work, and research. Every part of our campuses, including Alumni Park, must be fully accessible and free from vandalism and harassment.\"\n\nAt least 12 student protesters received interim or full suspensions from the university, a media liaison from the \"Gaza Solidarity Occupation\" told the Daily Trojan, the campus newspaper, on Sunday evening.\n\nSeveral student protesters who are USC Housing residents were told they have until 5 p.m. Monday to pack their items and leave, a student protester who requested anonymity due to safety concerns, told the Daily Trojan.\n\nIn a statement Monday, USC officials said, \"We are unable to discuss disciplinary matters because of student privacy laws and the confidential nature of personnel matters.\"\n\nUSC became a focal point of Southland pro-Palestinian protests following its April 15 decision to cancel valedictorian Asna Tabassum's commencement speech in response to complaints about her online posts critics called antisemitic. USC officials insisted the move was solely a security issue, not a political decision.\n\nStill, tensions continued to mount -- leading to the mass protest April 24 and attempted occupation of Alumni Park that resulted in the 93 arrests and the clearing of the earlier encampment.\n\nThe university eventually opted to cancel its May 10 main stage commencement altogether, but vowed to move forward with the usual array of smaller satellite graduation ceremonies for the school's individual colleges.\n\nThose ceremonies are set to begin Wednesday.\n\nThe university announced last week that in lieu of the main stage commencement ceremony, a \"Trojan Family Graduate Celebration\" will be held at 8:30 p.m. Thursday at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, featuring \"drone shows, fireworks, surprise performances, the Trojan Marching Band and a special gift just for the Class of 2024.\"", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

No arrests have been reported.\n\n\"We want to thank LAPD for assisting DPS in clearing the encampment and restoring normalcy for students and community as quickly and safely as possible. We will share more information with our community later today.\"\n\nClean-up of the encampment, which had been rebuilt after previously being cleared on April 24, began round 4:30 a.m. Sunday. USC Annenberg Media reported at 3:51 a.m. that university police officers told student reporters they planned to come in around 4 a.m. and had set up a staging area for the media.\n\nProtesters shouted \"Free Palestine\" at 4:17 a.m., as officers began surrounding the encampment, Annenberg Media said. At 4:25 a.m., DPS officers gave protesters in the encampment 15 minutes to leave or face arrest. Officers subsequently started to remove the banners hung by protesters, moving them to the side of the park, Annenberg Media said.\n\nDuring this time USC officials alerted students that the campus was temporarily closed, but school officials later announced that it had re-opened to authorized personnel.\n\n\"The University Park Campus is now open to students, faculty, and staff upon presentation of valid identification,\" USC posted on X at 10:37 a.m. Sunday. \"As an important reminder: tents and related equipment remain prohibited on campus and will be subject to immediate confiscation; camping and other non-permitted event(s).\"\n\nAs the clean-up proceeded, reporters at the Daily Trojan, USC's student newspaper, reported seeing \"at least 50 Los Angeles Police officers ... moving down Trousdale Parkway [near the USC campus] at around 4:15 a.m. with zip ties, less-lethal launchers and helmets.\" The paper also reported seeing \"three police vans, which appear to be used for transporting people who have been arrested.\"\n\nA news videographer at the scene said officers pushed 50 to 75 students out of the encampment and off the campus. The officers then cleared out the tents and other gear that was left behind.\n\nThe police action came just days after USC President Carol Folt wrote an open letter to the \"Trojan Family\" stressing the steps the university was taking to ensure that students finish finals \"in a quiet, safe academic environment -- and that our graduating students can enjoy peaceful and joyous commencement ceremonies.\"\n\nFolt also took a firm stand toward protesters who might continue to be disruptive.\n\n\"Let me be absolutely clear,\" she wrote in the letter released Friday. \"Free speech and assembly do not include the right to obstruct equal access to campus, damage property, or foment harassment, violence, and threats. Nor is anyone entitled to obstruct the normal functions of our university, including commencement.\n\n\"... When laws and policies that apply to everyone are repeatedly and flagrantly violated -- there must be consequences.\"\n\nOn Thursday, USC implemented updated campus-entry procedures as it remained under a state of heightened security.

Coliseum with several other groups around the same time, so the USC Trojan Family graduate event will be limited to a portion of the venue. Each graduate will receive up to six tickets for their guests, the university said, and will be limited to \"graduates and their families and loved ones.\"\n\nUSC said it was unable to secure the entire venue, because it was already booked. The announcement for the event said that USC President Carol Folt \"has created a major kick-off to three days and nights of commencement events to honor you and those who've helped you along the way.\"\n\nThe announcement does not mention how pro-Palestinian demonstrators had recently erected an encampment in Alumni Park. On April 24, police arrested 93 students and off-campus activists during the protest, one of several demonstrations at campuses across the country, including neighboring UCLA.\n\nUSC expects to confer over 18,000 degrees from May 8-11 for its commencement week with a slew of events to celebration the occassion. New security measures have also been put in place.\n\nAll vehicle and pedestrian access to the university campus will be limited to two entrances, USC's Department of Public Safety announced in a news release Thursday. The entrances are located at the north and south sides of the campus, referred to as the McCarthy and McClintock entrances.\n\nThe limited access will be in effect 24 hours a day. The entrance to Watt Way is closed, but could be reopened barring traffic conditions, according to university officials.\n\nA temporary, separate interior fence will greet guests to the campus who are approaching outside of a vehicle, with pedestrians being asked to enter the university at McCarthy Way at the quad; the north side of Watt Way at 34th Street; and McClintock Avenue at Childs Way.\n\nAll USC students and employees will need to show their campus IDs to enter the campus or access the interior fence, according to USC. Guests will need to pre-register with the university online and show their QR code generated from the USC visitor registration website. Each registration must be completed daily and can be registered by a USC student, faculty or staff member.\n\nThe new safety measures follows days of protests at the private university in South L.A.

No arrests have been reported.\n\n\"We want to thank LAPD for assisting DPS in clearing the encampment and restoring normalcy for students and community as quickly and safely as possible. We will share more information with our community later today.\"\n\nClean-up of the encampment, which had been rebuilt after previously being cleared on April 24, began around 4:30 a.m. Sunday.\n\nUSC Annenberg Media reported at 3:51 a.m. that university police officers told student reporters they planned to come in around 4 a.m. and had set up a staging area for the media, which they alleged was too far away to witness any arrests.\n\nProtesters shouted \"Free Palestine\" at 4:17 a.m., as officers began surrounding the encampment, Annenberg Media said. At 4:25 a.m., DPS officers gave protesters in the encampment 15 minutes to leave or face arrest.\n\nThe officers started at 4:35 a.m. to remove the banners hung by protesters, moving them to the side of the park, Annenberg Media said.\n\nDuring this time USC officials alerted students that the campus was temporarily closed.\n\nAs the clean-up proceeded, reporters at the Daily Trojan, USC's student newspaper, reported seeing \"at least 50 Los Angeles Police officers ... moving down Trousdale Parkway [near the USC campus] at around 4:15 a.m. with zip ties, less-lethal launchers and helmets.\" The paper also reported seeing \"three police vans, which appear to be used for transporting people who have been arrested.\"\n\nA news videographer at the scene said officers pushed 50 to 75 students out of the encampment and off the campus. The officers then cleared out the tents and other gear that was left behind.\n\nThe police action came just days after USC President Carol Folt wrote an open letter to the \"Trojan Family\" stressing the steps the university was taking to ensure that students finish finals \"in a quiet, safe academic environment -- and that our graduating students can enjoy peaceful and joyous commencement ceremonies.\"\n\nMs. Folt also took a firm stand toward protesters who might continue to be disruptive.\n\n\"Let me be absolutely clear,\" she wrote in the letter released Friday. \"Free speech and assembly do not include the right to obstruct equal access to campus, damage property, or foment harassment, violence, and threats. Nor is anyone entitled to obstruct the normal functions of our university, including commencement.\n\n\"When laws and policies that apply to everyone are repeatedly and flagrantly violated -- there must be consequences.\"\n\nIt was unclear when open access would be restored at the campus, which had been restricted to students, faculty and staff for much of the past week, now that the encampment has been removed.\n\nOn Thursday, USC implemented updated campus-entry procedures as it remained under a state of heightened security. The decision came a day after the school revealed plans for a \"Trojan Family Graduate Celebration\" at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum this coming Thursday, to replace the previously canceled main stage commencement ceremony amid the pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nUSC announced late Friday afternoon it was also pausing visitor registration because the \"campus is very busy with events and construction work to prepare for commencement,\" but existing visitor passes would be honored.\n\nPre-registered guests must show a QR code available from the visitor.usc.edu website, as well as a government-issued ID.\n\nUniversity officials said all bags will be subject to search.

No arrests have been reported.\n\n\"We want to thank LAPD for assisting DPS in clearing the encampment and restoring normalcy for students and community as quickly and safely as possible. We will share more information with our community later today.\"\n\nClean-up of the encampment, which had been rebuilt after previously being cleared on April 24th, began round 4:30 a.m. Sunday.\n\nUSC Annenberg Media reported at 3:51 a.m. that university police officers told student reporters they planned to come in around 4 a.m. and had set up a staging area for the media, which they alleged was too far away to witness any arrests.\n\nProtesters shouted \"Free Palestine\" at 4:17 a.m., as officers began surrounding the encampment, Annenberg Media said. At 4:25 a.m., DPS officers gave protesters in the encampment 15 minutes to leave of face arrest.\n\nThe officers started at 4:35 a.m. to remove the banners hung by protesters, moving them to the side of the park, Annenberg Media said.\n\nDuring this time USC officials alerted students that the campus was temporarily closed.\n\nAs the clean-up proceeded, reporters at the Daily Trojan, USC's student newspaper, reported seeing \"at least 50 Los Angeles Police officers ... moving down Trousdale Parkway [near the USC campus] at around 4:15 a.m. with zip ties, less-lethal launchers and helmets.\" The paper also reported seeing \"three police vans, which appear to be used for transporting people who have been arrested.\"\n\nA news videographer at the scene said officers pushed 50 to 75 students out of the encampment and off the campus. The officers then cleared out the tents and other gear that was left behind.\n\nThe police action came just days after USC President Carol Folt wrote an open letter to the \"Trojan Family\" stressing the steps the university was taking to ensure that students finish finals \"in a quiet, safe academic environment -- and that our graduating students can enjoy peaceful and joyous commencement ceremonies.\"\n\nFolt also took a firm stand toward protesters who might continue to be disruptive.\n\n\"Let me be absolutely clear,\" she wrote in the letter released Friday. \"Free speech and assembly do not include the right to obstruct equal access to campus, damage property, or foment harassment, violence, and threats. Nor is anyone entitled to obstruct the normal functions of our university, including commencement.\n\n\"... When laws and policies that apply to everyone are repeatedly and flagrantly violated -- there must be consequences.\"\n\nIt was unclear when open access would be restored at the campus, which had been restricted to students, faculty and staff for much of the past week, now that the encampment has been removed.\n\nOn Thursday, USC implemented updated campus-entry procedures as it remained under a state of heightened security. The decision came a day after the school revealed plans for a \"Trojan Family Graduate Celebration\" at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum this coming Thursday, to replace the previously canceled main stage commencement ceremony amid the pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nUSC announced late Friday afternoon it was also pausing visitor registration because the \"campus is very busy with events and construction work to prepare for commencement,\" but existing visitor passes would be honored.\n\nPre-registered guests must show a QR code available from the visitor.usc.edu website, as well as a government-issued ID.\n\nUniversity officials said all bags will be subject to search. People wearing masks will be asked to lower them briefly to verify identification, according to the university.\n\nThe USC campus had been relatively calm in the days prior to Sunday's clean-up opertation.\n\nOn Wednesday, dozens of USC faculty members held a march through the campus in support of protesters, calling in part for amnesty for those who were arrested on April 24th.\n\nThe Wednesday march remained peaceful, with some students joining the faculty in the late-afternoon procession. It happened hours after a virtual meeting was held between members of the campus Academic Senate and Folt, who was joined by Provost Andrew Guzman.\n\nFolt wrote on social media Wednesday afternoon that the meeting was \"to explain our reasoning and answer their thoughtful and direct questions about our recent decisions.\n\n\"Rich & sometimes opposing views are essential to a great university,\" Folt wrote. \"Trust is built every day & we hope this was a step forward.\"\n\nIn her letter, Folt wrote that \"the university has initiated disciplinary review processes for individuals who have violated both our policies and the law. We will take any further actions required to maintain campus safety and security, consistent with our legal obligations.\n\n\"The university is legally obligated to ensure that students, faculty, and staff can move freely throughout our campus while pursuing their studies, work, and research.

Despite the arrests, students said there's currently not a strong police presence surrounding the camp, aside from a few campus safety officers.\n\nHowever, student journalists at USC Annenberg reported that Nancy Alonzo, assistant director of the USC Village Residential Colleges, visited the edge of the campsite Saturday afternoon and read another letter aloud to members of the student movement.\n\n\"The encampment has to go down, as we have mentioned before, your encampment and acts of vandalism and the theft of university property violates policies and the law,\" Alonzo reportedly said. \"These policies actually exist to protect the safety and security of every member of our community and we must enforce these policies consistently as we have always done. And then we also set up an alternative free speech area that's available to you all and you can move the encampment there.\"\n\nMembers of the student coalition said they were not permitted to take a picture of Alonzo's letter or to receive a physical copy.\n\nStudents in the camp, who call themselves the Divest from Death Coalition, said they are not interested in relocating to the designated free speech area, behind the Leavey Library south of W. 34th St.\n\n\"Protest locations cannot be dictated by the people in power because then it's no longer the freedom to protest and assemble,\" said the encampment spokesperson, who did not want to identify themselves because of fear of retaliation from the USC administration and students opposed to their activism.\n\nThe spokesperson described Saturday evening as \"calm\" and \"chill.\" During the interview, students were heard cheering in the background. An Instagram story posted by Trojans for Palestine showed students sitting in Alumni Park on picnic blankets and orange Home Depot paint buckets, clapping and singing \"we shall not be moved.\"\n\nBut protesters were ready for arrest, the spokesperson said.\n\n\"There is fear in the air. There is confidence. There is passion. We are emboldened to stand up for the people in Gaza,\" they said. \"No matter how this occupation goes down, it's still a win for us because we have caused a disruption and discomfort to the USC administration. We have ended business as usual for the past few weeks.\"\n\nThe decision to clear the camp on April 24 sparked anger, coming after USC barred valedictorian Asna Tabassum from speaking at its May 10 commencement -- a first in the university's 143-year history -- over unspecified safety threats. The move came after pro-Israel groups criticized Tabassum for a link on her Instagram profile directing people to a pro-Palestinian website.\n\nThat led officials to cancel commencement all together.\n\nBut on Friday, USC announced plans for a \"Trojan Family\" graduation event at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The event will take place Thursday, May 9 at 8:30 p.m. USC announced on Thursday. The university promises a drone show, fireworks, surprise performances and the Trojan Marching Band. The university also promised a special gift for the class of 2024.\n\nUSC is the latest university to take action against camps.\n\nAt least 25 people were arrested early Tuesday at Cal Poly Humboldt. The same night at UCLA, a large group wearing black outfits and white masks attacked pro-Palestinian protesters, hurling objects and attempting to tear down barricades surrounding the encampment. The violence prompted criticism over the university's handling of the protests.\n\nBy Thursday, more than 200 had been arrested after police moved onto UCLA's Westwood campus to push protesters out and begin dismantling the camp.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters calling for an end to Israeli military actions in Gaza and divestment from Israel.\n\nEncampments remain in full swing at California campuses, including UC Irvine, Occidental College, Sacramento State, San Francisco State and others.\n\nAt least two other Southern California colleges -- Chapman University and Cal State L.A. -- joined the movement this week.

Coliseum, rolls out new campus security", "body": "After canceling its mainstage commencement ceremony amid pro-Palestinian protests, USC has announced plans for a \"Trojan Family\" graduation celebration event next week at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\n\nThe event will take place Thursday, May 9 at 8:30 p.m. USC announced on Thursday. The university promises a drone show, fireworks, surprise performances and the Trojan Marching Band. The university also promised a special gift for the class of 2024.\n\nThe event will share the L.A. Coliseum with several other groups around the same time, so the USC Trojan Family graduate event will be limited to a portion of the venue. Each graduate will receive up to six tickets for their guests, the university said, and will be limited to \"graduates and their families and loved ones.\"\n\nUSC said it was unable to secure the entire venue, because it was already booked. The announcement for the event said that USC President Carol Folt \"has created a major kick-off to three days and nights of commencement events to honor you and those who've helped you along the way.\"\n\nThe announcement does not mention how pro-Palestinian demonstrators had recently erected an encampment in Alumni Park. On April 24, police arrested 93 students and off-campus activists during the protest, one of several demonstrations at campuses across the country, including neighboring UCLA.\n\nUSC expects to confer over 18,000 degrees from May 8-11 for its commencement week with a slew of events to celebration the occassion. New security measures have also been put in place.\n\nAll vehicle and pedestrian access to the university campus will be limited to two entrances, USC's Department of Public Safety announced in a news release Thursday. The entrances are located at the north and south sides of the campus, referred to as the McCarthy and McClintock entrances.\n\nThe limited access will be in effect 24 hours a day. The entrance to Watt Way is closed, but could be reopened barring traffic conditions, according to university officials.\n\nA temporary, separate interior fence will greet guests to the campus who are approaching outside of a vehicle, with pedestrians being asked to enter the university at McCarthy Way at the quad; the north side of Watt Way at 34th Street; and McClintock Avenue at Childs Way.\n\nAll USC students and employees will need to show their campus IDs to enter the campus or access the interior fence, according to USC. Guests will need to pre-register with the university online and show their QR code generated from the USC visitor registration website. Each registration must be completed daily and can be registered by a USC student, faculty or staff member.\n\nThe new safety measures follows days of protests at the private university in South L.A. Tickets will be required to access the campus and for all commencement events taking place during commencement week.\n\nGuests will be screened much in the same way that security checks bags at sporting events, according to the university.\n\nBut the university's main stage commencement ceremony, which draws 65,000-attendees to the campus, was canceled after the administration rescinded Asna Tabassum's graduation speaking spot as USC valedictorian.\n\nTabassum, a biomedical engineering major with a passion for social justice who minored in \"resistance to genocide,\" drew undisclosed threats to the university.\n\nThe university's decisions leading up to the cancellation has drawn criticism from both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel activists.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Troy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_band", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marching band"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Trojans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Trojans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Folt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carol Folt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Los_Angeles", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of California, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrangle_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quadrangle (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valedictorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valedictorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomedical_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Biomedical engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Student", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6a8597e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3780+0+350/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6b%2Fb8%2F1635246e4ef7b4a76430c6e23220%2F1275465-me-usc-campus-gxc-0130.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537360", "eventUri": "eng-9537360", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "dateEnd": "2024-05-11", "textStart": 1410, "textEnd": 1418}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 243, "textEnd": 248}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 1189, "textEnd": 1197}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

College commencements altered amid Gaza war protests", "body": "The chain link fences are up, bag searches in place and metal detectors installed.\n\nAt many universities across the country, graduation for the Class of 2024 will feel more like making it through airport security than a procession through a free-flowing campus green or a cheering stadium crowd.\n\nThe drastic changes arrive as universities grapple with pro-Palestinian tent camps -- the scenes of recent mass arrests and turmoil -- during a volatile time of campus divisions over the Israel-Hamas war. Last week at UCLA a mob attacked an encampment, and violence erupted.\n\nThe biggest commencement overhaul is at USC, where the 65,000-attendee \"main stage\" ceremony was canceled after unspecified threats over the selection of a pro-Palestinian valedictorian who critics said was antisemitic. An encampment where protesters are pushing for divestment from Israel is set up near the site of where the stage would have been, reemerging after Los Angeles police in riot gear arrested 93 people and cleared it on April 24.\n\nGraduating USC students are capped at getting eight tickets -- often fewer for satellite commencements -- and administrators are scrambling to entice angry parents with new attractions as the university moves around traditional celebrations.\n\n\"We had planned to bring up to 25 people,\" said Annette Ricchiazzi, a USC alumna whose daughter graduates this month with an undergraduate degree in theater. The closest family members will attend a ceremony at the Bing Theater, where tickets per student are always limited to four. But grandparents and other relatives had hoped to join the main stage ceremony and other events.\n\nRead more: Jailed students, a canceled commencement, angry parents: USC's Carol Folt takes on critics\n\n\"Not anymore,\" Ricchiazzi said. \"And with all the security now up, am I supposed to try to get my mother and mother-in-law in wheelchairs to come and just hang around outside where nothing is happening that involves their granddaughter?\" Only Ricchiazzi, her husband and their two other children will attend the Wednesday theater commencement.\n\nUSC has also instituted a \"clear bag\" rule and will run guests through metal detectors as they enter the typically open campus gates. Aiming to offset the disappointment, the university has cobbled together a new \"Trojan Family\" event that will take place Thursday evening in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. It promises a marching band, fireworks and a drone show.\n\nA nondenominational, interfaith baccalaureate was scheduled for that night in Bovard Auditorium -- near the site of the current encampment. But an entry on the USC website that listed it appears to have been removed. A university spokesman did not reply to requests to confirm whether the event will take place. Neither did Varun Soni, the dean of religious life who oversees the ceremony.\n\nFaith-specific commencement events, including a gathering for Catholic students and a new May 10 commemoration for Jewish graduates organized by the USC Hillel and Chabad centers, are also planned.\n\nIn total, USC expects to dole out more than 18,000 degrees May 8-11 in dozens of commencement events.\n\nRead more: 13 days that rocked USC: How a derailed commencement brought 'complete disaster'\n\nThe outcome of USC's graduation, one of the earliest in the state, could set the stage for end-of-year celebrations nationwide. In Los Angeles, another large commencement will unfold June 14 at UCLA, where law enforcement arrested more than 200 people last week after entering a pro-Palestinian encampment. UCLA has not announced changes to its three identical graduation ceremonies in Pauley Pavilion.\n\nCal Poly Humboldt, where police last week arrested dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters who had barricaded themselves in campus buildings, announced Friday that it will hold three off-campus graduations at venues that include a casino and a high school -- instead of one large ceremony at the Redwood Bowl stadium.\n\n\"I know it's just a ceremony, but it's tradition and I'm disappointed that I cannot graduate in the same place where my father did,\" said Ruby Cayenne, a Cal Poly Humboldt senior who will receive a degree in journalism. \"For a while, we weren't sure if we'd have any graduation at all.\"\n\nAt UC Berkeley, where commencement is May 14, no changes have been announced. There is an encampment of more than 100 tents at the school. The administration has maintained a hands-off approach to the protest.\n\nAcross the nation, similar frustrations and debates over graduation are playing out as protesting students argue that their movement to end the Israel's war in Gaza, which local authorities say has killed 34,000 Palestinians and the United Nations says has left millions in food scarcity, should take precedence over commencement business as usual. Israel's retaliatory war began after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, which killed roughly 1,200 people in the country and took 240 hostage, many of whom are believed to be held in Gaza.\n\nAt Columbia University, where more than 100 protesters were arrested last week, the New York Police Department plans to remain on campus through May 17, two days past the university's commencement.\n\nMinouche Shafik, the Columbia University president, has said she does not want to \"deprive thousands of students and their families and friends of a graduation celebration.\"\n\nRead more: USC valedictorian's grad speech is canceled: 'The university has betrayed me'\n\n\"Many in this graduating class did not get a celebration when graduating from high school because of the pandemic,\" she said in recent remarks.\n\nA pro-Palestinian camp is also set up at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where more than 8,000 students attended a Saturday graduation at Michigan Stadium. The university said in a statement that \"commencement ceremonies have been the site of free expression and peaceful protest for decades.\" At the same time, security procedures similar to those at football game were in place. There were boos as well as cheers as people unfurled Palestinian flags during the event.\n\nAt USC on Friday, about 40 tents and dozens of people, the majority of them students, were present in Alumni Park, the center of campus. Posted signs demanded the university to divest from companies tied to the Israel-Hamas war -- a request the university has not accepted.\n\nStudents entering campus must go through one of two entrances, show their student ID and have their bags searched. Fencing directs students to security checkpoints. The university also announced Friday that it is pausing its visitor registration system that allowed students to bring in guests.\n\nAs demonstrators studied for finals and held teach-ins in the encampment, students nearby who weren't activists took photos in graduation regalia by the Tommy Trojan statue and other scenic spots.\n\nOthers, such as Sammie Sorsby-Jones, avoided the area.\n\nSorsby-Jones, a 22-year-old senior majoring in law, history and culture with a minor in gender studies, said that campus felt \"apocalyptic.\"\n\n\"I can't take walks around campus and reflect on the different memories I have in each building when there's lines to get into campus and the buildings are surrounded by fences,\" she said.\n\nSorsby-Jones chose not to take graduation photos at landmarks directly next to the encampment.\n\n\"It's not the protesters' fault, and I know people can still take grad photos there, but it just feels strange,\" she said. \"It's this constant reminder of a deeply not normal graduation in a way that does make it difficult to celebrate yourself, because the end of my college experience just feels like it pales in comparison to everything that's going on right now.\"\n\nSpeaking to a reporter last week, a member of the camp said that students would stay put \"until our demands are met.\" Asked if that meant through the summer, the student said, \"You'll have to see.\"\n\nIn an interview Monday, USC President Carol Folt would not commit to avoiding further arrests and did not indicate whether she planned to call for the removal the tents before graduation.\n\nRead more: Commencement speakers launch boycott of USC satellite graduation ceremonies\n\n\"My intent is this: to try to come to a resolution that is peaceful.... But we have a lot of students that want to graduate, and I fully expect them to be able to go through that,\" Folt said.\n\nActivists at USC posted images and video on social media of Department of Public Safety officers gathering by the camp on Thursday with riot gear and zip ties. The officers later dispersed.\n\nIn a campus letter released Friday, Folt suggested that she would not let the tents stay much longer.\n\nNobody is \"entitled to obstruct the normal functions of our university, including commencement. ... Every part of our campuses, including Alumni Park, must be fully accessible and free from vandalism and harassment,\" she wrote.\n\nIn an interview the same day, Aro Velmet, an associate professor of history who has joined students at the camp and was among faculty arrested last week, said he felt the protest was not disruptive to graduation but instead aligned with the university's purpose.\n\n\"Yesterday, during the loudest part of the camp people were chanting and singing union songs and others were taking pictures outside. They were fine. They were not bothered. I wish they had been curious about what's going on, but they certainly were not disrupted,\" Velmet said.\n\nHe said the response by Folt's administration, including the arrests, has been \"incredibly disruptive to the core academic mission of the university, which is to produce new knowledge. These are students who are curious about the world, putting their teachings into action.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

At 4:25 a.m., DPS officers gave protesters in the encampment 15 minutes to leave the area before facing arrest.\n\nThe officers started at 4:35 a.m. to remove the banners hung by protesters, moving them to the side of the park, Annenberg said. An officer reportedly told Annenberg Media reporters it is \"a DPS operation.\"\n\nDuring this time USC officials alerted students that the campus was temporarily closed.\n\nAs the clean-up operation proceed, reporters at the Daily Trojan, USC's student newspaper, reported seeing \"at least 50 Los Angeles Police officers ... moving down Trousdale Parkway near the USC campus at around 4:15 a.m. with zip ties, less-lethal launchers and helmets.\" The also reported seeing \"three police vans, which appear to be used for transporting people who have been arrested.\"\n\nA news videographer at the scene said officers pushed 50 to 75 students out of the encampment and off the campus. The officers then cleared out the tents and other gear that was left behind.\n\nThe police action came after USC President Carol Folt wrote an open letter to the \"Trojan Family\" stressing the steps the university was taking to ensure that students can finish finals \"in a quiet, safe academic environment -- and that our graduating students can enjoy peaceful and joyous commencement ceremonies.\"\n\nFolt took a firm stand toward protesters who might continue to be disruptive.\n\n\"Let me be absolutely clear,\" she wrote in the letter released Friday. \"Free speech and assembly do not include the right to obstruct equal access to campus, damage property, or foment harassment, violence, and threats. Nor is anyone entitled to obstruct the normal functions of our university, including commencement.\n\n\"... When laws and policies that apply to everyone are repeatedly and flagrantly violated -- there must be consequences.\"\n\nIt is not clear how campus access, which had been restricted to students, faculty and staff for much of the past week, would be impacted now that the encampment has been removed.\n\nOn Thursday, USC implemented updated campus-entry procedures as it remains under a state of heightened security. It also came a day after the school revealed plans for a \"Trojan Family Graduate Celebration\" at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Thursday, to replace the previously canceled main stage commencement ceremony amid the pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nAccording to the university DPS, vehicle and pedestrian access to the campus is available at the McCarthy and McClintock entrances. The entry at Watt Way is not open, but DPS officials said it or other locations may be used as exits to help relieve vehicle congestion.\n\nA separate, temporary interior perimeter fence is in place, with pedestrian access available at McCarthy Way and the quad; Watt Way and 34th Street; and McClintock Avenue and Childs Way.\n\nEntry was still limited to students and employees with IDs. Pre-registered guests must show a QR code available from the visitor.usc.edu website, as well as a government-issued ID.\n\nUSC announced late Friday afternoon it is pausing visitor registration because the \"campus is very busy with events and construction work to prepare for commencement,\" but existing visitor passes will be honored.\n\nUniversity officials said all bags will be subject to search. People wearing masks will be asked to lower them briefly to verify identification, according to the university.\n\nConditions on the USC campus had remained relatively calm in recent days, a far cry from the scene last week when 93 people were arrested following a mass protest and attempted occupation of Alumni Park.\n\nOn Wednesday, dozens of USC faculty members held a march through the campus in support of protesters, calling in part for amnesty for those who were arrested last week.\n\nThe Wednesday march remained peaceful, with some students joining the faculty in the late-afternoon procession. It happened hours after a virtual meeting was held between members of the campus Academic Senate and Folt, who was joined by Provost Andrew Guzman.\n\nFolt wrote on social media Wednesday afternoon that the meeting was \"to explain our reasoning and answer their thoughtful and direct questions about our recent decisions.\"\n\n\"Rich & sometimes opposing views are essential to a great university,\" Folt wrote. \"Trust is built every day & we hope this was a step forward.\"\n\nIn her letter, Folt wrote that \"the university has initiated disciplinary review processes for individuals who have violated both our policies and the law. We will take any further actions required to maintain campus safety and security, consistent with our legal obligations.\"\n\n\"The university is legally obligated to ensure that students, faculty, and staff can move freely throughout our campus while pursuing their studies, work, and research,\" Folt wrote. \"Every part of our campuses, including Alumni Park, must be fully accessible and free from vandalism and harassment.\"\n\nUSC became a focal point of Southland pro-Palestinian protests following its decision to cancel valedictorian Asna Tabassum's commencement speech in response to complaints about online posts that critics called antisemitic. USC officials insisted the move was solely a security issue, not a political decision.\n\nAs tensions continued mounting -- leading to the mass protest April 24 that resulted in 93 arrests -- the university eventually opted to cancel its May 10 main stage commencement in Alumni Park altogether, but vowed to move forward with the usual array of smaller satellite graduation ceremonies for the school's individual colleges.", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Socialists_of_Montenegro", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinian nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annenberg_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Annenberg Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Trojan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daily Trojan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USC_Annenberg_School_for_Communication_and_Journalism", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Campus police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_university", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public university"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-lethal_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-lethal weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspaper", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newspaper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Folt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carol Folt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrangle_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quadrangle (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_letter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open letter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commencement_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commencement speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southland_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southland Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valedictorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valedictorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provost_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Provost (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "QR code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nursing/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/mynewsla.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MNLA-Facebook.jpg?fit=640%2C360&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537360", "eventUri": "eng-9537360", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 6014, "textEnd": 6022}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 6100, "textEnd": 6106}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Fire crews were also there. USC issued an alert saying the LAPD had arrived and that people should leave the center of campus. Those who did not could face arrest, the alert said.\n\nLast month, Los Angeles police arrested 93 people on suspicion of trespassing last week as they cleared an earlier encampment at the center of campus.\n\nBut protesters reestablished campsite last weekend. In a campus-wide letter published Friday, USC President Carol Folt indicated that the encampment would not be permitted to remain much longer.\n\n\"The university is legally obligated to ensure that students, faculty, and staff can move freely throughout our campus while pursuing their studies, work, and research,\" Folt said. \"Every part of our campuses, including Alumni Park, must be fully accessible and free from vandalism and harassment.\"\n\nThe encampment at Alumni Park has grown to at least 40 tents and roughly 50 people, according to student organizers. Despite the arrests, students said there's currently not a strong police presence surrounding the camp, aside from a few campus safety officers.\n\nRead more: Encampments spread across California universities. Are they living on borrowed time?\n\nHowever, student journalists at USC Annenberg reported that Nancy Alonzo, assistant director of the USC Village Residential Colleges, visited the edge of the campsite Saturday afternoon and read another letter aloud to members of the student movement.\n\n\"The encampment has to go down, as we have mentioned before, your encampment and acts of vandalism and the theft of university property violates policies and the law,\" Alonzo reportedly said. \"These policies actually exist to protect the safety and security of every member of our community and we must enforce these policies consistently as we have always done. And then we also set up an alternative free speech area that's available to you all and you can move the encampment there.\"\n\nMembers of the student coalition said they were not permitted to take a picture of Alonzo's letter or to receive a physical copy.\n\nStudents in the camp, who call themselves the Divest from Death Coalition, said they are not interested in relocating to the designated free speech area, behind the Leavey Library south of W. 34th St.\n\n\"Protest locations cannot be dictated by the people in power because then it's no longer the freedom to protest and assemble,\" said the encampment spokesperson, who did not want to identify themselves because of fear of retaliation from the USC administration and students opposed to their activism.\n\nThe spokesperson described Saturday evening as \"calm\" and \"chill.\" During the interview, students were heard cheering in the background. An Instagram story posted by Trojans for Palestine showed students sitting in Alumni Park on picnic blankets and orange Home Depot paint buckets, clapping and singing \"we shall not be moved.\"\n\nBut protesters were ready for arrest, the spokesperson said.\n\n\"There is fear in the air. There is confidence. There is passion. We are emboldened to stand up for the people in Gaza,\" they said. \"No matter how this occupation goes down, it's still a win for us because we have caused a disruption and discomfort to the USC administration. We have ended business as usual for the past few weeks.\"\n\nThe decision to clear the camp on April 24 sparked anger, coming after USC barred valedictorian Asna Tabassum from speaking at its May 10 commencement -- a first in the university's 143-year history -- over unspecified safety threats. The move came after pro-Israel groups criticized Tabassum for a link on her Instagram profile directing people to a pro-Palestinian website.\n\nThat led officials to cancel commencement all together.\n\nBut on Friday, USC announced plans for a \"Trojan Family\" graduation event at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The event will take place Thursday, May 9 at 8:30 p.m. USC announced on Thursday. The university promises a drone show, fireworks, surprise performances and the Trojan Marching Band. The university also promised a special gift for the class of 2024.\n\nUSC is the latest university to take action against camps.\n\nAt least 25 people were arrested early Tuesday at Cal Poly Humboldt. The same night at UCLA, a large group wearing black outfits and white masks attacked pro-Palestinian protesters, hurling objects and attempting to tear down barricades surrounding the encampment. The violence prompted criticism over the university's handling of the protests.\n\nBy Thursday, more than 200 had been arrested after police moved onto UCLA's Westwood campus to push protesters out and begin dismantling the camp.\n\nRead more: After canceling commencement, USC will host event at L.A.

Several people could be seen leaving the area as officers formed a perimeter at the site of dozens of tents. Other people remained in the area around the encampment, beating drums and chanting in the darkness and light rain.\n\n\"The Los Angeles Police Department is clearing the center of UPC,\" the campus department of public safety said. \"If you are in the center of campus, please leave. People who don't leave could be arrested.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many people, if any, remained inside tents at the encampment early Sunday.\n\nThe police operation involving officers with zip ties, less-lethal launchers and helmets comes three days after a much larger pro-Palestinian encampment was cleared on the campus of UCLA.

It was the first place we looked - unfortunately, it was fully booked. We also looked at many alternative arenas around Los Angeles - which on such short notice had similar issues,\" the university wrote in a press release. \"We have been able to host this event - and a couple of smaller events - because several groups adjusted their plans at the Coliseum to accommodate limited access for this special event.\"\n\nThe event will feature drone shows, fireworks and surprise performances, according to the release.

Yes, you can. It's like, are you putting enough effort,\" Garcia asked. \"For students like me that are getting their master's, it's more about getting the master's, but there are other students that are getting their bachelor's.

They really want to live this experience.\"\n\nNBC4 reached out to USC regarding the security for the event, specifically about the potential for protests.\n\nIn a statement, USC wrote: \"There will be normal Coliseum security, like at a football game.\"\n\nSierra said she is not concerned about the possibility of protests.\n\n\"Honestly, like whatever is going to happen, like I feel like students are still like very vocal about their opinions,\" she said. \"So whatever happens, there's going to be like some type of protest, whether it's big or small.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbclosangeles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Southern California"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graduation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Troy"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Memorial_Coliseum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valedictorian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valedictorian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireworks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fireworks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Education", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/USC-Auditorium.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537360", "eventUri": "eng-9537360", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 321, "textEnd": 326}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

College commencements altered amid Gaza war protests", "body": "The chain link fences are up, bag searches in place and metal detectors installed.\n\nAt many universities across the country, graduation for the Class of 2024 will feel more like making it through airport security than a procession through a free-flowing campus green or a cheering stadium crowd.\n\nThe drastic changes arrive as universities grapple with pro-Palestinian tent camps -- the scenes of recent mass arrests and turmoil -- during a volatile time of campus divisions over the Israel-Hamas war. Last week at UCLA a mob attacked an encampment, and violence erupted.\n\nThe biggest commencement overhaul is at USC, where the 65,000-attendee \"main stage\" ceremony was canceled after unspecified threats over the selection of a pro-Palestinian valedictorian who critics said was antisemitic. An encampment where protesters are pushing for divestment from Israel is set up near the site of where the stage would have been, reemerging after Los Angeles police in riot gear arrested 93 people and cleared it on April 24.\n\nGraduating USC students are capped at getting eight tickets -- often fewer for satellite commencements -- and administrators are scrambling to entice angry parents with new attractions as the university moves around traditional celebrations.\n\n\"We had planned to bring up to 25 people,\" said Annette Ricchiazzi, a USC alumna whose daughter graduates this month with an undergraduate degree in theater. The closest family members will attend a ceremony at the Bing Theater, where tickets per student are always limited to four. But grandparents and other relatives had hoped to join the main stage ceremony and other events.\n\n\"Not anymore,\" Ricchiazzi said. \"And with all the security now up, am I supposed to try to get my mother and mother-in-law in wheelchairs to come and just hang around outside where nothing is happening that involves their granddaughter?\" Only Ricchiazzi, her husband and their two other children will attend the Wednesday theater commencement.\n\nUSC has also instituted a \"clear bag\" rule and will run guests through metal detectors as they enter the typically open campus gates. Aiming to offset the disappointment, the university has cobbled together a new \"Trojan Family\" event that will take place Thursday evening in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. It promises a marching band, fireworks and a drone show.\n\nA nondenominational, interfaith baccalaureate was scheduled for that night in Bovard Auditorium -- near the site of the current encampment. But an entry on the USC website that listed it appears to have been removed. A university spokesman did not reply to requests to confirm whether the event will take place. Neither did Varun Soni, the dean of religious life who oversees the ceremony.\n\nFaith-specific commencement events, including a gathering for Catholic students and a new May 10 commemoration for Jewish graduates organized by the USC Hillel and Chabad centers, are also planned.\n\nIn total, USC expects to dole out more than 18,000 degrees May 8-11 in dozens of commencement events.\n\nThe outcome of USC's graduation, one of the earliest in the state, could set the stage for end-of-year celebrations nationwide. In Los Angeles, another large commencement will unfold June 14 at UCLA, where law enforcement arrested more than 200 people last week after entering a pro-Palestinian encampment. UCLA has not announced changes to its three identical graduation ceremonies in Pauley Pavilion.\n\nCal Poly Humboldt, where police last week arrested dozens of pro-Palestinian protesters who had barricaded themselves in campus buildings, announced Friday that it will hold three off-campus graduations at venues that include a casino and a high school -- instead of one large ceremony at the Redwood Bowl stadium.\n\n\"I know it's just a ceremony, but it's tradition and I'm disappointed that I cannot graduate in the same place where my father did,\" said Ruby Cayenne, a Cal Poly Humboldt senior who will receive a degree in journalism. \"For a while, we weren't sure if we'd have any graduation at all.\"\n\nAt UC Berkeley, where commencement is May 14, no changes have been announced. There is an encampment of more than 100 tents at the school. The administration has maintained a hands-off approach to the protest.\n\nAcross the nation, similar frustrations and debates over graduation are playing out as protesting students argue that their movement to end the Israel's war in Gaza, which local authorities say has killed 34,000 Palestinians and the United Nations says has left millions in food scarcity, should take precedence over commencement business as usual. Israel's retaliatory war began after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, which killed roughly 1,200 people in the country and took 240 hostage, many of whom are believed to be held in Gaza.\n\nAt Columbia University, where more than 100 protesters were arrested last week, the New York Police Department plans to remain on campus through May 17, two days past the university's commencement.\n\nMinouche Shafik, the Columbia University president, has said she does not want to \"deprive thousands of students and their families and friends of a graduation celebration.\"\n\n\"Many in this graduating class did not get a celebration when graduating from high school because of the pandemic,\" she said in recent remarks.\n\nA pro-Palestinian camp is also set up at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where more than 8,000 students attended a Saturday graduation at Michigan Stadium. The university said in a statement that \"commencement ceremonies have been the site of free expression and peaceful protest for decades.\" At the same time, security procedures similar to those at football game were in place. There were boos as well as cheers as people unfurled Palestinian flags during the event.\n\nAt USC on Friday, about 40 tents and dozens of people, the majority of them students, were present in Alumni Park, the center of campus. Posted signs demanded the university to divest from companies tied to the Israel-Hamas war -- a request the university has not accepted.\n\nStudents entering campus must go through one of two entrances, show their student ID and have their bags searched. Fencing directs students to security checkpoints. The university also announced Friday that it is pausing its visitor registration system that allowed students to bring in guests.\n\nAs demonstrators studied for finals and held teach-ins in the encampment, students nearby who weren't activists took photos in graduation regalia by the Tommy Trojan statue and other scenic spots.\n\nOthers, such as Sammie Sorsby-Jones, avoided the area.\n\nSorsby-Jones, a 22-year-old senior majoring in law, history and culture with a minor in gender studies, said that campus felt \"apocalyptic.\"\n\n\"I can't take walks around campus and reflect on the different memories I have in each building when there's lines to get into campus and the buildings are surrounded by fences,\" she said.\n\nSorsby-Jones chose not to take graduation photos at landmarks directly next to the encampment.\n\n\"It's not the protesters' fault, and I know people can still take grad photos there, but it just feels strange,\" she said. \"It's this constant reminder of a deeply not normal graduation in a way that does make it difficult to celebrate yourself, because the end of my college experience just feels like it pales in comparison to everything that's going on right now.\"\n\nSpeaking to a reporter last week, a member of the camp said that students would stay put \"until our demands are met.\" Asked if that meant through the summer, the student said, \"You'll have to see.\"\n\nIn an interview Monday, USC President Carol Folt would not commit to avoiding further arrests and did not indicate whether she planned to call for the removal the tents before graduation.\n\n\"My intent is this: to try to come to a resolution that is peaceful.... But we have a lot of students that want to graduate, and I fully expect them to be able to go through that,\" Folt said.\n\nActivists at USC posted images and video on social media of Department of Public Safety officers gathering by the camp on Thursday with riot gear and zip ties. The officers later dispersed.\n\nIn a campus letter released Friday, Folt suggested that she would not let the tents stay much longer.\n\nNobody is \"entitled to obstruct the normal functions of our university, including commencement. ... Every part of our campuses, including Alumni Park, must be fully accessible and free from vandalism and harassment,\" she wrote.\n\nIn an interview the same day, Aro Velmet, an associate professor of history who has joined students at the camp and was among faculty arrested last week, said he felt the protest was not disruptive to graduation but instead aligned with the university's purpose.\n\n\"Yesterday, during the loudest part of the camp people were chanting and singing union songs and others were taking pictures outside. They were fine. They were not bothered. I wish they had been curious about what's going on, but they certainly were not disrupted,\" Velmet said.\n\nHe said the response by Folt's administration, including the arrests, has been \"incredibly disruptive to the core academic mission of the university, which is to produce new knowledge. These are students who are curious about the world, putting their teachings into action.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [],

Announces New Commencement Plans After Canceling its Main Ceremony", "body": "After weeks of tumult at the University of Southern California, administrators have announced updated commencement plans, with increased security and modified festivities. The plans are in lieu of the university's main graduation ceremony, which the school had canceled, citing security concerns.\n\nThe university said it would host a \"Trojan Family Graduate Celebration\" on Thursday at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the famed venue where its football team plays home games. More than 100 school-specific graduations and smaller receptions are set to take place on campus as planned, but with tighter access.\n\n\"Count on drone shows, fireworks, surprise performances, the Trojan Marching Band and a special gift just for the Class of 2024,\" an announcement about the Coliseum event said.\n\nFor scheduling reasons, the university will be able to use only a portion of the stadium, so each graduate will receive up to six tickets.\n\nAccess to campus for school-specific ceremonies will be limited to students, faculty, staff and registered guests, the university said. Security measures will be similar to those at sporting events, such as requiring that visitors and students carry clear bags.\n\nOn April 16, officials at U.S.C., a private institution in South Los Angeles better known for its glitzy roster of alumni than its student activism, canceled the traditional valedictorian address that was set to be given by Asna Tabassum, a Muslim biomedical engineering major, citing security concerns.\n\nPro-Israel groups had criticized a pro-Palestinian link on Ms. Tabassum's social media bio.\n\nHours later, the university said all of the featured guests and speakers -- including Billie Jean King, the tennis star, and John M. Chu, the director of \"Crazy Rich Asians\" -- who had been scheduled to appear alongside her would not be present.\n\nThe moves incited swift and intense outrage among students and others in the campus community. And as protests against the war in Gaza spread to universities across the country, students at U.S.C. made calls to let Ms. Tabassum speak a rallying cry.\n\nSome other universities in California took a lighter touch -- at least initially -- with pro-Palestinian encampments that formed on grassy quads across the state. But administrators at U.S.C. called in the Los Angeles Police Department within hours to arrest protesters for trespassing.\n\nIn all, 93 people were arrested, and the next day, April 25, administrators announced that the university's main commencement ceremony would be canceled altogether. U.S.C. said it could not host the ceremony because new safety measures would have increased the amount of time needed to process the 65,000 or so students or guests who usually attend the main-stage commencement.\n\nOn Friday morning, the campus, which is fenced but normally open to the public, was closed to anyone without an identification card.

Fire crews were also there.\n\nLast month, Los Angeles police arrested 93 people on suspicion of trespassing last week as they cleared an earlier encampment at the center of campus.\n\nBut protesters reestablished campsite last weekend. In a campus-wide letter published Friday, USC President Carol Folt indicated that the encampment would not be permitted to remain much longer.\n\n\"The university is legally obligated to ensure that students, faculty, and staff can move freely throughout our campus while pursuing their studies, work, and research,\" Folt said. \"Every part of our campuses, including Alumni Park, must be fully accessible and free from vandalism and harassment.\"\n\nThe encampment at Alumni Park has grown to at least 40 tents and roughly 50 people, according to student organizers. Despite the arrests, students said there's currently not a strong police presence surrounding the camp, aside from a few campus safety officers.\n\nHowever, student journalists at USC Annenberg reported that Nancy Alonzo, assistant director of the USC Village Residential Colleges, visited the edge of the campsite Saturday afternoon and read another letter aloud to members of the student movement.\n\n\"The encampment has to go down, as we have mentioned before, your encampment and acts of vandalism and the theft of university property violates policies and the law,\" Alonzo reportedly said. \"These policies actually exist to protect the safety and security of every member of our community and we must enforce these policies consistently as we have always done. And then we also set up an alternative free speech area that's available to you all and you can move the encampment there.\"\n\nMembers of the student coalition said they were not permitted to take a picture of Alonzo's letter or to receive a physical copy.\n\nStudents in the camp, who call themselves the Divest from Death Coalition, said they are not interested in relocating to the designated free speech area, behind the Leavey Library south of W. 34th St.\n\n\"Protest locations cannot be dictated by the people in power because then it's no longer the freedom to protest and assemble,\" said the encampment spokesperson, who did not want to identify themselves because of fear of retaliation from the USC administration and students opposed to their activism.\n\nThe spokesperson described Saturday evening as \"calm\" and \"chill.\" During the interview, students were heard cheering in the background. An Instagram story posted by Trojans for Palestine showed students sitting in Alumni Park on picnic blankets and orange Home Depot paint buckets, clapping and singing \"we shall not be moved.\"\n\nBut protesters were ready for arrest, the spokesperson said.\n\n\"There is fear in the air. There is confidence. There is passion. We are emboldened to stand up for the people in Gaza,\" they said. \"No matter how this occupation goes down, it's still a win for us because we have caused a disruption and discomfort to the USC administration. We have ended business as usual for the past few weeks.\"\n\nThe decision to clear the camp on April 24 sparked anger, coming after USC barred valedictorian Asna Tabassum from speaking at its May 10 commencement -- a first in the university's 143-year history -- over unspecified safety threats. The move came after pro-Israel groups criticized Tabassum for a link on her Instagram profile directing people to a pro-Palestinian website.\n\nThat led officials to cancel commencement all together.\n\nBut on Friday, USC announced plans for a \"Trojan Family\" graduation event at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The event will take place Thursday, May 9 at 8:30 p.m. USC announced on Thursday. The university promises a drone show, fireworks, surprise performances and the Trojan Marching Band. The university also promised a special gift for the class of 2024.\n\nUSC is the latest university to take action against camps.\n\nAt least 25 people were arrested early Tuesday at Cal Poly Humboldt. The same night at UCLA, a large group wearing black outfits and white masks attacked pro-Palestinian protesters, hurling objects and attempting to tear down barricades surrounding the encampment. The violence prompted criticism over the university's handling of the protests.\n\nBy Thursday, more than 200 had been arrested after police moved onto UCLA's Westwood campus to push protesters out and begin dismantling the camp.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters calling for an end to Israeli military actions in Gaza and divestment from Israel.\n\nEncampments remain in full swing at California campuses, including UC Irvine, Occidental College, Sacramento State, San Francisco State and others.\n\nAt least two other Southern California colleges -- Chapman University and Cal State L.A. -- joined the movement this week. Students at Cal State Long Beach held a rally Thursday, but have said there are no plans for an encampment.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"},

At 4:25 a.m., DPS officers gave protesters in the encampment 15 minutes to leave the area before facing arrest.\n\nThe officers started at 4:35 a.m. to remove the banners hung by protesters, moving them to the side of the park, Annenberg said.

In a series of tweets during the raid, the university warned demonstrators to leave the area, adding that \"people who don't leave could be arrested\".\n\nSpeaking to KTLA, members of the student-run newspapers the Daily Trojan and Annenberg Media said: \"We were just sitting here, camping out. We saw a peaceful encampment. They've been eating food, having teach-ins ... and then they eventually went in their tents later in the night and then at around 4[am] actually, we saw dozens of DPS cars [department of public safety] come in and then from there, they started bringing in the officers.\"\n\n\"Before they came in, it was very peaceful. People were sleeping, in fact,\" another member said, adding: \"At 4am was when ... we saw dozens of LAPD officers sort of come in, essentially in trucks, standing on the trucks. I think there were about four trucks, each of them had about a dozen or so police officers ... Along with that, we also had DPS come in.\"\n\nVideos posted online by the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation at USC showed dozens of riot police marching throughout campus as others stood guard with multiple zip ties hanging from their belts.\n\nAround them, anti-war student protesters chanted: \"Free, free Palestine!\" Others chanted, \"Who do you protect?\" and \"Fascists, fascists, you can't hide! We charge you with genocide.\" Some also chanted: \"Why are you in riot gear? I don't see no riot here!\"\n\nAnother video captured during the raid showed USC journalism professor Alan Mittelstaedt arguing with a police officer over media access as the police officer attempted to cordon media to an area far from the encampment.\n\nAt one point, the police officer raises his voice and says, \"By law, you gotta get outta the way! Listen to me!\"\n\nIn a statement following the raid, USC president Carol Folt said: \"I requested the LAPD to assist DPS in removing the encampment as peacefully and safely as possible. At 4.10 am, an order to disperse was issued, providing the trespassers one last opportunity to leave voluntarily. In 64 minutes, the encampment was abandoned and cleared. The operation was peaceful with no arrests. We will not tolerate illegal encampments of any kind at USC.\"\n\nHours later, some Democrats defended police actions taken across the country to dismantle campus encampments and even arrest protesters. Arizona senator Mark Kelly said on NBC's Meet the Press it was appropriate for police to get involved when protests turn into \"unlawful acts\".\n\n\"When they cross a line and when they commit crimes, they should be arrested,\" Kelly said. \"That's the appropriate thing to do.\"\n\nJoe Biden, who had been silent on the university campus protests, confronted the issue on Thursday. \"Dissent is essential for democracy,\" Biden said in an address at the White House. \"But dissent must never lead to disorder.\"\n\nThe president added: \"Vandalism, trespassing, breaking windows, shutting down campus, forcing the cancellation of classes and graduation ... none of this is a peaceful protest.\"\n\nSaturday's pre-dawn raid marked the second on USC's campus after police dismantled an earlier encampment and arrested 93 anti-war protesters on 24 April.\n\nThe USC encampments, along with multiple encampments across US college campuses in recent weeks, were set up by students in calls for the university to divest from companies - including weapons manufacturers - with ties to Israel.\n\nThe encampments also come in response to Israel's deadly war on Gaza since Hamas's 7 October attacks that killed more than 1,100 Israelis. Since October, Israeli forces have killed more than 34,000 Palestinians across Gaza while leaving 2 million survivors displaced across the narrow strip amid a famine caused by Israeli restrictions on aid.\n\nIsrael has also destroyed every university in Gaza, in addition to killing at least 5,479 students, 261 teachers and 95 university professors, according to the UN, which has condemned Israel's actions as \"scholasticide\".\n\nUSC has received significant backlash from students, faculty and alumni in recent weeks over its administration's crackdown on the student encampments, as well as its decision to cancel the valedictorian speech of Asna Tabassum, a Muslim student who has expressed solidarity for Palestine.\n\nThe Council of American Islamic Relations (Cair), the US's largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, condemned USC's decision as \"cowardly\" while Tabassum accused the university of attempting to \"silence my voice\".\n\nOn Friday, USC faculty staged a walkout in support of the anti-war student demonstrators and their encampment. Meanwhile, over 1,500 USC alumni have signed an open letter in support of the USC Divest from Death coalition.\n\nFollowing Saturday's raid, USC law professor Jody David Armour wrote on X: \"My heart is heavy but my spirits are high as I grieve the loss of the \u2066USC\u2069 students' encampment but celebrate their courageous & conscientious fight against our complicity in mass graves, collective punishment, forced starvation, & the killing of more than 14,000 children.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri":

As I pointed out at the time, the crowd at USC was fairly rowdy and made it difficult for LAPD to remove the tents.\n\nWhen police decided to arrest one person, they mob surrounded the police car he was put in and refused to let the officers leave. Eventually they had to release the arrested person for their own safety. That was one incident but overall, police arrested 93 people during that sweep and the tents were cleared from the campus.\n\nBut the leaders of the protest camp weren't done. Just over a week ago they reestablished the tent camp. USC's president put out a statement letting them know that consequences were coming.\n\nFreedom of expression is one of our foundational values, and throughout the year, faculty, staff, and students have held lawful marches, vigils, and peaceful demonstrations. But let me be absolutely clear: free speech and assembly do not include the right to obstruct equal access to campus, damage property, or foment harassment, violence, and threats. Nor is anyone entitled to obstruct the normal functions of our university, including commencement...\n\nWhen laws and policies that apply to everyone are repeatedly and flagrantly violated - there must be consequences. This is an intense and highly charged time for the country and for many here at USC - I'm asking everyone to help, abide by all our security measures, and treat each other with empathy and respect. The university has initiated disciplinary review processes for individuals who have violated both our policies and the law. We will take any further actions required to maintain campus safety and security, consistent with our legal obligations.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon a spokesperson for the administration visited the camp and read aloud another statement similar to the one above, letting them know they had to move but could relocate their tent camp to another area further from the center of campus. The protesters refused. As a result, early Sunday morning the LAPD moved in again.\n\nAt 4:17 a.m. USC issued an alert saying the LAPD had arrived and that people should leave the park area in the center of campus. Officials gave demonstrators the option to leave before being arrested. A group of about 30 protesters left the encampment as LAPD pushed them toward the university's Jefferson Boulevard entrance.\n\n\"Free, free Palestine\" demonstrators chanted when they faced police at the perimeter, beating drums as helicopters hovered overhead...\n\nAt about 5 a.m., police entered the core of the encampment and began dismantling tents, leaving behind posters and the makeshift barriers. A perimeter was set up outside the university park area where media and protesters gathered. By 6 a.m. the encampment area appeared empty and quiet. Los Angeles police had largely left and about 33 campus police officers patrolled the area as trucks and workers hauled away the encampnent debris.\n\nThe protesters released a whiny statement but the key line it is this one: \"Students complied with both the dispersal orders and the identification threats and fortunately no arrests were made.\"\n\nThe protesters at USC seem to have learned that there could be real consequences for their actions. I don't think this sweep by the LAPD would have gone the way it did Sunday morning if not for the tougher stance taken at Columbia and at other schools last week. Simply put, threatening the group as a group only encourages them to double down, but if you identify the individuals and make it clear they will personally be expelled, their attitude changes dramatically. \"No arrests were made\" is a sign that even the student radicals are only willing to go so far.\n\nAt least 13 students and one staff member are facing disciplinary action following the early morning LAPD sweep of the anti-war encampment at Alumni Park, a media liaison with USC Divest from Death told Annenberg Media...\n\nPrior to today's sweep in the early morning hours, students who had been arrested for criminal trespassing during the April 24 sweep were notified in an email from the university that \"any further violations of university policies ... [would] result in further discipline up to expulsion as well as an immediate ban from campus.\"\n\nThe email specified that violating university policies against camping, vandalism and defying DPS directives, among others, would be grounds for disciplinary action.\n\nThis is the way forward for other administrators around the country. Identify the students in the camp and let them know they will be expelled if they fail to comply with police orders. That's how you get a cleared campus with no arrests made.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_sexton@hotair.com", "name": "John Sexton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "University of Southern California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_protest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Student protest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protest_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protest camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vigil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_(region)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palestine (region)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trespass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trespass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-war_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anti-war movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Campus police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_activism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Student activism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vandalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbia, South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/115/24c7ca4c-c712-4a85-beb5-36b92525595f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537360", "eventUri": "eng-9537360", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-24", "textStart": 4116, "textEnd": 4124}], "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

USC student journalism outlet Annenberg Media reported on the events as they unfolded, until police closed the campus to everyone other than students and faculty, including forcing the media out. However, local CBS affiliate KCAL was somehow allowed on-campus to report, Annenberg Media's Mohammed Zain Shafi Khan told TheWrap.\n\nOne officer told the student reporters that, because they \"act like the media, and we're going to treat you like the media,\" and threatened to take their press badges, Annenberg Media reported.\n\n\"At 4 a.m. we saw Suburbans loaded with dozens of police officers in each of them, LAPD officers, at least 30 at the minimum,\" Khan explained. The police set up a perimeter, he added, and began to escort members of the encampment away.\n\n\"We tried to set up, we tried to ask them multiple times, but they kept pushing media towards the back, towards the end, where we really couldn't see anything -- but we really had to sort of put ourselves at risk, actually, to sort of go towards the front so we could document,\" he continued.\n\nThe campus had already been closed to everyone other than students and faculty by then, requiring anyone who approached to show a school ID. \"For a very, very long time, the only media that was on campus was the student media,\" Khan said, \"So we tried our way to make it up to the front and document what was going on.\"\n\nDespite the closed campus, KCAL was somehow on campus and reported the events as they unfolded, Khan noted. \"I'm not sure how they got on campus,\" Khan said. He theorized that perhaps KCAL was allowed on campus by the LAPD when police arrived. KCAL did not immediately reply to requests for comment from TheWrap.\n\nThings had taken a turn on Saturday afternoon after the assistant director of the USC Village Residential Colleges, Nancy Alonzo, approached the student encampment. Alonzo read aloud from a letter and told the student group, which operated under the name Divest From Death, \"The encampment has to go down. As we have mentioned before, your encampment and acts of vandalism and the theft of university property violate policies and the law.\"\n\n\"These policies actually exist to protect the safety and security of every member of our community and we must enforce these policies consistently as we have always done,\" Alonzo continued. \"And then we also set up an alternative free speech area that's available to you all and you can move the encampment there.\"\n\nThe encampment continued as usual until Department of Public Safety officers arrived that evening and announced parts of the campus would close. The LAPD arrived at 4 a.m. The school announced the closure and subsequent reopening of campus on social media.\n\nStudent Corinne Smith reported that USC Director of Media Relations Emily Gersema allowed L.A. media on campus after it was closed overnight. Smith tweeted, \"USC Director of Media Relations Emily Gersema and her office let LA press into campus and into the LAPD police line & provided statements on the eviction, while USC student media was kettled and pushed out of view and denied any comment.\"\n\nGersema did not immediately reply to requests for comment from TheWrap.\n\nThe closure of campus and dismissal of student media has drawn condemnation online. Journalist Jeremy Lindenfeld retweeted Smith's words and added, \"The treatment of Annenberg Media and Daily Trojan journalists last night was absolutely unacceptable.

The operation was peaceful. Campus is opening, students are returning to prepare for finals, and commencement set-up is in full swing,\" USC President Carol Folt said in a statement released around midday Sunday.\n\n\"Over the last few weeks, the university exercised patience and restraint as we worked to de-escalate a volatile situation. We've spoken to the occupiers daily, issued repeated warnings, and offered opportunities and locations for them to protest lawfully. We've supported their right to express strong opinions and passions for their cause, as always,\" she continued.\n\n\"Yet when free speech protests devolve into illegal occupations, violating the rights of others, we must draw a line. ... We are in the critical period from the end-of-term quiet study week, through finals and our commencement ceremonies.\n\n\"Despite our efforts to de-escalate, the occupation was spiraling in a dangerous direction over the last several days. Areas of campus were blocked, people walking down Trousdale, our main thoroughfare, were harassed, and iconic Trojan symbols were defaced. In addition, university property was stolen, and commencement structures were dismantled. Residence halls, campus throughfares, and libraries had become places of confrontation. Some finals were disrupted with noise and chanting during mandated quiet periods. Yesterday afternoon, outside agitators jumped the perimeter fencing and assaulted our officers.\n\n\"This had to stop. With no resolution in sight, I requested the LAPD to assist DPS in removing the encampment as peacefully and safely as possible. At 4:10 a.m., an order to disperse was issued, providing the trespassers one last opportunity to leave voluntarily. In 64 minutes, the encampment was abandoned and cleared. The operation was peaceful with no arrests. We will not tolerate illegal encampments of any kind at USC.\"\n\nThe encampment had been rebuilt after previously being cleared on April 24.\n\nProtesters shouted \"Free Palestine\" at 4:17 a.m. Sunday, as officers began surrounding the encampment, according to Annenberg Media. Officers subsequently started to remove the banners hung by protesters, moving them to the side of the park.\n\nDuring this time USC officials alerted students that the campus was temporarily closed, but school officials later announced that it had re-opened to authorized personnel.\n\n\"The University Park Campus is now open to students, faculty, and staff upon presentation of valid identification,\" USC posted on social media at 10:37 a.m. Sunday. \"As an important reminder: tents and related equipment remain prohibited on campus and will be subject to immediate confiscation; camping and other non-permitted event(s).\"\n\nOn Thursday, USC implemented updated campus-entry procedures as it remained under a state of heightened security. The decision came a day after the school revealed plans for a \"Trojan Family Graduate Celebration\" at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum this Thursday, to replace the previously canceled main stage commencement ceremony amid the pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nUSC announced late Friday afternoon it was also pausing visitor registration because the \"campus is very busy with events and construction work to prepare for commencement,\" but existing visitor passes would be honored. Pre-registered guests must show a QR code available from the visitor.usc.edu website, as well as a government-issued ID.\n\nUniversity officials said all bags will be subject to search. People wearing masks will be asked to lower them briefly to verify identification, according to the university.\n\nThe USC campus had been relatively calm in the days prior to Sunday's clean-up operation.\n\nOn Wednesday, dozens of USC faculty members marched through the campus in support of protesters, calling in part for amnesty for those who were arrested on April 24. The march remained peaceful, with some students joining the faculty in the late-afternoon procession. It happened hours after a virtual meeting between members of the campus Academic Senate and Folt, who was joined by Provost Andrew Guzman.\n\nFolt wrote on social media Wednesday afternoon that the meeting was \"to explain our reasoning and answer their thoughtful and direct questions about our recent decisions.\n\nIn her letter, Folt wrote that \"the university has initiated disciplinary review processes for individuals who have violated both our policies and the law. We will take any further actions required to maintain campus safety and security, consistent with our legal obligations.\n\n\"The university is legally obligated to ensure that students, faculty, and staff can move freely throughout our campus while pursuing their studies, work, and research. Every part of our campuses, including Alumni Park, must be fully accessible and free from vandalism and harassment.\"\n\nAt least 12 student protesters received interim or full suspensions from the university, a media liaison from the \"Gaza Solidarity Occupation\" told the Daily Trojan, the campus newspaper, on Sunday evening.\n\nSeveral student protesters who are USC Housing residents were told they have until 5 p.m. Monday to pack their items and leave, a student protester who requested anonymity due to safety concerns, told the Daily Trojan.\n\nIn a statement Monday, USC officials said, \"We are unable to discuss disciplinary matters because of student privacy laws and the confidential nature of personnel matters.\"\n\nUSC became a focal point of Southland pro-Palestinian protests following its April 15 decision to cancel valedictorian Asna Tabassum's commencement speech in response to complaints about her online posts critics called antisemitic. USC officials insisted the move was solely a security issue, not a political decision.\n\nStill, tensions continued to mount -- leading to the mass protest April 24 and attempted occupation of Alumni Park that resulted in the 93 arrests and the clearing of the earlier encampment.\n\nThe university eventually opted to cancel its May 10 main stage commencement altogether, but vowed to move forward with the usual array of smaller satellite graduation ceremonies for the school's individual colleges.\n\nThose ceremonies are set to begin Wednesday.\n\nThe university announced last week that in lieu of the main stage commencement ceremony, a \"Trojan Family Graduate Celebration\" will be held at 8:30 p.m. Thursday at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, featuring \"drone shows, fireworks, surprise performances, the Trojan Marching Band and a special gift just for the Class of 2024.\"", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

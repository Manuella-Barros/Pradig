Allied Universal hereby amends the Tender Offer to purchase for cash up to $739,000,000 in aggregate consideration (exclusive of accrued and unpaid interest (the \"Accrued Interest\"), and as such aggregate consideration may be increased or decreased by Allied Universal, the \"Maximum Tender Amount\") of its outstanding Notes.\n\nThe Tender Offer is being made in connection with a concurrent offering by Allied Universal of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the \"Additional Notes\") to be issued as additional notes under the Indenture, dated as of February 16, 2024, among Allied Universal, the guarantors party thereto and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent, to be sold in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On May 8, 2024, Allied Universal priced such offering for $500.0 million of Additional Notes, which offering is expected to close on May 22, 2024, subject to customary conditions (the \"New Offering\"). In addition, on May 8, 2024, Allied Universal priced $1,100 million aggregate principal amount of incremental term loans, which it intends to incur under an amendment (the \"Bank Amendment\") to its existing US dollar-denominated term loan facility. The Tender Offer will be financed by the amounts raised in the New Offering (net of transaction fees and expenses), and a portion of the incremental term loans raised pursuant to the Bank Amendment, together with cash on hand. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, dated May 7, 2024, as amended by the terms set forth herein (the \"Offer to Purchase\"). The Tender Offer is also hereby amended to be conditioned on the closing of Bank Amendment, in addition to the other conditions to the Tender Offer, including the closing of the New Offering. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given to them in the Offer to Purchase.\n\nThe following table sets forth the Tender Offer Consideration, the Early Tender Payment and the Total Consideration for the Tender Offer:\n\nTitle of Note\n\nCUSIP /ISIN (144A)(1)\n\nCUSIP /ISIN (Reg S)(1)\n\nPrincipal Amount Outstanding\n\nMaximum Tender Amount (2)\n\nTender Offer Consideration (3)(4)\n\nEarly Tender Payment (4)(5)\n\nTotal Consideration (4)(6)\n\n6.625% Senior Secured Notes due 2026\n\n019576 AA5 / US019576AA51\n\nU0201T AA8 / USU0201TAA89\n\n$944,976,000\n\n$739,000,000\n\n$971.25\n\n$30.00\n\n$1,001.25\n\n(1) No representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of such CUSIP or ISIN numbers; such numbers are provided solely for the convenience of the Holders (as defined below).\n\n(2) Excludes Accrued Interest.\n\n(3) Per $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Expiration Date.\n\n(4) Excludes Accrued Interest, which will be paid in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Consideration, as applicable.\n\n(5) For each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date.\n\n(6) For each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date. Total Consideration includes the Early Tender Payment.\n\nThe Tender Offer will expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. New York City time, on June 4, 2024 unless extended or earlier terminated (such date and time, as it may be extended or earlier terminated, the \"Expiration Date\"). Registered holders (each, a \"Holder\" and collectively, the \"Holders\") of the Notes must validly tender their Notes at or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 20, 2024 (such date and time, as it may be extended or earlier terminated, the \"Early Tender Date\") in order to be eligible to receive the Early Tender Payment in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration.\n\nTenders of the Notes may be withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 20, 2024, unless extended or earlier terminated by Allied Universal, and not thereafter, except in certain limited circumstances where withdrawal rights are required by applicable law.\n\nSubject to the Maximum Tender Amount and the other terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, possible proration of the Notes on the Early Settlement Date or the Final Settlement Date will be determined in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer.\n\nIf the aggregate total purchase price payable (including the Early Tender Payment, but excluding Accrued Interest) for the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase by Allied Universal equals or exceeds the Maximum Tender Amount, then Holders who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Date will not have any such Notes accepted for payment (unless the terms of the Tender Offer are amended by Allied Universal in its sole and absolute discretion).\n\nIf on the Early Settlement Date or Final Settlement Date, as applicable, only a portion of the tendered Notes may be accepted for purchase, due to the consideration for the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date or the Expiration Date, as applicable, exceeding the Maximum Tender Amount (excluding Accrued Interest), then the aggregate principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase will be prorated (subject to adjustment to maintain the authorized denomination of the Notes) based upon the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and not yet accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer, such that the Maximum Tender Amount will not be exceeded. If the Tender Offer is not fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, Holders who validly tender Notes after the Early Tender Date may be subject to proration, whereas Holders who validly tender Notes at or prior to the Early Tender Date will not be subject to proration.\n\nThe Total Consideration includes the Early Tender Payment of $30.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which Early Tender Payment is in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration.\n\nSubject to purchase in accordance with the Maximum Tender Amount and possible proration, Holders validly tendering Notes that have not been validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date will be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration listed in the table above, which includes the Early Tender Payment, on the \"Early Settlement Date,\" which is expected to be May 22, 2024 (the second business day after the Early Tender Date), but that may change without notice. Holders validly tendering Notes after the Early Tender Date but at or prior to the Expiration Date will only be eligible to receive the \"Tender Offer Consideration\" listed in the table on the \"Final Settlement Date.\" The Final Settlement Date is expected to be June 6, 2024 (the second business day after the Expiration Date), but that may change without notice. In addition to the Total Consideration or Tender Offer Consideration, Holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date.\n\nThe obligation of Allied Universal to accept for purchase, and to pay for, Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer is subject to, and conditioned upon, the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, in the sole and absolute discretion of Allied Universal, including Allied Universal's completion of the New Offering and Bank Amendment, on terms satisfactory to Allied Universal, the proceeds of which New Offering (net of transaction fees and expenses), together with a portion of the incremental loans raised pursuant to Bank Amendment and cash on hand, will be used to finance its purchase of Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer. For avoidance of doubt, references in the Offer to Purchase to \"completion\" of the New Offering and Bank Amendment shall mean completion of the closing of the New Offering and Bank Amendment, as applicable, at which closing Allied Universal receives the anticipated proceeds from such financing. No assurance can be given that the New Offering and Bank Amendment will be completed on the terms currently envisioned or at all. If such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by Allied Universal), no payments will be made to tendering Holders on the Early Settlement Date or Final Settlement Date, as applicable. The Tender Offer is not conditioned on any minimum principal amount of Notes being tendered. The Tender Offer and its provisions may be amended, extended, terminated, waived or withdrawn by Allied Universal in its sole and absolute discretion.\n\nNone of Allied Universal, the trustee for the Notes, any paying agent, transfer agent or listing agent under the Notes, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as the dealer manager, the information and tender agent, any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or representatives makes any recommendation to Holders as to whether or not to tender all or any portion of their Notes, and none of the foregoing has authorized any person to make any such recommendation. Holders must decide whether to tender Notes, and if tendering, the amount of Notes to tender. Holders are urged to evaluate carefully all information in the Offer to Purchase, consult their own investment, legal and tax advisors and make their own decisions whether to tender Notes and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender.\n\nAll of the Notes are held in book-entry form. If you hold Notes through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee, you must contact such broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee if you wish to tender Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer. You should check with such broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee to determine whether they will charge you a fee for tendering Notes on your behalf. You should also confirm with the broker, dealer, bank, trust company or other nominee any deadlines by which you must provide your tender instructions, because the relevant deadline set by such nominee may be earlier than the deadlines set forth herein.\n\nAllied Universal has retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to serve as the sole dealer manager for the Tender Offer. Allied Universal has retained Global Bondholder Services Corporation to act as the information and tender agent in respect of the Tender Offer.\n\nThis press release amends the terms of the Offer to Purchase. To the extent that any terms in the Offer to Purchase are inconsistent with terms in this press release, the terms of this press release shall control. Other than as set forth herein, no other terms of the Tender Offer are being amended and there are no other changes to the terms of the Tender Offer set forth in the Offer to Purchase.\n\nFor additional information regarding the terms of the Tender Offer, please contact Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC at its telephone number set forth on the back cover page of the Offer to Purchase. Copies of the Offer to Purchase may be obtained at https://www.gbsc-usa.com/allieduniversal or by contacting Global Bondholder Services Corporation at (855) 654-2014 or by email at contact@gbsc-usa.com.\n\nThis press release does not constitute or form part of any offer or invitation to purchase or sell, or any solicitation of any offer to sell or purchase, the Notes or any other securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction, and neither this press release nor any part of it, nor the fact of its release, shall form the basis of, or be relied on or in connection with, any contract therefor. The Tender Offer is made only by and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Offer to Purchase and the information in this press release is qualified by reference to the Offer to Purchase.\n\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell any securities in any jurisdiction or in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful. In those jurisdictions where the securities, blue sky or other laws require the Tender Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Tender Offer will be deemed to be made by the dealer manager or one or more registered brokers or dealers licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.\n\nAbout Allied Universal\n\nThe world's leading security and facility services provider and trusted partner to more than 400 of the FORTUNE 500, Allied Universal\u00ae delivers unparalleled customer relationships, innovative solutions, cutting-edge smart technologies and tailored services that enable clients to focus on their core businesses.

In addition, on May 8, 2024, Allied Universal priced $1,100 million aggregate principal amount of incremental term loans, which it intends to incur under an amendment (the \"Bank Amendment\") to its existing US dollar-denominated term loan facility. The Tender Offer will be financed by the amounts raised in the New Offering (net of transaction fees and expenses), and a portion of the incremental term loans raised pursuant to the Bank Amendment, together with cash on hand. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, dated May 7, 2024, as amended by the terms set forth herein (the \"Offer to Purchase\"). The Tender Offer is also hereby amended to be conditioned on the closing of Bank Amendment, in addition to the other conditions to the Tender Offer, including the closing of the New Offering. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given to them in the Offer to Purchase.\n\nThe following table sets forth the Tender Offer Consideration, the Early Tender Payment and the Total Consideration for the Tender Offer:\n\n(1) No representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of such CUSIP or ISIN numbers; such numbers are provided solely for the convenience of the Holders (as defined below).\n\n(2) Excludes Accrued Interest.\n\n(3) Per $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Expiration Date.\n\n(4) Excludes Accrued Interest, which will be paid in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Consideration, as applicable.\n\n(5) For each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date.\n\n(6) For each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date. Total Consideration includes the Early Tender Payment.\n\nThe Tender Offer will expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. New York City time, on June 4, 2024 unless extended or earlier terminated (such date and time, as it may be extended or earlier terminated, the \"Expiration Date\"). Registered holders (each, a \"Holder\" and collectively, the \"Holders\") of the Notes must validly tender their Notes at or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 20, 2024 (such date and time, as it may be extended or earlier terminated, the \"Early Tender Date\") in order to be eligible to receive the Early Tender Payment in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration.\n\nTenders of the Notes may be withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 20, 2024, unless extended or earlier terminated by Allied Universal, and not thereafter, except in certain limited circumstances where withdrawal rights are required by applicable law.\n\nSubject to the Maximum Tender Amount and the other terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, possible proration of the Notes on the Early Settlement Date or the Final Settlement Date will be determined in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer.\n\nIf the aggregate total purchase price payable (including the Early Tender Payment, but excluding Accrued Interest) for the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase by Allied Universal equals or exceeds the Maximum Tender Amount, then Holders who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Date will not have any such Notes accepted for payment (unless the terms of the Tender Offer are amended by Allied Universal in its sole and absolute discretion).\n\nIf on the Early Settlement Date or Final Settlement Date, as applicable, only a portion of the tendered Notes may be accepted for purchase, due to the consideration for the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date or the Expiration Date, as applicable, exceeding the Maximum Tender Amount (excluding Accrued Interest), then the aggregate principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase will be prorated (subject to adjustment to maintain the authorized denomination of the Notes) based upon the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and not yet accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer, such that the Maximum Tender Amount will not be exceeded. If the Tender Offer is not fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, Holders who validly tender Notes after the Early Tender Date may be subject to proration, whereas Holders who validly tender Notes at or prior to the Early Tender Date will not be subject to proration.\n\nThe Total Consideration includes the Early Tender Payment of $30.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which Early Tender Payment is in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration.\n\nSubject to purchase in accordance with the Maximum Tender Amount and possible proration, Holders validly tendering Notes that have not been validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date will be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration listed in the table above, which includes the Early Tender Payment, on the \"Early Settlement Date,\" which is expected to be May 22, 2024 (the second business day after the Early Tender Date), but that may change without notice. Holders validly tendering Notes after the Early Tender Date but at or prior to the Expiration Date will only be eligible to receive the \"Tender Offer Consideration\" listed in the table on the \"Final Settlement Date.\" The Final Settlement Date is expected to be June 6, 2024 (the second business day after the Expiration Date), but that may change without notice. In addition to the Total Consideration or Tender Offer Consideration, Holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date.\n\nThe obligation of Allied Universal to accept for purchase, and to pay for, Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer is subject to, and conditioned upon, the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, in the sole and absolute discretion of Allied Universal, including Allied Universal's completion of the New Offering and Bank Amendment, on terms satisfactory to Allied Universal, the proceeds of which New Offering (net of transaction fees and expenses), together with a portion of the incremental loans raised pursuant to Bank Amendment and cash on hand, will be used to finance its purchase of Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer. For avoidance of doubt, references in the Offer to Purchase to \"completion\" of the New Offering and Bank Amendment shall mean completion of the closing of the New Offering and Bank Amendment, as applicable, at which closing Allied Universal receives the anticipated proceeds from such financing. No assurance can be given that the New Offering and Bank Amendment will be completed on the terms currently envisioned or at all. If such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by Allied Universal), no payments will be made to tendering Holders on the Early Settlement Date or Final Settlement Date, as applicable. The Tender Offer is not conditioned on any minimum principal amount of Notes being tendered. The Tender Offer and its provisions may be amended, extended, terminated, waived or withdrawn by Allied Universal in its sole and absolute discretion.\n\nNone of Allied Universal, the trustee for the Notes, any paying agent, transfer agent or listing agent under the Notes, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as the dealer manager, the information and tender agent, any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or representatives makes any recommendation to Holders as to whether or not to tender all or any portion of their Notes, and none of the foregoing has authorized any person to make any such recommendation. Holders must decide whether to tender Notes, and if tendering, the amount of Notes to tender. Holders are urged to evaluate carefully all information in the Offer to Purchase, consult their own investment, legal and tax advisors and make their own decisions whether to tender Notes and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender.\n\nAll of the Notes are held in book-entry form. If you hold Notes through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee, you must contact such broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee if you wish to tender Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer.

You should also confirm with the broker, dealer, bank, trust company or other nominee any deadlines by which you must provide your tender instructions, because the relevant deadline set by such nominee may be earlier than the deadlines set forth herein.\n\nAllied Universal has retained Morgan Stanley & Co.

Allied Universal hereby amends the Tender Offer to purchase for cash up to $739,000,000 in aggregate consideration (exclusive of accrued and unpaid interest (the \"Accrued Interest\"), and as such aggregate consideration may be increased or decreased by Allied Universal, the \"Maximum Tender Amount\") of its outstanding Notes.\n\nThe Tender Offer is being made in connection with a concurrent offering by Allied Universal of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2031 (the \"Additional Notes\") to be issued as additional notes under the Indenture, dated as of February 16, 2024, among Allied Universal, the guarantors party thereto and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee and collateral agent, to be sold in an offering exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On May 8, 2024, Allied Universal priced such offering for $500.0 million of Additional Notes, which offering is expected to close on May 22, 2024, subject to customary conditions (the \"New Offering\"). In addition, on May 8, 2024, Allied Universal priced $1,100 million aggregate principal amount of incremental term loans, which it intends to incur under an amendment (the \"Bank Amendment\") to its existing US dollar-denominated term loan facility. The Tender Offer will be financed by the amounts raised in the New Offering (net of transaction fees and expenses), and a portion of the incremental term loans raised pursuant to the Bank Amendment, together with cash on hand. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, dated May 7, 2024, as amended by the terms set forth herein (the \"Offer to Purchase\"). The Tender Offer is also hereby amended to be conditioned on the closing of Bank Amendment, in addition to the other conditions to the Tender Offer, including the closing of the New Offering. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given to them in the Offer to Purchase.\n\nThe following table sets forth the Tender Offer Consideration, the Early Tender Payment and the Total Consideration for the Tender Offer:\n\n(1) No representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of such CUSIP or ISIN numbers; such numbers are provided solely for the convenience of the Holders (as defined below).\n\n(2) Excludes Accrued Interest.\n\n(3) Per $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Expiration Date.\n\n(4) Excludes Accrued Interest, which will be paid in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Consideration, as applicable.\n\n(5) For each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date.\n\n(6) For each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date. Total Consideration includes the Early Tender Payment.\n\nThe Tender Offer will expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. New York City time, on June 4, 2024 unless extended or earlier terminated (such date and time, as it may be extended or earlier terminated, the \"Expiration Date\"). Registered holders (each, a \"Holder\" and collectively, the \"Holders\") of the Notes must validly tender their Notes at or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 20, 2024 (such date and time, as it may be extended or earlier terminated, the \"Early Tender Date\") in order to be eligible to receive the Early Tender Payment in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration.\n\nTenders of the Notes may be withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 20, 2024, unless extended or earlier terminated by Allied Universal, and not thereafter, except in certain limited circumstances where withdrawal rights are required by applicable law.\n\nSubject to the Maximum Tender Amount and the other terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, possible proration of the Notes on the Early Settlement Date or the Final Settlement Date will be determined in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer.\n\nIf the aggregate total purchase price payable (including the Early Tender Payment, but excluding Accrued Interest) for the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase by Allied Universal equals or exceeds the Maximum Tender Amount, then Holders who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Date will not have any such Notes accepted for payment (unless the terms of the Tender Offer are amended by Allied Universal in its sole and absolute discretion).\n\nIf on the Early Settlement Date or Final Settlement Date, as applicable, only a portion of the tendered Notes may be accepted for purchase, due to the consideration for the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date or the Expiration Date, as applicable, exceeding the Maximum Tender Amount (excluding Accrued Interest), then the aggregate principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase will be prorated (subject to adjustment to maintain the authorized denomination of the Notes) based upon the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and not yet accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer, such that the Maximum Tender Amount will not be exceeded. If the Tender Offer is not fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, Holders who validly tender Notes after the Early Tender Date may be subject to proration, whereas Holders who validly tender Notes at or prior to the Early Tender Date will not be subject to proration.\n\nThe Total Consideration includes the Early Tender Payment of $30.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which Early Tender Payment is in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration.\n\nSubject to purchase in accordance with the Maximum Tender Amount and possible proration, Holders validly tendering Notes that have not been validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date will be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration listed in the table above, which includes the Early Tender Payment, on the \"Early Settlement Date,\" which is expected to be May 22, 2024 (the second business day after the Early Tender Date), but that may change without notice. Holders validly tendering Notes after the Early Tender Date but at or prior to the Expiration Date will only be eligible to receive the \"Tender Offer Consideration\" listed in the table on the \"Final Settlement Date.\" The Final Settlement Date is expected to be June 6, 2024 (the second business day after the Expiration Date), but that may change without notice. In addition to the Total Consideration or Tender Offer Consideration, Holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date.\n\nThe obligation of Allied Universal to accept for purchase, and to pay for, Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer is subject to, and conditioned upon, the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, in the sole and absolute discretion of Allied Universal, including Allied Universal's completion of the New Offering and Bank Amendment, on terms satisfactory to Allied Universal, the proceeds of which New Offering (net of transaction fees and expenses), together with a portion of the incremental loans raised pursuant to Bank Amendment and cash on hand, will be used to finance its purchase of Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer. For avoidance of doubt, references in the Offer to Purchase to \"completion\" of the New Offering and Bank Amendment shall mean completion of the closing of the New Offering and Bank Amendment, as applicable, at which closing Allied Universal receives the anticipated proceeds from such financing. No assurance can be given that the New Offering and Bank Amendment will be completed on the terms currently envisioned or at all. If such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by Allied Universal), no payments will be made to tendering Holders on the Early Settlement Date or Final Settlement Date, as applicable. The Tender Offer is not conditioned on any minimum principal amount of Notes being tendered. The Tender Offer and its provisions may be amended, extended, terminated, waived or withdrawn by Allied Universal in its sole and absolute discretion.\n\nNone of Allied Universal, the trustee for the Notes, any paying agent, transfer agent or listing agent under the Notes, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as the dealer manager, the information and tender agent, any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or representatives makes any recommendation to Holders as to whether or not to tender all or any portion of their Notes, and none of the foregoing has authorized any person to make any such recommendation. Holders must decide whether to tender Notes, and if tendering, the amount of Notes to tender. Holders are urged to evaluate carefully all information in the Offer to Purchase, consult their own investment, legal and tax advisors and make their own decisions whether to tender Notes and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender.\n\nAll of the Notes are held in book-entry form. If you hold Notes through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee, you must contact such broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee if you wish to tender Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer. You should check with such broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee to determine whether they will charge you a fee for tendering Notes on your behalf. You should also confirm with the broker, dealer, bank, trust company or other nominee any deadlines by which you must provide your tender instructions, because the relevant deadline set by such nominee may be earlier than the deadlines set forth herein.\n\nAllied Universal has retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to serve as the sole dealer manager for the Tender Offer. Allied Universal has retained Global Bondholder Services Corporation to act as the information and tender agent in respect of the Tender Offer.\n\nThis press release amends the terms of the Offer to Purchase. To the extent that any terms in the Offer to Purchase are inconsistent with terms in this press release, the terms of this press release shall control. Other than as set forth herein, no other terms of the Tender Offer are being amended and there are no other changes to the terms of the Tender Offer set forth in the Offer to Purchase.\n\nFor additional information regarding the terms of the Tender Offer, please contact Morgan Stanley & Co.

Capitalized terms used in this press release and not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Offer to Purchase.\n\nThe Tender Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on June 7, 2024, unless extended or earlier terminated as described in the Offer to Purchase (such time and date, as the same may be extended, the \"Expiration Time\").

The Tender Offer is being made in connection with a concurrent offering of notes by Allied Universal to be sold in an offering (the \"New Offering\") exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Tender Offer will be financed by the amounts raised in the New Offering (net of transaction fees and expenses), together with cash on hand. The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase, dated May 7, 2024 (the \"Offer to Purchase\").\n\nThe following table sets forth the Tender Offer Consideration, the Early Tender Payment and the Total Consideration (each, as defined herein) for the Tender Offer:\n\n(1) No representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of such CUSIP or ISIN numbers; such numbers are provided solely for the convenience of the Holders (as defined below).\n\n(2) Per $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Expiration Date (as defined herein).\n\n(3) Excludes accrued and unpaid interest (\"Accrued Interest\"), which will be paid in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration or the Total Consideration, as applicable.\n\n(4) For each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date (as defined herein).\n\n(5) For each $1,000 principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date. Total Consideration includes the Early Tender Payment.\n\nThe Tender Offer will expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. New York City time, on June 4, 2024 unless extended or earlier terminated (such date and time, as it may be extended or earlier terminated, the \"Expiration Date\"). Registered holders (each, a \"Holder\" and collectively, the \"Holders\") of the Notes must validly tender their Notes at or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 20, 2024 (such date and time, as it may be extended or earlier terminated, the \"Early Tender Date\") in order to be eligible to receive the Early Tender Payment in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration.\n\nTenders of the Notes may be withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 20, 2024, unless extended or earlier terminated by Allied Universal, and not thereafter, except in certain limited circumstances where withdrawal rights are required by applicable law.\n\nSubject to the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount and the other terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, possible proration of the Notes on the Early Settlement Date or the Final Settlement Date will be determined in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer.\n\nIf the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase by Allied Universal equals or exceeds the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount, then Holders who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Date will not have any such Notes accepted for payment (unless the terms of the Tender Offer are amended by Allied Universal in its sole and absolute discretion).\n\nIf on the Early Settlement Date or Final Settlement Date (each, as defined herein), as applicable, only a portion of the tendered Notes may be accepted for purchase, due to the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date or the Expiration Date, as applicable, exceeding the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount, then the aggregate principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase will be prorated (subject to adjustment to maintain the authorized denomination of the Notes) based upon the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and not yet accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer, such that the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount will not be exceeded. If the Tender Offer is not fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, Holders who validly tender Notes after the Early Tender Date may be subject to proration, whereas Holders who validly tender Notes at or prior to the Early Tender Date will not be subject to proration.\n\nThe Total Consideration includes an early tender payment (the \"Early Tender Payment\") of $30.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which Early Tender Payment is in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration.\n\nSubject to purchase in accordance with the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount and possible proration, Holders validly tendering Notes that have not been validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date will be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration listed in the table above, which includes the Early Tender Payment, on the \"Early Settlement Date,\" which is expected to be May 22, 2024 (the second business day after the Early Tender Date), but that may change without notice. Holders validly tendering Notes after the Early Tender Date but at or prior to the Expiration Date will only be eligible to receive the \"Tender Offer Consideration\" listed in the table on the \"Final Settlement Date.\" The Final Settlement Date is expected to be June 6, 2024 (the second business day after the Expiration Date), but that may change without notice. In addition to the Total Consideration or Tender Offer Consideration, Holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date.\n\nThe obligation of Allied Universal to accept for purchase, and to pay for, Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer is subject to, and conditioned upon, the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, in the sole and absolute discretion of Allied Universal, including Allied Universal's completion of the New Offering, on terms satisfactory to Allied Universal, the proceeds of which New Offering (net of transaction fees and expenses), together with cash on hand, will be used to finance its purchase of Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer. For avoidance of doubt, references in the Offer to Purchase to \"completion\" of the New Offering mean completion of the closing under such New Offering at which closing Allied Universal receives the anticipated proceeds from the New Offering. No assurance can be given that the New Offering will be completed on the terms currently envisioned or at all. If such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by Allied Universal), no payments will be made to tendering Holders on the Early Settlement Date or Final Settlement Date, as applicable. The Tender Offer is not conditioned on any minimum principal amount of Notes being tendered. The Tender Offer and its provisions may be amended, extended, terminated, waived or withdrawn by Allied Universal in its sole and absolute discretion.\n\nNone of Allied Universal, the trustee for the Notes, any paying agent, transfer agent or listing agent under the Notes, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as the dealer manager, the information and tender agent, any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or representatives makes any recommendation to Holders as to whether or not to tender all or any portion of their Notes, and none of the foregoing has authorized any person to make any such recommendation. Holders must decide whether to tender Notes, and if tendering, the amount of Notes to tender. Holders are urged to evaluate carefully all information in the Offer to Purchase, consult their own investment, legal and tax advisors and make their own decisions whether to tender Notes and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender.\n\nAll of the Notes are held in book-entry form. If you hold Notes through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee, you must contact such broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee if you wish to tender Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer. You should check with such broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee to determine whether they will charge you a fee for tendering Notes on your behalf. You should also confirm with the broker, dealer, bank, trust company or other nominee any deadlines by which you must provide your tender instructions, because the relevant deadline set by such nominee may be earlier than the deadlines set forth herein.\n\nAllied Universal has retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to serve as the sole dealer manager for the Tender Offer. Allied Universal has retained Global Bondholder Services Corporation to act as the information and tender agent in respect of the Tender Offer.\n\nFor additional information regarding the terms of the Tender Offer, please contact Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC at its telephone number set forth on the back cover page of the Offer to Purchase. Copies of the Offer to Purchase may be obtained at https://www.gbsc-usa.com/allieduniversal or by contacting Global Bondholder Services Corporation at (855) 654-2014 or by email at contact@gbsc-usa.com.\n\nThis press release does not constitute or form part of any offer or invitation to purchase or sell, or any solicitation of any offer to sell or purchase, the Notes or any other securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction, and neither this press release nor any part of it, nor the fact of its release, shall form the basis of, or be relied on or in connection with, any contract therefor. The Tender Offer is made only by and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Offer to Purchase and the information in this press release is qualified by reference to the Offer to Purchase.\n\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell any securities in any jurisdiction or in any circumstances in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful. In those jurisdictions where the securities, blue sky or other laws require the Tender Offer to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, the Tender Offer will be deemed to be made by the dealer manager or one or more registered brokers or dealers licensed under the laws of such jurisdiction.\n\nAbout Allied Universal\n\nThe world's leading security and facility services provider and trusted partner to more than 400 of the FORTUNE 500, Allied Universal\u00ae delivers unparalleled customer relationships, innovative solutions, cutting-edge smart technologies and tailored services that enable clients to focus on their core businesses.

Total Consideration includes the Early Tender Payment.\n\nThe Tender Offer will expire at one minute after 11:59 p.m. New York City time, on June 4, 2024 unless extended or earlier terminated (such date and time, as it may be extended or earlier terminated, the \"Expiration Date\"). Registered holders (each, a \"Holder\" and collectively, the \"Holders\") of the Notes must validly tender their Notes at or before 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 20, 2024 (such date and time, as it may be extended or earlier terminated, the \"Early Tender Date\") in order to be eligible to receive the Early Tender Payment in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration.\n\nTenders of the Notes may be withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on May 20, 2024, unless extended or earlier terminated by Allied Universal, and not thereafter, except in certain limited circumstances where withdrawal rights are required by applicable law.\n\nSubject to the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount and the other terms and conditions of the Tender Offer, possible proration of the Notes on the Early Settlement Date or the Final Settlement Date will be determined in accordance with the terms of the Tender Offer.\n\nIf the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date and accepted for purchase by Allied Universal equals or exceeds the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount, then Holders who validly tender their Notes after the Early Tender Date will not have any such Notes accepted for payment (unless the terms of the Tender Offer are amended by Allied Universal in its sole and absolute discretion).\n\nIf on the Early Settlement Date or Final Settlement Date (each, as defined herein), as applicable, only a portion of the tendered Notes may be accepted for purchase, due to the aggregate principal amount of Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date or the Expiration Date, as applicable, exceeding the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount, then the aggregate principal amount of Notes accepted for purchase will be prorated (subject to adjustment to maintain the authorized denomination of the Notes) based upon the aggregate principal amount of Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and not yet accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer, such that the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount will not be exceeded. If the Tender Offer is not fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Date, Holders who validly tender Notes after the Early Tender Date may be subject to proration, whereas Holders who validly tender Notes at or prior to the Early Tender Date will not be subject to proration.\n\nThe Total Consideration includes an early tender payment (the \"Early Tender Payment\") of $30.00 for each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which Early Tender Payment is in addition to the Tender Offer Consideration.\n\nSubject to purchase in accordance with the Aggregate Maximum Principal Amount and possible proration, Holders validly tendering Notes that have not been validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Date will be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration listed in the table above, which includes the Early Tender Payment, on the \"Early Settlement Date,\" which is expected to be May 22, 2024 (the second business day after the Early Tender Date), but that may change without notice. Holders validly tendering Notes after the Early Tender Date but at or prior to the Expiration Date will only be eligible to receive the \"Tender Offer Consideration\" listed in the table on the \"Final Settlement Date.\" The Final Settlement Date is expected to be June 6, 2024 (the second business day after the Expiration Date), but that may change without notice. In addition to the Total Consideration or Tender Offer Consideration, Holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase will also receive Accrued Interest from the last interest payment date up to, but not including, the applicable settlement date.\n\nThe obligation of Allied Universal to accept for purchase, and to pay for, Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Tender Offer is subject to, and conditioned upon, the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, in the sole and absolute discretion of Allied Universal, including Allied Universal's completion of the New Offering, on terms satisfactory to Allied Universal, the proceeds of which New Offering (net of transaction fees and expenses), together with cash on hand, will be used to finance its purchase of Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer. For avoidance of doubt, references in the Offer to Purchase to \"completion\" of the New Offering mean completion of the closing under such New Offering at which closing Allied Universal receives the anticipated proceeds from the New Offering. No assurance can be given that the New Offering will be completed on the terms currently envisioned or at all. If such conditions shall not have been satisfied (or waived by Allied Universal), no payments will be made to tendering Holders on the Early Settlement Date or Final Settlement Date, as applicable. The Tender Offer is not conditioned on any minimum principal amount of Notes being tendered. The Tender Offer and its provisions may be amended, extended, terminated, waived or withdrawn by Allied Universal in its sole and absolute discretion.\n\nNone of Allied Universal, the trustee for the Notes, any paying agent, transfer agent or listing agent under the Notes, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, as the dealer manager, the information and tender agent, any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates or any of their respective directors, officers, employees or representatives makes any recommendation to Holders as to whether or not to tender all or any portion of their Notes, and none of the foregoing has authorized any person to make any such recommendation. Holders must decide whether to tender Notes, and if tendering, the amount of Notes to tender. Holders are urged to evaluate carefully all information in the Offer to Purchase, consult their own investment, legal and tax advisors and make their own decisions whether to tender Notes and, if so, the principal amount of Notes to tender.\n\nAll of the Notes are held in book-entry form. If you hold Notes through a broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee, you must contact such broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee if you wish to tender Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer. You should check with such broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company or other nominee to determine whether they will charge you a fee for tendering Notes on your behalf. You should also confirm with the broker, dealer, bank, trust company or other nominee any deadlines by which you must provide your tender instructions, because the relevant deadline set by such nominee may be earlier than the deadlines set forth herein.\n\nAllied Universal has retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to serve as the sole dealer manager for the Tender Offer. Allied Universal has retained Global Bondholder Services Corporation to act as the information and tender agent in respect of the Tender Offer.\n\nFor additional information regarding the terms of the Tender Offer, please contact Morgan Stanley & Co.

The launch of the Offers (as defined below) is expected to be at or around 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on May 8, 2024 (the 'Launch Date'). The Offer Documents will be available from 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Launch Date at the following link: https://www.gbsc-usa.com/hsbc/.\n\nWe refer to the outstanding notes listed in the table below collectively as the 'Notes' and separately as a 'series' of Notes. We refer to each offer to purchase a series of Notes as an 'Offer', and collectively as the 'Offers'. The Offers are made upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated May 8, 2024, relating to the Notes (the 'Offer to Purchase') and the related notice of guaranteed delivery (the 'Notice of Guaranteed Delivery', and together with the Offer to Purchase, the 'Offer Documents'). As of the date of the Offer to Purchase, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Notes subject to the Offers is $10,000,000,000. References to '$' are to U.S. dollars.\n\nThe Offers are being undertaken to proactively manage the Company's outstanding debt portfolio.\n\nEach Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on May 14, 2024, unless extended or earlier terminated by the Company in its sole discretion (such date and time with respect to an Offer, as the same may be extended, the 'Expiration Time'). Notes tendered for purchase may be validly withdrawn at any time at or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on May 14, 2024 (such date and time with respect to an Offer, as the same may be extended, the 'Withdrawal Date'), but not thereafter, unless extended or earlier terminated with respect to an Offer by the Company in its sole discretion. We expect the Settlement Date to occur on May 17, 2024, unless extended or earlier terminated in respect of an Offer by the Company in its sole discretion (such date and time with respect to an Offer, as the same may be extended, the 'Settlement Date').\n\nEach Offer is independent of the other Offers, and we may terminate, modify or waive the conditions of any Offer without terminating, modifying or waiving the conditions of any other Offer.\n\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer Documents, holders who (i) validly tender Notes at or prior to the Expiration Time or (ii) validly tender Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on May 16, 2024 (such date and time with respect to an Offer, as the same may be extended, the 'Guaranteed Delivery Date') pursuant to the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures (as defined in the Offer to Purchase), and whose Notes are accepted for purchase by us, will receive consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of each series of Notes, which will be payable in cash on the Settlement Date as described below (the 'Consideration').\n\nThe Consideration applicable to each series of Notes validly tendered and accepted by us pursuant to the Offers will be calculated at or around 11:00 a.m. (New York City Time) on May 14, 2024 (such date and time with respect to an Offer, as the same may be extended by the Company in its sole discretion, the 'Price Determination Date'), in accordance with the formula set forth in the Offer to Purchase and with standard market practice, using the applicable 'Offer Yield', which will be equal to the sum of:\n\nAccordingly, the Consideration payable by us for each $1,000 principal amount of each series of Notes accepted by us will equal:\n\nsuch total amount being rounded to the nearest cent per $1,000 principal amount of such Notes, and the above calculation being made in accordance with standard market practice as described by the formula set forth in the Offer to Purchase.\n\nThe 'Bloomberg Reference Page' means the page on Bloomberg from which the Dealer Manager will observe the bid-side yield of the Reference Security for each series of Notes, which is expected to be PX1 (or any other recognized quotation source selected by us in consultation with the Dealer Manager if such quotation source is not available or manifestly erroneous).\n\nAs soon as reasonably practicable after the Price Determination Date, the Company will issue a press release specifying the Consideration for each series of Notes validly tendered and accepted.\n\nIn addition to the Consideration, holders whose Notes of a given series are accepted for purchase will also be paid a cash amount equal to accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes from, and including, the last interest payment date for such Notes to, but not including, the Settlement Date, rounded to the nearest cent (such amount in respect of a series of Notes, 'Accrued Interest'). Accrued Interest will be payable on the Settlement Date. For the avoidance of doubt, interest will cease to accrue on the Settlement Date for all Notes accepted in the Offers. Under no circumstances will any interest be payable to holders because of any delay on the part of Global Bondholder Services Corporation, as depositary, The Depository Trust Company ('DTC') or any other party in the transmission of funds to holders.\n\nIt is expected that the Offers will be financed with cash on hand.\n\nOn the date of the Offer to Purchase, the Company expects to launch a proposed new issuance (the 'Proposed Issuance') of senior unsecured debt securities in two series (the 'New Notes') which are not subject to the Offers. No assurance can be given that the Proposed Issuance will be completed.\n\nThe Offers are subject to the terms and conditions described in the Offer Documents. In particular, the Company's obligation to complete an Offer with respect to a particular series of Notes is conditioned on satisfaction of the 'Maximum Tender Amount Condition', meaning that the sum of (a) the Consideration (excluding Accrued Interest) for all validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes of such series plus (b) the aggregate Consideration (excluding Accrued Interest) for all validly tendered and not validly withdrawn Notes of each series having a higher Acceptance Priority Level (as specified in the above table, with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 4 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level), other than Excluded Notes (as defined below), does not exceed $5,000,000,000 (the 'Maximum Tender Amount'). Our obligation to complete the Offers is also conditioned on the successful completion, on terms and conditions satisfactory to us in our sole discretion, of the Proposed Issuance (the 'New Issue Condition').\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision in the Offer to Purchase to the contrary, if the Maximum Tender Amount Condition is not satisfied for a particular series of Notes, at any time at or prior to the Expiration Time, then (1) we will not be obligated to accept for purchase such series of Notes and will terminate the Offer with respect to such series of Notes (such series of Notes, 'Excluded Notes'), and (2) if there is any series of Notes having a lower Acceptance Priority Level for which the Maximum Tender Amount Condition is satisfied, meaning the Maximum Tender Amount is equal to or greater than the sum of:\n\nthen all Notes of such series having a lower Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted for purchase, and the Maximum Tender Amount Condition will be applied at each subsequent Acceptance Priority Level until there is no series of Notes with a lower Acceptance Priority Level to be considered for purchase for which the Maximum Tender Amount Condition is met.\n\nIt is possible that any series of Notes with an Acceptance Priority Level greater than 1 will fail to meet the Maximum Tender Amount Condition and therefore will not be accepted for purchase even if one or more series with a lower Acceptance Priority Level is accepted for purchase. If any series of Notes is accepted for purchase under the Offers, all Notes of that series that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn will be accepted for purchase. As a result, no series of Notes accepted for purchase will be prorated.\n\nThe Company reserves the right to amend or waive any of the conditions of the Offers, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, in our sole discretion, subject to applicable law. If any of the conditions are not satisfied at the Expiration Time with respect to an Offer, we may, in our sole discretion and without giving any notice, subject to applicable law, (a) terminate such Offer, (b) extend such Offer, on the same or amended terms, and thereby delay acceptance of any validly tendered Notes, or (c) continue to accept tenders.\n\nWe will, in connection with the allocation of the New Notes in the Proposed Issuance, consider among other factors whether or not the relevant investor seeking an allocation of the New Notes has, prior to such allocation, validly tendered or given a firm intention to us or the Dealer Manager that they intend to tender their Notes pursuant to the Offers and, if so, the aggregate principal amount of Notes tendered or intended to be tendered by such investor.\n\nTherefore, a holder who wishes to subscribe for New Notes in addition to tendering its Notes for purchase pursuant to the Offers may be eligible to receive, at the sole and absolute discretion of the Company, priority in the allocation of the New Notes, subject to the issue of the New Notes and such holder also making a separate application for the purchase of such New Notes to the managing bookrunner of the issue of the New Notes in accordance with the standard new issue procedures of such bookrunner. However, we are not obliged to allocate the New Notes to a holder who has validly tendered or indicated a firm intention to tender Notes pursuant to the Offers and, if New Notes are allocated, the principal amount thereof may be less or more than the principal amount of Notes tendered by such holder and accepted by us pursuant to the Offers.\n\nAll Notes accepted in the Offers will be cancelled and retired, and will no longer remain outstanding obligations of the Company. Holders of Notes are advised to read carefully the Offer to Purchase, including the 'Risk Factors' section, for full details of and information on the procedures for participating in the Offers.\n\nThe Company has retained HSBC Bank plc as Dealer Manager for the Offers (the 'Dealer Manager').

Global Bonds\" and, together with the New UI Global Bonds, the \"New Bonds\") in an amount, with pricing and on terms and conditions acceptable to Uruguay in its sole discretion, with pricing terms expected to be announced at or around 4:00 p.m., New York time on Wednesday, May 8, 2024 (the \"New Bonds Offering\").\n\nThe Global Tender Offer will commence at or around 8:00 a.m., New York time, on Wednesday, May 8, 2024 and, unless extended or earlier terminated, expire at (i) 12:00 noon, New York time, on Wednesday, May 8, 2024 for non-preferred tenders (the \"Non-Preferred Tender Period\"), and (ii) 2:00 p.m., New York time, on Wednesday, May 8, 2024 for preferred tenders (the \"Preferred Tender Period\"). The settlement of the Global Tender Offer is scheduled to occur on Tuesday, May 14, 2024 (the \"Global Tender Offer Settlement Date\"). The purchase price to be paid per Ps. 1,000 nominal principal amount of each series of Old Global Bonds tendered and accepted pursuant to the Global Tender Offer will be equal to the fixed price indicated in the table below (the \"Purchase Price\"). Holders whose Old Global Bonds are accepted in the Global Tender Offer will also receive any accrued and unpaid interest from, and including, the last interest payment date for such Old Global Bonds up to, but excluding, the Global Tender Offer Settlement Date (the \"Accrued Interest\"). Accrued Interest for Preferred and Non-Preferred Tender Orders will be payable in cash.\n\nThe Purchase Price and Accrued Interest of the Old Global Bonds shall be converted into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of Ps. 38.516 to US$1.00.\n\nIn addition, investors will receive Accrued Interest, as described above.\n\nThe nominal principal amount of Old Global Bonds validly tendered and accepted will be adjusted by a factor (the \"Adjustment UI Factor\") to reflect the increase of the UI index from the issuance date of the Old Global Bonds to the Global Tender Offer Settlement Date, which is expected to be Tuesday, May 14, 2024. As of the expected Global Tender Offer Settlement Date, (i) the Adjustment UI Factor for the 2027 UI Bonds would be 3.6647, which is the ratio of 6.0104, the value of the UI index at the Global Tender Offer Settlement Date, over 1.6401, the value of the UI index at the time of the issuance of the 2027 UI Bonds and (ii) the Adjustment UI Factor for the 2028 UI Bonds would be 2.5995, which is the ratio of 6.0104, the value of the UI index at the Global Tender Offer Settlement Date, over 2.3121, the value of the UI index at the time of the issuance of the 2028 UI Bonds.\n\nThe principal amount of the 2027 UI Bonds outstanding, as adjusted by the Adjustment UI Factor is Ps. 36,333,818,403.\n\nThe principal amount of the 2028 UI Bonds outstanding, as adjusted by the Adjustment UI Factor is Ps. 85,389,130,752.\n\nTender Orders (as defined below) made by holders of any series of Old Global Bonds who have submitted a corresponding Indication of Interest (as defined in the Global Offer to Purchase) for the New UI Global Bonds prior to the New Bonds Pricing Time (as defined in the Global Offer to Purchase) will be accepted before any other Tender Orders of such series of Old Global Bonds.\n\nDuring the Non-Preferred Tender Period or Preferred Tender Period, as applicable, a holder of Old Global Bonds may place orders to tender Old Global Bonds (\"Tender Orders\") only through one of the Dealer Managers (as defined below). Holders will NOT be able to submit tenders through Euroclear Bank SA/NV (\"Euroclear\"), Clearstream Banking, soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme (\"Clearstream\") or the Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\") systems. If a holder does not have an account with a Dealer Manager, such holder may place a tender offer through any broker, dealer, commercial bank, trust company, other financial institution or other custodian that it customarily uses that has an account with a Dealer Manager. Your broker must contact one of the Dealer Managers to submit a Tender Order on your behalf.\n\nHSBC Securities (USA) Inc., as the billing and delivery bank for the Global Tender Offer (in such capacity, the \"Billing and Delivery Bank\"), will consolidate all Tender Orders and, upon instruction of Uruguay, accept Old Global Bonds for purchase pursuant to the Global Tender Offer, subject to proration as described in the Global Offer to Purchase, at or around 8:00 a.m., New York time, on Thursday, May 9, 2024 or as soon as possible thereafter.\n\nThe Global Tender Offer is subject to Uruguay's right, at its sole discretion and subject to applicable law, to instruct the Billing and Delivery Bank to extend, terminate, withdraw, or amend the Global Tender Offer at any time. Each of Uruguay and the Billing and Delivery Bank reserves the right, in the sole discretion of each of them, not to accept any Tender Orders for any reason.

If you hold Old Global Bonds through DTC, they must be delivered to the Billing and Delivery Bank for settlement no later than 3:00 p.m., New York time, on the Global Tender Offer Settlement Date. If you hold Old Global Bonds through Euroclear or Clearstream, the latest process you can use to deliver your Old Global Bonds to the Billing and Delivery Bank is the overnight process, one day prior to the Global Tender Offer Settlement Date; you may not use the optional daylight process. Failure to deliver Old Global Bonds on time may result (i) in the cancellation of your tender and in you becoming liable for any damages resulting from that failure, (ii) in the case of Preferred Tenders (a) in the cancellation of any allocation of New UI Global Bonds in the New Bonds Offering in respect of your related Indication of Interest and/or (b) in the cancellation of your tender and in your remaining obligation to purchase your allocation of New UI Global Bonds in respect of your related Indication of Interest and/or (iii) in the delivery of a buy-in notice for the purchase of such Old Global Bonds, executed in accordance with customary brokerage practices for corporate fixed income securities. Any holder whose tender is cancelled will not receive the Purchase Price or Accrued Interest. Holders will not have withdrawal rights with respect to any tenders of Old Global Bonds in the Global Tender Offer. Old Global Bonds accepted for purchase will be settled on a delivery versus payment basis with the Billing and Delivery Bank on the Global Tender Offer Settlement Date in accordance with customary brokerage practices for corporate fixed income securities.\n\nAll Old Global Bonds that are tendered pursuant to Tender Orders placed through a Dealer Manager and accepted will be purchased by the Billing and Delivery Bank in such amounts as Uruguay shall determine and subject to the terms and conditions of the Global Offer to Purchase.

Uruguay will not be liable under any circumstances for any payment of the Purchase Price and Accrued Interest to the holders of Old Global Bonds tendered in the Global Tender Offer. The Billing and Delivery Bank shall not be liable for payments to any holder of Old Global Bonds validly tendered and accepted for purchase if such holder fails to deliver such Old Global Bonds at or prior to the deadlines ahead of the settlement of the Global Tender Offer as described in the Global Offer to Purchase.\n\nThe Global Offer to Purchase may be downloaded from the Information Agent's website at https://projects.morrowsodali.com/uruguay or obtained from the Information Agent, Morrow Sodali International LLC (Email: [email protected], Telephone: +1 203 658 9457 / +44 20 4513 6933), or from any of the Dealer Managers.\n\nThe Dealer Managers for the Global Tender Offer are:\n\nQuestions regarding the Global Tender Offer may be directed to the Dealer Managers at the above contact.\n\nLocal Tender Offer\n\nThe Local Tender Offer is conditioned upon (i) the allocation of the New Bonds Offering, in an amount, at prices and on terms acceptable to Uruguay in its sole discretion and (ii) the New Bonds Offering not being terminated prior to the settlement of the Local Tender Offer.\n\nOnly those individuals and/or legal entities that participate in the New Bonds Offering, and for up to the amount of New UI Global Bonds and/or New Ps.

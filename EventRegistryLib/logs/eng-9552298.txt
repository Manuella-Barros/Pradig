Qijiguang is smaller but is China's technologically most advanced military training vessel.\n\nChina did not say where the vessels will be based while in Cambodia and East Timor.\n\nBut the visit of the Chinese ships could further fuel U.S. concerns about the presence of Chinese warships at Cambodia's Ream Naval Base, whose recent expansion has been backed by China.\n\nCambodia's decision to allow China to develop Ream, located at a key waterway on the coast of the Gulf of Thailand in Cambodia's Sihanoukville province, has upset Washington worried that it will give Beijing a new outpost near the contested South China Sea, most of which are claimed by China.\n\nBefore a China-funded upgrade began in June 2022, Ream had been the site of some joint naval training and exercises between the United States and Cambodia. Cambodia demolished the U.S.-built facility in October 2020.\n\nAnother two Chinese warships, likely corvettes or frigates, have been docked at Ream since December. Cambodia's defence ministry insisted on Wednesday that their presence does not constitute a permanent deployment of the Chinese military in the country.\n\nChina has been boosting its \"ironclad\" friendship with the Southeastern Asian country, amid high-level state and military leader exchanges since last year.\n\nChinese Defence Minister Dong Jun in March met with Deputy Commander-in-chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces and Commander of the Royal Cambodian Army Mao Sophan in Beijing, with both pledging further military cooperation.\n\n(Reporting by Albee Zhang and Ryan Woo; Editing by Michael Perry)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Washington fears the base could serve as a strategic outpost for Beijing, particularly given its location along the Gulf of Thailand and proximity to the hotly contested South China Sea.\n\nCambodia's decision to allow China's development of Ream has strained its ties with the US. The base, previously utilized for joint naval exercises with the US, underwent a China-funded upgrade starting June 2022, leading to the demolition of a US-built facility in 2020.\n\nThe presence of two Chinese warships at Ream since December has intensified scrutiny. Despite Cambodia's assurance that this doesn't signal a permanent Chinese military presence, concerns persist over China's intentions in the region.\n\nChina's strengthened relationship with Cambodia includes high-level exchanges, exemplified by Defense Minister Dong Jun's meeting with Cambodian military leaders in Beijing.\n\nBoth sides pledge to deepen military cooperation, further consolidating their \"ironclad\" friendship.\n\nAs China expands its naval footprint in Southeast Asia, geopolitical tensions rise, particularly concerning the South China Sea.\n\nThe dispatch of warships for training underscores China's efforts to bolster regional alliances while raising questions about its long-term strategic objectives.", "source": {"uri": "otakukart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OtakuKart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tarunjyot_kaur@otakukart.com", "name": "Tarunjyot Kaur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ream_Naval_Base", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ream Naval Base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_warfare_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amphibious warfare ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military transport aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naval base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_fighting_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armoured fighting vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_ship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training ship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Timor"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "East Timor"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Thailand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulf of Thailand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South China Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_National_Defense_of_the_People's_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of National Defense of the People's Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://otakukart.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Chinas-naval-deployment-underscores-its-expanding-influence-in-Southeast-Asia.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552298", "eventUri": "eng-9552298", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Chhum Socheat said that the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) warships are in Cambodia for training purposes and are \"not staying permanently.\"\n\nHe said that the two Chinese corvettes were due to take part in a joint Cambodian-Chinese military exercise later this month. The vessels have also been involved in training Cambodian sailors, he added.\n\n\"The ships are docked for the training period only, they are not staying permanently,\" Socheat said. \"We have been clear that Cambodia is not allowing any foreign forces to be deployed on its territory.\"\n\nThe two ships first docked at the base in December, coinciding with an official visit by China's top defense official He Weidong, the vice chairman of the Central Military Commission. According to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), satellite images show that they have been there ever since, barring two brief periods from January 15-18 and March 29-30.\n\nFor several years now, U.S. policymakers and think tankers have been seized with reports about the establishment of a possible Chinese military presence at Ream Naval Base. China has funded an extensive expansion and refurbishment of the base, and some analysts claim that this could serve as a new permanent outpost for the PLAN.\n\nCambodia's government has repeatedly denied that China has been permitted to establish a permanent military presence in the country, with officials saying that the country's Constitution barred the government from allowing a foreign military presence on Cambodian soil.\n\nIn his comments to the AP, Socheat repeated this claim, stating that the government was \"fully following\" the constitution. In addition to training and military exercises, he said that the PLAN vessels were \"testing\" the new pier at Ream, which was completed last year in order to enable larger warships to dock in the shallow waters around the base, and that they were on show for the Royal Cambodian Navy, which was considering purchasing similar warships at some point in the future.\n\nReam Naval Base has been the subject of close attention since 2019, when the Wall Street Journal reported that China had signed a secret agreement to allow its military to use the base, citing unnamed U.S. and allied officials, prompting a vociferous denial from both Phnom Penh and Beijing. The Washington Post then reported in mid-2022 that China is \"secretly building a naval facility in Cambodia for the exclusive use of its military.\" Again citing unnamed Western officials, the report claimed that both countries were \"taking extraordinary measures to conceal the operation.\"\n\nThe lingering presence of the Chinese warships since December has appeared to lend weight to the suggestion that China is seeking to establish a permanent military presence, with CSIS analysts asking last month whether \"that presence has now, in fact, been established.\"\n\nIn its conclusions about the current Chinese presence at Ream, the think tank said that it was too soon to declare the base a Chinese facility - though sooner or later the situation would become clear.\n\n\"At some point, the two PLAN corvettes that have been at Ream since December will leave,\" it stated. \"Whether they are replaced with other Chinese ships, how long those ships stay, and whether other navies are afforded the same opportunities will all speak volumes about the true nature of the relationship between China's navy and Ream.\"", "source": {"uri": "thediplomat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Diplomat Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Liberation_Army_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Liberation Army Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pier", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvette", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Corvette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ream_Naval_Base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ream Naval Base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Weidong", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "He Weidong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Central_Military_Commission_(China)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairman of the Central Military Commission (China)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Strategic_and_International_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center for Strategic and International Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Satellite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Cambodian_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Cambodian Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phnom_Penh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phnom Penh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phnom Penh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cambodia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Taoism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Taoism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2024-05-09-041920.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9552298", "eventUri": "eng-9552298", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-15", "dateEnd": "-01-18", "textStart": 1315, "textEnd": 1328}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-29", "dateEnd": "2024-03-30", "textStart": 1333, "textEnd": 1344}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

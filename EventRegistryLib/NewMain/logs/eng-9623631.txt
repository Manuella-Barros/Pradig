REUTERS\n\nThe UN nuclear watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution on Wednesday calling on Iran to cooperate with the IAEA and reverse its recent barring of inspectors.\n\nTwenty countries voted in favour and two against, Russia and China, with 12 abstentions, diplomats said. It follows up on the last resolution 18 months ago that ordered Iran to comply with a years-long International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) investigation into uranium traces found at undeclared sites.\n\nWhile the number of sites under investigation has been narrowed to two from three, Iran still has yet to give the IAEA satisfactory answers on how the traces got there.\n\n\"The need for the Board to hold Iran accountable to its legal obligations is long overdue. Iran must urgently, fully and unambiguously co-operate with the Agency,\" Britain, France and Germany said in a statement to the Board on the resolution they proposed.\n\nSince the last resolution the list of problems the IAEA faces in Iran has grown, and the new text also called on Iran to address several of those issues.\n\nIn September Iran barred many of the IAEA's top enrichment experts on the inspection team, which IAEA chief Rafael Grossi called \"disproportionate and unprecedented\" and a \"very serious blow\" to the agency's ability to do its job properly.\n\n\"(The Board) calls on Iran to reverse its withdrawal of the designations of several experienced Agency inspectors which is essential to fully allow the Agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively,\" the resolution said.\n\nGrossi met officials in Iran last month in the hope of breaking a deadlock on the particles probe and the inspectors but also to expand IAEA monitoring to parts of Iran's nuclear programme that were covered under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nThe deal, which traded restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities for sanctions relief, unravelled after then-President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of it in 2018.\n\nIran responded by abandoning the deal's nuclear provisions, including IAEA monitoring of activities such as the production of parts for centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium. The agency now does not know how many Iran has nor where.\n\nThe resolution called on Iran to implement a vaguely-worded March 2023 joint statement that the IAEA took to be a sweeping pledge of cooperation, including on monitoring and the installation of surveillance cameras.\n\nIran is now enriching uranium to up to 60 percent purity, close to the 90 percent of weapons grade, and has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for three nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA yardstick.\n\nWestern powers say there is no credible civilian reason for that. Iran says its aims are entirely peaceful but officials have recently said it could change its \"nuclear doctrine\" if it is attacked or its existence threatened by arch-foe Israel. That has prompted alarm at the IAEA and in Western capitals.\n\n\"Iran, a country with a past nuclear weapons programme and whose enrichment programme started in secret, is amassing a growing stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and now boasts of being on the precipice of nuclear weapons capability,\" the United States said in a statement to the Board of Governors.\n\nThe US statement also echoed concerns Washington expressed to its European allies before it finally backed the resolution.\n\n\"Iran has repeatedly responded to the resolutions adopted by this Board in recent years with escalation instead of cooperation, including by producing 60 percent enriched uranium at its heavily fortified, underground facility at Fordow,\" it said.", "source": {"uri": "thearabweekly.com",

They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the outcome of the closed-doors vote. The resolution was put forward by France, Germany and Britain.\n\nCensure resolutions by the IAEA board are not legally binding but send a strong political and diplomatic message.\n\nThe resolution, a draft of which was seen by The Associated Press, called on Tehran to implement a joint statement between Iran and the IAEA from March 2023. In that statement, Iran pledged to resolve issues surrounding sites where inspectors have questions about possible undeclared nuclear activity, and to allow the IAEA to \"implement further appropriate verification and monitoring activities.\"\n\nInspectors have said two sites near Tehran bore traces of processed uranium. The IAEA has urged Iran to provide \"technically credible\" answers about the origin and current location of the nuclear material in order for it \"to be in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful.\"\n\nWhile the number of sites about which the IAEA has questions has been reduced from four to two since 2019, those lingering questions have been a persistent source of tensions.\n\nThe IAEA has identified the sites as Turquzabad and Varamin. The IAEA has said inspectors believe Iran used the Varamin site from 1999 until 2003 as a pilot project to process uranium ore and convert it into a gas form. The IAEA said buildings at the site had been demolished in 2004.\n\nTehran insists its program is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program until 2003.\n\nTurquzabad is where the IAEA believes Iran took some of the material at Varamin amid the demolition, though it has said that alone cannot \"explain the presence of the multiple types of isotopically altered particles\" found there.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to raise the pressure on Tehran, the resolution approved Wednesday states that IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi may need to prepare a \"comprehensive and updated assessment\" on unresolved issues surrounding Iran's nuclear program, if there is \"a continued failure by Iran to provide the necessary, full and unambiguous co-operation\" to resolve the unanswered questions.\n\nThe statement Iran's Foreign Ministry made in response to the censure did not include any threat to expand its nuclear program, as had been circulated in the days before the vote. Iran in recent months, as tensions remain high in the region over the Israel-Hamas war, has suggested it could potentially build a nuclear weapon if it so chose. Iran now has enough highly enriched uranium to produce \"several\" atomic bombs, the IAEA has warned, though it likely would need months to complete building one.\n\nThe IAEA board last censured Iran in November 2022. Iran retaliated by beginning to enrich uranium to 60% purity at its Fordo nuclear plant. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.\n\nIran responded to a previous resolution in June 2022 by removing IAEA cameras and monitoring equipment from its nuclear sites.\n\nIran in September barred several experienced U.N. inspectors from monitoring the country's nuclear program. Grossi said at the time that the decision constituted \"a very serious blow\" to the agency's ability to do its job \"to the best possible level.\"\n\nUnder a 2015 deal with world powers, Tehran agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program.\n\nHowever, tensions steadily grew between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from the nuclear deal. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment.\n\nStephanie Liechtenstein, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "princegeorgecitizen.com",

It follows up on the last resolution 18 months ago that ordered Iran to comply with a years-long International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) investigation into uranium traces found at undeclared sites.\n\nWhile the number of sites under investigation has been narrowed to two from three, Iran still has yet to give the IAEA satisfactory answers on how the traces got there.\n\n\"The need for the Board to hold Iran accountable to its legal obligations is long overdue. Iran must urgently, fully and unambiguously co-operate with the Agency,\" Britain, France and Germany said in a statement to the Board on the resolution they proposed.\n\nSince the last resolution the list of problems the IAEA faces in Iran has grown, and the new text also called on Iran to address several of those issues.\n\nIn September Iran barred many of the IAEA's top enrichment experts on the inspection team, which IAEA chief Rafael Grossi called \"disproportionate and unprecedented\" and a \"very serious blow\" to the agency's ability to do its job properly.\n\n\"(The Board) calls on Iran to reverse its withdrawal of the designations of several experienced Agency inspectors which is essential to fully allow the Agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively,\" the resolution said. Grossi met officials in Iran last month in the hope of breaking a deadlock on the particles probe and the inspectors but also to expand IAEA monitoring to parts of Iran's nuclear programme that were covered under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nThe deal, which traded restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities for sanctions relief, unravelled after then-President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of it in 2018.\n\nIran responded by abandoning the deal's nuclear provisions, including IAEA monitoring of activities such as the production of parts for centrifuges - machines that enrich uranium. The agency now does not know how many Iran has or where.\n\nU.S. CONCERNS\n\nThe resolution called on Iran to implement a vaguely worded March 2023 joint statement that the IAEA took to be a sweeping pledge of cooperation, including on monitoring and the installation of surveillance cameras.\n\nIran is now enriching uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the 90% of weapons grade, and has enough material enriched to that level, if enriched further, for three nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA yardstick.\n\nWestern powers say there is no credible civilian reason for that. Iran says its aims are entirely peaceful but officials have recently said it could change its \"nuclear doctrine\" if it is attacked or its existence threatened by arch-foe Israel. That has prompted alarm at the IAEA and in Western capitals.\n\n\"Iran, a country with a past nuclear weapons program and whose enrichment program started in secret, is amassing a growing stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and now boasts of being on the precipice of nuclear weapons capability,\" the United States said in a statement to the Board of Governors.\n\nThe U.S. statement also echoed concerns Washington expressed to its European allies before it finally backed the resolution.\n\n\"Iran has repeatedly responded to the resolutions adopted by this Board in recent years with escalation instead of cooperation, including by producing 60% enriched uranium at its heavily fortified, underground facility at Fordow,\" it said.\n\nReporting by Francois Murphy Editing by Alexandra

Diplomats say the U.N. nuclear watchdog's board of governors on has censured Iran for failing to cooperate fully with the agency. It called on Tehran [...]\n\nVIENNA (AP) -- The U.N. nuclear watchdog's board on Wednesday censured Iran for failing to cooperate fully with the agency, diplomats said, calling on Tehran to provide answers in a long-running investigation and reverse its decision to bar several experienced U.N. inspectors.\n\nThe development comes just over a week after a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, he latest in Tehran's attempts to steadily exert pressure on the international community.\n\nThe vote by the 35-member board at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna sets the stage for a likely further escalation of tensions between the agency and Iran, which has reacted strongly to similar previous resolutions.\n\nTwenty members voted for the resolution, while Russia and China opposed it, 12 abstained and one did not vote, according to diplomats. They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the outcome of the closed-doors vote. The resolution was put forward by France, Germany and Britain.\n\nCensure resolutions by the IAEA board are not legally binding but send a strong political and diplomatic message.\n\nThe resolution, a draft of which was seen by The Associated Press, called on Tehran to implement a joint statement between Iran and the IAEA from March 2023. In that statement, Iran pledged to resolve issues surrounding sites where inspectors have questions about possible undeclared nuclear activity, and to allow the IAEA to \"implement further appropriate verification and monitoring activities.\"\n\nInspectors have said two sites near Tehran bore traces of processed uranium. The IAEA has urged Iran to provide \"technically credible\" answers about the origin and current location of the nuclear material in order for it \"to be in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful.\"\n\nWhile the number of sites about which the IAEA has questions has been reduced from four to two since 2019, those lingering questions have been a persistent source of tensions.\n\nThe IAEA has identified the sites as Turquzabad and Varamin. The IAEA has said inspectors believe Iran used the Varamin site from 1999 until 2003 as a pilot project to process uranium ore and convert it into a gas form. The IAEA said buildings at the site had been demolished in 2004.\n\nTehran insists its program is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program until 2003.\n\nTurquzabad is where the IAEA believes Iran took some of the material at Varamin amid the demolition, though it has said that alone cannot \"explain the presence of the multiple types of isotopically altered particles\" found there.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to raise the pressure on Tehran, the resolution approved Wednesday states that IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi may need to prepare a \"comprehensive and updated assessment\" on unresolved issues surrounding Iran's nuclear program, if there is \"a continued failure by Iran to provide the necessary, full and unambiguous co-operation\" to resolve the unanswered questions.\n\nThe IAEA board last censured Iran in November 2022. Iran retaliated by beginning to enrich uranium to 60% purity at its Fordo nuclear plant. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.\n\nIran responded to a previous resolution in June 2022 by removing IAEA cameras and monitoring equipment from its nuclear sites.\n\nIran in September barred several experienced U.N. inspectors from monitoring the country's nuclear program. Grossi said at the time that the decision constituted \"a very serious blow\" to the agency's ability to do its job \"to the best possible level.\"\n\nUnder a 2015 deal with world powers, Tehran agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program.\n\nHowever, tensions steadily grew between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from the nuclear deal. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors":

The IAEA said buildings at the site had been demolished in 2004.\n\nTehran insists its program is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA say Iran had an organised military nuclear program until 2003.\n\nTurquzabad is where the IAEA believes Iran took some of the material at Varamin amid the demolition, though it has said that alone cannot \"explain the presence of the multiple types of isotopically altered particles\" found there.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to raise the pressure on Tehran, the resolution approved Wednesday states that IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi may need to prepare a \"comprehensive and updated assessment\" on unresolved issues surrounding Iran's nuclear programme, if there is \"a continued failure by Iran to provide the necessary, full and unambiguous co-operation\" to resolve the unanswered questions.\n\nThe IAEA board last censured Iran in November 2022. Iran retaliated by beginning to enrich uranium to 60% purity at its Fordo nuclear plant. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.\n\nIran responded to a previous resolution in June 2022 by removing IAEA cameras and monitoring equipment from its nuclear sites.\n\nIran in September barred several experienced UN inspectors from monitoring the country's nuclear program. Grossi said at the time that the decision constituted \"a very serious blow\" to the agency's ability to do its job \"to the best possible level\".\n\nUnder a 2015 deal with world powers, Tehran agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, UN inspectors were tasked with monitoring the programme.\n\nHowever, tensions steadily grew between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from the nuclear deal. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its programme and quickly stepped up enrichment.

Agency (IAEA) board of governors to pass a resolution criticising Tehran as \"hasty and unwise\", Iranian State TV reported.\n\nThe UN nuclear watchdog's 35-nation board of governors passed a resolution on Wednesday calling on Iran to step up cooperation with the watchdog and reverse its recent barring of inspectors.\n\n\"The decision of the Western countries was hasty and unwise, and it will undoubtedly have a detrimental impact on the process of diplomatic engagement and constructive cooperation [between Iran and the opposing parties]\", state TV cited Iran's mission to the United Nations as saying.\n\nThe motion brought by Britain, France and Germany - but opposed by China and Russia - at the IAEA board is the first of its kind since November 2022.\n\nIt comes amid an impasse over Iran's escalating nuclear activities and as Western powers fear Tehran may be seeking to develop a nuclear weapon, a claim Iran has consistently denied.\n\nThe resolution was carried by 20 votes in favour - including the United States, which initially was reluctant for fear of aggravating Middle East tensions - with 12 abstentions and one country not participating, three diplomats told the AFP news agency.\n\nAlthough symbolic in nature at this stage, the censure motion aims to raise diplomatic pressure on Iran, with the option to potentially refer the issue to the UN Security Council.\n\nTehran had already threatened \"a serious and effective response\" and called the censure motion \"devoid of any legal, technical and political basis\".\n\nIn the past, similar resolutions have prompted Tehran to retaliate by removing surveillance cameras and other equipment from its nuclear facilities and ratcheting up its uranium enrichment activities.\n\nThe IAEA has said that Tehran has significantly ramped up its nuclear programme and now has enough material to build several atomic bombs.\n\nDuring the debates at the IAEA board of governors that began on Monday in Vienna, European powers denounced Iran's expansion of its nuclear programme \"to alarming levels\" as \"unprecedented for a state without a nuclear weapons programme\".\n\nAccording to the IAEA, Iran is the only non-nuclear weapon state to enrich uranium to the high level of 60 percent - just short of weapons-grade - while it keeps accumulating large uranium stockpiles.\n\nThe resolution sent \"a strong and renewed message of support\" for the IAEA's efforts to address the issue, Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3, said in a statement.\n\n\"The Board will not sit idly by when Iran challenges the foundations of the non-proliferation system and undermines the credibility of the international safeguards regime,\" they added.\n\n\"We hope Iran takes this opportunity to resolve these outstanding matters so that no further Board action is necessary.\"\n\nIran has gradually broken away from its commitments under the nuclear deal it struck with world powers in 2015.\n\nThe landmark deal provided Iran with relief from Western sanctions in exchange for curbs on its atomic programme, but it fell apart after the unilateral withdrawal of the US under then-President Donald

to show political will ... and take the necessary steps to resume the implementation\" of the 2015 deal.\n\nBut the US rejected that assertion, saying Iran refused an accord when it was possible and

"The UN nuclear watchdog's board of governors has passed a resolution criticising Iran's lack of cooperation with the agency, diplomats told AFP on Wednesday, a decision Tehran slammed as \"hasty and unwise\".\n\nThe motion brought by Britain, France and Germany -- but opposed by China and Russia -- at the International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation board is the first of its kind since November 2022.\n\nIt comes amid an impasse over Iran's escalating nuclear activities and as Western powers fear Tehran may be seeking to develop a nuclear weapon, a claim Iran denies.\n\nThe resolution was carried by 20 votes in favour -- including the United States, which initially was reluctant for fear of aggravating Middle East tensions -- with 12 abstentions and one country not participating, three diplomats told AFP.\n\nThe confidential document obtained by AFP reiterates it is \"essential and urgent\" that Tehran provide \"technically credible explanations\" for the presence of uranium particles found at two undeclared locations in Iran.\n\n\"A continued failure\" by Iran to provide full cooperation on the years-long probe \"may necessitate\" a comprehensive assessment by IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, the text said.\n\n- 'Devoid of any legal basis' -\n\nThe resolution also says Iran must \"reverse its withdrawal of the designations of several experienced Agency inspectors\", and \"without delay\" reconnect the cameras used to monitor its nuclear activities.\n\nThe text also notes the \"concerns\" surrounding \"recent public statements made in Iran... regarding its technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and possible changes to Iran's nuclear doctrine\".\n\nFollowing intense negotiations with the United States, the resolution was modified to secure Washington's support.\n\nAlthough symbolic in nature at this stage, the censure motion aims to raise diplomatic pressure on Iran, with the option to potentially refer the issue to the UN Security Council.\n\nIran's mission to the United Nations said the censure motion was \"hasty and unwise\" and would \"undoubtedly have a destructive effect on the process of diplomatic interaction and constructive cooperation\", ISNA news agency quoted it as telling the Al-Monitor news website.\n\nTehran had already threatened \"a serious and effective response\" and called the censure motion \"devoid of any legal, technical and political basis\".\n\nIn the past, similar resolutions have prompted Tehran to retaliate by removing surveillance cameras and other equipment from its nuclear facilities and ratcheting up its uranium enrichment activities.\n\n- 'Alarming levels' -\n\nThe IAEA has said that Tehran has significantly ramped up its nuclear programme and now has enough material to build several atomic bombs.\n\nDuring the debates at the IAEA Board of Governors that began on Monday in Vienna, European powers denounced Iran's expansion of its nuclear programme \"to alarming levels\" as \"unprecedented for a state without a nuclear weapons programme\".\n\nAccording to the IAEA, Iran is the only non-nuclear weapon state to enrich uranium to the high level of 60 percent -- just short of weapons-grade -- while it keeps accumulating large uranium stockpiles.\n\nThe resolution sent \"a strong and renewed message of support\" for the IAEA's efforts to address the issue, Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3, said in a separate statement.\n\n\"The Board will not sit idly by when Iran challenges the foundations of the non-proliferation system and undermines the credibility of the international safeguards regime,\" they added.\n\n\"We hope Iran takes this opportunity to resolve these outstanding matters so that no further Board action is necessary.\"\n\nIran has gradually broken away from its commitments under the nuclear deal it struck with world powers in 2015.\n\nThe landmark deal provided Iran with relief from Western sanctions in exchange for curbs on its atomic programme, but it fell apart after the unilateral withdrawal of the United States under then-president Donald Trump in 2018.\n\nEfforts to revive the deal have so far failed.\n\nIn a joint statement quoted Wednesday by Iran's official news agency IRNA, Tehran, Moscow and Beijing called on \"Western countries to show political will... and take the necessary steps to resume the implementation\" of the 2015 deal.\n\nBut the United States rejected that assertion, saying Iran refused an accord when it was possible and \"continued with activities that negated the chance for that deal, and now makes baseless statements to obfuscate the history\".", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The two no votes were cast by Russia and China.\n\nIranian state TV said passage of the resolution \"was hasty and unwise, and it will undoubtedly have a detrimental impact on the process of diplomatic engagement and constructive cooperation\" between Iran and the opposite parties.\n\nThe resolution follows another passed 18 months ago that ordered Iran to immediately respond to questions from IAEA inspectors about the origin of uranium particles found at its undeclared sites.\n\nAlthough the number of sites under inspection has decreased from three to two, the IAEA says that Iran has not yet given the agency a convincing explanation about the origin of these uranium particles.\n\nBritain, France, and Germany said in a statement to the Board of Governors it should have held Iran accountable for its legal obligations long ago.\n\nThe statement emphasizes that \"Iran must urgently, fully, and unambiguously cooperate with the agency.\"\n\nSince the approval of the previous resolution, the list of issues faced by the IAEA in Iran has grown, and the new resolution requires Iran to resolve these numerous problems.\n\nAt the end of last summer, Tehran barred the participation of many senior IAEA experts in the inspection group, which IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said was \"disproportionate and unprecedented\" and a \"serious blow\" to the UN nuclear watchdog in carrying out its mission.\n\nThe board \"calls on Iran to reverse its withdrawal of the designations of several experienced agency inspectors which is essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively,\" the resolution said.\n\nThe resolution called the presence of these uranium-enrichment experts in inspections of Iran's nuclear activities \"vital.\"\n\nGrossi traveled to Iran last month hoping to break a deadlock on the probe into the uranium particles, address the issue of the barred inspectors, and expand IAEA monitoring to parts of Iran's nuclear program that were covered under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nThe deal fell apart after Iran responded to the U.S. withdrawal from the deal in 2018 by abandoning its provisions, including IAEA monitoring of activities such as the production of parts for centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium.\n\nThe agency currently does not know how many Iran has or where they are.",

"body": "The Board of Governors (BoG) of the United Nations nuclear agency, the IAEA, has passed a resolution against Iran despite warnings from Tehran that it would react decisively to such a measure.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation BoG passed the resolution with 20 in favor and two against with 12 abstentions during its Wednesday meeting.\n\nThe resolution urged Iran to cooperate more with the IAEA and to allow increased number of inspectors to visit nuclear sites in the country.\n\nIt came two days after IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said Iran has yet to provide the Agency with \"technically credible explanations\" about the presence of uranium particles at two of its nuclear sites.\n\nAs part of a joint statement announced by Iran and the IAEA on March 4, 2023, the two sides have resolved issues related to one of the three sites flagged by the Agency for alleged presence of uranium particles.\n\nIran had warned in recent days that it would react to a new IAEA resolution as officials insist the country's nuclear activities are totally peaceful and has been in line with the Agency's guidelines and resolutions.\n\nGrossi told reporters in Vienna on Monday that he is neither in favor nor against a new BoG resolution against Iran as he indicated that such a measure may harm good agreements he had reached with Iranian authorities during a trip to the country in early May.\n\nThe resolution was supported and put forward by Britain, France and Germany, the three parties to a 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world power.\n\nIran says the E3, as the three are known, have failed to comply with their economic obligations under the nuclear deal since the withdrawal of the United States from the agreement in 2018.\n\nThe three issued a statement proposing the IAEA resolution on Wednesday, calling on Iran to \"urgently, fully and unambiguously co-operate with the Agency\".\n\nThe resolution also demanded that Iran reverses a decision it took in September to scale back the number of IAEA inspectors in the country.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors":

The two no votes were cast by Russia and China.\n\nThe resolution follows another passed 18 months ago that ordered Iran to immediately respond to questions from IAEA inspectors about the origin of uranium particles found at its undeclared sites.\n\nAlthough the number of sites under inspection has decreased from three to two, the IAEA says that Iran has not yet given the agency a convincing explanation about the origin of these uranium particles.\n\nBritain, France, and Germany said in a statement to the Board of Governors it should have held Iran accountable for its legal obligations long ago.\n\nThe statement emphasizes that \"Iran must urgently, fully, and unambiguously cooperate with the agency.\"\n\nSince the approval of the previous resolution, the list of issues faced by the IAEA in Iran has grown, and the new resolution requires Iran to resolve these numerous problems.\n\nAt the end of last summer, Tehran barred the participation of many senior IAEA experts in the inspection group, which IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said was \"disproportionate and unprecedented\" and a \"serious blow\" to the UN nuclear watchdog in carrying out its mission.\n\nThe board \"calls on Iran to reverse its withdrawal of the designations of several experienced agency inspectors which is essential to fully allow the agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively,\" the resolution said.\n\nThe resolution called the presence of these uranium-enrichment experts in inspections of Iran's nuclear activities \"vital.\"\n\nGrossi traveled to Iran last month hoping to break a deadlock on the probe into the uranium particles, address the issue of the barred inspectors, and expand IAEA monitoring to parts of Iran's nuclear program that were covered under a 2015 deal with major powers.\n\nThe deal fell apart after Iran responded to the U.S. withdrawal from the deal in 2018 by abandoning its provisions, including IAEA monitoring of activities such as the production of parts for centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium.\n\nThe agency currently does not know how many Iran has or where they are.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType":

nuclear watchdog board passes resolution criticising Iran", "body": "The UN nuclear watchdog's board of governors has passed a resolution criticising Iran's lack of cooperation with the agency, diplomats told AFP on Wednesday, a decision Tehran slammed as \"hasty and unwise\".\n\nThe motion brought by Britain, France and Germany -- but opposed by China and Russia -- at the International Atomic Energy Agency's 35-nation board is the first of its kind since November 2022.\n\nIt comes amid an impasse over Iran's escalating nuclear activities and as Western powers fear Tehran may be seeking to develop a nuclear weapon, a claim Iran denies.\n\nThe resolution was carried by 20 votes in favour -- including the United States, which initially was reluctant for fear of aggravating Middle East tensions -- with 12 abstentions and one country not participating, three diplomats told AFP.\n\nThe confidential document obtained by AFP reiterates it is \"essential and urgent\" that Tehran provide \"technically credible explanations\" for the presence of uranium particles found at two undeclared locations in Iran.\n\n\"A continued failure\" by Iran to provide full cooperation on the years-long probe \"may necessitate\" a comprehensive assessment by IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, the text said.\n\n- 'Devoid of any legal basis' -\n\nThe resolution also says Iran must \"reverse its withdrawal of the designations of several experienced Agency inspectors\", and \"without delay\" reconnect the cameras used to monitor its nuclear activities.\n\nThe text also notes the \"concerns\" surrounding \"recent public statements made in Iran... regarding its technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and possible changes to Iran's nuclear doctrine\".\n\nFollowing intense negotiations with the United States, the resolution was modified to secure Washington's support.\n\nAlthough symbolic in nature at this stage, the censure motion aims to raise diplomatic pressure on Iran, with the option to potentially refer the issue to the UN Security Council.\n\nIran's mission to the United Nations said the censure motion was \"hasty and unwise\" and would \"undoubtedly have a destructive effect on the process of diplomatic interaction and constructive cooperation\", ISNA news agency quoted it as telling the Al-Monitor news website.\n\nTehran had already threatened \"a serious and effective response\" and called the censure motion \"devoid of any legal, technical and political basis\".\n\nIn the past, similar resolutions have prompted Tehran to retaliate by removing surveillance cameras and other equipment from its nuclear facilities and ratcheting up its uranium enrichment activities.\n\nMore from this section be Well: Information to keep your feet looking and feeling good this summer Very Early Menopause Could Raise Odds for Breast, Ovarian Cancers Lok Sabha Election Results 2024: BJP Workers Celebrate At Headquarters In Delhi | Exclusive Video - 'Alarming levels' -\n\nThe IAEA has said that Tehran has significantly ramped up its nuclear programme and now has enough material to build several atomic bombs.\n\nDuring the debates at the IAEA Board of Governors that began on Monday in Vienna, European powers denounced Iran's expansion of its nuclear programme \"to alarming levels\" as \"unprecedented for a state without a nuclear weapons programme\".\n\nAccording to the IAEA, Iran is the only non-nuclear weapon state to enrich uranium to the high level of 60 percent -- just short of weapons-grade -- while it keeps accumulating large uranium stockpiles.\n\nThe resolution sent \"a strong and renewed message of support\" for the IAEA's efforts to address the issue, Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3, said in a separate statement.\n\n\"The Board will not sit idly by when Iran challenges the foundations of the non-proliferation system and undermines the credibility of the international safeguards regime,\" they added.\n\n\"We hope Iran takes this opportunity to resolve these outstanding matters so that no further Board action is necessary.\"\n\nIran has gradually broken away from its commitments under the nuclear deal it struck with world powers in 2015.\n\nThe landmark deal provided Iran with relief from Western sanctions in exchange for curbs on its atomic programme, but it fell apart after the unilateral withdrawal of the United States under then-president Donald Trump in 2018.\n\nEfforts to revive the deal have so far failed.\n\nIn a joint statement quoted Wednesday by Iran's official news agency IRNA, Tehran, Moscow and Beijing called on \"Western countries to show political will... and take the necessary steps to resume the implementation\" of the 2015 deal.\n\nBut the United States rejected that assertion, saying Iran refused an accord when it was possible and \"continued with activities that negated the chance for that deal, and now makes baseless statements to obfuscate the history\".\n\nburs-anb-kym/rlp", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anne_beade@reformer.com", "name": "Anne Beade", "type":

and China, in a joint statement urged Western countries to show political will and take the necessary action to resume the implementation of the 2015 deal, according to Iran's state news agency

The two countries to vote against were Russia and China.\n\nIt came after the US dropped its objections to the censure and joined the European countries condemning Iran's years-long failure to cooperate. The Biden administration had been reluctant to take the step, wishing not to open up another conflict with Iran in the Middle East, but the Europeans insisted the integrity of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty was at stake.\n\nIn backing the motion the US called for a longer-term strategy to be developed towards Iran's nuclear programme, especially since many of the restrictions placed on Iran in the original 2015 nuclear deal will be lifted next year. The last censure motion against Iran 19 months ago led to Iran announcing that it was going to enrich uranium to 60% purity - close to weapons grade - at its Fordow fuel enrichment plant.\n\nIran signed a nuclear deal in 2015, the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPoA) that saw western economic sanctions lifted in return for strong controls over its civil nuclear programme. But the country has gradually reduced inspectors' access to its nuclear sites and also vastly increased its stock of highly enriched uranium in breach of the limits set. It says it did so in response to Donald Trump unilaterally pulling the US out of the agreement in 2018, a move that is widely seen to have undercut advocates of western engagement inside Iran.\n\nIran says a fatwa (Islamic edict or legal decree) forbids possession of nuclear weapons, and in recent days it has disowned remarks made by some senior politicians arguing Iran should develop a bomb.\n\nIn a joint statement to the IAEA board, the UK, France and Germany - the three European signatories to the agreement - said: \"Iran now possesses 30 times the JCPoA limit of enriched uranium and its stockpile of high enriched uranium up to 60% has continued to grow significantly. Iran now has the approximate amount of nuclear material from which the possibility of manufacturing a nuclear explosive device cannot be excluded.\"\n\nIt added: \"The [International Atomic Energy] Agency has lost continuity of knowledge in relation to the production and inventory of centrifuges, rotors and bellows, heavy water and uranium ore concentrate.\"\n\nThe IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, had visited Iran before the quarterly board meeting in a bid to negotiate improved access, but the death of the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, led to the discussions freezing.\n\nIn a joint statement issued before the vote, China, Iran and Russia called for fresh talks to revive the nuclear deal, saying it \"was time for the western countries to show their political will, to refrain from the endless cycle of escalation that has been going on for almost the last two years. Passing of the resolution was a mistake that will only lead to confrontation.\"\n\nThe Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, hailed the IAEA decision, saying: \"This is the first resolution in 19 months on Iranian violations, paving the way for further actions against Iran's nuclear activities ... The free world must stop Iran now - before it's too late.\"\n\nIran's specific countermeasures may be delayed by the country's presidential election on 28 June, since candidates have different views on the wisdom of signing the deal in the first place.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_wintour@theguardian.com",

The resolution was passed by 20 votes in favour, including the US which was initially reluctant to stoke regional tension, diplomats told AFP. Twelve countries abstained from the vote.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Iran's acting Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani said the IAEA was being exploited by certain member states to mount pressure on Tehran.\n\n\"The non-constructive approach of some member countries in exploiting the agency's capacity in pursuit of their political goals will definitely harm the identity of the agency,\" he said.\n\nBefore the vote, Iran handed a note to the agency urging it to assess Iranian nuclear activity with \"impartiality\".\n\nThe resolution submitted by the European powers, known as the E3, presses Iran to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites.\n\nThe new text calls on Iran to co-operate without delay, including allowing the IAEA to take samples if the agency needs them.\n\nIt also addresses problems that have arisen more recently, such as Iran's barring of many of the IAEA's senior uranium-enrichment experts on the inspection team.\n\n\"Much of Iran's nuclear programme is unprecedented for a state without a nuclear weapons programme,\" the E3 said on Monday.\n\nThe US and several European countries accuse Iran of seeking to develop a nuclear weapon. Tehran has repeatedly denied the claim.\n\nLast week, the UN watchdog warned that Iran could already possess more than three times the amount of highly enriched uranium required to build a weapon. In April, it said the country could be months or weeks away from constructing the bomb.\n\nAlthough symbolic, the censure is aimed at increasing diplomatic pressure on Iran. Similar resolutions in the past have instead led to further diplomatic impasse and restrictions.\n\nAfter the IAEA censure in 2022, Iran disconnected the agency's surveillance cameras monitoring its nuclear sites.\n\n\"We hope Iran takes this opportunity to resolve these outstanding matters so that no further Board action is necessary,\" the E3 said. The nuclear agency has the option to refer the matter to the UN Security Council.\n\nTehran ramped up its nuclear activities after former US president Donald Trump pulled out of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), widely known as the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nNegotiations resumed in 2021 to revive the deal but talks have stalled over disagreements and increasing tension between Washington and Tehran.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

retaliate by removing surveillance cameras and other equipment from its nuclear facilities and ratcheting up its uranium enrichment activities.\n\nTehran, which has already threatened \"a serious and effective response, slammed the censure motion as \"devoid of any legal, technical and political basis\".\n\n'Alarming levels'\n\nWhile Tehran denies that it is seeking to develop a nuclear weapon, it has at the same time significantly ramped up its nuclear programme and now has enough material to build several atomic bombs.\n\nDuring the debates at the IAEA Board of Governors that began on Monday in Vienna, European powers denounced Iran's expansion of its nuclear programme \"to alarming levels\" as \"unprecedented for a state without a nuclear weapons programme\".\n\nAccording to the IAEA, Iran is the only non-nuclear weapon state to enrich uranium to the high level of 60 percent -- just short of weapons-grade -- while it keeps accumulating large uranium stockpiles.\n\n\"Iran's escalating nuclear activities significantly harm international security and undermine the global non-proliferation architecture,\" Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3, said in a separate statement.\n\nIran has gradually broken away from its commitments under the nuclear deal it struck with world powers in 2015.\n\nThe landmark deal provided Iran with relief from Western sanctions in exchange for curbs on its atomic programme, but it fell apart after the unilateral withdrawal of the United States under then-president Donald Trump in 2018.\n\nEfforts to revive the deal have so far failed.\n\nIn a joint statement quoted Wednesday by Iran's official news agency IRNA, Tehran, Moscow and Beijing called on \"Western countries to show political will... and take the necessary steps to resume the implementation\" of the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nBut the United States rejected that assertion as \"a tired and transparent gambit\".\n\n\"Iran refused a deal when it was possible, continued with activities that negated the chance for that deal, and now makes baseless statements to obfuscate the history,\" the US said in its national statement to the board.", "source": {"uri":

The United States and the three European powers, collectively known as the E3, have long coordinated on efforts to contain Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.\n\nThe Biden administration was reluctant to take any action that could prompt Iran to ratchet up its nuclear program and further limit access to international inspectors. Had it voted against the European-led measure, however, the administration would have faced accusations in an election year that it was being too soft on Iran.\n\nThe US ambassador to the IAEA, Laura Holgate, said before the vote Wednesday that the United States would support the censure resolution \"given Iran's lack of cooperation with the IAEA and our commitment to collective action in support of the agency and the NPT,\" referring to the Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1970 meant to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.\n\nBut in a veiled jab at the Europeans, Holgate added, \"Make no mistake, it is important that resolutions be tied to a broader strategy.\"\n\nThe IAEA's board of governors last censured Iran in November 2022, reprimanding it for not complying with a years-long investigation into man-made uranium particles discovered at several undeclared nuclear sites. In retaliation, Iran announced that it had started enriching uranium to 60% purity at its Fordow nuclear facility.\n\nIran's semi-official Fars news agency quoted the country's atomic energy chief, Mohammad Eslami, as saying Monday that Tehran would respond \"accordingly\" if the IAEA moved forward with another censure.\n\nBehnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, welcomed the Europeans' use of diplomatic pressure against Iran but questioned what their end game is.\n\n\"Is this pressure to return to a fatally flawed deal, which is already fast expiring, or can and should this be an inflection point for the Europeans to build momentum towards snapback?\" Taleblu said.\n\nUN Resolution 2231, which enshrined the 2015 nuclear deal, allows its signatories to trigger a \"snapback\" of sanctions by filing a complaint to the Security Council if Iran is no longer abiding by its nuclear obligations. Considered by the West a measure of last resort, the option to restore sanctions on Iran expires in October 2025.\n\n\"The censure seems to amount to a feel-good measure for the West,\" said Ali Vaez, Iran program director at the International Crisis Group. \"It's more likely to prompt Iranian nuclear escalation rather than cooperation.\"\n\nThe original deal between Iran and world powers, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, set curbs on the purity and amount of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile in exchange for international sanctions relief. Iran began violating the accord after former President Donald Trump quit the JCPOA in 2018 and reimposed economic sanctions on Iran.\n\nA recent IAEA report concluded that Iran's stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels of 90% continues to grow. The agency said its uranium enriched up to 60% had increased by 20.6 kilograms (45.4 pounds) between February and May. The original nuclear deal limited Iran from enriching uranium beyond 3.67% purity.\n\nThe US intelligence community has assessed that Iran could amass enough fissile material to build three nuclear weapons within weeks if it decided to do so. Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes only.\n\nThe IAEA censure comes as the Biden administration pursues back-channel diplomacy with Tehran to lower tensions over its nuclear program and support for regional proxies. Last month, US and Iranian officials held another round of secret, indirect talks in the Gulf state of Oman.\n\nDuring a news conference in Berlin on Monday, acting Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Bagheri Kani acknowledged that the dialogue between the two adversaries continues.\n\n\"We have always continued our negotiations ... and they have never stopped,\" he said.\n\nThe IAEA censure comes weeks before Iran is set to hold a nationwide election to replace late President Ebrahim Raisi, who was killed in a helicopter crash last month.\n\nThe 12-member Guardian Council will soon decide which of the presidential hopefuls can stand in the June 28 election. Those who have registered their candidacy include former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, current parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, his conservative predecessor Ali Larijani and former nuclear negotiator Saeed Jalili.\n\nThe country's indirect talks with the United States are expected to continue regardless of who is elected Iran's next president, as both Tehran and Washington appear incentivized to put a lid on regional attacks that could pull them into direct military confrontation.", "source": {"uri": "al-monitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al-Monitor"}, "authors": [],

Twelve countries abstained and one did not vote.\n\nThe resolution urged Iran to implement a March 2023 joint statement with the IAEA. Tehran pledged then to resolve issues about possible undeclared nuclear activity, and to allow the IAEA to \"implement further appropriate verification and monitoring activities\".\n\nTensions had escalated when inspectors found sites near Tehran with traces of processed uranium. The IAEA aksed Iranian officials to provide \"technically credible\" answers about the origin and current location of the nuclear material \"to be in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful.\" Issues about two sites have been resolved, but two are still outstanding.\n\nIAEA inspectors believe Iran used the Varamin site from 1999 until 2003 as a pilot project to process uranium ore and convert it into a gas form. Buildings at the site were demolished in 2004.\n\nMaterial from Varamin was taken to the Turquzabad site amid the demolition, the IAEA assesses. However, this cannot \"explain the presence of the multiple types of isotopically altered particles\" found there.\n\nIran's Rejection of IAEA\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry showed no sign of accommodation. In a statement, it \"strongly condemns\" the action taken by the IAEA's 35-member Board of Governors.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran considers the presentation and approval of this resolution to be a political and non-constructive action and a continuation of the previous failed policies of some Western countries and an attempt to politically abuse international mechanisms against independent countries.\n\nHowever, the Ministry did not repeat the threat, issued by Iranian officials in recent days, to expand nuclear production further.\n\nThe IAEA reported last week that Iran has further increased its stocks of 20% and 60% uranium, which can potentially be further enriched to a weapons grade of more than 90%.\n\nCiting US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement with the 5+1 Powers (US, France, Germany, UK, China, and Russia) and the Trump Administration's imposition of comprehensive sanctions in November 2018, Iran began withholding the IAEA's surveillance video of nuclear sites.\n\nIn 2021, Iran refused renewal of a monitoring agreement. It subsequently removed some cameras from the sites.\n\nMeanwhile, Tehran broke the terms of the 2015 pact, which limited enrichment of uranium to 3.67%. In January 2021, it resumed production of 20% uranium, and began its first enrichment of 60% uranium three months later.", "source": {"uri": "eaworldview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EA WorldView"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_lucas@eaworldview.com", "name": "Scott Lucas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varamin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Varamin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Varamin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turquzabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turquzabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Turquzabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enriched uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://eaworldview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRAN-NUCLEAR-FACILITY-e1562397918110.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-11-", "textStart": 2529, "textEnd": 2542}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The resolution responds to Iran's persistent refusal to cooperate in good faith with the IAEA to clarify outstanding issues relating to undeclared nuclear material detected at multiple locations in Iran. Iran is legally obligated under its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Safeguards Agreement to cooperate with the IAEA and account for all nuclear material and activities.\n\n18 months ago, the IAEA Board stated that it was essential and urgent for Iran to act without delay to fulfil its NPT-required safeguards obligations to ensure the IAEA is able to verify that no nuclear material is diverted. Since then, Iran has consistently failed to meaningfully cooperate with the Agency, further restricted Agency access by de-designating experienced inspectors, and accumulated provocative statements on its technical capability to build nuclear weapons that are contrary to Iran's NPT obligations. Despite the repeated efforts by the IAEA Director General to engage in a substantial dialogue with Iran, Iran has made no progress to resolve the issues.\n\nWith this new resolution, the IAEA Board sends a strong and renewed message of support for the IAEA and its Director-General's relentless efforts to address the issue. The Board will not sit idly by when Iran challenges the foundations of the non-proliferation system and undermines the credibility of the international safeguards regime. Iran must cooperate with the Agency and provide technically credible explanations which satisfy the Agency's questions. This resolution supports the Agency to pursue its dialogue with Iran to clarify all outstanding safeguards issues, while setting the stage for further steps to hold Iran to account if it fails to make concrete progress.", "source": {"uri": "wired-gov.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "WiredGov"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Development_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Development Agencies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/channel-social/WGOV-9FZM2R/$file/GFO_social.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The two countries to vote against were Russia and China.\n\nRelated: Diplomats fear growing power of Iranian factions that want nuclear weapons\n\nIt came after the US dropped its objections to the censure and joined the European countries condemning Iran's years-long failure to cooperate. The Biden administration had been reluctant to take the step, wishing not to open up another conflict with Iran in the Middle East, but the Europeans insisted the integrity of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty was at stake.\n\nIn backing the motion the US called for a longer-term strategy to be developed towards Iran's nuclear programme, especially since many of the restrictions placed on Iran in the original 2015 nuclear deal will be lifted next year. The last censure motion against Iran 19 months ago led to Iran announcing that it was going to enrich uranium to 60% purity - close to weapons grade - at its Fordow fuel enrichment plant.\n\nIran signed a nuclear deal in 2015, the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPoA) that saw western economic sanctions lifted in return for strong controls over its civil nuclear programme. But the country has gradually reduced inspectors' access to its nuclear sites and also vastly increased its stock of highly enriched uranium in breach of the limits set. It says it did so in response to Donald Trump unilaterally pulling the US out of the agreement in 2018, a move that is widely seen to have undercut advocates of western engagement inside Iran.\n\nIran says a fatwa (Islamic edict or legal decree) forbids possession of nuclear weapons, and in recent days it has disowned remarks made by some senior politicians arguing Iran should develop a bomb.\n\nIn a joint statement to the IAEA board, the UK, France and Germany - the three European signatories to the agreement - said: \"Iran now possesses 30 times the JCPoA limit of enriched uranium and its stockpile of high enriched uranium up to 60% has continued to grow significantly. Iran now has the approximate amount of nuclear material from which the possibility of manufacturing a nuclear explosive device cannot be excluded.\"\n\nIt added: \"The [International Atomic Energy] Agency has lost continuity of knowledge in relation to the production and inventory of centrifuges, rotors and bellows, heavy water and uranium ore concentrate.\"\n\nThe IAEA director general, Rafael Grossi, had visited Iran before the quarterly board meeting in a bid to negotiate improved access, but the death of the Iranian president, Ebrahim Raisi, led to the discussions freezing.\n\nRelated: Nuclear issue looms over Iranian presidential election to succeed Raisi\n\nIn a joint statement issued before the vote, China, Iran and Russia called for fresh talks to revive the nuclear deal, saying it \"was time for the western countries to show their political will, to refrain from the endless cycle of escalation that has been going on for almost the last two years. Passing of the resolution was a mistake that will only lead to confrontation.\"\n\nThe Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, hailed the IAEA decision, saying: \"This is the first resolution in 19 months on Iranian violations, paving the way for further actions against Iran's nuclear activities ... The free world must stop Iran now - before it's too late.\"\n\nIran's specific countermeasures may be delayed by the country's presidential election on 28 June, since candidates have different views on the wisdom of signing the deal in the first place.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Twelve countries abstained and one did not vote.\n\nThe resolution urged Iran to implement a March 2023 joint statement with the IAEA. Tehran pledged then to resolve issues about possible undeclared nuclear activity, and to allow the IAEA to \"implement further appropriate verification and monitoring activities\".\n\nTensions had escalated when inspectors found sites near Tehran with traces of processed uranium. The IAEA aksed Iranian officials to provide \"technically credible\" answers about the origin and current location of the nuclear material \"to be in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful.\" Issues about two sites have been resolved, but two are still outstanding.\n\nIAEA inspectors believe Iran used the Varamin site from 1999 until 2003 as a pilot project to process uranium ore and convert it into a gas form. Buildings at the site were demolished in 2004.\n\nMaterial from Varamin was taken to the Turquzabad site amid the demolition, the IAEA assesses. However, this cannot \"explain the presence of the multiple types of isotopically altered particles\" found there.\n\nIran's Foreign Ministry showed no sign of accommodation. In a statement, it \"strongly condemns\" the action taken by the IAEA's 35-member Board of Governors.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran considers the presentation and approval of this resolution to be a political and non-constructive action and a continuation of the previous failed policies of some Western countries and an attempt to politically abuse international mechanisms against independent countries.\n\nHowever, the Ministry did not repeat the threat, issued by Iranian officials in recent days, to expand nuclear production further.\n\nThe IAEA reported last week that Iran has further increased its stocks of 20% and 60% uranium, which can potentially be further enriched to a weapons grade of more than 90%.\n\nCiting US withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear agreement with the 5+1 Powers (US, France, Germany, UK, China, and Russia) and the Trump Administration's imposition of comprehensive sanctions in November 2018, Iran began withholding the IAEA's surveillance video of nuclear sites.\n\nIn 2021, Iran refused renewal of a monitoring agreement. It subsequently removed some cameras from the sites.\n\nMeanwhile, Tehran broke the terms of the 2015 pact, which limited enrichment of uranium to 3.67%. In January 2021, it resumed production of 20% uranium, and began its first enrichment of 60% uranium three months later.", "source": {"uri": "eaworldview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EA WorldView"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_lucas@eaworldview.com", "name": "Scott Lucas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varamin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Varamin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Varamin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turquzabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turquzabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Turquzabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Withdrawal_of_United_States_troops_from_Afghanistan_(2020\u20132021)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Withdrawal of United States troops from Afghanistan (2020\u20132021)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enriched uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://eaworldview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IRAN-NUCLEAR-FACILITY-e1562397918110.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-11-", "textStart": 2503, "textEnd": 2516}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

It has been more than three years since Iran stopped provisionally applying its Additional Protocol and therefore it is also over three years since the agency was able to conduct complementary access in Iran.\"\n\nGrossi said there has been no progress in resolving the outstanding safeguards issues. Iran, he said, has not provided the IAEA with \"technically credible explanations\" for the presence of uranium particles of anthropogenic origin at the Varamin and Turquzabad sites. In addition, it had not informed the agency of the current location(s) of the nuclear material and/or of contaminated equipment.\n\n\"These outstanding safeguards issues stem from Iran's obligations under its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and need to be resolved for the agency to be in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful,\" Grossi said. \"Further public statements made in Iran regarding its technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and possible changes to Iran's nuclear doctrine only increase my concerns about the correctness and completeness of Iran's safeguards declarations.\"\n\nIn a statement, Iran's Permanent Mission to the United Nations in Vienna said: \"The Islamic Republic of Iran has so far rendered its full cooperation under the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement to the agency. It has to be re-emphasised that all Iran's nuclear material and activities have been completely declared and verified by the agency.\n\n\"The Islamic Republic of Iran rightfully expects that the agency conducts its reporting on verification activities in Iran based on the principles of impartiality, professionalism and objectivity.\"\n\nThe E3 welcomed the adoption of the resolution by the IAEA board of governors. In a joint statement, they said the resolution \"responds to Iran's persistent refusal to cooperate in good faith with the IAEA to clarify outstanding issues relating to undeclared nuclear material detected at multiple locations in Iran.\n\n\"If Iran meaningfully cooperates with the agency, and the Director General is able to report that the unresolved safeguards issues are no longer outstanding, the board could then close its consideration of this matter. We hope Iran takes this opportunity to resolve these outstanding matters so that no further board action is necessary.\"", "source": {"uri": "world-nuclear-news.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Nuclear News (WNN)"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Grossi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Grossi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bellows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heavy water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_ore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uranium ore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifuge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Centrifuge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enriched uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_impact_on_the_environment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human impact on the environment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varamin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Varamin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Varamin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Cooperatives", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 384, "textEnd": 390}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-03", "textStart": 1520, "textEnd": 1526}], "sentiment": 0.5372549019607844, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

parliament in 2020 to counter U.S. sanctions, explaining that the move was prompted by the failure of other parties to the deal, particularly the United States, to honor their commitments under the

They spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the outcome of the closed-doors vote. The resolution was put forward by France, Germany and Britain.\n\nCensure resolutions by the IAEA board are not legally binding but send a strong political and diplomatic message.\n\nGET CAUGHT UP\n\nSummarized stories to quickly stay informed\n\nPreviousNext\n\nArizona votes to put Texas-inspired immigration referendum on November ballot\n\nSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.\n\nTrump again suggests political opponents may face prosecution, too\n\nSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.\n\nEarly fires in California could signal worse to come, officials say\n\nSparkleSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed.\n\nHe went viral for driving with a suspended license.

In that statement, Iran pledged to resolve issues surrounding sites where inspectors have questions about possible undeclared nuclear activity, and to allow the IAEA to \"implement further appropriate verification and monitoring activities.\"\n\nInspectors have said two sites near Tehran bore traces of processed uranium. The IAEA has urged Iran to provide \"technically credible\" answers about the origin and current location of the nuclear material in order for it \"to be in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful.\"\n\nWhile the number of sites about which the IAEA has questions has been reduced from four to two since 2019, those lingering questions have been a persistent source of tensions.\n\nThe IAEA has identified the sites as Turquzabad and Varamin. The IAEA has said inspectors believe Iran used the Varamin site from 1999 until 2003 as a pilot project to process uranium ore and convert it into a gas form. The IAEA said buildings at the site had been demolished in 2004.\n\nTehran insists its program is peaceful, though the West and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program until 2003.\n\nTurquzabad is where the IAEA believes Iran took some of the material at Varamin amid the demolition, though it has said that alone cannot \"explain the presence of the multiple types of isotopically altered particles\" found there.\n\nIn an apparent attempt to raise the pressure on Tehran, the resolution approved Wednesday states that IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi may need to prepare a \"comprehensive and updated assessment\" on unresolved issues surrounding Iran's nuclear program, if there is \"a continued failure by Iran to provide the necessary, full and unambiguous co-operation\" to resolve the unanswered questions.\n\nThe IAEA board last censured Iran in November 2022. Iran retaliated by beginning to enrich uranium to 60% purity at its Fordo nuclear plant. Uranium enriched at 60% purity is just a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%.\n\nIran responded to a previous resolution in June 2022 by removing IAEA cameras and monitoring equipment from its nuclear sites.\n\nIran in September barred several experienced U.N. inspectors from monitoring the country's nuclear program. Grossi said at the time that the decision constituted \"a very serious blow\" to the agency's ability to do its job \"to the best possible level.\"\n\nUnder a 2015 deal with world powers, Tehran agreed to limit enrichment of uranium to levels necessary for generating nuclear power in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. At the time, U.N. inspectors were tasked with monitoring the program.\n\nHowever, tensions steadily grew between Iran and the IAEA since 2018, when then-President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from the nuclear deal. Since then, Iran has abandoned all limits the deal put on its program and quickly stepped up enrichment.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"},

The resolution responds to Iran's persistent refusal to cooperate in good faith with the IAEA to clarify outstanding issues relating to undeclared nuclear material detected at multiple locations in Iran. Iran is legally obligated under its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Safeguards Agreement to cooperate with the IAEA and account for all nuclear material and activities.\n\n18 months ago, the IAEA Board stated that it was essential and urgent for Iran to act without delay to fulfil its NPT-required safeguards obligations to ensure the IAEA is able to verify that no nuclear material is diverted. Since then, Iran has consistently failed to meaningfully cooperate with the Agency, further restricted Agency access by de-designating experienced inspectors, and accumulated provocative statements on its technical capability to build nuclear weapons that are contrary to Iran's NPT obligations. Despite the repeated efforts by the IAEA Director General to engage in a substantial dialogue with Iran, Iran has made no progress to resolve the issues.\n\nWith this new resolution, the IAEA Board sends a strong and renewed message of support for the IAEA and its Director-General's relentless efforts to address the issue. The Board will not sit idly by when Iran challenges the foundations of the non-proliferation system and undermines the credibility of the international safeguards regime. Iran must cooperate with the Agency and provide technically credible explanations which satisfy the Agency's questions. This resolution supports the Agency to pursue its dialogue with Iran to clarify all outstanding safeguards issues, while setting the stage for further steps to hold Iran to account if it fails to make concrete progress.\n\nIf Iran meaningfully cooperates with the Agency, and the Director General is able to report that the unresolved safeguards issues are no longer outstanding, the Board could then close its consideration of this matter. We hope Iran takes this opportunity to resolve these outstanding matters so that no further Board action is necessary.", "source": {"uri": "diplomatie.gouv.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "France Diplomatie - Minist\u00e8re de l'Europe et des Affaires \u00e9trang\u00e8res"}, "authors": [{"uri": "des_affaires_etrangeres@diplomatie.gouv.fr", "name": "Des Affaires \u00c9trang\u00e8res", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ministere_de_l_europe@diplomatie.gouv.fr", "name": "Minist\u00e8re De l'Europe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Development_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives/Development Agencies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Cooperatives", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Cooperatives", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/local/cache-vignettes/L800xH400/visuel_defaut_une_fd-44916.jpg?1702480405", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

He did not elaborate.\n\n\"Past experience should have proved to them [the West] that Iran does not retreat from its inalienable rights in the face of political pressure,\" he said.\n\nNour News, an Iranian outlet affiliated with Ali Shamkhani, senior political adviser to Iran's supreme leader, warned on June 6 that applying pressure on Tehran would only encourage it to expand its nuclear program.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kayhan newspaper, whose chief editor is appointed by the supreme leader, on June 6 demanded the expulsion of all IAEA inspectors from Iran. It also alleged that the resolution was meant to influence Iran's upcoming presidential election by forcing voters to elect a government willing to negotiate with the West.\n\nDespite its adoption, the resolution did not receive as many votes in favor as the last two resolutions. A June 2022 resolution was adopted 30-2, while a November 2022 resolution was passed 26-2.\n\nIran responded to the June 2022 resolution by removing IAEA cameras and monitoring equipment from several nuclear sites. In reaction to the November 2022 censure, Tehran started to enrich uranium to 60 percent purity at a second site, the Fordo plant.\n\nIn September 2023, despite there being no resolution against Iran, the Islamic republic moved to bar several experienced UN inspectors from monitoring its equipment.\n\nThe new resolution calls on Iran to reinstate the veteran inspectors.\n\nIran insists that it has been cooperative with the IAEA, but the agency's director-general, Rafael Grossi, maintains that Tehran has failed to provide \"technically credible\" explanations for traces of uranium found in two old but undeclared sites.\n\nDamon Golriz, a lecturer at The Hague University of Applied Sciences, told RFE/RL's Radio Farda that the resolution may be a step by European powers toward \"taking a political decision\" to trigger a \"snapback\" of UN Security Council (UNSC) sanctions against Iran.\n\nThe \"snapback\" mechanism is outlined in UNSC Resolution 2231, which enshrined the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. However, the option to reimpose the sanctions expires in October 2025.\n\n\"With the activation of the 'snapback' mechanism, we go back to how things were 15 years ago, when six UN resolutions obliged the world to put Iran under pressure,\" Golriz said.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

However, the United States withdrew from the agreement in May 2018.\n\nIn November 2022, the IAEA's Board of Governors passed a resolution, proposed by the U.S., Britain, France, and Germany, calling on Iran to cooperate with the IAEA's investigators regarding the alleged \"traces of uranium\" at a number of its \"undeclared\" sites. Iran has rejected the allegations.\n\nEslami said that Iran was in the phase of scaling back its commitments based on a strategic law passed by the country's parliament in 2020 to counter U.S. sanctions, explaining that the move was prompted by the failure of other parties to the deal, particularly the U.S., to honor their commitments under the agreement. \u25a0", "source": {"uri":

The resolution responds to Iran's persistent refusal to cooperate in good faith with the IAEA to clarify outstanding issues relating to undeclared nuclear material detected at multiple locations in Iran. Iran is legally obligated under its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) Safeguards Agreement to cooperate with the IAEA and account for all nuclear material and activities.\n\n18 months ago, the IAEA Board stated that it was essential and urgent for Iran to act without delay to fulfil its NPT-required safeguards obligations to ensure the IAEA is able to verify that no nuclear material is diverted. Since then, Iran has consistently failed to meaningfully cooperate with the Agency, further restricted Agency access by de-designating experienced inspectors, and accumulated provocative statements on its technical capability to build nuclear weapons that are contrary to Iran's NPT obligations. Despite the repeated efforts by the IAEA Director General to engage in a substantial dialogue with Iran, Iran has made no progress to resolve the issues.\n\nWith this new resolution, the IAEA Board sends a strong and renewed message of support for the IAEA and its Director-General's relentless efforts to address the issue. The Board will not sit idly by when Iran challenges the foundations of the non-proliferation system and undermines the credibility of the international safeguards regime. Iran must cooperate with the Agency and provide technically credible explanations which satisfy the Agency's questions. This resolution supports the Agency to pursue its dialogue with Iran to clarify all outstanding safeguards issues, while setting the stage for further steps to hold Iran to account if it fails to make concrete progress.\n\nIf Iran meaningfully cooperates with the Agency, and the Director General is able to report that the unresolved safeguards issues are no longer outstanding, the Board could then close its consideration of this matter. We hope Iran takes this opportunity to resolve these outstanding matters so that no further Board action is necessary.\n\n/Public Release.

We encourage the Director General to keep the Board informed of all relevant activities and developments.\n\nIt is no surprise that the IAEA's report once again confirms that Iran continues to escalate its proliferation sensitive nuclear activities, moving even further from its JCPoA commitments. Much of Iran's nuclear programme is unprecedented for a state without a nuclear weapons programme.\n\nChair,\n\nIn the reporting period, Iran has continued enriching uranium far beyond its JCPoA commitments. It now possesses 30 times the JCPoA limit of enriched uranium and its stockpile of high enriched uranium up to 60 % has continued to grow significantly. Iran now has three IAEA significant quantities of highly enriched uranium, which the IAEA defines as the approximate amount of nuclear material from which the possibility of manufacturing a nuclear explosive device cannot be excluded. The DG also reports that Iran continues to prepare for new enrichment capacities at the Fuel Enrichment Plant, where new cascades of centrifuges could be installed soon.\n\nWe recall previous IAEA reports of Iran's uranium metal-related work. The production of Uranium metal is a key step for the development of a nuclear weapon. We urge Iran not to undertake this work again.\n\nFor years now, the Agency's JCPoA-related verification and monitoring has been seriously affected by Iran's refusal to implement its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPoA, including Iran's decision to have all of the Agency's JCPOA-related surveillance and monitoring equipment removed.\n\nAs a consequence, and as the DG reiterates in his report, the Agency has lost continuity of knowledge in relation to the production and inventory of centrifuges, rotors and bellows, heavy water and UOC. The IAEA does not know, for example, how many centrifuges Iran has and where they are located.\n\nThe DG notes that it has been more than three years since Iran stopped applying its Additional Protocol. Iran has also not reversed its decision to withdraw the designations for experimented inspectors. All of these decisions made by Iran have detrimental implications for the Agency's ability to provide assurance of the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme.\n\nChair,\n\nThe E3 have consistently worked towards a diplomatic solution. In 2022 Iran twice refused a negotiated outcome which would have returned Iran to compliance with the JCPoA. Instead, Iran has chosen to escalate and to expand its nuclear programme to alarming levels.\n\nWe therefore urge Iran:\n\nThese steps would help rebuild the urgently needed trust between Iran and the international community, a trust that has been further eroded by recent statements made in Iran about its technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and the possibility of changing its nuclear doctrine.\n\nChair,\n\nIran's escalating nuclear activities significantly harm international security and undermine the global non-proliferation architecture. We will continue consultations, alongside international partners, on how best to address the increasing doubts about the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme. We remain committed to a diplomatic solution and stand ready to use all diplomatic levers available to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.\n\nFinally, we ask the Director General to keep the Board of Governors informed on the status of Iran's nuclear programme. We ask for the report to be made public.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enriched uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Governors_of_the_International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifuge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centrifuge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_explosive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear explosive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavy water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The resolution proposed by Germany, France, and Britain criticized Iran for \"moving away from its JCPOA commitments.\" It called on Iran to immediately stop its nuclear \"escalation\" and comply with the limits established by the JCPOA, a pact signed in 2015 regarding the West Asian country's nuclear program.\n\nJCPOA a dead pact killed by the West\n\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action went down the drain when in 2018, Washington decided to pull out from the pact it had signed along with Iran, Germany, Britain, France, Russia, and China. Subsequently, the White House imposed severe sanctions on Iran, thereby breaching the crucial article of the deal that had encouraged Iran to participate in the first place.\n\n\"When the E3 criticizes Iran for not fully complying with the JCPOA, it essentially disregards the real reason why Tehran is scaling back on its commitments: the JCPOA is now dead because of the West,\" said Reza Mir Taher, an expert on strategic affairs. \"For 1.5 years after the U.S. left the deal, Iran remained fully committed while it waited for Europe to make the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX) work.\"\n\nEstablished in early 2019, INSTEX was a special-purpose vehicle (SPV) created by Germany, Britain, and France with the goal of enabling non-USD and non-SWIFT transactions with Iran in order to circumvent U.S. sanctions. The system was ultimately dismantled by Europe in 2023 after failing to facilitate any transactions between Iran and the European trio.\n\n\"How do Europeans expect Iran to comply with the JCPOA when they themselves have not? Where is the logic in that? It is only natural that Iran thinks of the deal as useless,\" Mir Taher added.\n\nWestern hopes for Iran's upcoming elections\n\nBefore the recent adoption of a new anti-Iran resolution by the IAEA Board of Governors on Wednesday, Iran's Head of the Atomic Energy Organization, Mohammad Esmali, issued a stern warning that his country would respond firmly to any further provocative actions.\n\nIn a joint statement after the meeting, Iran, Russia, and China said they still consider the JCPOA valid, asking the West to return to implementing the deal instead of putting unnecessary pressure on Tehran.\n\nGiven that the resolution lacks binding force, the decision by Europe to escalate tensions with Iran following the UN nuclear watchdog's recent productive visit to the country raises questions. One plausible explanation could be linked to the upcoming presidential elections in Iran. Some analysts suggest that the resolution may be a deliberate move to provide an edge to Iranian candidates who are more conciliatory towards the West during upcoming televised debates. Specific contenders have a reputation for leveraging the nuclear program dispute to instill fear in Iranian society and secure electoral support.\n\n\"It is unfortunately true that some candidates have instrumentalized important issues in the past to rally support. I think contenders from across the political spectrum need to understand that such an approach is only detrimental to our national interests,\" Mir Taher stated.\n\nLeader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei ordered snap elections in line with Iran's constitution after President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian lost their lives during a helicopter crash on May 19.\n\nThe politicians who have nominated themselves to run for president hold different political views.

Russia, China and Iran have called on Western countries to restore the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) for Iran's nuclear program, according to a joint statement dedicated to the sixth meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors.\n\n\"The People's Republic of China, the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Russian Federation are convinced that it is time for Western countries to demonstrate political will, stop the continued cycle of escalation that has been going on for almost two years and take the necessary steps towards the revival of the JCPOA. This can still be done,\" the statement reads.\n\nThe three countries believe that the nuclear deal's resumption could make it possible to resolve the majority of issues related to Iran's nuclear program, particularly by providing IAEA inspectors with broad monitoring tools. Russia, China and Iran are confident that a fully operational nuclear deal would help ease tensions, benefitting all parties.\n\nMoscow, Beijing and Tehran emphasized that the JCPOA provisions demanding Iran ensure the civilian character of its nuclear program remained valid. In this regard, the three countries highlighted the need for the international community to treat Iran like any other party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons developing its own nuclear industry.\n\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, was signed by Iran, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (Russia, the United Kingdom, China, the United States and France) and Germany in 2015. The future of the deal was called into question after the United States withdrew from it unilaterally in 2018 under the Trump administration. Meanwhile, incumbent US President Joe Biden has repeatedly signaled that Washington was ready to return to the nuclear deal. In April 2021, Russia, Britain, Germany, China, the United States and France entered negotiations with Iran in Vienna in an effort to restore the JCPOA to its original form. However, the talks ended without any result in November 2022.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 233, "textEnd": 239}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Concerns remain high that Iran might build its own atomic bomb.\n\nThe resolution follows a precedent 18 months ago, when the IAEA ordered Iran to comply with a years-long investigation by the agency into traces of uranium found at undeclared sites.\n\nWhile the number of sites has dropped from three to two, Iran has never provided satisfactory answers, keeping things under wrap, thus raising questions about the real purpose of its nuclear programme, which it claims to be for civilian, not military use.\n\nSince the last resolution, the list of problems and critical issues facing the IAEA in Iran has grown, hence the call to provide satisfactory answers to the many unresolved issues.\n\nIn September, Iran banned many of the IAEA's top experts on enrichment, a measure that the agency's director general Rafael Grossi branded as \"disproportionate and unprecedented\". The Iranian decision, he added, represents a \"very serious blow\" to the agency's ability to do its job.\n\nLast month, Grossi met with Iranian officials, hoping to break the deadlock on the particle probe and the inspectors, but also to expand monitoring to parts of Iran's nuclear programme covered under the 2015 deal with major powers. No significant progress has been made so far.\n\nIn recent years, Tehran has progressively violated the terms of the nuclear deal. The first steps date back to 2019, in response to then-President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the JCPOA in May 2018 and the reintroduction of the harshest sanctions in history, which led to a collapse of the Iranian economy.\n\nA temporary agreement expired on 24 June 2021. Since then, various parties have been working on a new deal, without much success, while Trump's successor, President Joe Biden has maintained the sanctions.\n\nMany unresolved questions remain, including Iran's inability or unwillingness to explain the traces of uranium in three undeclared sites. Little progress has been made under ultraconservative President Ebrahim Raisi, who died on 19 May.", "source": {"uri": "asianews.it", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asia News.it"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Grossi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Grossi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Great power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.asianews.it/files/img/IMG_2260.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 3020, "textEnd": 3026}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-05-", "textStart": 2466, "textEnd": 2474}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

We would like to thank the Director General for his report on safeguards in Iran. We commend the Agency for its continued efforts to engage Iran to clarify and resolve the outstanding safeguards issues.\n\nChair,\n\nIt has been five years since the Agency first detected nuclear material at Turquzabad, and four years since nuclear material was detected at Varamin. In that time, the Board has, on numerous occasions, expressed its concern about these issues. We recall the last resolution adopted by this Board in November 2022, when the Board decided it was essential and urgent that Iran clarify all outstanding safeguards issues. One and a half years later, the Director General's latest report shows that once again, Iran has made no progress to resolve these issues. Instead of implementing this resolution and resolving outstanding issues, Iran has taken further negative steps, including announcing the development of new facilities without providing design information to the Agency, in clear violation of its legal obligations under Modified Code 3.1.; and de-designating several experienced Agency inspectors essential to the Agency's verification work. These actions show Iran's flagrant disregard for its safeguards obligations and the work of the IAEA.\n\nChair,\n\nOver a year has passed since Iran and the IAEA signed their Joint Statement in March 2023. Iran has not implemented the commitments it signed up to in this statement, despite ample time and space to do so. Nor has Iran implemented the agreements it made with the IAEA in March 2022, December 2021, September 2021, and August 2020. Indeed, Iran has made repeatedly clear that it does not feel bound to implement any voluntary commitments with the Agency that were agreed in good faith.\n\nChair,\n\nOver five years, Iran has been given unprecedented opportunities to clarify and resolve the open safeguards questions - issues which call into question the credibility of Iran's safeguards declarations and the possibility of undeclared nuclear material in Iran today. No other Member State has been afforded such time and patience by this Board to resolve issues critical to the correctness and completeness of its safeguards declarations. Whilst these issues remain unresolved, the Agency has made clear that it is unable to assure that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful. At a time when Iran's nuclear programme has never been more advanced, this is of grave concern to us all. This is especially the case when Iran has made several public statements on its technical capability to build a nuclear weapon, and possible changes to its nuclear doctrine - in contradiction with Iran's obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nChair, colleagues,\n\nWe believe it is now necessary that the Board take action to send a clear message to Iran that it cannot continue on its path, and that it must urgently co-operate with the Agency to resolve these issues, as it is legally obliged to do under its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement under the NPT. We therefore propose to the Board a resolution on this issue. We must demonstrate our resolve and our collective responsibility as Board members to renew our support to the DG and the Agency's efforts to ensure that safeguards are implemented in a fair and objective manner.\n\nFor the sake of the integrity of the international non-proliferation architecture and ultimately, global security, we cannot allow Iran to evade its obligations any longer. Our utmost objective is to provide full support to the Agency and the Director-General and call upon Iran to provide the substantive cooperation required to clarify and resolve all outstanding safeguards issues.\n\nOur draft resolution submitted for the Board's consideration contains the following main points:\n\nChair,\n\nWe have been repeatedly clear that once Iran co-operates fully and the DG confirms that all questions have received technically credible answers, and that Iran fulfils its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement obligations, this Board will no longer need to consider this item. But this can only take place when Iran demonstrates full, unambiguous and sustained co-operation with the Agency. We believe the renewed call in this resolution is essential to support the Director General's efforts. We sincerely hope that Iran recognises the seriousness of these issues and takes the opportunity to resolve them. As we have expressed before, reaching this outcome would be a significant success for Iran, for the IAEA, and for the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.\n\nChair,\n\nWe are fully aware of the current political context in Iran. However, it remains vital that Iran does not continue on the path of escalation while delaying urgently needed co-operation with the IAEA. This is why we see the need for the Board to act now - 18 months after the last resolution and 15 months after the last Joint Statement.\n\nChair,\n\nOur delegations have engaged broadly with Board members to explain our thinking, to solicit their feedback, and to listen to their views on these matters. We thank the many states that contributed to this process for this resolution and request the resolution be derestricted and made public once it is adopted.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varamin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Varamin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Varamin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Stamps", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Stamps", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-08-", "textStart": 1833, "textEnd": 1844}], "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

We encourage the Director General to keep the Board informed of all relevant activities and developments.\n\nIt is no surprise that the IAEA's report once again confirms that Iran continues to escalate its proliferation sensitive nuclear activities, moving even further from its JCPoA commitments. Much of Iran's nuclear programme is unprecedented for a state without a nuclear weapons programme.\n\nChair,\n\nIn the reporting period, Iran has continued enriching uranium far beyond its JCPoA commitments. It now possesses 30 times the JCPoA limit of enriched uranium and its stockpile of high enriched uranium up to 60 % has continued to grow significantly. Iran now has three IAEA significant quantities of highly enriched uranium, which the IAEA defines as the approximate amount of nuclear material from which the possibility of manufacturing a nuclear explosive device cannot be excluded. The DG also reports that Iran continues to prepare for new enrichment capacities at the Fuel Enrichment Plant, where new cascades of centrifuges could be installed soon.\n\nWe recall previous IAEA reports of Iran's uranium metal-related work. The production of Uranium metal is a key step for the development of a nuclear weapon. We urge Iran not to undertake this work again.\n\nFor years now, the Agency's JCPoA-related verification and monitoring has been seriously affected by Iran's refusal to implement its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPoA, including Iran's decision to have all of the Agency's JCPOA-related surveillance and monitoring equipment removed.\n\nAs a consequence, and as the DG reiterates in his report, the Agency has lost continuity of knowledge in relation to the production and inventory of centrifuges, rotors and bellows, heavy water and UOC. The IAEA does not know, for example, how many centrifuges Iran has and where they are located.\n\nThe DG notes that it has been more than three years since Iran stopped applying its Additional Protocol. Iran has also not reversed its decision to withdraw the designations for experimented inspectors. All of these decisions made by Iran have detrimental implications for the Agency's ability to provide assurance of the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme.\n\nChair,\n\nThe E3 have consistently worked towards a diplomatic solution. In 2022 Iran twice refused a negotiated outcome which would have returned Iran to compliance with the JCPoA. Instead, Iran has chosen to escalate and to expand its nuclear programme to alarming levels.\n\nWe therefore urge Iran:\n\nThese steps would help rebuild the urgently needed trust between Iran and the international community, a trust that has been further eroded by recent statements made in Iran about its technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and the possibility of changing its nuclear doctrine.\n\nChair,\n\nIran's escalating nuclear activities significantly harm international security and undermine the global non-proliferation architecture. We will continue consultations, alongside international partners, on how best to address the increasing doubts about the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme. We remain committed to a diplomatic solution and stand ready to use all diplomatic levers available to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.\n\nFinally, we ask the Director General to keep the Board of Governors informed on the status of Iran's nuclear programme. We ask for the report to be made public.", "source": {"uri": "gov.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "gov.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enriched uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifuge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Centrifuge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_explosive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear explosive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heavy water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.gov.uk/assets/static/govuk-opengraph-image-03837e1cec82f217cf32514635a13c879b8c400ae3b1c207c5744411658c7635.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

We would like to thank the Director General for his report on safeguards in Iran. We commend the Agency for its continued efforts to engage Iran to clarify and resolve the outstanding safeguards issues.\n\nChair,\n\nIt has been five years since the Agency first detected nuclear material at Turquzabad, and four years since nuclear material was detected at Varamin. In that time, the Board has, on numerous occasions, expressed its concern about these issues. We recall the last resolution adopted by this Board in November 2022, when the Board decided it was essential and urgent that Iran clarify all outstanding safeguards issues. One and a half years later, the Director General's latest report shows that once again, Iran has made no progress to resolve these issues. Instead of implementing this resolution and resolving outstanding issues, Iran has taken further negative steps, including announcing the development of new facilities without providing design information to the Agency, in clear violation of its legal obligations under Modified Code 3.1.; and de-designating several experienced Agency inspectors essential to the Agency's verification work. These actions show Iran's flagrant disregard for its safeguards obligations and the work of the IAEA.\n\nChair,\n\nOver a year has passed since Iran and the IAEA signed their Joint Statement in March 2023. Iran has not implemented the commitments it signed up to in this statement, despite ample time and space to do so. Nor has Iran implemented the agreements it made with the IAEA in March 2022, December 2021, September 2021, and August 2020. Indeed, Iran has made repeatedly clear that it does not feel bound to implement any voluntary commitments with the Agency that were agreed in good faith.\n\nChair,\n\nOver five years, Iran has been given unprecedented opportunities to clarify and resolve the open safeguards questions - issues which call into question the credibility of Iran's safeguards declarations and the possibility of undeclared nuclear material in Iran today. No other Member State has been afforded such time and patience by this Board to resolve issues critical to the correctness and completeness of its safeguards declarations. Whilst these issues remain unresolved, the Agency has made clear that it is unable to assure that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful. At a time when Iran's nuclear programme has never been more advanced, this is of grave concern to us all. This is especially the case when Iran has made several public statements on its technical capability to build a nuclear weapon, and possible changes to its nuclear doctrine - in contradiction with Iran's obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nChair, colleagues,\n\nWe believe it is now necessary that the Board take action to send a clear message to Iran that it cannot continue on its path, and that it must urgently co-operate with the Agency to resolve these issues, as it is legally obliged to do under its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement under the NPT. We therefore propose to the Board a resolution on this issue. We must demonstrate our resolve and our collective responsibility as Board members to renew our support to the DG and the Agency's efforts to ensure that safeguards are implemented in a fair and objective manner.\n\nFor the sake of the integrity of the international non-proliferation architecture and ultimately, global security, we cannot allow Iran to evade its obligations any longer. Our utmost objective is to provide full support to the Agency and the Director-General and call upon Iran to provide the substantive cooperation required to clarify and resolve all outstanding safeguards issues.\n\nOur draft resolution submitted for the Board's consideration contains the following main points:\n\nFirst, the Board would express continued, strong support for the Agency's professional and impartial efforts in carrying out its mandate to verify the implementation of Iran's safeguards obligations.\n\nSecond, the Board would reiterate its decision that it is essential and urgent, in accordance with Article 18 of Iran's NPT Safeguards Agreement, that Iran fulfil its legal obligations and take the specific actions called for by the Director General without delay. The Board would also call on Iran to implement without delay the Joint Statement between the IAEA and Iran of 4 March 2023, reverse its withdrawal of the designations of several experienced Agency inspectors and implement Modified Code 3.1, the application of which Iran has no right to unilaterally suspend in the first place.\n\nThird, following years of Iran's failure to co-operate to resolve these issues, this resolution also recognises that continued failure by Iran to resolve these issues may necessitate the production, by the Director General, of a comprehensive and updated assessment on the presence or use of undeclared nuclear material in connection with past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear programme.\n\nChair,\n\nWe have been repeatedly clear that once Iran co-operates fully and the DG confirms that all questions have received technically credible answers, and that Iran fulfils its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement obligations, this Board will no longer need to consider this item. But this can only take place when Iran demonstrates full, unambiguous and sustained co-operation with the Agency. We believe the renewed call in this resolution is essential to support the Director General's efforts. We sincerely hope that Iran recognises the seriousness of these issues and takes the opportunity to resolve them. As we have expressed before, reaching this outcome would be a significant success for Iran, for the IAEA, and for the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.\n\nChair,\n\nWe are fully aware of the current political context in Iran. However, it remains vital that Iran does not continue on the path of escalation while delaying urgently needed co-operation with the IAEA. This is why we see the need for the Board to act now - 18 months after the last resolution and 15 months after the last Joint Statement.\n\nChair,\n\nOur delegations have engaged broadly with Board members to explain our thinking, to solicit their feedback, and to listen to their views on these matters. We thank the many states that contributed to this process for this resolution and request the resolution be derestricted and made public once it is adopted.\n\nThank you, Chair.\n\n/Public Release.

"Iran has called on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to observe impartiality in its reports on the country's nuclear activities, emphasizing that Tehran has fully complied with its commitments under the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement.\n\nThe remarks were made in an explanatory note issued by Iran's Permanent Mission to the United Nations Office and other international organizations in Vienna on Tuesday, outlining the Islamic Republic's views on two recent reports by the IAEA's director general to its Board of Governors.\n\nIran has made every effort to enable the IAEA to effectively carry out its verification activities in the country, including safeguards and monitoring measures that are unique to the IAEA's verification regime, the document said.\n\nIt also emphasized that Iran's decision to suspend the implementation of its JCPOA (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) commitments was fully in line with the country's inherent rights under the nuclear deal, in response to the illegal US withdrawal from the agreement and the inability of the E3 to adhere to their commitments.\n\nIran further denounced E3's decision to refrain from implementing their sanctions-lifting commitments, describing it as \"an unlawful act\" and another blatant example of their failure to fully comply with their obligations under both the JCPOA and UN Security Council Resolution 2231.\n\nThe document also stated that from a legal point of view, the IAEA's assessments are based on unreliable information and invalid documents provided by Israel that not only constantly conspires against Iran's relations with the agency, but also commits sabotage, attacks, and threat of attacks against the Islamic Republic.\n\nRecently, persistent political pressure exerted by certain countries has reached a point where even technically resolved issues are subsequently changed in the IAEA's reports, contrary to what was agreed upon, it said.\n\nThese politically-motivated pressures prevent the agency from performing its professional and impartial role, the document added.\n\nOn Monday, Rafael Grossi, the director general of IAEA, repeated his previous claims about lack of cooperation on Iran's side on certain issues, including its refusal to allow several Agency inspectors to continue to carry out missions in Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nHe also claimed that Iran has yet to provide the IAEA with \"technically credible explanations\" about the presence of uranium particles at two of its nuclear sites.\n\nIran and world powers reached a landmark nuclear agreement in 2015, under which Tehran curbed parts of its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of sanctions imposed on the Iranian economy.\n\nTehran started to suspend some of its obligations under the agreement in 2019, a year after the US government, under Donald Trump, abandoned the deal and reinstated sanctions on Iran.\n\nIran then agreed to some additional IAEA inspections under the Joint Statement and resolved issues related to one of the three sites and the alleged presence of uranium particles there.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType":

Grossi said the stockpile of Iran's enriched uranium continues to grow while it has been three years since the agency last had access in Iran.\n\nThe IAEA is facing difficulties in both monitoring and gaining credible information about Iran's nuclear programme. Grossi highlighted that the agency has lost \"continuity of knowledge\" and further stated that Iran has not provided adequate explanations for the presence of uranium reported at the undeclared sites of Varamin and Turquzabad. The director general said that these outstanding safety concerns, including Iran's withdrawal of agency inspectors, means the IAEA is currently \"not in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful.\"\n\nIn 2015, Iran entered into a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, otherwise known as the \"Iran Nuclear Deal,\" with China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States to ensure that Iran's nuclear programme will be exclusively peaceful. The US has since withdrawn from the deal and subsequently released a joint statement with the Governments of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, stating that \"Iran must fully cooperate with the IAEA to enable it to provide assurances that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful, and to re-designate the inspectors suspended in September 2023.\"\n\nMariano Grossi travelled to Tehran in early May for meetings with Iran officials which were referred to in his address. The result of previous discussions was a joint statement between Iran and the IAEA agreeing to further cooperation.

Among the 35 countries on the board, China and Russia voted against the resolution, while 12 other developing countries, including South Africa, India, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and T\u00fcrkiye, abstained.\n\n\"Facts have proved time and again that creating confrontation and exerting pressure will not solve the (Iran nuclear) issue, but will undermine the cooperation between the IAEA and Iran and further complicate the issue,\" Li said.\n\nLi noted that the IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi paid a successful visit to Iran in early May and has maintained constructive exchanges with the Iranian side, and both sides have been committed to pushing forward the IAEA's safeguards work in Iran.\n\nIran has just observed national mourning following the death of President Ebrahim Raisi and is set to hold a presidential election later this month, Li also pointed out. \"In this special context, certain countries' move to provoke confrontation for political purposes is unconstructive for the political settlement of the Iran nuclear issue.\"\n\nThe Chinese envoy stressed the importance of returning to the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\nThe United States, as the JCPOA saboteur, should fully demonstrate its sincerity and work with all parties to restore the complete and effective implementation of the JCPOA, Li said.\n\nChina urges all parties to view the current situation in a calm and responsible manner, take concrete actions to support the strengthening of cooperation between IAEA and Iran, and bring the political and diplomatic efforts to resolve the Iran nuclear issue back to the right track, Li added.\n\nIran signed the JCPOA with world powers in July 2015, agreeing to restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. However, the United States withdrew from the agreement in May 2018, reinstating sanctions and prompting Iran to scale back some of its nuclear commitments.\n\nEfforts to revive the JCPOA began in April 2021 in Vienna, but despite multiple rounds of negotiations, no substantial progress has been reported since the last talks in August 2022. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn",

We encourage the Director General to keep the Board informed of all relevant activities and developments.\n\nIt is no surprise that the IAEA's report once again confirms that Iran continues to escalate its proliferation sensitive nuclear activities, moving even further from its JCPoA commitments. Much of Iran's nuclear programme is unprecedented for a state without a nuclear weapons programme.\n\nChair,\n\nIn the reporting period, Iran has continued enriching uranium far beyond its JCPoA commitments. It now possesses 30 times the JCPoA limit of enriched uranium and its stockpile of high enriched uranium up to 60 % has continued to grow significantly. Iran now has three IAEA significant quantities of highly enriched uranium, which the IAEA defines as the approximate amount of nuclear material from which the possibility of manufacturing a nuclear explosive device cannot be excluded. The DG also reports that Iran continues to prepare for new enrichment capacities at the Fuel Enrichment Plant, where new cascades of centrifuges could be installed soon.\n\nWe recall previous IAEA reports of Iran's uranium metal-related work. The production of Uranium metal is a key step for the development of a nuclear weapon. We urge Iran not to undertake this work again.\n\nFor years now, the Agency's JCPoA-related verification and monitoring has been seriously affected by Iran's refusal to implement its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPoA, including Iran's decision to have all of the Agency's JCPOA-related surveillance and monitoring equipment removed.\n\nAs a consequence, and as the DG reiterates in his report, the Agency has lost continuity of knowledge in relation to the production and inventory of centrifuges, rotors and bellows, heavy water and UOC. The IAEA does not know, for example, how many centrifuges Iran has and where they are located.\n\nThe DG notes that it has been more than three years since Iran stopped applying its Additional Protocol. Iran has also not reversed its decision to withdraw the designations for experimented inspectors. All of these decisions made by Iran have detrimental implications for the Agency's ability to provide assurance of the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme.\n\nChair,\n\nThe E3 have consistently worked towards a diplomatic solution. In 2022 Iran twice refused a negotiated outcome which would have returned Iran to compliance with the JCPoA. Instead, Iran has chosen to escalate and to expand its nuclear programme to alarming levels.\n\nWe therefore urge Iran:\n\nTo immediately halt its nuclear escalation and refrain from making threats to produce nuclear weapons;To return to the limits imposed by the JCPoA, in particular those regarding enrichment;To implement the commitments it made regarding transparency and cooperation with the IAEA including re-applying all transparency measures that it stopped in February 2021;To re-implement and swiftly ratify its Additional Protocol; andTo reverse its September 2023 decision to withdraw the designations of experienced inspectors.\n\nThese steps would help rebuild the urgently needed trust between Iran and the international community, a trust that has been further eroded by recent statements made in Iran about its technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and the possibility of changing its nuclear doctrine.\n\nChair,\n\nIran's escalating nuclear activities significantly harm international security and undermine the global non-proliferation architecture. We will continue consultations, alongside international partners, on how best to address the increasing doubts about the peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear programme. We remain committed to a diplomatic solution and stand ready to use all diplomatic levers available to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.\n\nFinally, we ask the Director General to keep the Board of Governors informed on the status of Iran's nuclear programme. We ask for the report to be made public.\n\nThank you.\n\n/Public Release.

One board member state did not vote, according to the report.\n\n\"The decision made by Western countries was both hasty and unwise,\" the Iranian Mission to the U.N. told Newsweek, \"and it will undoubtedly have a detrimental effect on the process of diplomatic engagement and constructive cooperation.\"\n\nWashington's decision to back the move came despite reservations from President Joe Biden's administration, which has officially sought a return to the multilateral nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The historic deal, which lifted international sanctions on Iran in exchange for restrictions to its nuclear program, was forged under President Barack Obama in 2015 and unilaterally abandoned by President Donald Trump in 2018.\n\nSince the return of U.S. sanctions, Iran has gradually reduced its commitments to the deal. Negotiations pursued under Biden to restore full U.S. and Iranian participation in the JCPOA ultimately unraveled in late 2022.\n\nFollowing an IAEA report issued last week highlighting even higher levels of Iranian uranium enrichment above JCPOA limits, Atomic Energy Organization of Iran Director Mohammed Eslami told reporters Tuesday that Tehran would continue to take steps away from the agreement until sanctions were again lifted.\n\nIran has always maintained that it did not seek to develop a nuclear weapon, a position held for decades in line with a fatwa, an Islamic religious ruling, issued by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nBut a number of senior Iranian officials, including an adviser to Khamenei, have come out in recent months suggesting potential shifts to the doctrine in the event that the nation was threatened directly by Israel amid soaring regional tensions over the war in Gaza.\n\nLast month, the Iranian Mission to the U.N. told Newsweek that \"Iran's nuclear doctrine remains unchanged\" and \"Iran will continue to adhere to the Supreme Leader's fatwa, which unequivocally prohibits the production, procurement, stockpiling, and use of any form of weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\nHowever, the Mission added at the time that \"in the event of an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, all of which are subject to monitoring and inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency, there exists a possibility of Iran reconsidering its collaboration within the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the IAEA and the U.S. State Department for comment.\n\nPrior to the vote on Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador to the IAEA Laura Holgate referred to \"a deeply troubling and steady drumbeat of recent statements from senior Iranian officials threatening that Iran may reconsider its stated nuclear doctrine and asserting that Iran has all the technical capabilities needed to quickly to build nuclear weapons should it decide to do so.\"\n\nShe also accused Tehran of failing to sufficiently cooperate with the IAEA and of responding to the watchdog's resolutions \"with escalation instead of cooperation.\"\n\nStill, she argued that, \"make no mistake, it is important that resolutions be tied to a broader strategy,\" and called for the censure to \"be a first step in a strategy aimed at achieving a sustainable, effective solution to Iran's nuclear program that includes full cooperation with the IAEA.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"},

We would like to thank the Director General for his report on safeguards in Iran. We commend the Agency for its continued efforts to engage Iran to clarify and resolve the outstanding safeguards issues.\n\nChair,\n\nIt has been five years since the Agency first detected nuclear material at Turquzabad, and four years since nuclear material was detected at Varamin. In that time, the Board has, on numerous occasions, expressed its concern about these issues. We recall the last resolution adopted by this Board in November 2022, when the Board decided it was essential and urgent that Iran clarify all outstanding safeguards issues. One and a half years later, the Director General's latest report shows that once again, Iran has made no progress to resolve these issues. Instead of implementing this resolution and resolving outstanding issues, Iran has taken further negative steps, including announcing the development of new facilities without providing design information to the Agency, in clear violation of its legal obligations under Modified Code 3.1.; and de-designating several experienced Agency inspectors essential to the Agency's verification work. These actions show Iran's flagrant disregard for its safeguards obligations and the work of the IAEA.\n\nChair,\n\nOver a year has passed since Iran and the IAEA signed their Joint Statement in March 2023. Iran has not implemented the commitments it signed up to in this statement, despite ample time and space to do so. Nor has Iran implemented the agreements it made with the IAEA in March 2022, December 2021, September 2021, and August 2020. Indeed, Iran has made repeatedly clear that it does not feel bound to implement any voluntary commitments with the Agency that were agreed in good faith.\n\nChair,\n\nOver five years, Iran has been given unprecedented opportunities to clarify and resolve the open safeguards questions - issues which call into question the credibility of Iran's safeguards declarations and the possibility of undeclared nuclear material in Iran today. No other Member State has been afforded such time and patience by this Board to resolve issues critical to the correctness and completeness of its safeguards declarations. Whilst these issues remain unresolved, the Agency has made clear that it is unable to assure that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful. At a time when Iran's nuclear programme has never been more advanced, this is of grave concern to us all. This is especially the case when Iran has made several public statements on its technical capability to build a nuclear weapon, and possible changes to its nuclear doctrine - in contradiction with Iran's obligations under the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\nChair, colleagues,\n\nWe believe it is now necessary that the Board take action to send a clear message to Iran that it cannot continue on its path, and that it must urgently co-operate with the Agency to resolve these issues, as it is legally obliged to do under its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement under the NPT. We therefore propose to the Board a resolution on this issue. We must demonstrate our resolve and our collective responsibility as Board members to renew our support to the DG and the Agency's efforts to ensure that safeguards are implemented in a fair and objective manner.\n\nFor the sake of the integrity of the international non-proliferation architecture and ultimately, global security, we cannot allow Iran to evade its obligations any longer. Our utmost objective is to provide full support to the Agency and the Director-General and call upon Iran to provide the substantive cooperation required to clarify and resolve all outstanding safeguards issues.\n\nOur draft resolution submitted for the Board's consideration contains the following main points:\n\nChair,\n\nWe have been repeatedly clear that once Iran co-operates fully and the DG confirms that all questions have received technically credible answers, and that Iran fulfils its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement obligations, this Board will no longer need to consider this item. But this can only take place when Iran demonstrates full, unambiguous and sustained co-operation with the Agency. We believe the renewed call in this resolution is essential to support the Director General's efforts. We sincerely hope that Iran recognises the seriousness of these issues and takes the opportunity to resolve them. As we have expressed before, reaching this outcome would be a significant success for Iran, for the IAEA, and for the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.\n\nChair,\n\nWe are fully aware of the current political context in Iran. However, it remains vital that Iran does not continue on the path of escalation while delaying urgently needed co-operation with the IAEA. This is why we see the need for the Board to act now - 18 months after the last resolution and 15 months after the last Joint Statement.\n\nChair,\n\nOur delegations have engaged broadly with Board members to explain our thinking, to solicit their feedback, and to listen to their views on these matters. We thank the many states that contributed to this process for this resolution and request the resolution be derestricted and made public once it is adopted.", "source": {"uri": "gov.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "gov.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varamin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Varamin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Varamin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Stamps", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Stamps", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://www.gov.uk/assets/static/govuk-opengraph-image-03837e1cec82f217cf32514635a13c879b8c400ae3b1c207c5744411658c7635.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-08-", "textStart": 1675, "textEnd": 1686}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

At worst, it will succeed in steadily augmenting its nuclear program penalty-free, enabling it to build a nuclear weapon more quickly than Western powers could detect and stop. This would cause regional nuclear proliferation and irreparable damage to the IAEA and the NPT.\"\n\nSeparately, the Islamic Republic is also in violation of the 2015 nuclear deal, having enriched large quantities of uranium up to both the 20% and 60% levels, far above the permitted 3.67% level, and dangerously close to the 90% weaponized level.\n\nIn contrast to Albright's position, the US government is reportedly opposed to confronting Iran at this stage because of a mix of concern that Tehran might escalate the situation into a crisis right as the US presidential election season comes to its most crucial point as well as concerns that Iran could choose to aggravate the ongoing Israel-Hamas-Hezbollah-Yemen war.\n\nThere is also a debate between the EU and the US about whether any new pressure will make any difference after Iran president Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash and elections for his replacement are not set to take place until June 28.", "source": {"uri":

In the Ukraine-Russia conflict, despite billions in aid to Ukraine, the country remains far from a decisive victory. Additionally, Biden has struggled to align Netanyahu with the U.S. policy and has been unable to control Hamas. Iran since the scrapping of JCPOA deal, have strengthened its efforts towards uranium enrichment. U.S. efforts to halt this have been thwarted by primarily by fours reasons; the failure of IAEA inspections; unable to block the black-market that is supplying Iran with nuclear resources, unable to halt knowledge and equipment transfer from Iran allies, and Biden also eased severe sanctions imposed upon Iran during the Trump administration.\n\nBiden's approach to control Iran's nuclear program has faltered, with neither aggression nor appeasement yielding results as Tehran remains particularly hostile towards the U.S. The Middle East faces increasing instability, with Israel, an undeclared nuclear power, engaged in conflict with Hamas, which is backed by Iran -- a nation on the verge of becoming a nuclear power itself. The prospect of nuclear hostility between Israel and Iran is growing.\n\nThese issues not only highlight Biden's foreign policy failures but also signify a broader decline in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nA recent International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report has sparked renewed concerns about US foreign policy failure in curbing Iran's nuclear program. The report revealed a significant increase in Iran's enriched uranium stockpile, surpassing the limits established by the 2015 nuclear deal, which reignited fears about Iran's nuclear intentions.\n\nThe IAEA report underscored a critical development: Iran's enriched uranium stockpile has surged significantly in recent months. Since February, Iran's stockpile has increased by 1,489.8 pounds, far exceeding the 661-pound limit established by the 2015 nuclear deal. Notably, Iran now possesses around 313.2 pounds of uranium enriched to 60%, which is close to weapons-grade levels. While precise figures are debated as IAEA is being barred from inspections after September 2023, the trend indicates that Iran's nuclear program is nearing completion.\n\nThe international community remains deeply divided on how to address Iran's nuclear activities. Countries like the United States and Israel view Iran's program as a covert effort to develop nuclear weapons and have advocated for stringent sanctions to halt it entirely while maintaining their own arsenals. In contrast, nations like Russia and China argue that Iran's nuclear endeavors are for peaceful purposes, such as electricity generation, and have opposed harsh measures.\n\nExperts suggest that the shift in U.S. policy is a contributing factor. The Trump administration's \"maximum pressure\" sanctions had a notably detrimental effect on Iran's economy and its nuclear program. The Biden administration, however, took a more lenient approach, which aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal after Trump's withdrawal, even though Iran had lost interest in the JCPOA. This change inadvertently provided Iran with some breathing room. Biden's policy shifted from maximum pressure to appeasement, including the release of $6 billion unfrozen assets for Iran. It was a misjudgment by Biden's team to assume that Iran would utilize these funds solely for \"humanitarian purposes.\"\n\nThe newly found financial flexibility has reportedly allowed Iran to bolster its nuclear activities from which it supported militant groups in the region. These groups have been linked to attacks on US targets, Israel, and other critical infrastructure, further destabilizing an already volatile region. A drone strike perpetrated by Iranian-backed militants struck a U.S. military base in northeast Jordan, situated precariously close to the Syrian border resulted in the loss of three Americans and left at least 25 others wounded. The incident served as a stark reminder of the declining US power. Iran also launched a direct missile attack against Israel, marking its direct confrontation with Israel and its allies.\n\nThe international community, particularly European allies, is increasingly frustrated with the situation. They see the US approach lacking a clear strategy and potentially undermining efforts to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions for its own election. Frustration is simmering as they perceive the US approach towards Iran's nuclear program to be riddled with inconsistencies and is without a coherent long-term strategy. As Biden administration is prioritizing domestic politics over decisive action.\n\nThe future trajectory of Iran's nuclear program remains uncertain. Continued inaction or wrong action could lead to further enrichment and a potential arms race in the Middle East. Biden has to realize that regional security needs to take precedence over personal politics, as a nuclear Iran will exacerbate tensions with undeclared nuclear power, Israel, in the region.",

This level of enrichment is just a technical step from 90% enrichment, considered weapons grade.\n\nAccording to the IAEA definition, it is technically possible to create an atomic bomb with roughly 42 kilograms (92.5 pounds) of uranium enriched to 60% if the material is further enriched to 90%.\n\nIran has continued to ramp up enrichment, while maintaining that its nuclear program is strictly peaceful.\n\nHowever, Western powers claim there is no credible civilian explanation for Tehran's nuclear activities. In 2022, the IAEA issued a report saying it could not \"provide assurances that Iran's nuclear program is exclusively peaceful.\"\n\nAccording to the IAEA, Iran's total stockpile of enriched uranium now stands at 6,201.3 kilograms (13,671.5 pounds) -- a 675.8 kilogram (1,489.8 pound) increase in three months.\n\nFollowing meetings with officials in Iran earlier this month, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi told reporters that Tehran's cooperation with the organization has been \"completely unsatisfactory\" in recent months and urged the country to adopt \"concrete\" measures to address concerns.\n\nThere have also been recent Iranian threats of a push towards the bomb. On May 9, an adviser to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei said Tehran will weaponize its nuclear program if Israel \"threatens its existence.\"\n\nTwo weeks ago, a lawmaker close to the regime suggested that the country might already possess an atomic bomb, saying, \"In my opinion, we have achieved nuclear weapons, but we do not announce it.\" JNS", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news",

Political brinkmanship in light of international efforts to handle Iran's nuclear case is not constructive, they said in a statement.\n\nThe group went on to call upon the Board of Governors to work towards putting Iran's nuclear issue back on the rails, and encourage further dialogue and constructive cooperation between the IAEA and the Islamic Republic.\n\nThe non-constructive and confrontational approach of the authors of the draft resolution against Iran sends a message to the international community that a slender majority is enough to exploit the decision-making process in the Board of Governors, the statement also read.\n\nIf the resolution is passed, they warned, it will be another miscalculation that will inevitably lead to confrontation.\n\nIran and world powers reached a landmark nuclear agreement in 2015, under which Tehran curbed parts of its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of sanctions imposed on the Iranian economy.\n\nTehran started to suspend some of its obligations under the agreement in 2019, a year after the US government, under Donald Trump, abandoned the deal and reinstated sanctions on Iran.\n\nIran then agreed to some

the presence of uranium particles found at two undeclared locations in Iran.\n\n\"A continued failure\" by Iran to provide full cooperation on the years-long probe \"may necessitate\" a comprehensive assessment by IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, the text said.\n\n- 'Devoid of any legal basis' -\n\nThe resolution also says Iran has to \"reverse its withdrawal of the designations of several experienced Agency inspectors\", and \"without delay\" reconnect the cameras used to monitor nuclear activities.\n\nThe text also notes the \"concerns\" surrounding \"recent public statements made in Iran... regarding its technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons and possible changes to Iran's nuclear doctrine\".\n\nFollowing intense negotiations with the US, the resolution was modified to secure Washington's support.\n\nCensure motion\n\nAlthough symbolic in nature at this stage, the censure motion aims to raise diplomatic pressure on Iran, with the option to potentially refer the issue to the UN Security Council.\n\nIn the past, similar resolutions have prompted Tehran to retaliate by removing surveillance cameras and other equipment from its nuclear facilities and ratcheting up its uranium enrichment activities.\n\nTehran, which has already threatened \"a serious and effective response, slammed the censure motion as \"devoid of any legal, technical and political basis\".",

Program - Iran Front Page", "body": "The remarks were made in an explanatory note issued by Iran's Permanent Mission to the United Nations Office and other international organizations in Vienna on Tuesday, outlining the Islamic Republic's views on two recent reports by the IAEA's director general to its Board of Governors.\n\nIran has made every effort to enable the IAEA to effectively carry out its verification activities in the country, including safeguards and monitoring measures that are unique to the IAEA's verification regime, the document said.\n\nIt also emphasized that Iran's decision to suspend the implementation of its JCPOA (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) commitments was fully in line with the country's inherent rights under the nuclear deal, in response to the illegal US withdrawal from the agreement and the inability of the E3 to adhere to their commitments.\n\nIran further denounced E3's decision to refrain from implementing their sanctions-lifting commitments, describing it as \"an unlawful act\" and another blatant example of their failure to fully comply with their obligations under both the JCPOA and UN Security Council Resolution 2231.\n\nThe document also stated that from a legal point of view, the IAEA's assessments are based on unreliable information and invalid documents provided by Israel that not only constantly conspires against Iran's relations with the agency, but also commits sabotage, attacks, and threat of attacks against the Islamic Republic.\n\nRecently, persistent political pressure exerted by certain countries has reached a point where even technically resolved issues are subsequently changed in the IAEA's reports, contrary to what was agreed upon, it stressed\n\nThese politically-motivated pressures prevent the agency from performing its professional and impartial role, the document added.\n\nOn Monday, Rafael Grossi, the director general of IAEA, repeated his previous claims about lack of cooperation on Iran's side on certain issues, including its refusal to allow several Agency inspectors to continue to carry out missions in Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nHe also claimed that Iran has yet to provide the IAEA with \"technically credible explanations\" about the presence of uranium particles at two of its nuclear sites.\n\nIran and world powers reached a landmark nuclear agreement in 2015, under which Tehran curbed parts of its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of sanctions imposed on the Iranian economy.\n\nTehran started to suspend some of its obligations under the agreement in 2019, a year after the US government, under Donald Trump, abandoned the deal and reinstated sanctions on Iran.\n\nIran then agreed to some additional IAEA inspections under the Joint Statement and resolved issues related to one of the three sites and the alleged presence of uranium particles there.", "source": {"uri": "ifpnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Most agreements are with countries that have committed to not possessing nuclear weapons. The IAEA is the verification authority to enforce the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).\n\nThere are 35 member countries on the IAEA Board of Governors, which meets five times a year.\n\nThe IAEA has about 2,500 employees.\n\nIAEA safeguard programs monitor nuclear reactors to make sure nuclear material is not being diverted for making weapons.\n\nThe IAEA sends out inspectors to monitor reactors.\n\nThe IAEA helps countries prepare and respond to emergencies.\n\nThere are more than 417 nuclear power reactors in operation.\n\nThere are more than 50 nuclear power reactors under construction.\n\nThere are more than 90 operational nuclear reactors in the United States.\n\nFrance has a 62.6% share of nuclear power to total electricity generation, the highest percentage of nuclear energy in the world.\n\n1942 - The world's first nuclear chain reaction takes place in Chicago as part of the Manhattan Project, a US research program aimed at developing the first nuclear weapons.\n\nJuly 16, 1945 - The United States conducts its first nuclear weapons test in New Mexico.\n\nDecember 1951 - Electricity is first generated from a nuclear reactor at the National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho.\n\nOctober 3, 1952 - The United Kingdom conducts its first nuclear weapons test.\n\nDecember 8, 1953 - In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, President Dwight D. Eisenhower asks the world's major powers to work together in developing peacetime uses of the atom. This is known as the Atoms for Peace program, and 40 countries participate. Also during this speech, Eisenhower proposes the creation of an international agency to monitor the spread of nuclear technology.\n\nJune 26, 1954 - In the Soviet Union, the first nuclear power plant is connected to an electricity grid to provide power to residences and businesses in a town near Moscow.\n\n1957 - The IAEA is established to facilitate the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\n\n1950's - Brazil and Argentina begin research and development of nuclear reactors.\n\nMarch 28, 1979 - A partial meltdown of the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant occurs in Middletown, Pennsylvania. It is determined that equipment malfunctions, design-related problems and human error led to the accident.\n\nMarch 11, 2011 - A 9.0 magnitude earthquake strikes near the coast of Honshu, Japan, creating a massive tsunami. The tsunami knocks out the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant's cooling systems. The cores of three of six reactors are damaged by overheating. Resulting hydrogen explosions blow apart the buildings surrounding two reactors.\n\nMay 30, 2011 - Germany announces it will abandon the use of all nuclear power by the year 2022. This repeals a 2010 plan to extend the life of the country's nuclear reactors.\n\nNovember 11, 2013 - Iran signs an agreement with the IAEA, granting inspectors access to nuclear sites.\n\nJuly 14, 2015 - After 20 months of negotiations, Iran reaches a comprehensive agreement (The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA)), with the United States and other countries that is aimed at reining in Iran's nuclear program. In exchange for limits on its nuclear activities, Iran will get relief from sanctions while being allowed to continue its atomic program for peaceful purposes.\n\nAugust 11, 2015 - Japan restarts a nuclear reactor on the island of Kyushu. It's the country's first reactor to come back online since the 2011 tsunami.\n\nJanuary 16, 2016 - The IAEA confirms that Iran has taken all of the steps outlined in the nuclear deal, allowing for sanctions to be lifted, as per the agreement.\n\nMay 8, 2018 - US President Donald Trump announces that the United States will withdraw from JCPOA and will be imposing \"the highest level of economic sanction\" against Iran. In Tehran, Rouhani says Iran will take a few weeks to decide how to respond to the US withdrawal, but Rouhani says he had ordered the country's \"atomic industry organization\" to be prepared to \"start our industrial enrichment without limitations.\"\n\nMay 8, 2019 - Rouhani announces a partial withdrawal from the JCPOA.\n\nFebruary 16, 2021 - The IAEA reports it received a February 15 letter from Iran stating that it will stop implementing provisions of the additional monitoring protocol as of February 23. This will effectively limit which facilities nuclear inspectors can scrutinize and when they can access them, making it harder for experts to determine if Tehran is attempting to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nFebruary 18, 2021 - The Joe Biden administration releases a statement indicating that the United States is willing to sit down for talks with Tehran and other signatories to the Iran nuclear deal, before either side has taken tangible action to salvage or return to compliance with the agreement.\n\nFebruary 21, 2021 - In a joint statement, the IAEA and Iran announce they have reached a deal in which Iran will give IAEA inspectors continued access to verify and monitor nuclear activity in the country for the next three months.\n\nMarch 15, 2023 - A spokesman from the IAEA tells CNN in an email that \"approximately 2.5 tons of natural uranium\" contained in 10 drums were found to be missing from supplies held in Libya during an inspection on March 14, 2023.\n\nJuly 7, 2023 - IAEA Director General Grossi tells CNN that Japan's plan to start releasing treated radioactive water into the ocean in August is safe and there is no better option to deal with the massive buildup of wastewater collected since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, but public anxiety remains high.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

However, France, Germany, the UK, and the US have chosen a different path, \"ignoring the common goal of resuming JCPOA implementation because of their own political considerations,\" the statement claimed.\n\nRevising the JCPOA would be a \"win-win\" for all sides, Iran, Russia, and China argued. Among other things, it would answer most of the questions the international community has regarding \"Iran's peaceful nuclear program\" and would provide the IAEA with more extensive tools to monitor and verify Tehran's activities in the field, they stated.\n\n\"It is time for Western countries to show political will, stop the endless cycle of escalation... and take the necessary step to revive the JCPOA,\" the statement added. It is still possible to salvage the agreement and Tehran, Moscow, and Beijing are fully prepared to do this, the document stressed.\n\nREAD MORE: 'No evidence' Iran developing nuclear weapons - IAEA\n\nOn Tuesday, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Mohammad Eslami, said the country is \"currently in the phase of reduction of commitments\" under the JCPOA.

non-compliance with the JCPOA to the Board of Governors and the UN Security Council respectively.\n\nHe further noted that the reports prepared by Director General of the IAEA Rafael Grossi include two sections regarding the JCPOA as well as the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Safeguards Agreement.\n\nCountermeasure\n\nAsked about a move by Britain, France and Germany late on

at the United States for withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal and preventing other countries from cooperating with Iran.\n\nHe underscored that the AEOI complies with Articles 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, and does not accept any action that would harm interaction between Iran and the IAEA.\n\nThe JCPOA's Articles 26 and 36 allow the deal's signatories to scale back their commitments should the

Twenty states voted in favor of the censure, while two states, China and Russia, opposed and 12 abstained.\n\nThe resolution demands that Iran reverse its threatening nuclear advances, restore IAEA monitoring and the designation of key agency inspectors, and enter into compliance with its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) obligations -- including a five-year IAEA investigation into Iran's alleged nuclear weapons work. The resolution also suggests the IAEA may need to issue a comprehensive report on the regime's non-compliance with NPT safeguards. During the meeting, the board also took note of new IAEA reports that indicate Iran is inching closer to a nuclear weapon, increasing its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60 percent -- a short step from the weapons-grade level of 90 percent. Tehran has said it will take retaliatory nuclear steps in response to the IAEA resolution.\n\n\"IAEA member states voted today to uphold the Non-Proliferation Treaty and IAEA safeguards. Now comes the difficult part: developing a strategy for weathering Iran's countermoves and restoring a transatlantic pressure campaign to roll back Tehran's nuclear advances. The alternative is continuing to let Iran creep toward the nuclear threshold with impunity.\" -- Andrea Stricker, FDD Research Fellow and Deputy Director of FDD's Nonproliferation and Biodefense Program\n\n\"An IAEA board resolution that calls out Iran for non-compliance with its most basic nuclear obligations is one of the least provocative pressure tools available. If the United States and its allies give in to threats from Tehran over a piece of paper, they will never be serious about doing all it takes to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapon.\" -- Richard Goldberg, FDD Senior Advisor\n\n\"The fact that the E3 had to shame Washington into a resolution censuring Tehran for nuclear non-compliance is an embarrassment. Three years into Biden's term, the administration is signaling major risk aversion in the face of a fast-expanding Iranian nuclear program. Tehran will read the tea leaves in Washington and may not be willing to stop its nuclear march.\" -- Behnam Ben Taleblu, FDD Senior Fellow\n\nFrance, the United Kingdom, and Germany (known as the \"E3\") presented the draft resolution despite initial U.S. opposition to the plan. Washington ultimately voted for the resolution after failing to dissuade its European allies from moving forward.\n\nIAEA censure resolutions create political pressure for states to comply with nonproliferation obligations. Iran's failure to comply with the resolution's demands could ultimately lead to Washington, its European allies, and other partners referring Tehran's case to the UN Security Council (UNSC) for non-compliance. At the UNSC, the United States, France, or the United Kingdom could trigger the reimposition of all the UN Iran sanctions that were lifted under the 2015 Iran nuclear deal's implementation of UNSC Resolution 2231, including arms, drone, and missile embargoes, and restrictions on Tehran's nuclear activities. A statement by the U.S. ambassador to the IAEA, Laura S.H. Holgate, hinted at an \"inflection point\" where states would need to decide on whether to reimpose these sanctions before the mechanism for doing so expires in October 2025.\n\n\"Amid New Iranian

The resolution calls on the regime to increase its cooperation with the IAEA and to lift its recent ban on inspectors and diplomats.\n\nDuring the three days of the Board of Governors meeting, numerous statements and warnings were made by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi and representatives from European countries and the United States regarding the regime's intentions behind violating its commitments to the IAEA.\n\nIn his opening remarks, the Director General of the IAEA expressed concern about the regime's increased stockpile of enriched uranium, stating, \"Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium continues to increase, including that enriched up to 60%.\"\n\nHe added, \"It has been more than three years since Iran stopped provisionally applying its Additional Protocol and therefore it is also over three years since the Agency was able to conduct complementary access in Iran.\"\n\nGrossi also stated, \"There has been no progress in resolving the outstanding safeguards issues. Iran has not provided the Agency with technically credible explanations for the presence of uranium particles of anthropogenic origin at Varamin and Turquzabad or informed the Agency of the current location(s) of the nuclear material and/or of contaminated equipment.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters, the draft resolution presented by France, the United Kingdom, and Germany initially faced resistance from the United States but eventually received its support. In a statement, the US ambassador to the IAEA said, \"Given Iran's lack of cooperation with the IAEA and our commitment to collective action in support of the Agency and the NPT, the United States supports this resolution.\"\n\nSimultaneously with the Board of Governors meeting, several US Senators submitted a resolution to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, calling for the referral of the regime's nuclear case to the UN Security Council.\n\nThe signatories of the resolution Biden administration to \"pursue censure of Iran at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), refer the issue to the United Nations Security Council, and reaffirm that all measures will be taken to prevent the regime in Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.\"\n\nThe European Union also issued a statement expressing concern over the continued worrying expansion of the Iranian regime's nuclear program, stating, \"The EU is gravely concerned that the Agency is still not in a position to provide assurance that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful, due to Iran's lack of cooperation.\"\n\nThe statement also added, \"We urge Iran to resume the provisional implementation of the Additional Protocol and to bring it into force, to enable the Agency to provide credible assurances on the absence of undeclared nuclear activities.\"\n\nIn a statement, Maryam Rajavi, the president-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) described the resolution as \"inevitable and necessary but wholly inadequate.\"\n\nMrs. Rajavi emphasized that in view of the regime's continued defiance and violations of UN Resolution 2231, it is time for the immediate application of the snapback mechanism. She urged that all resolutions concerning the regime's nuclear activities be enforced and that the nuclear file be referred to the United Nations Security Council. This action is long overdue, she said.\n\nMrs. Rajavi noted that adopting a firm policy against the mullahs' regime, including \"the use of the snapback mechanism, referring its nuclear dossier to the Security Council, placing the regime under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, naming the IRGC as a terrorist organization, and recognizing the resistance and the struggle of the resistance units and the rebellious youth against the suppressive Revolutionary Guards, is an imperative for security and tranquility in this critical region of the world, and for preventing a belligerent dictatorship from obtaining the atomic bomb.\"\n\nThe NCRI Secretariat's statement also noted that the \"policy of appeasement, endless negotiations, and undue concessions have allowed the regime to advance its nuclear ambitions without significant repercussions, providing it with ample opportunity.\"\n\nA month ago, a key adviser to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the head of the regime's Strategic Council on Foreign Relations spoke of changing the regime's \"nuclear doctrine\" towards building a nuclear bomb, brazenly stating that the regime \"has the capacity to produce a nuclear bomb.\"\n\nIt is past time that the international community puts the appeasement policy toward Tehran behind them and start supporting the people of Iran, who are the world's main allies against a terrorist regime that is racing to obtain a nuclear bomb.", "source": {"uri": "english.mojahedin.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It follows up on the last resolution 18 months ago that ordered Iran's regime to comply with a years-long IAEA investigation into uranium traces found at undeclared sites. Iran's regime has yet to give the IAEA satisfactory answers on how the traces got there.\n\n\"The need for the Board to hold Iran accountable to its legal obligations is long overdue. Iran must urgently, fully and unambiguously co-operate with the Agency,\" Britain, France and Germany said in a statement to the Board on the resolution they proposed, according to Reuters.\n\nIn a statement, Mrs. Maryam Rajavi, President-elect of the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), described the resolution of the IAEA Board of Governors as \"inevitable and necessary but wholly inadequate.\"\n\nMrs. Rajavi emphasized that in view of the regime's continued defiance and violations of UN Security Council Resolution 2231, \"it is time for the immediate application of the snapback mechanism.\" She urged that all resolutions concerning the regime's nuclear activities be enforced and that the regime's nuclear dossier be referred to the United Nations Security Council. \"This action is long overdue,\" she said.\n\nThe UN Security Council Resolution 2231, adopted on July 20, 2015, terminated previous UN sanctions against Iran's regime and set out a process for monitoring and verifying its compliance with the nuclear deal, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. It outlined specific nuclear-related measures Iran's had to take to curb its nuclear activities and allow UN inspectors to monitor its sites. Iran's regime has been in breach of its commitments for years.\n\nIn September 2023, Tehran barred many IAEA inspectors from visiting its sites, which IAEA chief Rafael Grossi called \"disproportionate and unprecedented\" and a \"very serious blow\" to the agency's ability to do its job properly. Grossi met regime officials in Iran last month in the hope of breaking a deadlock on the particles probe and the inspectors and to expand IAEA monitoring to parts of Iran's nuclear program that were covered under the JCPOA.\n\nThe new resolution by the Board of Governors calls on Iran's regime \" to reverse its withdrawal of the designations of several experienced Agency inspectors which is essential to fully allow the Agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.\"\n\nMrs. Rajavi noted that adopting a firm policy against the mullahs' regime, including \"the use of the snapback mechanism, referring its nuclear dossier to the Security Council, placing the regime under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, naming the IRGC as a terrorist organization, and recognizing the resistance and the struggle of the resistance units and the rebellious youth against the suppressive Revolutionary Guards, is an imperative for security and tranquility in this critical region of the world, and for preventing a belligerent dictatorship from obtaining the atomic bomb.\"\n\nThe Iranian Resistance has revealed details of the Iranian regime's nuclear weapons program in over 100 news conferences since 1991, including crucial, secretive sites like Natanz and Arak in 2002.\n\nHowever, the west's policy of appeasement, endless negotiations, and undue concessions have allowed the regime to advance its nuclear ambitions without significant repercussions, providing it with ample opportunity to advance its nefarious ambitions.\n\nA month ago, a key adviser to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the head of the regime's Strategic Council on Foreign Relations spoke of changing the regime's \"nuclear doctrine\" towards building a nuclear bomb, brazenly stating that the regime \"has the capacity to produce a nuclear bomb.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.mojahedin.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Nuclear Watchdog Censures Iran and Demands Access for Inspectors", "body": "The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency on Wednesday censured Iran over its refusal to grant inspectors access to its uranium enrichment program, passing a carefully worded resolution after the United States toned it down in a bid to avoid provoking a crisis at a time in which the Middle East is already roiling.\n\nThe resolution was sponsored by France, Britain and Germany in response to advances in Iran's nuclear program over the past year and the Iranian's government's refusal to cooperate with the agency. By most estimates Tehran is now just days or weeks away from being able to produce bomb-grade fuel for roughly three nuclear weapons, though actually fashioning them into warheads could take a year or more.\n\nThe resolution passed in a vote of the 35-member board of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations body, with 20 votes in favor, 12 abstentions and two against. The no votes were cast by Russia and China. Russia has close security ties to Iran and purchases Iranian drones for the war in Ukraine. China is a close economic ally helping Iran evade sanctions by purchasing its oil at a discounted rate.\n\nNine years ago, when Iran agreed to sharp limits on its nuclear program in a deal reached with the Obama administration and European nations, both Russia and China joined the effort to contain Tehran's nuclear capabilities. The vote in Vienna on Wednesday made clear how dramatically their position has shifted.\n\nWhile I.A.E.A. censure resolutions are not legally binding, they do carry political weight. In November 2022, the board passed a similar resolution that was drafted by the same three European countries, demanding that Iran cooperate with investigations into uranium traces found at suspected former nuclear sites. Iran never complied.\n\nThe Biden administration, though, was clearly concerned about avoiding a resolution that was so sharply worded that it could set off a backlash in Tehran. American officials said that they shared the Europeans' concern, but that they did not want to back an unenforceable resolution that might prompt Iran to escalate its nuclear program at a time it is seeking to defuse tensions in the region.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriched_uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enriched uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/08/25/world/05iran-nuclear/25us-israel-intel-sub-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Nothing has happened at the Vienna talks on the restoration of the JCPOA for several months, and this is largely due to the past midterm elections in the United States,\" Ulyanov said, adding, \"The elections are over - it's time to get together again and complete the negotiation marathon, there are all the conditions for this.\"\n\nUnderlining Iran's constructive attitude, the Russia diplomat said, \"The Western negotiators are aware of this. But instead of finalizing the deal, they are introducing a resolution that inevitably and at least temporarily undercuts the Vienna negotiation process.\"\n\nHe pointed out that \"the paradox is that the resolution was presented by four Western participants in the Vienna talks on the restoration of the nuclear deal, including the U.S., which in the past has shown a slightly more responsible approach than the Europeans.\"\n\nIran strongly condemned the resolution and has taken some measures in response to it, including the initiation of uranium enrichment at the Fordow nuclear plant to the purity of 60 percent.\n\nIranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said the resolution was tabled with \"political aims.\"\n\n\"It was put on the agenda of the U.S. and the European trio, to mount pressures on the Islamic Republic of Iran,\" said the spokesman, adding that the resolution was issued while Iran has had the most transparent peaceful nuclear program in the world with regards to the number of the nuclear installations under the supervision of the IAEA worldwide. Kanaani added Tehran has let the Agency conduct the highest number of inspections and verifications.\n\nDescribing the resolution as a \"destructive and irrational move,\" Kanaani said unfortunately instrumental use of international organizations against independent nations has turned into a norm in the foreign policy of the West.\n\nThe spokesman pointed out that the Islamic Republic will never give in to the pressure, reiterating Iran will continue its peaceful nuclear program proportional to its needs and in line with its rights and commitments under the international treaties to which it is a member state.\n\nKanaani then touched on Iran's response to the resolution. \"In response to the recent move by the U.S. and the three European countries in approving the anti-Iran resolution, at the first stage Tehran has put a few measures on the agenda of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) that were implemented on Sunday at the enrichment sites of Martyr Ahmadi Roshan (in Natanz) and Dr. Alimohammadi (in Fordow) with the IAEA inspectors in attendance,\" he said in a statement.\n\nHe concluded, \"Any time the Western sides return to their commitments and abide by their obligations, and put an end to the political moves, the Islamic Republic of Iran will react proportionately, while pursuing its inalienable rights.\"\n\nIran's response was quick. According to a statement by the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI), Iran installed a set of the more advanced IR6 centrifuges at the Natanz nuclear plant, a move that will further accelerate Iran's uranium enrichment to the level of 60 percent.", "source": {"uri": "tehrantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tehran Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The document reflected Tehran's resolve to provide for IAEA inspection and monitoring as well as readiness on the part of Iran to give the Agency access to three nuclear facilities.", "source": {"uri": "tass.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TASS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Bagheri", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ali Bagheri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TASS", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TASS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs_(Germany)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister for Foreign Affairs (Germany)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Students'_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Students' News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diplomat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Grossi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafael Grossi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 125, "textEnd": 131}, {"amb": false, "date": "-03-04", "textStart": 1002, "textEnd": 1009}], "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Due to Iran's prolonged failure to address outstanding safeguards issues, the Agency is once again unable to assure that Iran's nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful.\n\nChair,\n\nIn his report, the DG once again reports that Iran has provided no technically credible explanations regarding the outstanding safeguards investigations into Turquzabad and Varamin, over five years since these investigations began. This is contrary to both Iran's legal obligations under its NPT Safeguards Agreement and Iran's commitments under the Joint Statement of March 2023 to cooperate with the Agency and provide further information. We also note the Agency's assessment of the nuclear material discrepancy at the Esfahan Uranium Conversion Facility and recognise that the material balance of the uranium involved in uranium metal production experiments conducted at Jabr Bin Hayan Laboratories included an amount of nuclear material unaccounted for, \"which cannot be explained by accountancy measurement errors.\" This is of particular concern as undeclared uranium metal experiments were conducted at the same laboratories in Iran between 1995 and 2002. We take note of the Agency's ongoing evaluations related to the uranium metal production experiments.\n\nAs long as such cases exist and are not fully clarified, there remains reasonable doubt about the nature of Iran's nuclear activities.\n\nWe are especially concerned by Iran's continued refusal to apply Modified Code 3.1, which is a legal obligation that Iran cannot unilaterally suspend or modify. Iran is the only State with significant nuclear activities that is not implementing Modified Code 3.1 as part of its NPT Safeguards Agreement. This refusal prevents the Agency from obtaining early design information for new nuclear facilities necessary to prepare its safeguards approach, and leaves it reliant on open-source information in the absence of formal declarations from Iran. Given Iran's recent history of undeclared nuclear facilities and past unresolved questions as well as several public statements on Iran's technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons, Iran's action further fuels serious doubts over whether Iran's nuclear activities remain exclusively peaceful.\n\nWe also continue to regret that, despite repeated requests by the DG since last September, Iran has still not reversed the de-designation of several experienced IAEA inspectors. As the DG previously reported, Iran's extreme and unjustified decision effectively made the Agency's independent technical work subject to political interpretation. Its reversal remains essential to fully allow the Agency to conduct its verification activities in Iran effectively.\n\nChair, The E3 commend the DG's long-standing efforts to remain open to constructive engagement with Iran. Instead of seizing these opportunities to engage constructively with the DG to resolve all outstanding questions, Iran has consistently failed to offer any immediate concrete actions. This resolution is put forward after Iran has not reacted in substance to the previous resolution for 18 months, it comes after the cases have been unsolved for five whole years. For a very long time we have waited patiently for substantial Iranian cooperation with the Agency, but to no avail.\n\nChair,\n\nWe have been asking Iran for five years to engage in good faith and comply with its legal obligations. It is now time for the Board of Governors to hold Iran accountable. In order to stress the international community's resolve and to strengthen our collective support to the DG and the Agency's efforts to implement Iran's NPT Safeguards.\n\nAgreement, we have tabled the draft resolution before you. As we have long called for, Iran must urgently, fully and unambiguously co-operate with the Agency, and we are determined to support the Agency to this end.\n\nShould there be no significant change in Iran's actions in the near future, the Board must be ready to act further, including by making a finding under Article 19 of Iran's CSA. For the sake of the integrity of the international non-proliferation architecture and ultimately, global security, we cannot allow Iran to evade its NPT safeguards obligations year after year. Therefore, we call on all Governors to support this important and timely proposal.\n\nChair,\n\nWe once again thank the DG for his commitment and express our unwavering support to the Agency for their impartial and professional work on the issue. We encourage the DG to continue to report to the Board in a timely manner and ask for the report contained in GOV/2024/29 to be derestricted and made public.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_on_the_Non-Proliferation_of_Nuclear_Weapons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_material", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear material"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varamin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Varamin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Varamin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States of Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear weapon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isfahan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Isfahan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Isfahan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_proliferation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear proliferation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confederate States of America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concrete"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Green", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6784313725490196, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

This is contrary to both Iran's legal obligations under its NPT Safeguards Agreement and Iran's commitments under the Joint Statement of March 2023 to cooperate with the Agency and provide further information. We also note the Agency's assessment of the nuclear material discrepancy at the Esfahan Uranium Conversion Facility and recognise that the material balance of the uranium involved in uranium metal production experiments conducted at Jabr Bin Hayan Laboratories included an amount of nuclear material unaccounted for, \"which cannot be explained by accountancy measurement errors.\" This is of particular concern as undeclared uranium metal experiments were conducted at the same laboratories in Iran between 1995 and 2002.

This refusal prevents the Agency from obtaining early design information for new nuclear facilities necessary to prepare its safeguards approach, and leaves it reliant on open-source information in the absence of formal declarations from Iran. Given Iran's recent history of undeclared nuclear facilities and past unresolved questions as well as several public statements on Iran's technical capabilities to produce nuclear weapons, Iran's action further fuels serious doubts over whether Iran's nuclear activities remain exclusively peaceful.\n\nWe also continue to regret that, despite repeated requests by the DG since last September, Iran has still not reversed the de-designation of several experienced IAEA inspectors.

Nuclear news - Tasnim News Agency", "body": "TEHRAN (Tasnim) - The Iranian Foreign Ministry condemned the move by a number of members of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors to pass a politically-motivated and unconstructive resolution against Iran.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday night, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Nasser Kanaani strongly condemned the IAEA Board of Governors' resolution, which has criticized Iran.\n\nCondemning the proposal and adoption of the anti-Iranian resolution as a \"political and unconstructive\" measure, the spokesman said it follows the previous failed policies of a number of Western countries and amounts to an attempt at the political abuse of the international mechanisms against sovereign states.\n\nIran is committed to continued technical cooperation with the IAEA within the framework of its international rights and duties and in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and the Safeguards Agreement, he stated.\n\nKanaani underlined that the recent resolution could by no means undermine Iran's determination to continue employing peaceful nuclear energy and carrying out its nuclear development plans in compliance with its rights enshrined in the relevant international treaties.\n\nHis comments came after the UN nuclear watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution on Wednesday calling on Iran to step up cooperation with the IAEA and reverse what it called the barring of inspectors.\n\nThe motion brought by the UK, France and Germany -but opposed by China and Russia- at the IAEA Board is the first of its kind since November 2022.\n\nThe resolution was carried by 20 votes in favor -including the US, which initially was reluctant for fear of aggravating Middle East tensions- with 12 abstentions and one country not participating.", "source": {"uri": "tasnimnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The justification for the resolution is that while Tehran consistently denies seeking a bomb, its program continues to rapidly advance and expand.\n\nAccording to the IAEA, Iran is the only country enriching uranium up to 60% and accumulating significant quantities of highly enriched uranium, or HEU. The Institute for Science and International Security in London writes in an analysis of the agency'' findings on the truthfulness of Iran's atomic project: \"The total capacity of centrifuges for producing weapon grade uranium (WGU) is sufficient, as 25 kilograms (kg) of WGU, for roughly eight nuclear weapons in one month, ten in two months, twelve in three months, and thirteen in four months.\"\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nThe institute warns that with Iran's increasingly experienced uranium enrichment capacity, even using only a portion of its highly enriched uranium stockpile, Iran could produce its first 25 kg of weapons-grade uranium in about a week. If Iran delays inspector access, rapid detection of this uranium diversion may be challenging.\n\nRevelations of Iran's resistance: Using a cover of academic research\n\nThe National Council of Resistance of Iran, or NCRI, a dissident group that calls for the overthrow of the radical Islamic regime ruling Iran and offers what many consider a viable alternative to it, revealed the existence of an organization called SPND - which in English translates to the Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research.\n\nRecently, NCRI revealed that during the presidency of Ebrahim Raisi, specific changes were made within this organization managing nuclear weapons production to divert attention and prevent the real objectives of SPND from being exposed to the International Atomic Energy Agency. One of these changes involved utilizing Islamic Azad University and its extensive scientific facilities for this research. Islamic Azad University is Iran's largest university complex - according to regime data, it has over one million students - and provides services to the regime's weapons program. According to information obtained from the National Council of Resistance, the regime transferred several key individuals of the nuclear weapons project to Islamic Azad University to continue their work under its cover.\n\nRaisi, the president of Iran who was killed in a helicopter crash in northern Iran on May 19, appointed Mohammad Islamian, one of the senior officers of the Revolutionary Guards, as the head of the Atomic Energy Organization to expand the regime's nuclear activities. Islamian, as the head of the Revolutionary Guards Research Center in the 1980s, had obtained a nuclear weapons program through Abdul Qadir Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear bomb.\n\nConfronting Iran's nuclear ambitions\n\nThe fact that Tehran is a step away from a nuclear bomb and has framed its program like the sword of Damocles over Mideast and Western peace and security is largely the result of Western appeasement policies toward the country. The Iranian regime seeks to extort from Western nations while escaping the military consequences for the havoc it has unleashed in the Middle East.\n\nNevertheless, contrary to popular misconceptions, Tehran is currently at its weakest point in years. In this weakness, the death of Raisi has dealt an irreparable and strategic blow to the Iranian theocracy. The presence of figures like Ali Larijani, who served as speaker of Parliament for three terms, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, president from 2005 to 2013, as candidates in the early presidential elections, while disqualified in previous elections in favor of Raisi, demonstrates the significant weakness of the Tehran dictatorship.\n\nThe world should not allow endless nuclear negotiations to be Tehran's response to international pressure due to its human rights abuses and warmongering. Nor should it allow the arming of such a regime with nuclear weapons - the ultimate tool for the mullahs' future extortion attempts.\n\nFor 25 years, WND has boldly brought you the news that really matters.

General Comments\n\n1. The Islamic Republic of Iran has complied fully with its obligations including Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (INFCIRC/214) and has done its utmost to enable the Agency to effectively carry out its verification activities in Iran, including C/S measures on Iran's nuclear material and activities.\n\n2. The separation of issues divided under two different reports has not been duly respected. Some JCPOA related matters have been repeated in the NPT Safeguards report and vice versa, some NPT Safeguards related matters can been seen in the JCPOA report. As an example, verification and monitoring activities related to centrifuges rotor and bellows manufacturing workshops, should have been defined only in the scope of JCPOA report.\n\n3. Following the United States' unlawful withdrawal from the JCPOA in May 2018 and failure of the E3/EU to fulfill their commitments, in exercising of its rights under paragraphs 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, Iran had ceased all voluntary transparency measures beyond its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (CSA), including implementation of Modified Code 3.1 as specified in para. 13 of the preamble as well as in para. 65 of Annex I to the JCPOA in February 2021.\n\n4. Iran's decision to cease performing its commitments under the JCPOA was fully in accordance with its inherent rights under paragraphs 26 and 36 of the JCPOA and in response to the U.S. unlawful withdrawal from the JCPOA, coupled with the E3's inability to uphold their commitments. This blatant fact, by no means, can constitute a basis for E3 to refrain from implementing their commitments.\n\n5. The E3's decision to refrain from implementing their sanctions-lifting commitments specified in Paragraph 20 of Annex V of the JCPOA on Transition Day (18 October 2023) was an unlawful act and another explicit instance of significant non-performance of their commitments in violation of both the JCPOA and the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231.\n\n6. On the issue related to the so-called two locations, it should be underlined that the origin of the issue goes back to the allegations primarily posed by an ill-intended third party, namely the Israeli regime, which does not have a single commitment to any WMD instruments, including in particular NPT, and repeatedly threatens to attack Iran's nuclear facilities and installations devoted to peaceful purposes, contrary to the numerous GC resolutions, including in particular 407, 1983; 444, 1985; 475, 1987 and 939, 1990, none of which has been respected by this regime. The regime has been so rude that most recently has threatened Iran to nuclear attack. Netanyahu's statement which was broadcasting live across the world saying that \"Iran must face a credible nuclear threat\" and his heritage minister saying that \"dropping a nuclear bomb would be one of the options to attack Hamas is a clear violation of international law.\n\n7. From legal point of view, the assessments of the Agency in its report is based on unreliable information and unauthentic documents provided by a regime which not only constantly plotting against Iran's relation with the Agency, but also committing sabotages, attack, and threat of attack against Iran, along with its brutal policy and genocide against innocent people of Gaza, as recognized now by the international community.\n\n8. In light of further cooperation with the Agency, in recent years, Iran has implemented voluntary measures in the framework of several Joint Statements including the 4th March 2023.\n\n9. Most recently, constant political pressure exerted by few certain States has led to the point that technically resolved issues are later altered in the Agency's reports contrary to what have been agreed upon. These pressures which are politically motivated have impeded the Agency to carry out its professional and impartial role. The Director General on different occasions in his reports expresses sentiment by using unconventional expressions contrary to the technicality and objectivity of such reports, which needs to be avoided.\n\nB. Comments on the NPT Safeguards report (GOV/2024/29), Background:\n\n10. With respect to paragraph 3 of the report (GOV/2024/29), it has to be noted that time and again the Islamic Republic of Iran has reiterated that there has never been any location to be declared under the CSA, including through INFCIRC/1159 dated 23 November 2023, INFCIRC/1131 dated 14 September 2023, INFCIRC/996 dated 7 June 2022, INFCIRC/967 dated 3 December 2021, as well as INFCIRC/1183 dated 7 March 2024. The Agency's claim of undeclared locations has not been supported by authentic safeguards-relevant information document and evidences.\n\n11.On para. 4, once again Iran stresses that there have been no any nuclear material and activity in so called location \"Lavisan-Shian\". This location, as it has been stipulated in footnote 6 of the report, has gone under Agency's extensive verification activities including Complementary Access, accordingly the matter was closed.\n\n12. On paras. 5 and 6, despite there have not been any nuclear material and activity needed to be declared, Iran has so far provided the Agency with its explanations. However, voluntary measures could be considered within the modality to be agreed upon in line with the 4th March 2023 Joint Statement.\n\n13. On para. 6 of the report \"...the Agency's assessment of the undeclared nuclear related activities that were undertaken by Iran at 'Marivan' remains unchanged\" as it was said in paragraph 6 above, the Agency's assessment should not be based on unreliable information and unauthentic documents. Furthermore, there is no added value in referring to some previous arguments confirmed by subsequent information which led to resolution of this issue as specified in the previous Director General's report (GOV/2023/26). However, the details have been reflected in paragraph 8 of INFCIRC/1094 dated 7 June 2023.\n\nC. Comment on the Section C of the Report (GOV/2024/29):\n\n14. On para. 7: \"Varamin\", the following facts need to be considered:\n\nAs it was frequently explained by Iran, there has not been any undeclared location required to be declared under the CSA.\n\nThe allegation of existing \"undeclared pilot-scale plant used between 1999 and 2003\" is not supported by reliable information and authentic documents, rather is based on false and fabricated documents provided by ill-intended entity.\n\nThe Agency's reference to a sole poor quality satellite imagery for assessing that \"... containers removed from Varamin were eventually transferred to Turquzabad ...\" is NOT adequate and correct; there are thousands of similar containers moving around the country. Claim of movement of one container from a location to another, could not be a sound judgement based on such unprovable and imprecise evidence.\n\n15. On para. 8: \"Turquzabad\" the following facts need to be considered:\n\nThe Agency's assessment is not based on authentic information and evidences. Turquzabad is actually an industrial place encompassing various kinds of warehouses and depots for storing detergents, chemicals, foodstuff, fabrics & textiles, vehicles tire and parts, tubes &joints, and some industrial scraps.\n\nAs it has been frequently said, the location in question is industrial scraps storage, movement of containers is a usual activity in that area. Transfer of a container from one area to another which is a usual activity cannot be considered as a solid ground for such allegation.\n\nAs a result of very intensive investigations carried out into the background of activities of this location, except sabotage as the most probable indication, no any other reason has been found for the presence of such particles.\n\nOn the Agency's incorrect assumption of intact removal of containers from the location, the explanations indicating incorrectness of the Agency's assumption, has already been provided to the Agency. However, Iran expresses its readiness to extend the explanations within the modality to be agreed upon in line with the 4th March 2023 Joint Statement.\n\n16. On para.9: The Agency on its previous reports had referred to the so called four undeclared locations, requesting information, which was later provided by Iran and consequently the number of the locations was reduced by the Agency to two. Therefore, the false assumption of undeclared locations which was based on unauthentic information, as a result of Iran's extensive cooperation within the framework of the Joint Statement, was corrected. The remaining two locations could also be addressed through mutual cooperation within the modality to be agreed upon in line with the 4th March 2023 Joint Statement.\n\nC.2. Discrepancy in nuclear material balance\n\n17. On para. 10, following has to be considered:\n\nThe uranium metal arising from declared conversion experiments conducted at the JHL (IRL-), received at the Uranium Conversion Facility, UCF (IRK-), has been frequently verified by the Agency since 2003, including quarterly and yearly, led to satisfactory issuance of relevant 90(a) and 90(b) statements by the Agency.\n\nIran in a letter dated 9 August 2023, in response to the Agency's inquiry, stressed that the mentioned discrepancy emerged at UCF (IRK-) was due to a different and irregular process of recovering uranium from the waste material, known as \"dirty waste\" containing various kinds of unknown elements as impurities. Basically, the difference of material between the starting and ending of recovery process is technically predictable and unavoidable. Although the difference emerged in ending point of recovery was accepted by Iran, the Agency was convinced that the amount initially claimed by the Agency was considerably less than what which has been announced earlier. To this end, several technical discussions on the subject were held between the Agency and Iran. In a technical discussion on 8 November 2023 in Vienna, Iran provided a presentation, based on firm technical documents and proofs, regarding detailed recovery process and its relevant accountancy calculation in IRK- for U-Metal dirty waste dissolution. To resolve this issue, it was agreed in the meeting that the Agency conduct additional verification activities at UCF in earliest possible time.\n\nThe Agency's further verification activities in this regard were conducted on 21, 22 November 2023, 3, 4 December 2023 and 20 December 2023. During these follow-up activities at IRK-, the operator provided details of accountancy calculations for U-Metal dirty waste recovery. Despite the agreement reached with the Agency, and confirmation received dated 2023-12-21for providing assessment including the analysis results of the environmental and destructive assay samples collected at the IRK- by February 2024, the results of these verifications has yet to be shared with Iran. However, the Agency accepted that the amount of SRD was far less than its initial evaluation.\n\n18. On para. 11, it should be mentioned that:\n\nDuring the Agency's DDG and AEOI's Vice-President meeting in Tehran on 29 January 2024 and as a result of a proposal suggested by the DDG, technical discussion was concluded. In his proposal, DDG suggested that without continuing the technical discussion, a correction to the IRK- accountancy records with the agreed amount be submitted to the Agency by Iran, the issue would be resolved without any reflection to IRL-. Accordingly, the required corrected nuclear material accounting reports were provided to the Agency through Iran's letter dated 7 February 2024. The corrected nuclear material accounting reports indicate that all declared amount of uranium contained in the solid waste, sent from JHL to UCF for dissolution, was received at the UCF, and the mentioned shortfall only pertained to UCF (IRK-).\n\nPursuant to this agreement, Iran corrected relevant accountancy records, and the Agency submitted the modified statements for IRK- and IRL- facilities. The Agency in its 90(a) statement dated 2024-02-21 stipulated that the discrepancy in the amount of uranium contained in the solid waste sent from JHL to UCF has been resolved. This resolution has also been reflected exactly as \"resolved\" in footnote 23 of the JCPOA report (GOV/2024/7 dated 26 February 2024). BUT surprisingly without giving any reason, at the same day, the word \"resolved\" has been changed to \"rectified\"(para. 15 of GOV/2024/8). Subsequently the reports were unprofessionally, without issuing a corrigendum to the report, re-issued on the 2 March 2024. There is no justifiable reason for such unwarranted deviation of agreement and hastily changing of the distributed reports. This approach highlights external political pressures which undermines the credibility of the Agnecy.\n\n19. On para. 12: The Agency in its letter dated 22 May 2024 requested Iran to re-evaluate the uranium metal production experiments that has been verified continuously since 2003. This request has no legal ground and is contrary to the mutual agreement of 29 February 2024. In this regard, the following points need to be considered:\n\nAs explained above, the uranium metal at the JHL had been under Agency's continuous C/S measures (seals) while being retained at JHL (IRL-) facility and has been frequently verified by the Agency since 2003, for which the relevant 90(a) and 90(b) statements have been subsequently issued by the Agency with satisfactory endorsement. It should be noted that there has not been any activity performed on this material that may change its status.\n\nThe R&D project for U metal production from UF4 has been declared to the Agency in 2003 and has been verified in depth in 2003-2004 and later in 2009 and eventually in 2014. In this R&D project, in addition to fine products, some different types of waste such as scrap, heterogeneous waste, etc. were produced. All of these materials have gone under Agency's different verifications.\n\nThe Agency in its statement dated 2014-02-12 clearly assessed that \"all declared nuclear material has been accounted for and that there were no indication of the undeclared presence, production or processing of nuclear material\". The Agency further in its report (GOV/2015/68) mentioned that \"...The Agency re-evaluated this information in 2014 and assessed that the amount of natural uranium involved was within the uncertainties associated with nuclear material accountancy and related measurements\".\n\nThe material being received by UCF (IRK-) from JHL (IRL-) was under the Agency's seals, verified by the Agency and the operator and evidently, the shipper data was accepted. Since the receiving MBA (IRK1) has accepted the shipper data, there is not any shipper-receiver-difference (SRD) to be reported. After recovery in process area (IRK2), verification of the material was performed at the UCF and the shortfall which was due to the processing of the material, cannot be considered as SRD. The shortfall also cannot be considered a cause for changing the accounting reports of the origin facility JHL (IRL-).\n\nTaking into account that the mentioned shortfall was only identified in the end of the recovery process at UCF (IRK-), and not at the receiving point of this facility, thus, it definitely cannot be attributed to the origin facility, i.e. Jaber Ibn Hayan Multipurpose laboratory (IRL-).\n\nThe letter of 22 May 2024 referred to in the DG report has been received by Iran only few days before releasing the report. To avoid any ambiguity and misleading, the Agency's letter should not have been hastily reflected in the report without Iran's answer. Taking into consideration that the material balance of the uranium involved in uranium metal production experiments conducted at JHL was concluded in year 2014 (see above statement 90(b)), reopening a closed matter which has been concluded by the Agency after an exhausted procedure, would undoubtedly jeopardize the credibility of the Agency's verification system including its accounting statements.\n\n20. On Modified Code 3.1:\n\nAcceptance of implementation of Modified Code 3.1 was among the measures reflected in para. 13 of the preamble as well as in para. 65 of Annex I to the JCPOA. Following the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA and failure of the E3/EU to fulfill their commitments under the agreement, Iran, in exercising its rights under para 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, decided to fulfill obligations merely under its CSA. However, acting in good faith and in light of understanding reached with the Director General, Iran has already provided general information on planning of new facilities (including Iran Hormoz, Sistan-Baluchestan and...) and has stated that relevant safeguards information will be provided to the Agency in due time.\n\nThe DG in his report has referred to the uniqueness of Iran's performance of Modified Code 3.1 (Iran remains the only State with significant nuclear activities in which the Agency is implementing a comprehensive safeguards agreement but which is not implementing the provisions of the modified). In this regard, uniqueness of the JCPOA needs also to be reiterated which is characterized by high frequency of the inspections, confidence-building and transparency measures beyond the CSA and the Additional Protocol. This characteristic of the agreement made Iran to be the only State with having a robust verification regime.\n\nAccording to the Law passed by Islamic Consultative Assembly (Majlis) entitled \"Strategic Action Plan to Lift Sanctions and Protect Iranian Nation's Interests\", Iran, in exercising its rights under para 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, decided to fulfill obligations merely under its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. One should not expect that while the unjustified unilateral sanctions still continue, Iran will fully implement its commitments under the JCPOA\n\nD. Comment on the Section D of the Report (GOV/2024/29) Joint Statement (paras. 17-20, 22 and 34)\n\n21. Two important elements of the 4th March 2023 Joint Statement should be taken into considerations, i.e. the framework of the CSA and the agreed modality. The Islamic Republic of Iran acting in good faith and even pending the agreement to be reached out on the modalities, allowed the Agency to install 9 surveillance cameras. Furthermore, Iran allowed the Secretariat to successfully service the cameras and store the recorded data. The progress achieved arising from the mutual cooperation with the Agency needs to be recognized by the Board of Governors.\n\n22. It is obvious that further implementation of the Joint Statement requires Iran and the Agency to discuss on modalities to be mutually agreed upon.\n\n23. On para. 21, 27 and 33 of GOV/2024/29 as well as paras. 21, 22 and 33 of GOV/2024/26 regarding exercising Iran's sovereign right of de-designation of few inspectors, the followings need to be taken into consideration:\n\nAs outlined in Article 9(a)(ii) of the (CSA) between Iran and the Agency (INFCIRC/214), it is unequivocally established that Iran retains the Sovereign prerogative to object to the designation of Agency inspectors, not only at the time of the proposed designation but also at any other time after designation has been made.\n\nCurrently, total number of 120 designated inspectors is available to the Agency for the Islamic Republic of Iran. This clearly shows Iran's willingness to enable the Agency to carry out its mandate benefiting from experienced various inspectors.\n\nExertion of this right, by no means impacts, directly or indirectly, the ability of the IAEA to conduct its inspections in Iran.\n\nWhile the Islamic Republic of Iran accepted the designation of 14 new proposed inspectors of the Agency on two occasions (October 2023 and February 2024), but unfortunately, this matter was not faithfully reflected in the report.\n\n24. As it has been mentioned in para. 23 and 24 of GOV/2024/29, during the visit of the DG to Tehran and Isfahan (for participation in the International Conference on Nuclear Science and Technology) and later visit of the DDG to Tehran, discussions were held with the different authorities including the late Foreign Minister H.E. Dr. Amirabdollahian, Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs, H.E. Dr. Bagheri Kani as well as Vice President and Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, H.E. Mr. Eslami and his Deputy for International, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs. During discussions both sides while exchanging view on different issues including implementation of the Joint Statement, agreed to continue their consultations on a proper time after prevailing special circumstances as a result of martyrdom of the President, Foreign Minister and other companions in an aerial incident would be tackled.\n\n25. On para. 26, the public statement; It has been officially stated in several occasion that nuclear weapon has never been in the defense doctrine of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Therefore, there is no ground for any interpretation of the public individual statements. The Director General is not expected to make safeguards conclusion or statement based on the individual's views. This conclusion neither professionally nor legally is justified. These public statements as misquoted several times and does not correspond to the official position of Iran, if any, could not be abused by others to question Iran's commitments under the NPT.\n\nE. Comments on the report (GOV/2024/29), Summary\n\n26. The Islamic Republic of Iran's nuclear activities are fully peaceful and the allegations created by the ill-intended third party are not authentic and has no justification.\n\n27. Iran voluntarily granted access and provided information and clarification to the Agency on claimed locations. This was despite the Agency did not present authentic documents to Iran concerning the claim on \"undeclared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities\", and Iran was not and is not obliged to respond the Agency's requests about unauthentic and fabricated documents. However, unfortunately, the Agency considers all fabricated documents and fake information provided by the Israeli regime as authentic. This has led the Agency to conclude wrong and unreliable assumption accordingly.\n\n28. In respect to the de-designated inspectors, the Agency is needed to respect fully Iran's rights under the CSA including Article 9. Any attempt to compromise the Member States' sovereign rights in violation of respective CSA is unacceptable and shall not make a precedent that would jeopardize the rights of Member States.\n\n29. During the visit of the DG and the DDG to Iran, meeting with high authorities, both sides while exchanging view on different issues including implementation of the Joint Statement agreed to continue their consultations on a proper time once prevailing special circumstances arising from martyrdom of the President, Foreign Minister and other companions in an aerial incident would be tackled.\n\n30. As mentioned earlier, it has been officially stated in several occasion nuclear weapon has no place in the defense doctrine of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Therefore, there is no ground for any misinterpretation of the public individual statements. The Director General is not expected to make safeguards conclusion or statement based on the individual's views. Any conclusion based on public statement is neither professionally nor legal.\n\nConclusion\n\n31. The Islamic Republic of Iran has so far rendered its full cooperation under the CSA to the Agency. It has to be re-emphasized that all Iran's nuclear material and activities have been completely declared and verified by the Agency.\n\n32. The Islamic Republic of Iran rightfully expects that the Agency conducts its reporting on verification activities in Iran based on the principles of impartiality, professionalism, and objectivity.\n\n33. It has to be re-emphasized that all Iran's nuclear material and activities have been completely declared to the Agency and has gone through a very robust verification system. Although, the Islamic Republic of Iran has no obligation to respond to the Agency's questions based on fabricated and unauthentic documents, however, on a voluntary basis and in a cooperative manner, Iran provided all necessary information, supporting documents and granted accesses requested by the Agency.\n\n34. The Islamic Republic of Iran, once again, stresses the importance and value of cooperation extended to the Agency. This constructive cooperation should not be undermined by short-sighted political interests. Accordingly, the Agency has the responsibility to show wisdom in addressing such issues in a diligent manner in order to avoid distorting the bigger picture on cooperation between Iran and the Agency.\n\n4354", "source": {"uri": "en.irna.ir", "dataType": "news", "title": "IRNA English"}, "authors": [{"uri": "irna_english@en.irna.ir", "name": "Irna English", "type": "author", "isAgency":

As it has been stated on numerous occasions, Iran's decision to take remedial measures was in full accordance with its inherent right under paragraphs 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, in reaction to the United States' unlawful unilateral withdrawal from the agreement on 8 May 2018, and the subsequent failure of the E3 to uphold their commitments. The objective behind Iran's decision, which was made a full year after the US's unlawful withdrawal and the E3/EU's failure to fulfill their sanctions-lifting obligations, was crystal clear: to restore a balance in reciprocal commitments and benefits under the JCPOA.\n\nThe claim that the E3 has consistently upheld its JCPOA commitments is simply untrue. On the contrary, the E3 has constantly failed to honor its obligations under paragraph 20 of Annex V of the JCPOA. This significant non-compliance is still ongoing. The E3's failure to implement its sanctions-lifting commitments specified in paragraph 20 of Annex V of the JCPOA on Transition Day (18 October 2023) as an unjustifiable unilateral is a clear example of substantial non-performance of their obligations, thereby violating both the JCPOA and UNSC Resolution 2231 (2015).\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has persistently complied with its obligations under the Comprehensive Safeguard Agreements (CSA), including through maximum cooperation with the IAEA to implement its verification activities in Iran. To date, Iran has been under the most robust verification and monitoring activities of the Agency.\n\nRegarding the modified Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements, it should be emphasized that the implementation of modified Code 3.1 was among the transparency and confidence-building measures, as reflected in paragraph 65 of Annex I of the JCPOA. As part of Iran's decision to stop implementing voluntary transparency measures beyond its Safeguard Agreement, the implementation of modified Code 3.1 was ceased. It was taken in full conformity with paragraphs 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, according to which, in the case of re-introduction or reimposition of nuclear-related sanctions by the U.S. or the EU, Iran has the right to cease performing its commitments under the JCPOA in whole or in part.\n\nSimilarly, Iran's decision to enrich uranium in Fordow was a remedial measure in response to non-compliance of the United States and E3/EU with their legally binding obligations under Resolution 2231 (2025) and their significant non-performance under the JCPOA commitments. That decision was also made in exercising Iran's rights expressly stated in paragraphs 26 and 36 of the JCPOA and in full accordance with its inherent rights under the NPT and the commitment under CSA. However, all such activities have been and continue to be under the supervision of the IAEA.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran's commitment to its obligations under the NPT remains steadfast. States parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) shall not be prevented from exercising their inalienable rights under the Treaty to develop research, production, and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in full conformity with articles I and II of the Treaty. Any allegation to the contrary is baseless and categorically rejected. The claim that Iran's nuclear program has reached a critical and irreversible point, coupled with assertions that Iran's peaceful nuclear activities pose a threat to international peace and security, are entirely false and unfounded.\n\nThe expression of concern over the termination of UNSCR 2231(2015) on 18 October 2025 is misleading, irrelevant, and provocative, given the absolutely peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program. Iran has constantly demonstrated its rejection of nuclear weapons and its commitment to NPT. This principled policy remains unchanged. Iran firmly rejects all forms of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, based on solid ideological teachings and strategic considerations. Iran is determined to remain actively engaged in all genuine international efforts to save humanity from the menace of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran reaffirms its unwavering commitment to diplomacy. It has repeatedly shown its willingness to resume talks with the aim of full implementation of the JCPOA by all participants. The JCPOA is a hard-won multilateral diplomatic achievement that remains the best option with no alternatives. It exemplified successful dialogue and diplomacy, effectively averting an undue crisis.

General Comments\n\n1. The Islamic Republic of Iran has complied fully with its obligations including Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (INFCIRC/214) and has done its utmost to enable the Agency to effectively carry out its verification activities in Iran, including C/S measures on Iran's nuclear material and activities.\n\n2. The separation of issues divided under two different reports has not been duly respected. Some JCPOA related matters have been repeated in the NPT Safeguards report and vice versa, some NPT Safeguards related matters can been seen in the JCPOA report. As an example, verification and monitoring activities related to centrifuges rotor and bellows manufacturing workshops, should have been defined only in the scope of JCPOA report.\n\n3. Following the United States' unlawful withdrawal from the JCPOA in May 2018 and failure of the E3/EU to fulfill their commitments, in exercising of its rights under paragraphs 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, Iran had ceased all voluntary transparency measures beyond its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (CSA), including implementation of Modified Code 3.1 as specified in para. 13 of the preamble as well as in para. 65 of Annex I to the JCPOA in February 2021.\n\n4. Iran's decision to cease performing its commitments under the JCPOA was fully in accordance with its inherent rights under paragraphs 26 and 36 of the JCPOA and in response to the US unlawful withdrawal from the JCPOA, coupled with the E3's inability to uphold their commitments. This blatant fact, by no means, can constitute a basis for E3 to refrain from implementing their commitments.\n\n5. The E3's decision to refrain from implementing their sanctions-lifting commitments specified in Paragraph 20 of Annex V of the JCPOA on Transition Day (18 October 2023) was an unlawful act and another explicit instance of significant non-performance of their commitments in violation of both the JCPOA and the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231.\n\n6. On the issue related to the so-called two locations, it should be underlined that the origin of the issue goes back to the allegations primarily posed by an ill-intended third party, namely the Israeli regime, which does not have a single commitment to any WMD instruments, including in particular NPT, and repeatedly threatens to attack Iran's nuclear facilities and installations devoted to peaceful purposes, contrary to the numerous GC resolutions, including in particular 407, 1983; 444, 1985; 475, 1987 and 939, 1990, none of which has been respected by this regime. The regime has been so rude that most recently has threatened Iran to nuclear attack. Netanyahu's statement which was broadcasting live across the world saying that \"Iran must face a credible nuclear threat\" and his heritage minister saying that \"dropping a nuclear bomb would be one of the options to attack Hamas is a clear violation of international law.\n\n7. From legal point of view, the assessments of the Agency in its report is based on unreliable information and unauthentic documents provided by a regime which not only constantly plotting against Iran's relation with the Agency, but also committing sabotages, attack, and threat of attack against Iran, along with its brutal policy and genocide against innocent people of Gaza, as recognized now by the international community.\n\n8. In light of further cooperation with the Agency, in recent years, Iran has implemented voluntary measures in the framework of several Joint Statements including the 4th March 2023.\n\n9. Most recently, constant political pressure exerted by few certain States has led to the point that technically resolved issues are later altered in the Agency's reports contrary to what have been agreed upon. These pressures which are politically motivated have impeded the Agency to carry out its professional and impartial role. The Director General on different occasions in his reports expresses sentiment by using unconventional expressions contrary to the technicality and objectivity of such reports, which needs to be avoided.\n\nB. Comments on the NPT Safeguards report (GOV/2024/29), Background:\n\n10. With respect to paragraph 3 of the report (GOV/2024/29), it has to be noted that time and again the Islamic Republic of Iran has reiterated that there has never been any location to be declared under the CSA, including through INFCIRC/1159 dated 23 November 2023, INFCIRC/1131 dated 14 September 2023, INFCIRC/996 dated 7 June 2022, INFCIRC/967 dated 3 December 2021, as well as INFCIRC/1183 dated 7 March 2024. The Agency's claim of undeclared locations has not been supported by authentic safeguards-relevant information document and evidences.\n\n11. On para. 4, once again Iran stresses that there have been no any nuclear material and activity in so called location \"Lavisan-Shian\". This location, as it has been stipulated in footnote 6 of the report, has gone under Agency's extensive verification activities including Complementary Access, accordingly the matter was closed.\n\n12. On paras. 5 and 6, despite there have not been any nuclear material and activity needed to be declared, Iran has so far provided the Agency with its explanations. However, voluntary measures could be considered within the modality to be agreed upon in line with the 4th March 2023 Joint Statement.\n\n13. On para. 6 of the report \"...the Agency's assessment of the undeclared nuclear related activities that were undertaken by Iran at 'Marivan' remains unchanged\" as it was said in paragraph 6 above, the Agency's assessment should not be based on unreliable information and unauthentic documents. Furthermore, there is no added value in referring to some previous arguments confirmed by subsequent information which led to resolution of this issue as specified in the previous Director General's report (GOV/2023/26). However, the details have been reflected in paragraph 8 of INFCIRC/1094 dated 7 June 2023.\n\nC. Comment on the Section C of the Report (GOV/2024/29):\n\n14. On para. 7: \"Varamin\", the following facts need to be considered:\n\n- As it was frequently explained by Iran, there has not been any undeclared location required to be declared under the CSA.\n\n- The allegation of existing \"undeclared pilot-scale plant used between 1999 and 2003\" is not supported by reliable information and authentic documents, rather is based on false and fabricated documents provided by ill-intended entity.\n\n- The Agency's reference to a sole poor quality satellite imagery for assessing that \"... containers removed from Varamin were eventually transferred to Turquzabad ...\" is NOT adequate and correct; there are thousands of similar containers moving around the country. Claim of movement of one container from a location to another, could not be a sound judgement based on such unprovable and imprecise evidence.\n\n15. On para. 8: \"Turquzabad\" the following facts need to be considered:\n\n- The Agency's assessment is not based on authentic information and evidences. Turquzabad is actually an industrial place encompassing various kinds of warehouses and depots for storing detergents, chemicals, foodstuff, fabrics & textiles, vehicles tire and parts, tubes & joints, and some industrial scraps.\n\n- As it has been frequently said, the location in question is industrial scraps storage, movement of containers is a usual activity in that area. Transfer of a container from one area to another which is a usual activity cannot be considered as a solid ground for such allegation.\n\n- As a result of very intensive investigations carried out into the background of activities of this location, except sabotage as the most probable indication, no any other reason has been found for the presence of such particles.\n\n- On the Agency's incorrect assumption of intact removal of containers from the location, the explanations indicating incorrectness of the Agency's assumption, has already been provided to the Agency. However, Iran expresses its readiness to extend the explanations within the modality to be agreed upon in line with the 4th March 2023 Joint Statement.\n\n16. On para.9: The Agency on its previous reports had referred to the so called four undeclared locations, requesting information, which was later provided by Iran and consequently the number of the locations was reduced by the Agency to two. Therefore, the false assumption of undeclared locations which was based on unauthentic information, as a result of Iran's extensive cooperation within the framework of the Joint Statement, was corrected. The remaining two locations could also be addressed through mutual cooperation within the modality to be agreed upon in line with the 4th March 2023 Joint Statement.\n\n- The uranium metal arising from declared conversion experiments conducted at the JHL (IRL-), received at the Uranium Conversion Facility, UCF (IRK-), has been frequently verified by the Agency since 2003, including quarterly and yearly, led to satisfactory issuance of relevant 90(a) and 90(b) statements by the Agency.\n\n- Iran in a letter dated 9 August 2023, in response to the Agency's inquiry, stressed that the mentioned discrepancy emerged at UCF (IRK-) was due to a different and irregular process of recovering uranium from the waste material, known as \"dirty waste\" containing various kinds of unknown elements as impurities. Basically, the difference of material between the starting and ending of recovery process is technically predictable and unavoidable. Although the difference emerged in ending point of recovery was accepted by Iran, the Agency was convinced that the amount initially claimed by the Agency was considerably less than what which has been announced earlier. To this end, several technical discussions on the subject were held between the Agency and Iran. In a technical discussion on 8 November 2023 in Vienna, Iran provided a presentation, based on firm technical documents and proofs, regarding detailed recovery process and its relevant accountancy calculation in IRK- for U-Metal dirty waste dissolution. To resolve this issue, it was agreed in the meeting that the Agency conduct additional verification activities at UCF in earliest possible time.\n\n- The Agency's further verification activities in this regard were conducted on 21, 22 November 2023, 3, 4 December 2023 and 20 December 2023. During these follow-up activities at IRK-, the operator provided details of accountancy calculations for U-Metal dirty waste recovery. Despite the agreement reached with the Agency, and confirmation received dated 2023-12-21for providing assessment including the analysis results of the environmental and destructive assay samples collected at the IRK- by February 2024, the results of these verifications has yet to be shared with Iran. However, the Agency accepted that the amount of SRD was far less than its initial evaluation.\n\n18. On para. 11, it should be mentioned that:\n\n- During the Agency's DDG and AEOI's Vice-President meeting in Tehran on 29 January 2024 and as a result of a proposal suggested by the DDG, technical discussion was concluded. In his proposal, DDG suggested that without continuing the technical discussion, a correction to the IRK- accountancy records with the agreed amount be submitted to the Agency by Iran, the issue would be resolved without any reflection to IRL-. Accordingly, the required corrected nuclear material accounting reports were provided to the Agency through Iran's letter dated 7 February 2024. The corrected nuclear material accounting reports indicate that all declared amount of uranium contained in the solid waste, sent from JHL to UCF for dissolution, was received at the UCF, and the mentioned shortfall only pertained to UCF (IRK-).\n\n- Pursuant to this agreement, Iran corrected relevant accountancy records, and the Agency submitted the modified statements for IRK- and IRL- facilities. The Agency in its 90(a) statement dated 2024-02-21 stipulated that the discrepancy in the amount of uranium contained in the solid waste sent from JHL to UCF has been resolved. This resolution has also been reflected exactly as \"resolved\" in footnote 23 of the JCPOA report (GOV/2024/7 dated 26 February 2024). BUT surprisingly without giving any reason, at the same day, the word \"resolved\" has been changed to \"rectified\"(para. 15 of GOV/2024/8). Subsequently the reports were unprofessionally, without issuing a corrigendum to the report, re-issued on the 2 March 2024. There is no justifiable reason for such unwarranted deviation of agreement and hastily changing of the distributed reports. This approach highlights external political pressures which undermines the credibility of the Agency.\n\n19. On para. 12: The Agency in its letter dated 22 May 2024 requested Iran to re-evaluate the uranium metal production experiments that has been verified continuously since 2003. This request has no legal ground and is contrary to the mutual agreement of 29 February 2024. In this regard, the following points need to be considered:\n\n- As explained above, the uranium metal at the JHL had been under Agency's continuous C/S measures (seals) while being retained at JHL (IRL-) facility and has been frequently verified by the Agency since 2003, for which the relevant 90(a) and 90(b) statements have been subsequently issued by the Agency with satisfactory endorsement. It should be noted that there has not been any activity performed on this material that may change its status.\n\n- The R&D project for U metal production from UF4 has been declared to the Agency in 2003 and has been verified in depth in 2003-2004 and later in 2009 and eventually in 2014. In this R&D project, in addition to fine products, some different types of waste such as scrap, heterogeneous waste, etc. were produced. All of these materials have gone under Agency's different verifications.\n\n- The Agency in its statement dated 2014-02-12 clearly assessed that \"all declared nuclear material has been accounted for and that there were no indication of the undeclared presence, production or processing of nuclear material\". The Agency further in its report (GOV/2015/68) mentioned that \"...The Agency re-evaluated this information in 2014 and assessed that the amount of natural uranium involved was within the uncertainties associated with nuclear material accountancy and related measurements\".\n\n- The material being received by UCF (IRK-) from JHL (IRL-) was under the Agency's seals, verified by the Agency and the operator and evidently, the shipper data was accepted. Since the receiving MBA (IRK1) has accepted the shipper data, there is not any shipper-receiver-difference (SRD) to be reported. After recovery in process area (IRK2), verification of the material was performed at the UCF and the shortfall which was due to the processing of the material, cannot be considered as SRD. The shortfall also cannot be considered a cause for changing the accounting reports of the origin facility JHL (IRL-).\n\n- Taking into account that the mentioned shortfall was only identified in the end of the recovery process at UCF (IRK-), and not at the receiving point of this facility, thus, it definitely cannot be attributed to the origin facility, i.e. Jaber Ibn Hayan Multipurpose laboratory (IRL-).\n\n- The letter of 22 May 2024 referred to in the DG report has been received by Iran only few days before releasing the report. To avoid any ambiguity and misleading, the Agency's letter should not have been hastily reflected in the report without Iran's answer. Taking into consideration that the material balance of the uranium involved in uranium metal production experiments conducted at JHL was concluded in year 2014 (see above statement 90(b)), reopening a closed matter which has been concluded by the Agency after an exhausted procedure, would undoubtedly jeopardize the credibility of the Agency's verification system including its accounting statements.\n\n20. On Modified Code 3.1:\n\n- Acceptance of implementation of Modified Code 3.1 was among the measures reflected in para. 13 of the preamble as well as in para. 65 of Annex I to the JCPOA. Following the US withdrawal from the JCPOA and failure of the E3/EU to fulfill their commitments under the agreement, Iran, in exercising its rights under para 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, decided to fulfill obligations merely under its CSA. However, acting in good faith and in light of understanding reached with the Director General, Iran has already provided general information on planning of new facilities (including Iran Hormuz, Sistan-Baluchestan and...) and has stated that relevant safeguards information will be provided to the Agency in due time.\n\n- The DG in his report has referred to the uniqueness of Iran's performance of Modified Code 3.1 (Iran remains the only State with significant nuclear activities in which the Agency is implementing a comprehensive safeguards agreement but which is not implementing the provisions of the modified). In this regard, uniqueness of the JCPOA needs also to be reiterated which is characterized by high frequency of the inspections, confidence-building and transparency measures beyond the CSA and the Additional Protocol. This characteristic of the agreement made Iran to be the only State with having a robust verification regime.\n\n- According to the Law passed by Islamic Consultative Assembly (Majlis) entitled \"Strategic Action Plan to Lift Sanctions and Protect Iranian Nation's Interests\", Iran, in exercising its rights under para 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, decided to fulfill obligations merely under its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. One should not expect that while the unjustified unilateral sanctions still continue, Iran will fully implement its commitments under the JCPOA\n\nD. Comment on the Section D of the Report (GOV/2024/29) Joint Statement (paras. 17-20, 22 and 34)\n\n21. Two important elements of the 4th March 2023 Joint Statement should be taken into considerations, i.e. the framework of the CSA and the agreed modality. The Islamic Republic of Iran acting in good faith and even pending the agreement to be reached out on the modalities, allowed the Agency to install 9 surveillance cameras. Furthermore, Iran allowed the Secretariat to successfully service the cameras and store the recorded data. The progress achieved arising from the mutual cooperation with the Agency needs to be recognized by the Board of Governors.\n\n22. It is obvious that further implementation of the Joint Statement requires Iran and the Agency to discuss on modalities to be mutually agreed upon.\n\n23. On para. 21, 27 and 33 of GOV/2024/29 as well as paras. 21, 22 and 33 of GOV/2024/26 regarding exercising Iran's sovereign right of de-designation of few inspectors, the followings need to be taken into consideration:\n\n- As outlined in Article 9(a)(ii) of the (CSA) between Iran and the Agency (INFCIRC/214), it is unequivocally established that Iran retains the Sovereign prerogative to object to the designation of Agency inspectors, not only at the time of the proposed designation but also at any other time after designation has been made.\n\n- Currently, total number of 120 designated inspectors is available to the Agency for the Islamic Republic of Iran. This clearly shows Iran's willingness to enable the Agency to carry out its mandate benefiting from experienced various inspectors.\n\n- Exertion of this right, by no means impacts, directly or indirectly, the ability of the IAEA to conduct its inspections in Iran.\n\n- While the Islamic Republic of Iran accepted the designation of 14 new proposed inspectors of the Agency on two occasions (October 2023 and February 2024), but unfortunately, this matter was not faithfully reflected in the report.\n\n24. As it has been mentioned in para. 23 and 24 of GOV/2024/29, during the visit of the DG to Tehran and Isfahan (for participation in the International Conference on Nuclear Science and Technology) and later visit of the DDG to Tehran, discussions were held with the different authorities including the late Foreign Minister H.E. Dr. Amirabdollahian, Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs, H.E. Dr. Baqeri Kani as well as Vice President and Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, H.E. Mr. Eslami and his Deputy for International, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs. During discussions both sides while exchanging view on different issues including implementation of the Joint Statement, agreed to continue their consultations on a proper time after prevailing special circumstances as a result of martyrdom of the President, Foreign Minister and other companions in an aerial incident would be tackled.\n\n25. On para. 26, the public statement; It has been officially stated in several occasion that nuclear weapon has never been in the defense doctrine of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Therefore, there is no ground for any interpretation of the public individual statements. The Director General is not expected to make safeguards conclusion or statement based on the individual's views. This conclusion neither professionally nor legally is justified. These public statements as misquoted several times and does not correspond to the official position of Iran, if any, could not be abused by others to question Iran's commitments under the NPT.\n\nE. Comments on the report (GOV/2024/29), Summary\n\n26. The Islamic Republic of Iran's nuclear activities are fully peaceful and the allegations created by the ill-intended third party are not authentic and has no justification.\n\n27. Iran voluntarily granted access and provided information and clarification to the Agency on claimed locations. This was despite the Agency did not present authentic documents to Iran concerning the claim on \"undeclared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities\", and Iran was not and is not obliged to respond the Agency's requests about unauthentic and fabricated documents. However, unfortunately, the Agency considers all fabricated documents and fake information provided by the Israeli regime as authentic. This has led the Agency to conclude wrong and unreliable assumption accordingly.\n\n28. In respect to the de-designated inspectors, the Agency is needed to respect fully Iran's rights under the CSA including Article 9. Any attempt to compromise the Member States' sovereign rights in violation of respective CSA is unacceptable and shall not make a precedent that would jeopardize the rights of Member States.\n\n29. During the visit of the DG and the DDG to Iran, meeting with high authorities, both sides while exchanging view on different issues including implementation of the Joint Statement agreed to continue their consultations on a proper time once prevailing special circumstances arising from martyrdom of the President, Foreign Minister and other companions in an aerial incident would be tackled.\n\n30. As mentioned earlier, it has been officially stated in several occasion nuclear weapon has no place in the defense doctrine of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Therefore, there is no ground for any misinterpretation of the public individual statements. The Director General is not expected to make safeguards conclusion or statement based on the individual's views. Any conclusion based on public statement is neither professionally nor legal.\n\nConclusion\n\n31. The Islamic Republic of Iran has so far rendered its full cooperation under the CSA to the Agency. It has to be re-emphasized that all Iran's nuclear material and activities have been completely declared and verified by the Agency.\n\n32. The Islamic Republic of Iran rightfully expects that the Agency conducts its reporting on verification activities in Iran based on the principles of impartiality, professionalism, and objectivity.\n\n33. It has to be re-emphasized that all Iran's nuclear material and activities have been completely declared to the Agency and has gone through a very robust verification system. Although, the Islamic Republic of Iran has no obligation to respond to the Agency's questions based on fabricated and unauthentic documents, however, on a voluntary basis and in a cooperative manner, Iran provided all necessary information, supporting documents and granted accesses requested by the Agency.\n\n34. The Islamic Republic of Iran, once again, stresses the importance and value of cooperation extended to the Agency. This constructive cooperation should not be undermined by short-sighted political interests. Accordingly, the Agency has the responsibility to show wisdom in addressing such issues in a diligent manner in order to avoid distorting the bigger picture on cooperation between Iran and the Agency.", "source": {"uri": "tasnimnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062e\u0628\u0631\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u062a\u0633\u0646\u06cc\u0645"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

General Comments\n\n1. The Islamic Republic of Iran has complied fully with its obligations including Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (INFCIRC/214) and has done its utmost to enable the Agency to effectively carry out its verification activities in Iran, including C/S measures on Iran's nuclear material and activities.\n\n2. The separation of issues divided under two different reports has not been duly respected. Some JCPOA related matters have been repeated in the NPT Safeguards report and vice versa, some NPT Safeguards related matters can been seen in the JCPOA report. As an example, verification and monitoring activities related to centrifuges rotor and bellows manufacturing workshops, should have been defined only in the scope of JCPOA report.\n\n3. Following the United States' unlawful withdrawal from the JCPOA in May 2018 and failure of the E3/EU to fulfill their commitments, in exercising of its rights under paragraphs 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, Iran had ceased all voluntary transparency measures beyond its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (CSA), including implementation of Modified Code 3.1 as specified in para. 13 of the preamble as well as in para. 65 of Annex I to the JCPOA in February 2021.\n\n4. Iran's decision to cease performing its commitments under the JCPOA was fully in accordance with its inherent rights under paragraphs 26 and 36 of the JCPOA and in response to the US unlawful withdrawal from the JCPOA, coupled with the E3's inability to uphold their commitments. This blatant fact, by no means, can constitute a basis for E3 to refrain from implementing their commitments.\n\n5. The E3's decision to refrain from implementing their sanctions-lifting commitments specified in Paragraph 20 of Annex V of the JCPOA on Transition Day (18 October 2023) was an unlawful act and another explicit instance of significant non-performance of their commitments in violation of both the JCPOA and the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231.\n\n6. On the issue related to the so-called two locations, it should be underlined that the origin of the issue goes back to the allegations primarily posed by an ill-intended third party, namely the Israeli regime, which does not have a single commitment to any WMD instruments, including in particular NPT, and repeatedly threatens to attack Iran's nuclear facilities and installations devoted to peaceful purposes, contrary to the numerous GC resolutions, including in particular 407, 1983; 444, 1985; 475, 1987 and 939, 1990, none of which has been respected by this regime. The regime has been so rude that most recently has threatened Iran to nuclear attack. Netanyahu's statement which was broadcasting live across the world saying that \"Iran must face a credible nuclear threat\" and his heritage minister saying that \"dropping a nuclear bomb would be one of the options to attack Hamas is a clear violation of international law.\n\n7. From legal point of view, the assessments of the Agency in its report is based on unreliable information and unauthentic documents provided by a regime which not only constantly plotting against Iran's relation with the Agency, but also committing sabotages, attack, and threat of attack against Iran, along with its brutal policy and genocide against innocent people of Gaza, as recognized now by the international community.\n\n8. In light of further cooperation with the Agency, in recent years, Iran has implemented voluntary measures in the framework of several Joint Statements including the 4th March 2023.\n\n9. Most recently, constant political pressure exerted by few certain States has led to the point that technically resolved issues are later altered in the Agency's reports contrary to what have been agreed upon. These pressures which are politically motivated have impeded the Agency to carry out its professional and impartial role. The Director General on different occasions in his reports expresses sentiment by using unconventional expressions contrary to the technicality and objectivity of such reports, which needs to be avoided.\n\nB. Comments on the NPT Safeguards report (GOV/2024/29), Background:\n\n10. With respect to paragraph 3 of the report (GOV/2024/29), it has to be noted that time and again the Islamic Republic of Iran has reiterated that there has never been any location to be declared under the CSA, including through INFCIRC/1159 dated 23 November 2023, INFCIRC/1131 dated 14 September 2023, INFCIRC/996 dated 7 June 2022, INFCIRC/967 dated 3 December 2021, as well as INFCIRC/1183 dated 7 March 2024. The Agency's claim of undeclared locations has not been supported by authentic safeguards-relevant information document and evidences.\n\n11. On para. 4, once again Iran stresses that there have been no any nuclear material and activity in so called location \"Lavisan-Shian\". This location, as it has been stipulated in footnote 6 of the report, has gone under Agency's extensive verification activities including Complementary Access, accordingly the matter was closed.\n\n12. On paras. 5 and 6, despite there have not been any nuclear material and activity needed to be declared, Iran has so far provided the Agency with its explanations. However, voluntary measures could be considered within the modality to be agreed upon in line with the 4th March 2023 Joint Statement.\n\n13. On para. 6 of the report \"...the Agency's assessment of the undeclared nuclear related activities that were undertaken by Iran at 'Marivan' remains unchanged\" as it was said in paragraph 6 above, the Agency's assessment should not be based on unreliable information and unauthentic documents. Furthermore, there is no added value in referring to some previous arguments confirmed by subsequent information which led to resolution of this issue as specified in the previous Director General's report (GOV/2023/26). However, the details have been reflected in paragraph 8 of INFCIRC/1094 dated 7 June 2023.\n\nC. Comment on the Section C of the Report (GOV/2024/29):\n\n14. On para. 7: \"Varamin\", the following facts need to be considered:\n\n- As it was frequently explained by Iran, there has not been any undeclared location required to be declared under the CSA.\n\n- The allegation of existing \"undeclared pilot-scale plant used between 1999 and 2003\" is not supported by reliable information and authentic documents, rather is based on false and fabricated documents provided by ill-intended entity.\n\n- The Agency's reference to a sole poor quality satellite imagery for assessing that \"... containers removed from Varamin were eventually transferred to Turquzabad ...\" is NOT adequate and correct; there are thousands of similar containers moving around the country. Claim of movement of one container from a location to another, could not be a sound judgement based on such unprovable and imprecise evidence.\n\n15. On para. 8: \"Turquzabad\" the following facts need to be considered:\n\n- The Agency's assessment is not based on authentic information and evidences. Turquzabad is actually an industrial place encompassing various kinds of warehouses and depots for storing detergents, chemicals, foodstuff, fabrics & textiles, vehicles tire and parts, tubes & joints, and some industrial scraps.\n\n- As it has been frequently said, the location in question is industrial scraps storage, movement of containers is a usual activity in that area. Transfer of a container from one area to another which is a usual activity cannot be considered as a solid ground for such allegation.\n\n- As a result of very intensive investigations carried out into the background of activities of this location, except sabotage as the most probable indication, no any other reason has been found for the presence of such particles.\n\n- On the Agency's incorrect assumption of intact removal of containers from the location, the explanations indicating incorrectness of the Agency's assumption, has already been provided to the Agency. However, Iran expresses its readiness to extend the explanations within the modality to be agreed upon in line with the 4th March 2023 Joint Statement.\n\n16. On para.9: The Agency on its previous reports had referred to the so called four undeclared locations, requesting information, which was later provided by Iran and consequently the number of the locations was reduced by the Agency to two. Therefore, the false assumption of undeclared locations which was based on unauthentic information, as a result of Iran's extensive cooperation within the framework of the Joint Statement, was corrected. The remaining two locations could also be addressed through mutual cooperation within the modality to be agreed upon in line with the 4th March 2023 Joint Statement.\n\nC.2. Discrepancy in nuclear material balance\n\n17. On para. 10, following has to be considered:\n\n- The uranium metal arising from declared conversion experiments conducted at the JHL (IRL-), received at the Uranium Conversion Facility, UCF (IRK-), has been frequently verified by the Agency since 2003, including quarterly and yearly, led to satisfactory issuance of relevant 90(a) and 90(b) statements by the Agency.\n\n- Iran in a letter dated 9 August 2023, in response to the Agency's inquiry, stressed that the mentioned discrepancy emerged at UCF (IRK-) was due to a different and irregular process of recovering uranium from the waste material, known as \"dirty waste\" containing various kinds of unknown elements as impurities. Basically, the difference of material between the starting and ending of recovery process is technically predictable and unavoidable. Although the difference emerged in ending point of recovery was accepted by Iran, the Agency was convinced that the amount initially claimed by the Agency was considerably less than what which has been announced earlier. To this end, several technical discussions on the subject were held between the Agency and Iran. In a technical discussion on 8 November 2023 in Vienna, Iran provided a presentation, based on firm technical documents and proofs, regarding detailed recovery process and its relevant accountancy calculation in IRK- for U-Metal dirty waste dissolution. To resolve this issue, it was agreed in the meeting that the Agency conduct additional verification activities at UCF in earliest possible time.\n\n- The Agency's further verification activities in this regard were conducted on 21, 22 November 2023, 3, 4 December 2023 and 20 December 2023. During these follow-up activities at IRK-, the operator provided details of accountancy calculations for U-Metal dirty waste recovery. Despite the agreement reached with the Agency, and confirmation received dated 2023-12-21for providing assessment including the analysis results of the environmental and destructive assay samples collected at the IRK- by February 2024, the results of these verifications has yet to be shared with Iran. However, the Agency accepted that the amount of SRD was far less than its initial evaluation.\n\n18. On para. 11, it should be mentioned that:\n\n- During the Agency's DDG and AEOI's Vice-President meeting in Tehran on 29 January 2024 and as a result of a proposal suggested by the DDG, technical discussion was concluded. In his proposal, DDG suggested that without continuing the technical discussion, a correction to the IRK- accountancy records with the agreed amount be submitted to the Agency by Iran, the issue would be resolved without any reflection to IRL-. Accordingly, the required corrected nuclear material accounting reports were provided to the Agency through Iran's letter dated 7 February 2024. The corrected nuclear material accounting reports indicate that all declared amount of uranium contained in the solid waste, sent from JHL to UCF for dissolution, was received at the UCF, and the mentioned shortfall only pertained to UCF (IRK-).\n\n- Pursuant to this agreement, Iran corrected relevant accountancy records, and the Agency submitted the modified statements for IRK- and IRL- facilities. The Agency in its 90(a) statement dated 2024-02-21 stipulated that the discrepancy in the amount of uranium contained in the solid waste sent from JHL to UCF has been resolved. This resolution has also been reflected exactly as \"resolved\" in footnote 23 of the JCPOA report (GOV/2024/7 dated 26 February 2024). BUT surprisingly without giving any reason, at the same day, the word \"resolved\" has been changed to \"rectified\"(para. 15 of GOV/2024/8). Subsequently the reports were unprofessionally, without issuing a corrigendum to the report, re-issued on the 2 March 2024. There is no justifiable reason for such unwarranted deviation of agreement and hastily changing of the distributed reports. This approach highlights external political pressures which undermines the credibility of the Agency.\n\n19. On para. 12: The Agency in its letter dated 22 May 2024 requested Iran to re-evaluate the uranium metal production experiments that has been verified continuously since 2003. This request has no legal ground and is contrary to the mutual agreement of 29 February 2024. In this regard, the following points need to be considered:\n\n- As explained above, the uranium metal at the JHL had been under Agency's continuous C/S measures (seals) while being retained at JHL (IRL-) facility and has been frequently verified by the Agency since 2003, for which the relevant 90(a) and 90(b) statements have been subsequently issued by the Agency with satisfactory endorsement. It should be noted that there has not been any activity performed on this material that may change its status.\n\n- The R&D project for U metal production from UF4 has been declared to the Agency in 2003 and has been verified in depth in 2003-2004 and later in 2009 and eventually in 2014. In this R&D project, in addition to fine products, some different types of waste such as scrap, heterogeneous waste, etc. were produced. All of these materials have gone under Agency's different verifications.\n\n- The Agency in its statement dated 2014-02-12 clearly assessed that \"all declared nuclear material has been accounted for and that there were no indication of the undeclared presence, production or processing of nuclear material\". The Agency further in its report (GOV/2015/68) mentioned that \"...The Agency re-evaluated this information in 2014 and assessed that the amount of natural uranium involved was within the uncertainties associated with nuclear material accountancy and related measurements\".\n\n- The material being received by UCF (IRK-) from JHL (IRL-) was under the Agency's seals, verified by the Agency and the operator and evidently, the shipper data was accepted. Since the receiving MBA (IRK1) has accepted the shipper data, there is not any shipper-receiver-difference (SRD) to be reported. After recovery in process area (IRK2), verification of the material was performed at the UCF and the shortfall which was due to the processing of the material, cannot be considered as SRD. The shortfall also cannot be considered a cause for changing the accounting reports of the origin facility JHL (IRL-).\n\n- Taking into account that the mentioned shortfall was only identified in the end of the recovery process at UCF (IRK-), and not at the receiving point of this facility, thus, it definitely cannot be attributed to the origin facility, i.e. Jaber Ibn Hayan Multipurpose laboratory (IRL-).\n\n- The letter of 22 May 2024 referred to in the DG report has been received by Iran only few days before releasing the report. To avoid any ambiguity and misleading, the Agency's letter should not have been hastily reflected in the report without Iran's answer. Taking into consideration that the material balance of the uranium involved in uranium metal production experiments conducted at JHL was concluded in year 2014 (see above statement 90(b)), reopening a closed matter which has been concluded by the Agency after an exhausted procedure, would undoubtedly jeopardize the credibility of the Agency's verification system including its accounting statements.\n\n20. On Modified Code 3.1:\n\n- Acceptance of implementation of Modified Code 3.1 was among the measures reflected in para. 13 of the preamble as well as in para. 65 of Annex I to the JCPOA. Following the US withdrawal from the JCPOA and failure of the E3/EU to fulfill their commitments under the agreement, Iran, in exercising its rights under para 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, decided to fulfill obligations merely under its CSA. However, acting in good faith and in light of understanding reached with the Director General, Iran has already provided general information on planning of new facilities (including Iran Hormuz, Sistan-Baluchestan and...) and has stated that relevant safeguards information will be provided to the Agency in due time.\n\n- The DG in his report has referred to the uniqueness of Iran's performance of Modified Code 3.1 (Iran remains the only State with significant nuclear activities in which the Agency is implementing a comprehensive safeguards agreement but which is not implementing the provisions of the modified). In this regard, uniqueness of the JCPOA needs also to be reiterated which is characterized by high frequency of the inspections, confidence-building and transparency measures beyond the CSA and the Additional Protocol. This characteristic of the agreement made Iran to be the only State with having a robust verification regime.\n\n- According to the Law passed by Islamic Consultative Assembly (Majlis) entitled \"Strategic Action Plan to Lift Sanctions and Protect Iranian Nation's Interests\", Iran, in exercising its rights under para 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, decided to fulfill obligations merely under its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement. One should not expect that while the unjustified unilateral sanctions still continue, Iran will fully implement its commitments under the JCPOA\n\nD. Comment on the Section D of the Report (GOV/2024/29) Joint Statement (paras. 17-20, 22 and 34)\n\n21. Two important elements of the 4th March 2023 Joint Statement should be taken into considerations, i.e. the framework of the CSA and the agreed modality. The Islamic Republic of Iran acting in good faith and even pending the agreement to be reached out on the modalities, allowed the Agency to install 9 surveillance cameras. Furthermore, Iran allowed the Secretariat to successfully service the cameras and store the recorded data. The progress achieved arising from the mutual cooperation with the Agency needs to be recognized by the Board of Governors.\n\n22. It is obvious that further implementation of the Joint Statement requires Iran and the Agency to discuss on modalities to be mutually agreed upon.\n\n23. On para. 21, 27 and 33 of GOV/2024/29 as well as paras. 21, 22 and 33 of GOV/2024/26 regarding exercising Iran's sovereign right of de-designation of few inspectors, the followings need to be taken into consideration:\n\n- As outlined in Article 9(a)(ii) of the (CSA) between Iran and the Agency (INFCIRC/214), it is unequivocally established that Iran retains the Sovereign prerogative to object to the designation of Agency inspectors, not only at the time of the proposed designation but also at any other time after designation has been made.\n\n- Currently, total number of 120 designated inspectors is available to the Agency for the Islamic Republic of Iran. This clearly shows Iran's willingness to enable the Agency to carry out its mandate benefiting from experienced various inspectors.\n\n- Exertion of this right, by no means impacts, directly or indirectly, the ability of the IAEA to conduct its inspections in Iran.\n\n- While the Islamic Republic of Iran accepted the designation of 14 new proposed inspectors of the Agency on two occasions (October 2023 and February 2024), but unfortunately, this matter was not faithfully reflected in the report.\n\n24. As it has been mentioned in para. 23 and 24 of GOV/2024/29, during the visit of the DG to Tehran and Isfahan (for participation in the International Conference on Nuclear Science and Technology) and later visit of the DDG to Tehran, discussions were held with the different authorities including the late Foreign Minister H.E. Dr. Amirabdollahian, Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs, H.E. Dr. Baqeri Kani as well as Vice President and Head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, H.E. Mr. Eslami and his Deputy for International, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs. During discussions both sides while exchanging view on different issues including implementation of the Joint Statement, agreed to continue their consultations on a proper time after prevailing special circumstances as a result of martyrdom of the President, Foreign Minister and other companions in an aerial incident would be tackled.\n\n25. On para. 26, the public statement; It has been officially stated in several occasion that nuclear weapon has never been in the defense doctrine of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Therefore, there is no ground for any interpretation of the public individual statements. The Director General is not expected to make safeguards conclusion or statement based on the individual's views. This conclusion neither professionally nor legally is justified. These public statements as misquoted several times and does not correspond to the official position of Iran, if any, could not be abused by others to question Iran's commitments under the NPT.\n\nE. Comments on the report (GOV/2024/29), Summary\n\n26. The Islamic Republic of Iran's nuclear activities are fully peaceful and the allegations created by the ill-intended third party are not authentic and has no justification.\n\n27. Iran voluntarily granted access and provided information and clarification to the Agency on claimed locations. This was despite the Agency did not present authentic documents to Iran concerning the claim on \"undeclared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities\", and Iran was not and is not obliged to respond the Agency's requests about unauthentic and fabricated documents. However, unfortunately, the Agency considers all fabricated documents and fake information provided by the Israeli regime as authentic. This has led the Agency to conclude wrong and unreliable assumption accordingly.\n\n28. In respect to the de-designated inspectors, the Agency is needed to respect fully Iran's rights under the CSA including Article 9. Any attempt to compromise the Member States' sovereign rights in violation of respective CSA is unacceptable and shall not make a precedent that would jeopardize the rights of Member States.\n\n29. During the visit of the DG and the DDG to Iran, meeting with high authorities, both sides while exchanging view on different issues including implementation of the Joint Statement agreed to continue their consultations on a proper time once prevailing special circumstances arising from martyrdom of the President, Foreign Minister and other companions in an aerial incident would be tackled.\n\n30. As mentioned earlier, it has been officially stated in several occasion nuclear weapon has no place in the defense doctrine of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Therefore, there is no ground for any misinterpretation of the public individual statements. The Director General is not expected to make safeguards conclusion or statement based on the individual's views. Any conclusion based on public statement is neither professionally nor legal.\n\nConclusion\n\n31. The Islamic Republic of Iran has so far rendered its full cooperation under the CSA to the Agency. It has to be re-emphasized that all Iran's nuclear material and activities have been completely declared and verified by the Agency.\n\n32. The Islamic Republic of Iran rightfully expects that the Agency conducts its reporting on verification activities in Iran based on the principles of impartiality, professionalism, and objectivity.\n\n33. It has to be re-emphasized that all Iran's nuclear material and activities have been completely declared to the Agency and has gone through a very robust verification system. Although, the Islamic Republic of Iran has no obligation to respond to the Agency's questions based on fabricated and unauthentic documents, however, on a voluntary basis and in a cooperative manner, Iran provided all necessary information, supporting documents and granted accesses requested by the Agency.\n\n34. The Islamic Republic of Iran, once again, stresses the importance and value of cooperation extended to the Agency. This constructive cooperation should not be undermined by short-sighted political interests. Accordingly, the Agency has the responsibility to show wisdom in addressing such issues in a diligent manner in order to avoid distorting the bigger picture on cooperation between Iran and the Agency.\n\nMNA/TSN", "source": {"uri": "en.mehrnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mehr News Agency"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turquzabad", "type":

"Tehran, IRNA -- Iran's Permanent Mission to the United Nations Office and other international organizations in Vienna has issued an explanatory note outlining Iran's views on two recent reports by the IAEA's director general to its Board of Governors.\n\nThe following are the general outlines of the document:\n\nIran has fully complied with its commitments under the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (INFCIRC/214), and has made every effort to enable the IAEA to effectively carry out its verification activities in Iran, including safeguards and monitoring measures that are unique to the IAEA's verification regime.\n\nHowever, the separation of issues in these two reports has not been properly observed.\n\nSome matters related to the JCPOA, the 2025 nuclear deal, have been repetitively included in the Safeguards (NPT) report, and vice versa, some NPT-related issues have been observed in the report on the JCPOA.\n\nFollowing the illegal US withdrawal from the JCPOA in May 2018 and the inability of the European Union/E3 (Germany, UK, France) to fulfill their commitments, Iran suspended its voluntary transparency measures beyond the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (CSA).\n\nIran's decision to suspend the implementation of its JCPOA commitments was fully in line with the country's inherent rights under Paragraphs 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, in response to the illegal US withdrawal from the nuclear deal and the inability of the E3 to adhere to their commitments.\n\nThis clear reality cannot in any way serve as a basis for the E3 to refrain from fulfilling their own obligations.\n\nThe E3's decision to refrain from implementing their sanctions-lifting commitments, as specified in Paragraph 20 of Annex V of the JCPOA on the Transition Day (October 18, 2023), is an unlawful act and another blatant example of their failure to fully comply with their obligations under both the JCPOA and UN Security Council Resolution 2231.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the IAEA's assessments are based on unreliable information and invalid documents provided by a regime (Israel) that not only constantly conspires against Iran's relations with the agency, but also commits sabotage, attacks, and threat of attacks against Iran.\n\nGiven the increased cooperation with the IAEA in recent years, Iran has implemented voluntary measures within the framework of several joint statements, including the joint statement of March 4, 2023.\n\nRecently, the persistent political pressures exerted by certain countries have reached a point where even technically resolved issues are subsequently changed in the IAEA's reports, contrary to what was agreed upon.\n\nThese politically-motivated pressures prevent the agency from performing its professional and impartial role.", "source": {"uri": "globalsecurity.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "GlobalSecurity.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_pike@globalsecurity.org", "name": "John Pike", "type": "author",

It asks Tehran to take \"necessary and urgent measures\" to resolve the alleged safeguard issues.\n\nBefore the voting, several countries issued a joint statement calling the adoption of the anti-Iran resolution a miscalculation and warned of its negative consequences.

With the slogan, \"Neither East nor West,\" the Islamic Republic rejected multilateral mechanisms and emphasized ideology in bilateral relations.\n\nFred Halliday, professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics, has said that Iran's revolution had more transnational goals than even the Russian and French revolutions. For Iran, challenging the established world order has long been a particular priority.\n\nDespite the desire to depend on neither East nor West, Iran saw the United States as the greater threat. America was labeled the ''Great Satan,'' while the Soviet Union, initially called the \"lesser Satan,\" gradually became a friend. In 1989, Iran formalized relations with the \"less evil\" country by signing a comprehensive economic protocol with Moscow. Iran subsequently expanded ties within the framework of then-Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's \"new thinking.\"\n\nAfter the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, Iran sought to re-establish ties with the West to help rebuild the country, ease international isolation, and attract foreign investment. However, the administrations of Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami failed to restore sustainable ties. Even the Khatami administration's cooperation with the United States against the Afghan Taliban after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks did not improve relations; instead, Iran found itself put on an \"Axis of evil\" by the George W. Bush administration.\n\nThis made many in Iran realize that the West's problem with the Islamic Republic went beyond its actions to its very existence and identity. Khatami's successor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thus turned toward China and Russia as more reliable partners for Iran.\n\nHassan Rouhani, Ahmadinejad's successor, followed a more balanced policy towards the East and West in an effort to relieve sanctions tied to Iran's nuclear program. With the Trump administration's withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal in 2018, however, internal opponents of the Rouhani government questioned his approach. As a result of European countries' inability to compensate for the U.S. withdrawal by continuing to trade with Iran, Rouhani could not realize the goals of the \"look to the West\" strategy.\n\nThe policy of \"Looking to the East\" has intensified under Rouhani's successor, Ebrahim Raisi's presidency. It has geopolitical, economic, and ideological components. It is a strategic choice in Iranian foreign policy that also reflects changes in the international system and a specific interpretation of sovereignty in favor of Eastern powers, including China and Russia.\n\nAccordingly, in the Raisi administration's Government Transformation Document, North America is no longer seen as a region with which it is possible to normalize relations. The nuclear issue has been downgraded from a political issue to a technical one of relieving sanctions rather than a platform for improving relations with the West.\n\nBased on this, in May 2023, the Raisi government reached an 'understanding' with the United States, which, in addition to resolving the issue of American-Iranian prisoners, was also considered a framework for reducing nuclear tension. According to the agreement reached between the two states in Muscat, Oman, Iran avoided enrichment above 60 percent. Furthermore, after the direct attacks of Iran and Israel against each other, there are reports of the start of nuclear talks between Iran and the United States.\n\nIn contrast, Iran sees its relationships with China and Russia as strategic. The 25-Year Comprehensive Cooperation Agreement with China and the 20-year cooperation agreement with Russia are aimed at establishing long-term relationships with the two other poles of a new multipolar world order.\n\nIran believes that the future international system will be determined by three fault lines: West Eurasia, East Eurasia, and the Mediterranean and Asia.\n\nAccording to the opinion of Former IRGC commander and top aide to Iran's Supreme Leader, Yahya Rahim-Safavi, \"in the western Eurasia fault, actors such as the US and Europe as naval powers with the support of NATO in front of the power of the Russian Federation are struggling and competing. The geographical range of this fault starts from the Barents Sea in the Arctic Ocean and eastern Finland to the countries separated from the former Soviet Union to the Black Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, North Africa, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean.\"\n\nFrom his point of view, the eastern Eurasia fault between the United States and the aligned governments in East Asia and the Pacific Ocean has been formed for the economic blockade of China and the dominance and control of the East-West maritime trade. He considers the third geostrategic fault to be ranging from the Mediterranean to West Asia. According to this understanding, the USA, the UK, and some other Western countries have created Israel in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nIran sees the development of these fault lines as potentially weakening Russia and China. Accordingly, Iran has supported Russia in the Ukraine war and worries that Hamas has been severely damaged by the Gaza conflict. Iran is also worried about developments in Taiwan and the possible weakening of China in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThis understanding of the future international order has been criticized by some influential Iranians, including former foreign ministers Mohammad Javad Zarif and Ali Akbar Salehi. They believe that the future international order does not have a fixed aspect and that Iran should not get closer to Russia and China at the cost of losing relations with the West. However, with reformers and moderates removed from the internal power structure, the supporters of a more balanced foreign policy are in a weak position. Therefore, the continuation of the \"Look to the East\" policy should be considered a permanent trend in Iran's foreign policy even if the experience of relations with Russia and China and Iran's admission to groups such as the BRICS and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization have not met Iran's economic needs.\n\nMohammad Sadr, a former Iranian diplomat, has criticized the current approach, saying that sanctions have kept Iran from controlling inflation or benefiting from new trade corridors.\n\nRussia and China have also not been reliable supporters of Iranian interests. Shahriar Heydari, a member of the National Security and Foreign Policy Commission of the Iranian Parliament, criticized Russia and China's support for the positions of Arab governments regarding three small islands in the Persian Gulf, which Iran controls and the United Arab Emirates claims.\n\nYet, Russia and China do value Iran's challenge to the U.S.-led international system and have joined Iran and North Korea in a so-called ''The Axis of Upheaval'' against the current world order.\n\nAlexander Dugin, an advisor to Russian President Vladimir Putin, has praised Iran and its support for an \"Axis of Resistance\" against Israel and the U.S. as important in confronting what Dugin calls the West's \"evil liberalism.\" Dugin sees Iran, a majority Shi'ite Muslim nation, as an ally of Orthodox Christian Russia against this liberalism and even suggested that Iran will be present at Armageddon as part of an \"Army of Light\" against an \"Army of Darkness.\"\n\nRajab Safarov, who is also close to Putin, considers a Western-oriented Iran as more dangerous for Russia than a nuclear-armed Iran.\n\nAt the same time, the Iranian deep state worries that Russia may eventually reach an accommodation with the West over Ukraine in a compromise similar to the 1907 St. Petersburg Agreement between tsarist Russia and imperial Great Britain. Even as it doubles down on a \"Look to the East\" policy, Iran acknowledges that outreach to the West is necessary in emergency situations as a tactical choice.", "source": {"uri": "tabnak.ir", "dataType": "news", "title": "tabnak.ir"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Khatami", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mohammad Khatami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Rouhani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hassan Rouhani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebrahim_Raisi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ebrahim Raisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmoud_Ahmadinejad", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eurasia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akbar_Hashemi_Rafsanjani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_School_of_Economics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London School of Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikhail Gorbachev"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iranian Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mediterranean Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran\u2013Iraq_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran\u2013Iraq War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_W._Bush", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of George W.

"body": "In a recent letter to the UN Security Council, the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the United Nations in New York vehemently rejected the accusations leveled by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom (E3) regarding Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThe letter, singed by Iran's Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, outlined Tehran's position on its peaceful nuclear activities and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), emphasizing the Islamic Republic's commitment to international agreements and its rights under these frameworks.\n\nThe letter firmly denied the E3's claims of Iran's non-compliance with the JCPOA.\n\nAccording to the letter, Iran's remedial measures regarding its nuclear commitments were taken in response to the United States' unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA on 8 May 2018, and the subsequent failure of the E3 to honor their commitments.\n\nIran's actions, which began a full year after the US withdrawal, aimed to restore the balance of reciprocal commitments and benefits under the agreement.\n\nThe Iranian UN Mission further said the E3 failed to fulfill their obligations under the JCPOA.\n\nThe letter highlighted that the E3 has not implemented the required sanctions-lifting measures as specified on Transition Day (October 18, 2023), marking a significant non-compliance that violates both the JCPOA and UNSC Resolution 2231 (2015), that endorsed the nuclear deal.\n\nThe letter reaffirmed Iran's consistent compliance with its obligations under the Comprehensive Safeguard Agreements (CSA) and its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nIran's suspension of the modified Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements was cited as a legitimate response to the re-imposition of sanctions by the US and the EU, in line with paragraphs 26 and 36 of the JCPOA.\n\nThe Iranian Mission to the UN stressed that Tehran's decision to enrich uranium in the nuclear site of Fordow was a remedial measure in response to the non-compliance of the US and E3/EU with their legally binding obligations.\n\nAll such activities, the letter stressed, remain under the IAEA supervision, demonstrating Iran's commitment to peaceful nuclear development.\n\nThe letter underscored Iran's unwavering adherence to the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and its inalienable right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\n\nIran categorically rejected allegations that its nuclear program poses a threat to international peace and security, reiterating its rejection of nuclear weapons based on ideological and strategic considerations.\n\nThe Iranian UN Mission reaffirmed its dedication to diplomacy and its willingness to resume talks aimed at the full implementation of the JCPOA by all participants.\n\nThe letter emphasized that the JCPOA remains the best option for resolving the nuclear issue, representing a significant diplomatic achievement that benefits all parties involved.\n\nIn conclusion, Iran's letter to the UN Security Council called for a balanced and fair approach to the JCPOA and urged the E3 to honor their commitments, thereby contributing to the agreement's revival and the maintenance of international peace and security.", "source": {"uri": "ifpnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Iran Front Page"}, "authors": [],

Governors", "body": "The following are the general outlines of the document:\n\nIran has fully complied with its commitments under the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (INFCIRC/214), and has made every effort to enable the IAEA to effectively carry out its verification activities in Iran, including safeguards and monitoring measures that are unique to the IAEA's verification regime.\n\nHowever, the separation of issues in these two reports has not been properly observed.\n\nSome matters related to the JCPOA, the 2025 nuclear deal, have been repetitively included in the Safeguards (NPT) report, and vice versa, some NPT-related issues have been observed in the report on the JCPOA.\n\nFollowing the illegal US withdrawal from the JCPOA in May 2018 and the inability of the European Union/E3 (Germany, UK, France) to fulfill their commitments, Iran suspended its voluntary transparency measures beyond the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement (CSA).\n\nIran's decision to suspend the implementation of its JCPOA commitments was fully in line with the country's inherent rights under Paragraphs 26 and 36 of the JCPOA, in response to the illegal US withdrawal from the nuclear deal and the inability of the E3 to adhere to their commitments.\n\nThis clear reality cannot in any way serve as a basis for the E3 to refrain from fulfilling their own obligations.\n\nThe E3's decision to refrain from implementing their sanctions-lifting commitments, as specified in Paragraph 20 of Annex V of the JCPOA on the Transition Day (October 18, 2023), is an unlawful act and another blatant example of their failure to fully comply with their obligations under both the JCPOA and UN Security Council Resolution 2231.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the IAEA's assessments are based on unreliable information and invalid documents provided by a regime (Israel) that not only constantly conspires against Iran's relations with the agency, but also commits sabotage, attacks, and threat of attacks against Iran.\n\nGiven the increased cooperation with the IAEA in recent years, Iran has implemented voluntary measures within the framework of several joint statements, including the joint statement of March 4, 2023.\n\nRecently, the persistent political pressures exerted by certain countries have reached a point where even technically resolved issues are subsequently changed in the IAEA's reports, contrary to what was agreed upon.\n\nThese politically-motivated pressures prevent the agency from performing its professional and impartial role.\n\n4353**2050", "source":

Former US President Donald Trump illegally pulled out of the deal in 2018 while the current US President, Joe Biden, has signaled that he is ready to resurrect the agreement.\n\nRussia, the UK, Germany, China, the US, and France have been in talks with Iran since April 2021 to reinstate the deal.\n\nThe talks to salvage the JCPOA kicked off in the Austrian capital of Vienna in April 2021, with the intention of examining Washington's seriousness in rejoining the deal and removing anti-Iran sanctions.\n\nThe negotiations have been at a standstill since August due to Washington's insistence on its hard-nosed position of not removing all the sanctions that were slapped on the Islamic Republic by the previous US administration.

It asks Tehran to take \"necessary and urgent measures\" to resolve the alleged safeguard issues.\n\nBefore the voting, several countries issued a joint statement calling the adoption of the anti-Iran resolution a miscalculation and warned of its negative consequences. They also urged member states to resist the efforts to politicize safeguarding issues by not voting on the resolution.\n\n4399", "source": {"uri": "en.irna.ir", "dataType": "news", "title": "IRNA English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic_News_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Republic News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of directors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vienna"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_program_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear program of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Nonviolence", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Nonviolence", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://img9.irna.ir/d/r2/2024/06/05/4/171192142.jpg?ts=1717612969229", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623631", "eventUri": "eng-9623631", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

This brings the number of collaborating centres in the field of nuclear security worldwide to ten.\n\nZeyad Alsaaydeh, Chairman of the Board of Directors of NCNRS, which is part of Jordan's Energy and Minerals Regulatory Commission, said: \"Jordan has been constantly working to strengthen the national nuclear security architecture to combat nuclear smuggling and illicit trafficking of nuclear and other radioactive material, and to respond to nuclear security events.\"\n\nHe added: \"This agreement comes at a time when global cooperation in the radiological and nuclear sector is essential. NCNRS has strengthened its capabilities and is equipped with the latest technologies, enabling its specialized and qualified technical personnel to support all activities agreed upon.\"\n\nRana Abida, Charg\u00e9 d'affaires at the Permanent Mission of Jordan in Vienna, agreed. \"The designation of NCNRS as collaborating centre will support the IAEA's activities and solidify the centre's goals of enhancing coordination between national agencies to secure nuclear and radioactive material, and counter illicit trafficking, and we hope this will benefit nuclear security in the region as well,\" she said.\n\nThe long collaboration between NCNRS and IAEA in nuclear security over the years has resulted in the organization of several training courses, as well as in NCNRS participation in coordinated research projects, such as the 'Facilitation of Safe and Secure Trade Using Nuclear Detection Technology - Detection of RN and Other Contraband', and 'Advancing Maintenance, Repair, and Calibration of Radiation Detection Equipment'. In addition, NCNRS participates in the International Network of Front Line Officers and Organizations for Nuclear Security Detection and the International Network for Nuclear Security Training and Support Centres.\n\nNCNRS facilities also include a radiation detection training facility, equipped with radiation portal monitors and hand-held detectors. The establishment of NCNRS as a collaborating centre of the IAEA will play an important role in further enhancing capacity building for nuclear security worldwide.\n\nAbout Collaborating Centres\n\nAn IAEA Collaborating Centre is a national institution, department or laboratory, which focuses on research, development and training and which has been designated by the IAEA to support the IAEA's programmatic activities by implementing an agreed work plan. The designation of such a Centre is done through an IAEA Collaborating Centre Agreement. This Agreement is a legally binding document signed by both parties, which contains the undertakings of the parties and the duration of designation as well as the objectives, activities and expected results and outcomes.\n\n/Public Release.

the path of the country's progress with cases and accusations.\"\n\nEmphasizing that the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) was the result of the same 20 years of negotiations, Eslami added: \"They tried to close Iran's nuclear file by leveling accusation in this way, but the resistance of the Iranian nation and the guidance of the Supreme Leader of the revolution did not allow this sector to suffer and was able to progress and reach the set goals despite pressures and disturbances\".\n\nThe AEOI chief further said that the efforts have been made to expand nuclear technology in

{"id": 231285532, "title": "Hundreds of cancer patients hit by NHS cyber attack as thousands of appointments cancelled", "text": "Patients with cancer and those needing emergency operations were among those who had their treatment cancelled this week due to a major cyber attack on NHS hospitals in London, The Independent can reveal. More than 200 emergency and life-saving operations, including those which should be done within 24 hours, had to be cancelled by Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 Foundation Trust (GSTT) and King\u2019s College University Hospital FT. Information obtained by this paper reveals the scale of disruption to NHS services in south London after Synnovis, a supplier of pathology services to the hospitals, was hit by a ransomware attack from Russian cyber-crime hackers. It is not yet clear how long the disruption will last, however hospitals are concerned they will struggle if it contiues for more than a few days. According to a source, Synnovis carries out tens of thousands of tests a day but is unable to do so as it cannot access systems. GSTT and King\u2019s College declared critical incidents this week as has mental health and community care provider South London and Maudsley NHS trust, which was also affected. The impact may also extend beyond London as Synnovis supplies, some services to other hospitals. The Independent can reveal: Blood transfusions were among the main issues following the attack and healthcare leaders are concerned as cross-checking blood will be required for emergency operations. However, as reported earlier this year there is a national shortage in the supply of O+ and O- blood across the country. Synnovis supplies the IT platform for pathology services to hospitals that include; Guy\u2019s Hospital, St Thomas\u2019 Hospital, Denmark Hill Hospital, transplant centre The Royal Papworth and Harefield Hospital, and children\u2019s hospital the Evelina. It also is the main pathology platform provider for GP services across six London boroughs \u2013 Bromley, Southwark, Lambeth, Bexley, Greenwich and Lewisham. The ransomware attack, which occurred on Monday, is suspected to have been carried out by Russian cyber-crime group Qilin. Synnovis has received a ransomware note however The Independent understands it is not clear whether the hackers have extracted patient data. Sources told The Independent the impact on NHS services could last for months, although the most urgent and priority services could be restored in weeks. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is involved in managing the situation alongside the NHS and the Department of Health and Social Care. An NHS London spokesperson said: \u201cNHS staff are working around the clock to minimise the significant disruption to patient care following the ransomware cyber-attack and we are sorry to all those who have been impacted. Pathology services are integral to a wide range of treatments and we know that a number of operations and appointments have been cancelled due to this attack \u201cWe are still working with hospitals and local GP services to fully assess the disruption, and ensure the data is accurate. In the meantime our advice to patients remains, if you have not been contacted please do continue to attend your appointments.\u201d A Synnovis spokesperson said: \u201cSynnovis continues to work closely with NHSE and the NCSC to prioritise and restore our services as quickly and safely as possible. \u201cWe are in the process of implementing a number of operational workarounds to minimise the impact on partner services. Our teams are working continuously and we will provide further updates as we are able.\u201d", "summary": "<p><strong>Exclusive: </strong>Hundreds of patients urgently referred for suspected cancer had appointments cancelled </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/nhs-cyber-attack-london-hospitals-cancer-b2558871.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/05/08/8f11e8b349a7648a9b803d97820d4a20Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3NjU1Mzc4-2.2017962.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:38:55", "author": "Rebecca Thomas", "authors": ["Rebecca Thomas"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.108}

Various causes are responsible for this transition, including its consequences and the difficulties associated with incorporating renewable energy into the worldwide power system. Various factors contribute to the adoption of renewable energy.\n\nIt is important to analyze the factors that promote the adoption of renewable energy, specifically focusing on environmental concerns.\n\nAs stated in the 2018 report \"Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C\" by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the increasing recognition of climate change and its negative impacts has prompted worldwide initiatives to decrease carbon emissions. Renewable energy, known for its minimal greenhouse gas emissions, has become an important solution to combat climate change.\n\nThe International Renewable Energy Agency's report \"Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2019\" confirms that renewable energy technologies, including solar photovoltaics (PV), wind turbines, and energy storage systems, have made significant progress in terms of cost reduction and efficiency improvement. As a result, renewable energy has become increasingly competitive with conventional energy sources.\n\nAccording to the Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century's \"Renewables 2020 Global Status Report\", governments around the world have introduced different policies and incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy. These include feed-in tariffs, tax credits, renewable portfolio standards, and carbon pricing mechanisms.\n\nThe 30% Milestone has various connotations.\n\nEnergy security can be improved by diversifying the energy mix to include renewable sources. This reduces reliance on fossil fuels, which are affected by geopolitical uncertainties and price volatility, as highlighted in the International Energy Agency's report \"World Energy Outlook 2020\".\n\nFurthermore, there exist several economic prospects. According to the United Nations Environment Programme's report \"Global Trends in Renewable Energy Investment 2019\", the renewable energy industry is now a major catalyst for economic growth, promoting innovation, generating employment, and attracting investments. Moreover, the decentralized characteristic of renewable energy promotes local economic growth and empowers communities.\n\nFurthermore, it is imperative to take into consideration the societal advantages. According to the World Health Organization's report \"Household Air Pollution and Health\", the availability of clean and affordable energy has a positive impact on public health. It achieves this by decreasing air pollution and supplying electricity to disadvantaged communities, especially in rural regions of developing nations.\n\nVarious problems and possibilities must be taken into account.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, the irregular and unpredictable character of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, presents difficulties in maintaining a stable and reliable power infrastructure. Nevertheless, the progress in grid management technology and the creation of smart grids provide remedies to improve the incorporation of renewable energy sources.\n\nThe European Commission, in their report on \"Clean Energy for All Europeans,\" recognizes that effectively managing the fluctuation of renewable energy generation necessitates the use of scalable energy storage technology and flexible demand-side management measures. System flexibility can be improved by the utilization of battery storage systems, pumped hydro storage, and demand response programs.\n\nAccording to the World Bank's report on \"RISE 2020: The Retail-Industry System Emissions model,\" in order to increase the proportion of renewable energy in the electricity mix, it is necessary to have strong policy frameworks that give priority to long-term decarbonization objectives, encourage investments in renewable energy, and guarantee a fair transition for those affected.\n\nAcademicians assert that the increase in renewable energy is serving as a catalyst for a worldwide transition in the electrical industry. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are expected to have a substantial impact on the worldwide energy supply in the medium to long term, as discussed by Breyer et al. in their article \"On the role of solar photovoltaics in global energy transition scenarios\" published in Progress in Photovoltaics Research and Applications (2017).\n\nIn the piece \"The renewable energies technology surge: a new techno-economic paradigm in the making?\" published in Futures (2013), Mathews explains that the shift towards renewable energy sources is becoming increasingly significant. This is not only due to the need to reduce carbon emissions, but also because of the economic benefits linked to renewable energy technologies.\n\nMathews also acknowledges that countries such as China have emerged as significant participants in renewable energy investments, namely in wind and solar photovoltaic (PV) systems.\n\nMacknick et al. (2012) found that renewable energy sources, such as solar PV and wind, are not only transforming the energy sector but also impacting water consumption patterns, as stated in their article \"The water implications of generating electricity: water use across the United States based on different electricity pathways through 2050\" published in Environmental Research Letters.\n\nThe water impacts of electricity generation fluctuate depending on the specific energy pathways, highlighting the significance of adopting sustainable methods in energy production. In addition, the sporadic characteristics of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind require the advancement of energy storage systems to guarantee the stability of the power grid, as stated by Wen et al. in their publication \"Engineering electrochemical surface for efficient carbon dioxide upgrade\" in Advanced Energy Materials (2021).\n\nIn their publication titled \"Product environmental footprint (pef) of photovoltaic modules -- lessons learned from the environmental footprint pilot phase on the way to a single market for green products in the European Union\" in Progress in Photovoltaics Research and Applications (2017), Wade et al. acknowledged that the global push to reduce carbon emissions in the energy sector aligns with international agreements such as the Paris Agreement. They emphasized the necessity of significant increases in photovoltaic (PV) capacity in the coming decades.\n\nThe transition to renewable energy seeks to reduce carbon emissions and stimulate economic development, as highlighted by Hussain et al. in their article \"Evaluating the impact of energy and environment on economic growth in BRI countries\" published in Energy & Environment (2022).\n\nInvestments in renewable energy have been shown to have a favorable effect on economic development, demonstrating a connection between sustainability and prosperity. In order to achieve ambitious climate goals, it is essential to have a combination of renewable energy sources. Among these sources, solar photovoltaic (PV) energy is emerging as a dominant and cost-effective solution. This information is based on the publication by L\u00f6ffler et al., titled \"Designing a model for the global energy system -- genesys-mod: an application of the open-source energy modeling system (osemosys)\" which was published in Energies in 2017.\n\nIntegrating renewable energy into power systems can greatly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and decrease reliance on conventional fossil fuel plants (source: \"An Application of Hunter-Prey Optimization for Maximizing Photovoltaic Hosting Capacity Along with Multi-Objective Optimization in Radial Distribution Network\", 2022).\n\nFurthermore, Shen et al. (2022) explored the relationship between renewable energy technologies and environmental sustainability in Africa. Their study, titled \"Tracking environmental sustainability pathways in Africa: do natural resource dependence, renewable energy, and technological innovations amplify or reduce the pollution noises?\", suggests that renewable energy technologies have the potential to reduce environmental pollution and promote sustainability.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType":

It is a roadmap guiding the country away from reliance on coal-fired power towards renewable energy alternatives by 2027. It aims to include all communities and workers who will be affected by the energy transition.\n\nThe plan says everyone should have access to electricity through a mix which includes renewable energy. This energy transition must also create new employment opportunities, particularly in the burgeoning renewable energy sector, and contribute to economic development. At the same time, it must set up an energy future where power is reliable and not disrupted.\n\nThese are ambitious goals. Yet the urgency of South Africa's energy transition cannot be overstated. As one of the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases, South Africa faces increasing pressure to curb its carbon footprint. But the transition to cleaner energy sources must not come at the expense of marginalised communities or make socio-economic inequality worse.\n\nI research energy transitions and women's empowerment in these renewable energy projects. I argue that the Just Energy Transition Implementation Plan must take eight critical steps if it is to succeed. These include mobilising different forms of international finance, investing in new infrastructure and involving communities.\n\nWithout these steps the plan lacks the foundation to shift South Africa towards a sustainable, low-carbon economy.\n\nProgress so far\n\nThe South African government has started reforms to stimulate private investment in renewable energy infrastructure and establish a competitive electricity market. Before this, independent power producers had to go through a detailed, often lengthy process to get a generating licence.\n\nThe government has removed licensing requirements for independent power producers, making it easier for them to launch and manage energy projects of any size. This aims to attract more independent producers to the energy market, fostering investment and innovation.\n\nThe government also introduced tax incentives and rebates. These allowed businesses to reduce their taxable income to reflect the decreasing value of renewable energy installations over time. This encourages more investment in clean energy infrastructure.\n\nThe government has also provided debt relief to Eskom, South Africa's state-owned utility. This allows Eskom to invest in renewable energy infrastructure and grid upgrades. It also gives Eskom the space to pay for projects mitigating the impacts of the transition on communities and workers.\n\nOne such initiative is the Komati Power Station Just Energy Transition project, which involves decommissioning the coal-fired power station and transitioning to renewable energy sources.\n\nThe debt relief package prohibits Eskom from borrowing any more money. However, the South African Renewable Energy Masterplan, part of the plan, aims to assemble international pledges, low interest concessional loans from development finance institutions, and private sector investment to pay for the transition.\n\nWhat needs to be done\n\nThere are eight critical steps that will make the Just Energy Transition Implementation Plan work. These are:\n\n1) Continuously improve the mechanisms that facilitate project approvals and attract investors, including cooperatively owned projects. This broadens the participation in the renewable sector by including cooperatively owned renewables. It also helps it grow by diversifying the investment base and enhancing community involvement.\n\n2) Prioritise just transition principles. Make sure that fairness guides every part of the shift to cleaner energy. Give extra attention to communities and workers who might be hurt by the changes. Take specific actions to tackle unfairness, such as making sure everyone can afford energy, creating new jobs, and helping people gain new skills.\n\n3) Promote community engagement and participation: Actively involve local communities and indigenous groups in the shift to renewable energy. This means listening to their voices and making decisions together. Projects must be set up that communities can own and benefit from equally. This collaborative approach aims to share the advantages of clean energy fairly among everyone involved.\n\n4) Maximise international support and financing. Continue to work with other countries, investor groups and development finance institutions. The aim must be to bring in more money and help for the just energy transition.\n\n5) Promote renewable energy investment. Encourage private sector investment by offering enticing policies, clear regulations and new financing options. This involves building public-private partnerships between the government and those developing renewable energy.\n\n6) Invest in more infrastructure and in modernising the grid. Upgrading and expanding the electrical grid will allow it to include more energy from solar and wind power. Renewables can generate a lot of power on a windy or sunny day and much less when it's calm or cloudy. The grid needs to be flexible enough to maintain a steady and reliable power supply without power outages. Electricity access must be improved in areas that currently have limited or no power, so that more communities benefit.\n\n7) Foster skills development and local capacity building. Boost training and education in renewable energy for local communities and workers. This can be done by working closely with schools, businesses, and government to set up new training programmes.\n\n8) Monitor and evaluate progress. Set up systems to check how close we are to our goals and find ways to get better. Make this public so that trust is built and everyone supports the move towards cleaner energy.", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Just Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskom", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eskom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_power_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent power producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Debt relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon footprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-fired_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coal-fired power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_finance_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Development finance institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_incentive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax incentive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.econotimes.com/assets/images/econotimes/metaDefault2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545731", "eventUri": "eng-9545731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

It aims to include all communities and workers who will be affected by the energy transition.\n\nThe plan says everyone should have access to electricity through a mix which includes renewable energy. This energy transition must also create new employment opportunities, particularly in the burgeoning renewable energy sector, and contribute to economic development. At the same time, it must set up an energy future where power is reliable and not disrupted.\n\nThese are ambitious goals. Yet the urgency of South Africa's energy transition cannot be overstated.

But the transition to cleaner energy sources must not come at the expense of marginalised communities or make socio-economic inequality worse.\n\nI research energy transitions and women's empowerment in these renewable energy projects.

These include mobilising different forms of international finance, investing in new infrastructure and involving communities.\n\nWithout these steps the plan lacks the foundation to shift South Africa towards a sustainable, low-carbon economy.\n\nProgress so far\n\nThe South African government has started reforms to stimulate private investment in renewable energy infrastructure and establish a competitive electricity market. Before this, independent power producers had to go through a detailed, often lengthy process to get a generating licence.\n\nThe government has removed licensing requirements for independent power producers, making it easier for them to launch and manage energy projects of any size. This aims to attract more independent producers to the energy market, fostering investment and innovation.\n\nRead more: COP28: South Africa pioneered plans to transition to renewable energy - what went wrong\n\nThe government also introduced tax incentives and rebates. These allowed businesses to reduce their taxable income to reflect the decreasing value of renewable energy installations over time. This encourages more investment in clean energy infrastructure.\n\nThe government has also provided debt relief to Eskom, South Africa's state-owned utility. This allows Eskom to invest in renewable energy infrastructure and grid upgrades. It also gives Eskom the space to pay for projects mitigating the impacts of the transition on communities and workers.\n\nRead more: South Africa and renewable energy: a 12-year-old programme offers insights for countries moving to cleaner power sources\n\nOne such initiative is the Komati Power Station Just Energy Transition project, which involves decommissioning the coal-fired power station and transitioning to renewable energy sources.\n\nThe debt relief package prohibits Eskom from borrowing any more money. However, the South African Renewable Energy Masterplan, part of the plan, aims to assemble international pledges, low interest concessional loans from development finance institutions, and private sector investment to pay for the transition.\n\nWhat needs to be done\n\nThere are eight critical steps that will make the Just Energy Transition Implementation Plan work. These are:\n\n1) Continuously improve the mechanisms that facilitate project approvals and attract investors, including cooperatively owned projects. This broadens the participation in the renewable sector by including cooperatively owned renewables. It also helps it grow by diversifying the investment base and enhancing community involvement.\n\n2) Prioritise just transition principles. Make sure that fairness guides every part of the shift to cleaner energy. Give extra attention to communities and workers who might be hurt by the changes. Take specific actions to tackle unfairness, such as making sure everyone can afford energy, creating new jobs, and helping people gain new skills.\n\n3) Promote community engagement and participation: Actively involve local communities and indigenous groups in the shift to renewable energy. This means listening to their voices and making decisions together. Projects must be set up that communities can own and benefit from equally. This collaborative approach aims to share the advantages of clean energy fairly among everyone involved.\n\n4) Maximise international support and financing. Continue to work with other countries, investor groups and development finance institutions. The aim must be to bring in more money and help for the just energy transition.\n\n5) Promote renewable energy investment. Encourage private sector investment by offering enticing policies, clear regulations and new financing options. This involves building public-private partnerships between the government and those developing renewable energy.\n\n6) Invest in more infrastructure and in modernising the grid. Upgrading and expanding the electrical grid will allow it to include more energy from solar and wind power. Renewables can generate a lot of power on a windy or sunny day and much less when it's calm or cloudy. The grid needs to be flexible enough to maintain a steady and reliable power supply without power outages. Electricity access must be improved in areas that currently have limited or no power, so that more communities benefit.\n\n7) Foster skills development and local capacity building. Boost training and education in renewable energy for local communities and workers. This can be done by working closely with schools, businesses, and government to set up new training programmes.\n\n8) Monitor and evaluate progress.

Take specific actions to tackle unfairness, such as making sure everyone can afford energy, creating new jobs, and helping people gain new skills.\n\n3) Promote community engagement and participation: Actively involve local communities and indigenous groups in the shift to renewable energy. This means listening to their voices and making decisions together. Projects must be set up that communities can own and benefit from equally. This collaborative approach aims to share the advantages of clean energy fairly among everyone involved.\n\n4) Maximise international support and financing. Continue to work with other countries, investor groups and development finance institutions. The aim must be to bring in more money and help for the just energy transition.\n\n5) Promote renewable energy investment. Encourage private sector investment by offering enticing policies, clear regulations and new financing options. This involves building public-private partnerships between the government and those developing renewable energy.\n\n6) Invest in more infrastructure and in modernising the grid. Upgrading and expanding the electrical grid will allow it to include more energy from solar and wind power. Renewables can generate a lot of power on a windy or sunny day and much less when it's calm or cloudy. The grid needs to be flexible enough to maintain a steady and reliable power supply without power outages. Electricity access must be improved in areas that currently have limited or no power, so that more communities benefit.\n\n7) Foster skills development and local capacity building. Boost training and education in renewable energy for local communities and workers. This can be done by working closely with schools, businesses, and government to set up new training programmes.\n\n8) Monitor and evaluate progress. Set up systems to check how close we are to our goals and find ways to get better. Make this public so that trust is built and everyone supports the move towards cleaner energy.\n\nRicardo Amansure does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\nBy Ricardo Amansure, Senior Researcher at the Centre for Sustainability Transitions, Stellenbosch University", "source": {"uri": "modernghana.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Modern Ghana Media Communication Ltd."}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Just Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskom", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eskom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_power_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent power producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Debt relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon footprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-fired_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coal-fired power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_finance_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Development finance institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellenbosch_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stellenbosch University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 55}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/12302020113338-1j041q5ccw-writer.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545731", "eventUri": "eng-9545731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Co-hosted by the World Energy Council and the Government of the Netherlands, the Congress is a critical turning point for clean and inclusive energy transitions worldwide and an opportunity to design and deliver better energy futures. HCSS strategic analysts Laura Birkman and Irina Patrahau represented the Hague Centre for Strategic Studies as official Congress partner.\n\n\"The 26th World Energy Congress brought together an enormous diversity of people and perspectives,\" senior strategic analyst Laura Birkman reflected. \"Central to the discussion was how to move the different global transitions forward, including the energy transition. There are multiple pathways to get there, but a key challenge will be to shift the current focus on supply (alignment of markets) to demand (alignment of people). The social transformation required will necessitate a user-centric system that understands and acts on the needs of people and industry.\"\n\n\"Energy is not about prosperity anymore, but a social justice issue. A just and inclusive energy transition will be key to its success.\"\n\nFor 100 years, the World Energy Congress has convened the cooperative power of the world energy community to turn inspiration into action, exploring innovative solutions to global challenges and shaping the future of energy.\n\n\"This year's World Energy Congress was clearly focused on addressing the energy trilemma of affordability, sustainability, and security, recognizing that an energy transition that does not advance societal well-being and environmental sustainability is a failed transition,\" HCSS analyst Irina Patrahau stated. \"Achieving these requires developing context-specific solutions for different geographies and different energy sources, rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.\"\n\nThe World Energy Congress is the world's longest established energy event led by the world's oldest energy community, delivering a world-class, independent and impactful energy gathering on a global scale. Throughout the four days of the Congress meeting, leaders came together to explore solutions on key topics including: the energy transition, e-Mobility, infrastructure, public sector and alternative fuels.\n\n\"An energy transition that does not advance societal well-being and environmental sustainability is a failed transition.\"\n\n\"Energy is not about prosperity anymore, but a social justice issue,\" Laura Birkman commented. \"A just and inclusive energy transition will be key to its success. The challenge of transitioning 'in' is just as great as the challenge of transitioning 'out'. A change making mentality will be critical in a world that is fueled by geopolitical tension and distrust. Focusing on the benefits of the energy transition rather than the costs, can help shift the conversation from winners and losers to a system that can be attractive for all.\"", "source": {"uri": "hcss.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "HCSS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_willemsen@hcss.nl", "name": "Patrick Willemsen", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Energy_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Energy Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hague", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Hague"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alternative fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://hcss.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/World-Energy-Congress-Rotterdam-2024-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545731", "eventUri": "eng-9545731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

As concerns about climate change and environmental degradation intensify, the shift from traditional fossil fuels to renewable energy sources has become imperative. These sources, primarily solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal energy, offer the promise of unlimited energy without the dire environmental consequences associated with coal, oil, and natural gas.\n\nThe allure of renewable energy lies in its ability to harness natural processes that are replenished continually. Solar power converts sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic cells or concentrated solar power systems, while wind energy uses the kinetic energy of air in motion to spin turbines. Similarly, hydroelectric power generates electricity from the flow of water in rivers or from man-made installations like dams. Geothermal energy, on the other hand, utilizes the Earth's internal heat to produce power.\n\nThe global transition to renewable energy is not merely an environmental imperative but also an economic opportunity. Investments in renewable technologies foster job creation in new industries, reduce energy prices, and decrease dependency on imported fuels. Moreover, renewables reduce pollution and have a significantly lower carbon footprint than conventional energy sources, contributing to a decrease in air quality-related health problems.\n\nAdopting renewable energy also involves challenges such as variability, storage, and integration with existing power grids. However, advancements in technology, improved storage solutions, and innovative policy frameworks are increasingly overcoming these hurdles. Governments worldwide are recognizing the benefits of renewables, implementing incentives for their adoption, and setting ambitious targets for their future contribution to national energy mixes.\n\nAs we move forward, renewable energy stands as a cornerstone of sustainable development. It offers a pathway not only towards a cleaner environment but also towards a more resilient and economically diverse global energy landscape.\n\nAs per the latest research done by Verified Market Research experts, the Global Renewable Energy Market shows that the market will be growing at a faster pace.

It is a roadmap guiding the country away from reliance on coal-fired power towards renewable energy alternatives by 2027. It aims to include all communities and workers who will be affected by the energy transition.\n\nThe plan says everyone should have access to electricity through a mix which includes renewable energy. This energy transition must also create new employment opportunities, particularly in the burgeoning renewable energy sector, and contribute to economic development. At the same time, it must set up an energy future where power is reliable and not disrupted.\n\nThese are ambitious goals. Yet the urgency of South Africa's energy transition cannot be overstated. As one of the world's largest emitters of greenhouse gases, South Africa faces increasing pressure to curb its carbon footprint. But the transition to cleaner energy sources must not come at the expense of marginalised communities or make socio-economic inequality worse.\n\nI research energy transitions and women's empowerment in these renewable energy projects. I argue that the Just Energy Transition Implementation Plan must take eight critical steps if it is to succeed. These include mobilising different forms of international finance, investing in new infrastructure and involving communities.\n\nWithout these steps the plan lacks the foundation to shift South Africa towards a sustainable, low-carbon economy.\n\nProgress so far\n\nThe South African government has started reforms to stimulate private investment in renewable energy infrastructure and establish a competitive electricity market. Before this, independent power producers had to go through a detailed, often lengthy process to get a generating licence.\n\nThe government has removed licensing requirements for independent power producers, making it easier for them to launch and manage energy projects of any size. This aims to attract more independent producers to the energy market, fostering investment and innovation.\n\nRead more: COP28: South Africa pioneered plans to transition to renewable energy - what went wrong\n\nThe government also introduced tax incentives and rebates. These allowed businesses to reduce their taxable income to reflect the decreasing value of renewable energy installations over time. This encourages more investment in clean energy infrastructure.\n\nThe government has also provided debt relief to Eskom, South Africa's state-owned utility. This allows Eskom to invest in renewable energy infrastructure and grid upgrades. It also gives Eskom the space to pay for projects mitigating the impacts of the transition on communities and workers.\n\nRead more: South Africa and renewable energy: a 12-year-old programme offers insights for countries moving to cleaner power sources\n\nOne such initiative is the Komati Power Station Just Energy Transition project, which involves decommissioning the coal-fired power station and transitioning to renewable energy sources.\n\nThe debt relief package prohibits Eskom from borrowing any more money. However, the South African Renewable Energy Masterplan, part of the plan, aims to assemble international pledges, low interest concessional loans from development finance institutions, and private sector investment to pay for the transition.\n\nWhat needs to be done\n\nThere are eight critical steps that will make the Just Energy Transition Implementation Plan work. These are:\n\n1) Continuously improve the mechanisms that facilitate project approvals and attract investors, including cooperatively owned projects. This broadens the participation in the renewable sector by including cooperatively owned renewables. It also helps it grow by diversifying the investment base and enhancing community involvement.\n\n2) Prioritise just transition principles. Make sure that fairness guides every part of the shift to cleaner energy. Give extra attention to communities and workers who might be hurt by the changes. Take specific actions to tackle unfairness, such as making sure everyone can afford energy, creating new jobs, and helping people gain new skills.\n\n3) Promote community engagement and participation: Actively involve local communities and indigenous groups in the shift to renewable energy. This means listening to their voices and making decisions together. Projects must be set up that communities can own and benefit from equally. This collaborative approach aims to share the advantages of clean energy fairly among everyone involved.\n\n4) Maximise international support and financing. Continue to work with other countries, investor groups and development finance institutions. The aim must be to bring in more money and help for the just energy transition.\n\n5) Promote renewable energy investment. Encourage private sector investment by offering enticing policies, clear regulations and new financing options. This involves building public-private partnerships between the government and those developing renewable energy.\n\n6) Invest in more infrastructure and in modernising the grid. Upgrading and expanding the electrical grid will allow it to include more energy from solar and wind power. Renewables can generate a lot of power on a windy or sunny day and much less when it's calm or cloudy. The grid needs to be flexible enough to maintain a steady and reliable power supply without power outages. Electricity access must be improved in areas that currently have limited or no power, so that more communities benefit.\n\n7) Foster skills development and local capacity building. Boost training and education in renewable energy for local communities and workers. This can be done by working closely with schools, businesses, and government to set up new training programmes.\n\n8) Monitor and evaluate progress. Set up systems to check how close we are to our goals and find ways to get better. Make this public so that trust is built and everyone supports the move towards cleaner energy.", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Just Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eskom", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Eskom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_power_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent power producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Conversation (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellenbosch_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stellenbosch University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt_relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Debt relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_footprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon footprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-fired_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coal-fired power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_finance_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Development finance institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_incentive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax incentive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public utility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cooperative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/586637/original/file-20240408-18-8s1hxr.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545731", "eventUri": "eng-9545731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Looking back at the first Congress, then called the World Power Congress, in London in 1924, global energy systems looked very different. In 1924, global oil production was around 2.8 million barrels per day, compared to almost 102 million barrels per day last year. In other words, a country like South Korea or Canada consumes today the same amount of oil that the whole world needed one hundred years ago.\n\nIn 1924, there was no nuclear energy in the global energy mix and renewables were probably beyond the imagination of policy makers. By 1975, there were 200 nuclear power reactors in 19 different countries, but solar are wind power were still practically nonexistent. It was not until the early 2000s that solar and wind began to gain traction and break records year after year, contributing 18 percent of the world's total energy consumption.\n\nUnlike previous energy transitions, the current energy transition is not mainly driven by a more superior technology in terms of energy density and efficiency alone. The current energy transition is mainly responding to the climate impacts related to energy generation and consumption over the last century, or what economists call \"externalities\". However, this transition towards more sustainable sources of energy is constrained by the increasing energy demand globally, especially in emerging and less developed economies. This makes the global energy transition measured against three main criteria, commonly referred to as the \"energy trilemma\": energy security, energy affordability, and environmental sustainability.\n\nTo address the energy trilemma, four critical discussion themes emerged during the centenary World Energy Congress in Rotterdam: 1. Accelerating the deployment of existing solutions, 2. Scaling innovative technologies, 3. The interaction of energy and artificial intelligence (AI), and 4. Humanizing the energy transition.\n\nThere has been great progress on deployment of clean energy technologies over the last 20 years that made most of these technologies cost-competitive with fossil fuels in today's market even without financial support. However, these technologies are not deployed fast enough to get us on track to meet our climate targets. For example, utility-scale wind and solar projects in the United States can take 4.5 years on average to obtain the necessary permits and navigate necessary environmental reviews for siting and construction.\n\nThere is a need for regulatory reforms that can strike the right balance between timely decisions on clean energy and infrastructure projects while preserving thorough environmental reviews. This balance would not leave project developers concerned about fluctuations in equipment costs while they are waiting on permits. The recent delays in offshore wind projects along US coastlines show how the combination of uncertainty, public acceptance, and affordability can impact the pace of the energy transition.\n\nIn their 2023 World Energy Transitions Outlook, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimated that accelerating the deployment of renewables, energy efficiency, and electrification could achieve 69 percent of global emissions reductions needed to reach net zero by 2050. This would leave almost a third of the needed abatement to innovative, disruptive technologies (e.g., long-duration energy storage, hydrogen, e-fuels, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS), carbon dioxide removal) that have not been deployed at a scale large enough to meet our climate targets.\n\nRenewables need long-duration energy storage at scale to ensure that this clean power is available anytime, day or night. Hydrogen and e-fuels will also be needed to support transportation and industrial applications that require liquid fuels, especially when their high heat demands can't be met with renewables. Although there has been some progress on production of these cleaner fuels with major hydrogen production and infrastructure projects in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, there are still gaps around how policies can create large demand signals to scale this market.\n\nAfter all these mitigation efforts are exhausted, there will still be carbon emissions in the air that need to be subtracted from our limited carbon budget, a clear and direct role for carbon management technologies. CCUS can capture emissions from unabated industrial resources or remaining fossil-based power generation units. Some industries, even if they were completely powered by clean energy, would still emit carbon. For example, almost 60 percent of the emissions from cement production are unavoidable process emissions from the calcination process (i.e., the decomposition of calcium carbonate into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide) rather than energy-related emissions. As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicated, climate mitigation efforts to date have been insufficient and there is a need for scaling carbon dioxide removal technologies to reduce the risks of climate overshoot and complement emissions reduction efforts, especially from hard-to-abate sectors.\n\nOver the last few years, AI has emerged as an enabler for the energy transition. Generative AI can play an important role in modernization of the electric grid by enabling grid operators to make better, faster decisions and optimize loads. Also, AI can be one of the most effective abatement tools for fugitive methane emissions by using satellite and aerial measurements to quantify, map, and predict methane leaks. This approach can revolutionize fugitive emissions abatement by moving from preventive measures to predictive and even descriptive measures.\n\nA successful emissions abatement strategy relies heavily on accurate measurements which can be challenging for companies with complex operations and supply chains. However, the automation capabilities of AI can drastically reduce the margin of error from manual inputs and provide accurate, real-time data to help companies identify where to focus their emissions reduction activities.\n\nAdditionally, AI can be used to improve the performance and increase the output of solar photovoltaic (PV) and concentrated solar power (CSP) systems by predicting solar output, reducing corrective maintenance costs, and providing a more accurate forecast of the capacity available to the grid from electric loads that can be turned on or off depending on the balance between electric demand and generation.\n\nWith the increase in electric vehicles (EV) adoption, AI-enabled energy demand forecasts will be critical in avoiding peak charges and reducing the burden on the grid. Although AI has many advantages to enable the energy transition, its huge energy footprint remains a challenge as countries plan for future energy needs. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that electricity consumption from data centers could double by 2026 to be roughly equivalent to the electricity consumption in Japan.\n\nSince this is the first energy transition in history that is not driven solely by technology metrics, it is critical to ensure that local communities are involved in climate action plans. With disproportionate impacts of climate change around the world, especially in the global South where most countries have historically contributed far less to global emissions, energy equity and climate justice should be at the center of the energy transition. There is a dire need for bridging the climate finance gap and facilitating the flow of funds to the Global South by de-risking investments and regulatory reforms in developing economies. This would also require institutional reforms in the finance sector to move towards new financing mechanisms (e.g., concessional finance, credit guarantee, grants) rather than the unfair, high-interest loans from multilateral banks that have been the main vehicle for energy infrastructure and development projects for decades.\n\nThe world has gone through many energy transitions before, but what probably differentiates the current energy transition is that it encompasses multiple energy transitions happening at the same time. There are transformations across the globe in energy generation processes, infrastructure development, energy policy frameworks, environmental laws, and financing mechanisms. While these transformations do not need to happen at the same pace in every region, countries should ensure that the collective energy transition efforts are sufficient to meet our global climate targets. We have enough tools today to shape the next hundred years of energy.\n\nA hundred years ago, participants at the World Energy Congress were probably not as concerned about energy-related climate impacts. However, we know better today about these impacts and how we can meet global energy needs without compromising environmental integrity. In his masterpiece, One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia Marquez showed us how it took five generations to decipher the prophecy of the Buendia family and their town of Macondo. We have deciphered the energy trilemma, but global action is imperative to navigate the storm and tackle the climate crisis. If we learned anything from Marquez's magical realism and the fate of the city of Macondo, we should work together to accelerate the deployment of energy and climate solutions that can shape a brighter future for people and planet.", "source": {"uri": "atlanticcouncil.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atlantic Council"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This is the series where we meet the scientists who have been quietly incrementally working towards the global development targets set by the United Nations in 2015.\n\nWorld leaders pledged to solve a range of economic, environmental and social issues, and the package of 17 Sustainable Development Goals were born.\n\nSince then, in a huge effort, thousands of researchers all over the world have been tackling the biggest problems that the planet faces today.\n\nIn episode seven, we look at Sustainable Development Goal number seven: how to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all.\n\nAnd meet an engineer who uses artificial intelligence to help Ghana design its renewable energy future.\n\nJulien Harou 01:21\n\nOkay, hi, my name is Julien Harou. I'm a professor in water management and infrastructure systems at the University of Manchester in the United Kingdom.\n\nI started out as pretty much a pure water resources professor. So I would look to help water companies and countries plan their their water resources and manage them.\n\nBut very quickly, because of hydropower, I moved into joint water and energy systems. And water is also used for food production. So I somehow grew from water to water, energy, food. The United Nations General Assembly in 2015 developed a series of goals. And goal number seven is the one related to energy. So the formal goal is to ensure access to affordable, reliable and sustainable modern energy for all.\n\nAnd so the question quickly becomes: \"Well, are we making any progress to that goal?\"\n\nWell, actually, the news is relatively good. From 2015 to 2021, the portion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 87% to 91%.\n\nSo it's pretty decent, that means there's a little less than than 10% of people now who don't have access to energy.\n\nThe other, the other thing that was mentioned was that these goal wants sustainable energy. And what that generally means is renewable energy. So energy that doesn't require burning fossil fuels. And in 2023, about 30% of the global energy generation was from renewable energy sources.\n\nThese have much lower carbon dioxide emissions. And so this is also a pretty big success, especially since....in the year 2000, so just less than 25 years ago, it was 18%. So the news for SDG goal number seven is actually pretty decent. And things are progressing rapidly.\n\nJulien Harou 03:33\n\nYou can't study in university water energy food systems, that doesn't exist. So it's quite, the people who are in this field, it's generally a little bit unusual where they come from.\n\nSo I was actually born in Brazil, grew up and raised in the United States. Then I trained in Belgium, my native country where my parents are from, as a geologist.\n\nAnd then slowly I started working in the in the water field, and then got drawn to civil engineering because I just saw the problems in the world created by infrastructure.\n\nSo I went back late in life. I was a mature student, and did graduate degrees at Cornell and UC Davis.\n\nAnd there I really started to focus on on water and economics. And so that's how I got slowly into this area of water, energy, food systems and human natural systems.\n\nRecently, I work mostly in Africa and Asia. And looking at how to better manage human natural systems.\n\nSo, my focus is on countries where the water, the energy and the food system, and the environment are interconnected and interacting and so when you act in one, you affect the the other.\n\nThe big turning point in my career is I was working on a project for the World Bank evaluating dam investments. So these are reservoirs, hydropower dams in in Nepal. And it occurred to me and to our research group that it was just not possible to evaluate the value of an investment in a hydropower dam if you didn't consider what it was contributing to the to the wider energy system.\n\nSo that's where I stopped being a pure water engineer and moved to, you know, water, energy food systems. Because I found you couldn't, you couldn't evaluate how valuable a water asset was an infrastructure asset like a hydropower dam, if you didn't consider how it was contributing to the energy system at national scale.\n\nAnd for example, what we're talking about today, renewable energy. You know, hydropower is a renewable source. But it's a renewable source that comes at a certain cost.\n\nYou have to flood certain areas, you have to change the way the water regime works. And so there's some environmental sacrifices there, and potentially human sacrifices.\n\nSurprisingly, even though I started my career as a geologist, and I really had no interest in computers whatsoever, I very quickly realized that these human natural systems are very large and very complex. And your brain just can't wrap itself around the problem. You need computers.\n\nSo strangely, from geologist, I went to kind of applied computer guy, and spent many years developing these computer simulation tools to represent how the different elements of water energy food systems work together.\n\nFinally, this led to artificial intelligence. It turns out, you can connect these simulators to these new artificial intelligence design methods.\n\nAnd you can find really clever ways to develop human natural systems that get lots of benefits and don't have too many negative impacts. So yeah, that was my career in a nutshell. Starting in geology and finishing in economics, engineering and artificial intelligence.\n\nThere are many ways to generate energy, and water is just one of them. And in fact, people have used water and moving water to help do work throughout history.\n\nFor many, many years, water was used to drive mills that would grind grain into flour to make bread. So that was the, that was the initial hydropower.\n\nNowadays, we just convert it to electricity. And so the way it works is that water is stored at altitude, it has a lot of potential energy, it's heavy, and it's high up and so when it flows down, that will create kinetic energy.\n\nAnd hydropower is simply taking that kinetic energy and using turbines and generators to convert the kinetic energy into the electricity that we use in the electrical grids and power grids.\n\nAnd so essentially, hydropower is this conversion of the energy that's in water into electricity. The big win from hydropower, and particularly storage hydropower, is that it's a renewable source because water falls from the sky in rainfall and that water becomes then available. If it's stored, it becomes available when you need it.\n\nHydropower is both renewable and dispatchable. Dispatchable is a technical term from the energy sector means in summary is that you can turn it off and on when you when you want it.\n\nThis is not the case for other renewable energy sources. So solar and wind energy are called variable sources or intermittent sources. That means they're unpredictable, right? You don't really know when it's going to be sunny, and you don't really know when it's going to be windy, and it can stop being sunny or windy at any time. So that's why those renewable sources are called variable or intermittent.\n\nIt just means that there's they are somewhat unpredictable. So hydropower is the perfect complement to that. And so, you know, that's, that's a good thing. It's a good thing that hydropower is compatible in that way.\n\nAnd it can allow countries to really increase their, the amount of renewables they use, right? If you have a backup of hydropower, you can have more solar, you can exploit more solar and more wind power, because you know, that if all of a sudden those turn off, you can just put on your hydropower.\n\nHowever, that sounds like a perfect solution. But imagine what would happen if the rivers were going up and down just to react to the how much wind and sun there were.\n\nYou would really change the way rivers look, you know, could become quite dangerous. You would never know if a river is going to be flowing quickly or, or slowly. It wouldn't be great for humans, but also not great for wildlife.\n\nSo, yeah. So although wind, solar and hydropower can work well together, in practice you have to make sure that you're not creating a negative impacts on humans and the environment when you when you do use them together.\n\nGhana is a country in West Africa. It has about 32 million people, the area is about the same as as the United Kingdom, perhaps. It's on the coast. It's near other countries like Burkina Faso and Nigeria.\n\nAnd the most surprising thing with Ghana is that has the Volta River, which in 1960s, there was a large dam created there.\n\nAnd this dam, called the Akosombo dam, it flooded a part of the Volta River, and created an absolutely huge reservoir that you can see from space. It's 8500 square kilometres.\n\nSo it's just a huge amount of landmass there that was lost. Of course, in exchange for power production.\n\nNowadays, it's about two thirds of the national production is from thermal sources. So these are things like natural gas and crude oil and diesel. But about one third is still from dams.\n\nThe other thing happening in Ghana is that they are, like most other countries, rapidly trying to increase the renewable energy there. It's currently well, because of hydropower, it's 33%, the solar and wind is quite low now in Ghana, just a few percent.\n\nAnd that is trying to be increased. One issue is that the solar potential is in the north, that's where it's quite sunny, in the highlands there. And most of the people live near the coast in the south. Right, so in the 1960s, this really large dam was put in place. Originally, it was mostly for a large aluminum smelter. They wanted to create metal production there, and they needed a lot of energy to do so.\n\nWhat happens is that the whole, the river was really changed to suit their energy needs. And so the dam was operated to favour baseload hydropower. So that means you're, you're trying to release the same amount amount of water all the time every day to have that steady supply of energy.\n\nAnd that really wasn't that great for the environment. The Volta river traditionally would have quite a bit of natural variability, it would have wet seasons, dry seasons. And so when all of a sudden it became the same amount of water flowing all year, it really affected the environment and the ecosystems and that had a few manifestations.\n\nFor example, the Volta river flows down into the sea, in an estuary. And there the fact that the saltwater and freshwater stopped mixing the way they did meant that there was less fish to be caught, less clams, oysters, and the fish catch was changed and decreased.\n\nThere was also unfortunately, a lot of growth of weeds and algae. The presence of aquatic weeds along the lakes and also the tributaries that flow into the Akosombo really negatively affected the local human health.\n\nThese weeds provide habitat for animals like blackflies, or mosquitoes, or snails, that became or that are vectors of waterborne diseases.\n\nAnd there's unfortunately several diseases that really strongly increased. One called bilharzia, one called river blindness, and malaria as well. You can definitely see how there's a clear impact healthwise from, from the dam.\n\nJulien Harou 13:47\n\nWe created a computer model of the Ghananian natural and human natural system. And we did that really to try to answer the question: \"What infrastructure elements should Ghana pick up over the next 20-30 years?\"\n\nSo how should they get their energy in the future? How should they improve their water supplies? What infrastructure should they put in place? So really, it's a design problem or an investment problem?\n\nAnd so the computer models were built specifically to answer those questions. And so, we have, you know, one river system model, which, you know, has the Volta River and other of the major rivers and the major dams.\n\nThen we had a power system model. This is like, imagine like a network of the of the grid, the electrical grid and you're representing all the locations where energy is generated and where energy is consumed.\n\nAnd then we also have, you know, the accounting of the benefits that come from water and energy. So every place where you have economic production of some sort like irrigation food production, that's also represented.\n\nAnd so the model will march along through time. Computer simulation of human natural systems, it's very cool.\n\nBut it's been active since the 1960s. So economists, scientists and engineers have been doing that, pretty much since the 1960s.\n\nThe really cool thing that hapened in the last 10 years is artificial intelligence. You can take your integrated resorce system simulator, which is maybe kind of boring, just a computer tool that tracks resources over time. And you can connect it to AI.\n\nYou can connect it to artificial intelligence design algorithms. In this case, we use one which is very cool, called evolutionary algorithms.\n\nThese are algorithms which just imitate evolution. If you look at yourself or your cat, and you will see that evolution produces amazing things.\n\nAnd so we just use the same processes of evolution. And we encode all the potential investments into these genomes.\n\nAnd then we allow these genomes to exist over many generations, and let the population evolve. And so it's kind of an artificial way to design a system where you kind of trick evolution to not evolve a species, but to evolve an infrastructure system that works very well.\n\nAnd so the evolutionary algorithm and the simulators just work hand in hand. And over millions of generations, they just refined the design.\n\nAnd after a lot of calculations, something that would take you years to do on your laptop, (we do it on supercomputers, of course, or cloud computers), you get these really evolved designs.\n\nAnd these will, these will recommend the synergistic ways that the water system, the energy system, and the food production system and the environmental system, how they can really synergistically and opportunistically work well together.\n\nOkay, so the the results of the study were quite interesting. The first thing the artificial intelligence did is it said, \"Oh, you know, renewable energy is good, let's generate a ton of new energy from solar power and wind power.\"\n\nAnd so that's the first thing it tried. It just, you know, full speed on expanding the renewable power from solar and wind.\n\nWhat happened then is that to produce a stable electrical grid, it needed to start having the hydropower just turn on and off.\n\nAs soon as there was not enough power from wind and sun, the hydropower would just release water.\n\nAnd so what happened is the rivers across Ghana in the computer model became very dangerous. Flashy, flashy rivers, if you will\n\nThey would just have high flows, and then they would have low flows. And it would just change all the time. And so that's not good for the environment. And it's not good for humans who live near the rivers. It is quite dangerous.\n\nSo in the end, what the computer model found, and what we were able to tease out of these artificial intelligence, a design approach, was a compromise, really.\n\nSo we looked at the trade-offs between all the performance metrics that we were tracking, all the benefits we wanted from the system. And in the end, it invested in a system that put quite a bit of biogas and solar power in the north of Ghana.\n\nA lot of winds near the coast on the southeast of the country where a lot of people live, and then created a whole series of new transmission lines across the country to kind of equalize, and, you know, to make sure that all the energy produced by in these different regions of Ghana, could, could be at the right place at the right time, if you will.\n\nAnd by doing that, really intelligently, it was able to really reduce the damage to rivers. And so the the hydro-peaking, or the kind of artificial river regime, was really reduced very much.\n\nIn this compromise solution that was found the intermittent renewables, although they could go up to nearly 40%, that was found to be very damaging to the, to the aquatic ecosystems.\n\nAnd so we were able to find a solution that is more like 20 to 30%, you know, because hydropower is already over 30%.\n\nSo we could get to a system by the 2030s. Ghana would be more than half of its national power would be from a renewable sources, but still it wouldn't have some of these damages that would happen if your only objective was increasing renewables.\n\nSo we were happy with this compromise solution. It was getting Ghana very quickly by the 2030s to more than half of their national energy from from well over half from renewable sources, and, but without some negative impacts that might happen if you try to do that too quickly.\n\nJulien Harou 20:28\n\nAt the moment the best predictions are that the renewable energy mix by 2030 will be about 42%, which is a very large amount.\n\nAt the year 2000, it was only about 17%. So going from in 20, you know, in 30 years going from 17% to 42% would really be a huge success for the world.\n\nBut what I think this study underlined is that because energy systems are linked to other natural resource, or other resource systems like water, food production and the environment, countries and policymakers in the UN and other places need to be very careful to not try to go too quickly and not try to change the way our human natural systems are organized, too quickly, because then you could have all sorts of negative social and economic and environmental impacts.\n\nIf you try to make the change too quickly, make the transition too quickly to renewable energy, you might create some negative impacts.\n\nAnd so that's really what this study tried to underline is that you should look at this the whole system, the whole country, or in some cases, in the case of power pools, where countries are working together, you should look synergistically at how the whole energy system can cooperate effectively with the water system, the food production system, the environment, and find solutions that are acceptable for all the different sectors and the regions of the country or the regions of the, or the countries in a multi-country system.\n\nWe're pretty excited about this design approach. So it's really a computer simulation linked to artificial intelligence.\n\nIt's an exciting use of of artificial intelligence design. We think that this will make lots of contributions. There's lots of researchers around the world who are starting to use these these methods.\n\nSo we're excited to see this work expanding throughout the world and countries making use of these, these planning and design methods to improve the way they select infrastructure investments.\n\nYou know, infrastructure is very expensive, it's there for a long time. And it's just essential that countries not make mistakes, you know, as they push forward in the energy transition.\n\nIt's just very important that they make infrastructure investment solutions, which make the most sense for their people, for their environment, and for their economies, so that you know, they can continue to thrive and they can quickly move towards, towards you know, in the direction of the SDGs in particular SDG number seven, the one on renewable energy and sustainable energy for all.\n\nFabio Pullizi: 23:39\n\nThanks for listening to this series How to save humanity in 17 goals.

Or follow us on Google News!\n\nAs a necessary step to remain on track to limit global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, the world must achieve net zero emissions by 2050. Renewable energy targets have been variously contentious, in flux, and ambitious since the Paris Agreement. Moreover, within the energy community, there has been growing debate on the feasibility of achieving a 100% global renewable energy system.\n\nProponents of 100% renewable energy scenarios argue that there is growing evidence that such an energy system -- completely devoid of fossil fuel and nuclear energy production -- is both technologically feasible and offers the lowest cost and most environmentally sustainable option for decarbonization.\n\nThe International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) Coalition for Action seeks to settle the debate as to whether 100% renewable energy targets can be achieved. In a new report, they compare three 100% renewable energy scenarios and two net-zero emissions scenarios, attempting to go beyond the feasibility debate for each individual scenario.\n\nThe study identifies common challenges and opportunities for a rapid and holistic shift towards more ambitious renewable energy targets and provides related policy recommendations. It outlines actions that can facilitate the success of such scenarios and identifies requirements to support a 100% renewable energy system by mid-century.\n\nChip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution!\n\nThe IRENA Coalition for Action states that the majority of anthropogenic emissions are due to energy-related activities. To meet renewable energy targets, harnessing technologies for solar, wind, hydro, geothermal bioenergy, ocean, and others, along with significantly increased energy efficiency measures, will be key to emission reductions.\n\nNet zero system scenarios are fundamentally based on 2 factors:\n\nThe 100% renewable energy scenarios differ in the milestones and exact technology and resources mix, but they do not allow for other than renewable energy sources by 2050 or soon after. Needless to say, achieving a 100% renewable energy system requires systemic changes in energy market design and infrastructure development. Long-term decisions must be implemented today, regardless of current market trends. Additionally, decisions are needed today to create an enabling environment in which the required infrastructure and capacity are readily available as we transition towards a 100% renewable energy future. A crucial approach in guiding how a 100% renewable energy system can be achieved is to examine various energy transformation scenarios.\n\nEach of the IRENA scenarios are in line with a 1.5\u00b0C target by mid-century, which is synonymous with preferred renewable energy targets set by the Paris Climate Accord of 2015. All the scenarios examined call for:\n\nVarious steps to achieve these end-use energy reductions are suggested, such as greatly improved efficiencies in building design and retrofits, expanded use of heat pump technologies, and demand-side management strategies.\n\nPerhaps the most important common finding among all scenarios is that electricity in total final energy consumption (TFEC) will grow substantially over the next 30 years, in part due to the electrification of the industrial, transport, and building sectors. A general increase in electric goods worldwide and an overall increase in sector coupling applications are also important contributing factors. Electrification can provide anywhere from 50% to more than 90% of TFEC by 2050, compared to around 20% in 2022. Consequently, there is a need to build a significant amount of new electricity capacity and enabling infrastructure to cover the needs of these sectors.\n\nThe overall rapid expansion of the electricity sector and the growth of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources will demand a transformation of the transmission and distribution capabilities of the grid. This will require large investments to expand and enhance the grid leading to smart and highly digitalized grids, such as upgrades in control and monitoring of grids. Additional storage capacities and various storage technologies will also be required.\n\nFinally, sector coupling is an important requirement to match VRE and flexible demand. Grid flexibility, achieved through storage technologies covering time scales from hourly to daily to seasonally, demand-side management of the load, and regional power trading, will be a major driver for a stable and reliable decarbonized energy system that still meets consumer requirements.\n\nFor solar PV, dramatic growth is expected in both distributed (rooftop) residential and commercial systems as well as large utility scale systems. For wind, significant growth in offshore and onshore wind deployments is anticipated. In all the scenarios, other renewable technologies, notably hydro, but also sustainable modern biomass use, geo- and solar- thermal systems, and wave and tidal systems will be relevant, but no other generating technology will see anywhere near the growth that will be achieved through wind and solar technologies.\n\nThe four scenarios that include bioenergy show that biomass technologies can supply anywhere from around 6% to more than 20% of all primary energy by mid-century. The contribution of bioenergy is most prominent for residential and industrial heat sectors where it is expected to provide hot water and steam for households as well as industries such as cement, steel, paper, and pulp. The share of traditional biomass use will largely be replaced by modern biomass use, factoring in air pollution and sustainability as adoption drivers, and, overall, marginally contributing to the energy supply by 2050.\n\nThe contribution of bioenergy is limited in the transport sector, where other options such as electricity and hydrogen are more prominent. Power generation from biomass is considered complementary to other sources such as solar PV, wind, and hydropower.\n\nThese sources have the potential to lead the world to achieving current projections for renewable energy targets.

Its increase was greater than the economy generally: Since 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, employment in Maine rose 1%, while clean energy employment increased by nearly 3%.\n\nThe energy efficiency sector is the largest among five categories, accounting for more than 8,600 jobs in 2022, or 58% of the state's clean energy workforce.\n\nThe sector includes workers who are involved in the research, manufacture, sales, installation, repair and professional service support of technologies and services intended to improve the efficiency of commercial, residential and industrial buildings. That includes high efficiency heating, ventilation and air conditioning and renewable heating and cooling. It accounted for more than 3,700 workers, or 43% of Maine's energy efficiency workers in 2022, according to the report.\n\nThe other sectors of the clean energy economy are clean energy power generation, alternative transportation, clean grid and storage and clean fuels.\n\nSubsidies of up to $10,600 for heat pump installation include rebates of as much as $8,000 by Efficiency Maine Trust, a quasi-state agency that promotes energy efficiency, and federal tax credits of up to $2,600. In addition to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the public money is helping to drive job growth to install, repair and service electric heat pumps.\n\nOther jobs on the rise in the energy efficiency sector are in energy efficient software, energy auditing and other areas.\n\nView this document on Scribd\n\nThe administration of Gov. Janet Mills had set a goal of installing 100,000 heat pumps in Maine homes by 2025, which has been surpassed. Last summer, the governor updated her goal to include an additional 175,000 heat pump installations by 2027.\n\nIn addition to boosting employment, the push for clean energy is prodding workers to spend more time on clean energy-related jobs, according to the report. So-called \"intensity-adjusted clean energy employment\" increased by 11% between 2018 and 2022 as clean energy employment expanded by nearly 6%. The report cites an HVAC firm in 2018 with six installers who only occasionally installed heat pumps and now employs six installers who exclusively do so.\n\nAs a result, the number of clean energy workers would not change, but the number of labor hours working with heat pumps increased and \"intensity-adjusted jobs\" would show a corresponding increase, the report said.\n\nThe report by BW Research Partnership uses data based on the annual United States Energy and Employment Report in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nAfter energy efficiency, the next largest clean energy segment was renewable electric power generation, which employs about one-fifth of the state's clean energy workers.\n\nAll clean energy technology segments grew since 2018. Jobs in alternative transportation increased at the greatest rate, 28%, adding nearly 200 jobs. The renewable electric power generation segment -- wind, geothermal, bioenergy, and hydropower -- added the greatest number, 300, between 2018 and 2022.\n\nMills last month vetoed legislation that would have required developers of clean energy projects to enter into an employer and employee \"harmony agreement\" with unions seeking to represent the developer's employees at the project site. The governor said the measure was ambiguous and too far-reaching in scope.\n\nThe Maine AFL-CIO said the legislation was an \"an attempt to ensure that new clean energy jobs, outside of construction, are good-quality, union jobs.\"\n\nOpponents, who included contractors and renewable energy developers, said the legislation would dissuade renewable energy development on state-owned land, invite legal challenges and \"unduly delay project development or interfere with Maine's clean energy targets.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heat pump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maine"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating,_ventilation,_and_air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity generation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Mills", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Janet Mills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioenergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bioenergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hydropower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL\u2013CIO", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFL\u2013CIO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_commercialization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy commercialization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geothermal energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545731", "eventUri": "eng-9545731", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 5}], "sentiment": 0.7411764705882353, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

With the continent experiencing rapid urbanization, population growth, and increasing industrialization, the energy demand has soared. Yet, the majority of the population still lacks access to electricity, hindering progress in key sectors such as healthcare, education, and commerce.\n\nReports show that Africa is the most energy-deprived continent globally, with over 75 percent of its population lacking access to electricity. The statistics are telling: in 2022, 600 million Africans lacked electricity, with a staggering 98 percent of them residing in sub-Saharan Africa. With Africa's population projected to soar from 1.4 billion to 2.5 billion by 2050, coupled with increasing urbanization and incomes, the energy demand is set to surge dramatically.\n\nThe nexus between energy security and economic prosperity is undeniable. Countries with abundant and well-managed energy resources have the potential to fuel industrialization, attract investment, and create jobs. Moreover, reliable access to electricity is essential for powering essential services, such as hospitals and schools, and for enabling the adoption of modern technologies that drive innovation and productivity.\n\nThe energy deficit in Africa poses a significant barrier to economic development, with approximately 546 million Africans living in poverty, making up about half of the continent's population. Access to energy is not only a matter of convenience but a prerequisite for fostering economic growth and creating employment opportunities.\n\nDespite Africa hosting 18 percent of the global population, its energy consumption remains disproportionately low, accounting for less than 6 percent of global energy usage. Particularly stark is the per capita energy consumption in sub-Saharan Africa, which stands at a mere 180 kilowatt hours (kWh), a fraction of the figures seen in Europe and the United States.\n\nThe gap between energy demand and supply continues to widen due to factors such as population growth, and disruptions in supply chains. There has been a reversal in efforts to increase electricity access, with nearly three-quarters of Africa's population still lacking access to clean cooking facilities. Africa boasts abundant energy resources, yet it remains the most energy-poor continent. The dependence on exporting resources rather than utilizing them domestically exacerbates this paradox.\n\nWeak, unreliable, and aging infrastructure poses a significant obstacle to improving energy access. Grid collapses, load shedding, and insufficient investment in maintenance undermine efforts to strengthen energy security. Also, high levels of debt limit the ability to invest in energy infrastructure, with debt servicing costs consuming a significant portion of government revenues. Many public utilities cannot meet energy needs, hampered by financial mismanagement and corruption.\n\nThe challenging business environment in Africa deters private sector investment in the energy sector, exacerbating the energy crisis. To address these challenges and work towards universal energy access, several recommendations are proposed.\n\n- Promote the use of natural gas as a transition fuel, combining renewable energy with gas to achieve universal access while minimizing emissions.\n\n- Scale up investment in renewable energy sources to meet energy needs sustainably, requiring collaboration between governments, multilateral organizations, and the private sector.\n\n- Invest in grid, off-grid, and mini-grid infrastructure to expand energy access, with a focus on rural areas where grid expansion is economically unfeasible.\n\n- Encourage private sector participation through deregulation, fostering competition, improving service quality, and reducing costs.\n\n- Establish transparent regulatory frameworks to mobilize private capital, ensuring accountability and de-risking investments in the energy sector.", "source": {"uri": "africanleadershipmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "African Leadership Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_brennan@africanleadershipmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Alex Brennan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_supply_and_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World energy supply and consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urbanization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Urbanization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Population growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sub-Saharan Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrialisation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Industrialisation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilowatt-hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kilowatt-hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_poverty_and_cooking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy poverty and cooking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand_response", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demand response"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.africanleadershipmagazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/c9c257bd-c9ff-4932-8102-42e663488402.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545731", "eventUri": "eng-9545731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Historically, the region has heavily relied on fossil fuels, notably oil and gas, which have driven its economic development over the past century. However, challenges such as declining fossil fuel reserves, price volatility, the impacts of climate change, and environmental concerns associated with fossil fuel usage have become pressing global issues. Consequently, countries in the region are reassessing their energy policies, aiming to shift towards cleaner energy sources, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, diversify their economies, and improve the living standards and well-being of Arab populations. This article examines the future of energy transition in the Arab region, highlighting the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.\n\nThis post was originally published on the Transparency Coalition in Extractive Industries (TCEI). Read the original here.\n\nThe Arab region boasts some of the world's largest reserves of oil and gas, which have played a significant role in its economic growth and development. These resources have long been the backbone of the region's economies, contributing vital support to infrastructure, education, and healthcare systems. However, despite the abundance of resources, many countries in the Arab region face significant challenges in the energy sector.\n\nFor instance, rapid population growth and urbanization in the region have led to increased demand for energy. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), primary energy demand in the Arab region is expected to rise by 56% by 2040, with electricity demand expected to double. Excessive reliance on fossil fuels has also led to several challenges, including environmental degradation from greenhouse gas emissions and rising energy production costs. Additionally, recent fluctuations in oil prices have underscored the need for diversification and the development of alternative energy sources.\n\nRenewable energy sources, which are renewable by nature and emit minimal pollutants, offer low-cost electricity options. According to the International Energy Agency, renewable energy facilities worldwide broke new records in 2021, continuing to rise by 8% in 2022.\n\nThe demand for primary energy in the Arab region is expected to increase by 56% by the year 2040, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\nThe Arab region is blessed with abundant renewable energy resources, particularly solar, wind, and hydropower, which are plentiful and becoming increasingly cost-effective. These resources have the potential to revolutionize the energy sector in the Arab world. Solar energy potential in the region is estimated at around 5000 terawatt-hours per year, while wind energy potential is approximately 50,000 megawatts. All of this makes the future of energy transition in the Arab region appear bright and full of opportunities.\n\nSome Arab countries are seeking to increase their solar energy production through ambitious projects under the umbrella of Vision 2030. However, despite the abundance of renewable energy resources, their deployment in the region has been slow due to various challenges, including policy and regulatory barriers, funding shortages, and a lack of skilled labor.\n\nThe Arab world is incredibly rich in renewable energy resources, notably hydroelectric, solar, and wind energy. According to the Arab Forum for Environment and Development (AFED) report for 2011, the Arab region has a combined hydroelectric capacity of approximately 10.7 gigawatts, with large hydroelectric stations in Egypt and Iraq, and stations of various capacities in Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, and Syria.\n\nRegarding solar energy utilization, the Arab world possesses vast resources due to its unique geographical location, which grants it the highest solar irradiance. A significant portion of the region falls within the so-called \"solar belt.\"\n\nIn the realm of wind energy, Egypt and Jordan are among the most suitable countries in the region for harnessing this source. Wind speed averages around 11.8 meters per second in the Gulf of Suez in Egypt and 7.5 meters per second in Jordan.\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia boasts an ideal geographic location for implementing solar energy projects, receiving 7 kilowatts per square meter per hour during the 12 daylight hours, significantly higher than sunny countries like Spain.\n\nYemen also holds high potential for generating energy through two important renewable sources: solar and wind. In 2022, Yemen signed agreements to implement renewable energy projects, including new solar energy projects, in several provinces.\n\nThis optimistic outlook indicates a promising future for solar energy in the Arab region. It opens avenues for Arab countries to keep pace with Europe and East Asia in solar energy projects, making them ideal nations for implementing solar energy projects to meet local demand and engage in retail sales.\n\nAll these factors reflect the high potential for solar energy generation in the Arab world, where solar energy sources range from 1460 to 3000 kilowatt-hours per square meter per year.\n\nThe Arab world possesses the highest solar irradiance, with a significant portion of it falling within what is known as the solar belt.\n\nThe region also holds high potential for wind energy generation, with Arab countries planning for more than 73 gigawatts of solar and wind energy projects on a facility scale, representing an increase of over five times the current capacity. Alongside operational projects, these will account for 91% of the Arab League's renewable energy goals for 2030.\n\nSome Arab countries have launched large-scale solar projects, such as Morocco, which constructed one of the world's largest solar power stations at a cost of around $9 billion.\n\nThus, the region hosts some of the highest solar irradiance levels globally, providing an excellent opportunity for solar energy utilization.\n\nWith the growing momentum towards renewable energy, the Arab region faces numerous challenges in successfully transitioning towards the use of renewable energy sources. Despite the availability of renewable natural resources in the region, the utilization of renewable energy sources remains limited. It is essential to identify and address the factors hindering the further development of these sources in the region.\n\nThe transition to a low-carbon and sustainable energy system in the Arab region poses several challenges, including a lack of necessary funding and infrastructure, weak regulatory and institutional frameworks, heavy reliance on hydrocarbons as a primary source of energy and income, increasing energy demand, and susceptibility to external shocks such as oil price fluctuations. Additionally, there is a lack of awareness and participation, along with conflicts and crises, exacerbating the situation. Not to mention the increasing greenhouse gas emissions and the effects of climate change.\n\nPolitical and regulatory barriers are among the challenges, as the lack of clear policies and regulatory systems to promote renewable energy represents a significant obstacle to its widespread adoption in the region. In many countries, fossil fuel subsidies are still in place, making it difficult for renewable energy to compete on a level playing field. Moreover, bureaucratic obstacles and a lack of political will have hindered the development of renewable energy projects.\n\nThe high cost of renewable energy projects and the lack of funding are among the primary challenges in the region.\n\nThe economies of the region rely heavily on the hydrocarbon sector, making the transition to renewable energy difficult without significant economic restructuring. Additionally, the high cost of renewable energy projects and funding shortages are major challenges in the region. While the cost of renewable energy has significantly decreased in recent years, it still requires substantial initial investments, which may be difficult to secure in countries with limited access to capital markets. Therefore, one of the major challenges is the high cost of renewable energy technologies compared to traditional fossil fuels. Despite the declining costs of renewable energy sources, they remain more expensive than traditional fossil fuels in many cases.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of infrastructure and skilled labor is another challenge. Arab countries often lack the necessary infrastructure to support the transition to renewable energy. Electricity grids in the region are often old and ill-equipped to handle widespread renewable energy production. Governments in the region may also lack the technical expertise required to effectively implement renewable energy policies. Deploying renewable energy projects requires skilled labor, which is often lacking in the Arab region due to underinvestment in education and technical training programs, resulting in a shortage of qualified personnel for the installation, operation, and maintenance of renewable energy systems.\n\nTechnical and technological problems such as intermittency and storage remain major challenges with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind energy. This means that energy cannot be generated continuously, which may require backup energy sources. Additionally, there is a need for energy storage technologies to store excess energy generated during peak production times for use during low production times. The cost of these technologies remains high - any energy storage technologies - which poses a barrier to their deployment in the region.\n\nThe investments in renewable energy according to geography_crop.\n\nWhile the Arab region is home to approximately 9 oil and natural gas exporting countries, and Arab states account for about 25% of global oil production and around 15% of natural gas production, many countries in the region face energy crises related to fuel supply or electricity generation, stemming from either high prices due to supply shortages or weaknesses in local extraction and refining capabilities, as well as deficiencies in energy infrastructure networks and their limitations. The increasing energy demand in the Arab region poses a crisis resulting from efforts for economic and industrial development or as a natural consequence of excessive population growth and urban expansion. This naturally burdens Arab countries in several aspects, including providing energy sources (oil, gas, and their derivatives), and ensuring energy transmission networks, with growing pressure on existing networks. Renewable energy presents an important solution and alternative to energy problems and crises, as it can reduce the need for fossil fuels and alleviate the burden on existing energy transmission networks.\n\nWhile the Arab region comprises approximately 9 oil and natural gas exporting countries, and Arab nations account for about 25% of global oil production and approximately 15% of natural gas production, many countries in the region suffer from energy crises, whether related to fuel supply or electricity generation associated with its derivatives. This is due either to price hikes concerning supply shortages or to weaknesses in local extraction and refining capabilities. Additionally, it is related to the inadequate infrastructure of energy networks and their limitations. The escalating energy demand in the Arab region constitutes a crisis stemming from efforts for economic and industrial development or as a natural consequence of excessive population growth and urban expansion. Naturally, this poses a burden on Arab countries in several aspects, including providing energy sources (oil, gas, and their derivatives), and ensuring energy transmission networks, with increasing pressure on existing networks. Renewable energy presents a significant solution and alternative to energy problems and crises, as it can reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and alleviate the burden on existing energy transmission networks.\n\nIn the face of these challenges, regional integration plays a crucial role in the energy transition in the Arab region. Regional cooperation can help achieve energy security, improve the efficiency of natural resource utilization, and utilize their financial returns in sustainable development processes.\n\nThe opportunities available for regional integration include issues of energy and water supply within the region. These areas will benefit from advanced dialogue, fundamental technical work, and the promise of achieving strong positive economic impacts in the very near future.\n\nCurrently, the development of the Arab electricity market is underway, aiming to increase cross-border electricity trade from the current 2% to 40% by 2035. This project will provide the region with one of the largest integrated and multi-country energy networks in the world.\n\nThe Arab region stands at a crossroads towards its energy transformation, with significant challenges and opportunities in the future. The abundant renewable energy resources in the region provide a pathway to a low-carbon and sustainable energy system, but harnessing these resources requires overcoming political, regulatory, financial, and technological challenges.\n\nSuccessful deployment of renewable energy in the region will require coordinated efforts by governments, companies, civil society, and donor entities to develop policies, financing mechanisms, and necessary technical capabilities. Policy solutions to address these challenges include supporting research and innovation, reforming the electricity sector, promoting public-private partnerships, increasing regional integration, and enhancing education and awareness.\n\nDespite the challenges, the benefits of a sustainable energy system, including environmental sustainability, energy security, and economic development, make the transition to renewable energy a vital priority for the Arab region.\n\n[3]\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0642\u0629

The North of England is stepping up to the plate and I have written a couple of articles recently on why the region is well placed to capitalise on the growth of the renewable energy sector. Known for its industrial heritage, the region is now leveraging its strengths to attract significant investment and spark some ground-breaking innovations in energy.\n\nIn the article below, I outline why the North East in particular is a region to watch and learn from, and why I expect to see a lot more M&A activity and Private Equity investment in the region's energy market in the next few years.\n\nThe bold innovations attracting attention\n\nOne of the things that makes the North East particularly interesting is the innovative nature of many of the businesses coming to the fore in the energy sector, providing potential solutions to the challenges that hinder the energy transition; whether it's a home energy management app from Swarm Energy, a new battery energy storage system from Connected Energy or some of the innovative technology recently supported by the Technology, Innovation and Green Growth for Offshore Renewables' (TIGGOR) programme.\n\nLarge international business are also striving to scale their operations and boost their technological capabilities, and one of the ways they are doing this is through investments into and acquisitions of technology focused energy businesses in the region.\n\nMany of our clients are at the forefront of this transformation. The firm has been advising key players such as Envision on its multi-million-pound car battery factory currently being built near the Nissan plant in Sunderland, and helping SeAH wind secure a deal to supply turbine foundations for the Hornsea 3 wind farm from their factory currently being built in Teesside.\n\nThe North East energy sector is seeing an unprecedented wave of both domestic and international investments in local energy businesses. Last year I worked on an exciting deal which saw the acquisition of Stockton-based energy data company EnAppSys by Norwegian headquartered Montel, backed by the Riverside Group (a global private equity investor). EnAppSys helps traders, energy analysts and other stakeholders to make the best strategic decisions based on data from 32 European countries and is another great example of a North East business delivering solutions in the energy sector to businesses across the globe.\n\nA pool of talent to tap into\n\nThanks to the North East's rich industrial legacy, the region is stacked with expertise directly relevant and applicable to the energy sector. A masterclass in \"transferable skills\" is already underway in the region, taking traditional manufacturing techniques and applying them to cutting-edge renewable energy technologies - what many are referring to as going from 'steam to green'.\n\nThis wealth of expertise has helped draw companies and investors to the region in search of skilled talent and out-of-the-box solutions. The availability of a highly skilled workforce, coupled with the region's commitment to education and training in energy-related disciplines, is opening up opportunities in the North East.\n\nThe universities of Teesside, Newcastle, Durham, Sunderland, and Northumbria are all within easy reach of each other, creating a collaborative powerhouse of educational institutions that add even more innovation to draw upon. For companies looking to expand their operations or enter new market segments - the North East has a lot to offer.\n\nSteering the conversation by speaking with one voice\n\nRecent years have seen the North East collaborate more across the region after the recognition that one strong voice can be more powerful than its individual parts. This pooling of resources across the region will be strengthened further when a mayor is chosen for the new North East Mayoral Combined Authority later this spring.\n\nThe appetite for collaboration between businesses and academic institutions creates fertile ground for innovation and growth. At Womble Bond Dickinson, our long history in the region, coupled with our specialist knowledge and extensive network of potential investors means we are well positioned to shepherd through some rewarding deals in the energy sector.\n\nWhat's more, we now have a framework in place which makes this 'sky's the limit' thinking possible, with the regulations brought about by the Energy Act 2023. This is a topic my colleague Eleni Diamantopoulou offers more insight into in her article Energy Act 2023: The countdown to net zero.\n\nI can definitely see more M&A and PE deals in the space in the near future, which will allow exciting energy start-ups to reach the next level, grow, and have an international impact.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"},

It transcends political divides, urging collective action toward a future where every individual can thrive in this world.\n\nAt the recent Energy and Environment Symposium in Garfield County, a statement from Liberty Energy's publication, \"Bettering Human Lives,\" resonated profoundly: \"Zero Energy Poverty by 2050 is a superior goal compared to Net Zero by 2050.\"\n\nThis declaration reframes the discourse, shifting from the divisive \"how\" to the unifying \"why.\" While debates often revolve around the mechanics of transitioning to renewable energy, they overlook who stands to benefit or suffer from these changes. The transition from coal in Colorado raises valid concerns about energy affordability, reliability and security, yet the plight of those vulnerable to energy poverty remains overlooked.\n\nIn Colorado's Western Slope counties, families grapple with rising inflation and energy costs, particularly in rural communities reliant on propane. Renters face barriers to adopting renewable energy technologies. As incentives dwindle and mandates expand, these families risk being left behind.\n\nThe global view is even more drastic. Worldwide, 2.3 billion people have no access to modern energy; therefore, burning wood, dung, grass, or charcoal to cook and heat every day. The fine particulate pollution emitted from these open (many times indoor) fires kills over 3 million people per year. Locally (in Colorado), approximately 84,000 households received over $135 million in federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds to help with utility bills in Fiscal Year 2022 (Oct. 1, 2022-Sept. 30, 2023). For reference, in FY2019, the total assistance to approximately 68,000 Colorado households was $54 million (this amount had been steady since FY2012). The energy poverty issue is only getting worse.\n\nEnergy poverty, defined as the inability to afford basic energy services for essential needs, disproportionately affects marginalized communities, exacerbating social inequalities and hindering economic progress. It is a silent crisis that undermines the foundation of societal well-being, perpetuating cycles of poverty and vulnerability.\n\nEradicating energy poverty becomes not just a moral imperative but a strategic necessity to achieve a carbon-neutral future. With Colorado's coal transition underway and living costs escalating, the risk of energy poverty looms larger. Shifting priorities and fostering inclusive discussions can prevent Coloradans from facing this fundamental deprivation.\n\nThe shift in priorities starts by recognizing that access to abundant, affordable and reliable energy is a fundamental human right. Zero Energy Poverty by 2050 offers a holistic framework that transcends partisan divides, focusing on tangible outcomes resonating across the political spectrum.\n\nAchieving Zero Energy Poverty requires a multifaceted approach, integrating policy interventions, community engagement and innovative financing mechanisms. By investing in energy efficiency, renewable energy deployment, and targeted assistance programs, we empower individuals and communities to break free from the cycle of energy poverty and move into a more resilient future.\n\nMoreover, the pursuit of Zero Energy Poverty is not just a moral imperative but a pragmatic strategy for advancing community interests. Ensuring universal energy access unleashes untapped potential, drives economic growth, enhances productivity and fosters unity. It is an investment in human capital, paving the way for a more prosperous and sustainable society.\n\nThe path toward Zero Energy Poverty by 2050 presents a challenge with the promise of substantial reward, offering a future where energy serves as a catalyst for unity and progress.\n\nZero Energy Poverty is the superior priority. Let's transcend partisan divides and embrace a shared vision of a more sustainable world. Together, we can forge a path toward a brighter future, ensuring access to affordable energy is a fundamental right for all Coloradans.", "source": {"uri": "steamboatpilot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "steamboatpilot.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-Income_Home_Energy_Assistance_Program", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vulnerability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mechanics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Western_Slope", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Western Slope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Collective action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Garfield County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Garfield County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcoal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charcoal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Particulates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_inequality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social inequality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propane", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Propane"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/8/2020/02/02022100/Opinion_logo-1024x604.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545731", "eventUri": "eng-9545731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

According to the United States Energy Information Administration, wave energy can supply up to 66% of all the United States energy needs. This is a game-changer! Eco Wave Power is leading this revolution with its grid-connected wave energy array in Israel, and its soon-to-be-operational wave energy project in the Port of Los Angeles -- a first of its kind in the United States.\"\n\n\"For operators to make confident and assured decisions during offshore activities, accurate and timely sea state data is key. In an environment that is constantly evolving, real-time insights can make all the difference, providing up-to-the-minute information to many different stakeholders, particularly vessel operators supporting the traditional energy and emerging renewables sectors. We're now looking toward the next step of data-driven decisions for the market with wave prediction systems, which remove uncertainty when working in challenging environments. Breakthrough technologies like these enable vessel operators to assess risks before they materialize, enabling wider efficiencies and improved safety across the industry.\"\n\n-- Marius Five Aarset, CEO, Miros (OTC attendee)\n\n\"Unsurprisingly, the energy transition is dominating conversation on the floor at OTC this year. Whether it's discussing the role hydrogen and carbon capture will play in moving away from fossil fuels, or a focus on compliance and increasing scrutiny on businesses to reduce fugitive emissions, there is a real buzz. These are themes that are rooted in the very fabric of our business, so it's incredibly positive to hear the sector taking the energy transition seriously. There is so much that can be learned from oil and gas heritage that will be vital to move us forward as an industry.\"\n\n\"With growing demands to meet energy needs globally, digitalization should not just be a trend -- it's a strategic imperative. Today, industry leaders are already harnessing the power of digital twins, AI and real-time data analytics to not only enhance asset management but also to revolutionize safety protocols and streamline maintenance operations. These technologies empower remote operations and reduce the need for physical inspections and in turn increase efficiencies by minimizing operational disruptions. As we move forward, integrating the very latest innovations will be key to optimized production and enhanced reliability, fostering a more robust and agile offshore energy sector for years to come.\"\n\n-- Mart\u00edn Luna Rivera, Americas Channel Partner Manager, James Fisher Asset Information Services (OTC attendee)\n\n\"The offshore industry today faces the critical imperative of balancing energy security with reliability and sustainability for the future. This creates an urgency for organizations to tackle challenges by leveraging a disruptive mindset, capable of solving problems that may not yet be fully defined. Success relies on the ability to merge conventional engineering with an innovative approach that meets market demands for energy transition and decarbonization. We are confident that the energy industry has trusted partners with the research and technology capabilities necessary to enhance performance -- while navigating a net-zero journey in oil and gas industry.\"\n\n-- Natalia Klafke, Global Head of Energy and Sustainability, Radix\n\n\"With the White House aiming for 80% clean energy generation by 2030, the growth of America's offshore renewable industry is more essential than ever. Having successfully completed the full-power testing of our work-class ROV, the Quantum EV, we look forward to supporting US wind farms' fast and efficient scale-up. Using less energy and reducing contamination risk, the Quantum EV will facilitate the growth of America's $45 billion renewable energy market.\"\n\n-- Mark Collins, Innovation Director, SMD (OTC attendee)\n\n\"Safety is paramount for the offshore industry. Constant exposure to seawater and corrosive chemical additives used in mixing drilling mud can take a toll on offshore platforms. Walkways, stairs and other high-traffic areas made of aluminum, steel and wood can't stand up to these corrosive elements, creating safety hazards. Fiberglass-reinforced polymer (FRP) structures are corrosion-resistant, and won't shrink, swell, dent or conduct electricity. Their limitless configurations of catwalks, stairs, railings and more paired with anti-slip surfaces make FRP the perfect fit for access and safety needs for offshore operations.\"\n\n-- Thomas Wright, Business Development Director, Bedford Reinforced Plastics\n\n\"With the robust burst of energy operations within the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago remains poised in a strategic position of geographic location and expertise to support our neighboring countries. At the Offshore Technology Conference this year, we are emphasizing our capability to enhance efficiency and safety in offshore operations. Our discussions at booth 4747 revolve around supporting deepwater exploration and optimizing supply chain logistics in challenging environments. These conversations reflect the resilience and adaptability of our sector, even as we confront the pressing challenges of energy transition and environmental sustainability.\"\n\n-- Dale Lutchman, Vice President of Customer Service, Ramps Logistics\n\n\"From the heart of the Caribbean's energy sector, I am proud to spotlight Trinidad and Tobago's dynamic capabilities at the Offshore Technology Conference. Our region offers a unique proposition: the globalization of a highly specialized workforce. Since 2023, EDO North America LLC has established a strong presence, securing a global contract with a leading oil and gas company to provide specialized and technical offshore labor in Alaska, Houston and Louisiana. Positioned strategically, we excel in filling critical offshore roles globally. At our booth, the focus is on overcoming challenges like talent mobility and optimizing logistical operations, while pioneering sustainable solutions that drive operational excellence in offshore projects.\"", "source": {"uri": "offshore-mag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Offshore"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ariana_hurtado@offshore-mag.com", "name": "Ariana Hurtado", "type": "author",

On one side, the relentless demand for accessible and affordable energy to power our homes, fuel our industries, and drive inclusive societal progress. On another, the ever-present anxiety that is energy security, which is sorely needed to safeguard against disruptions to daily life, and brings to mind the precariousness of the world's finite resources. There is also the third side, the urgent call for sustainability, as the specter of climate change haunts the very livability of the archipelagic Philippines in the future.\n\nNavigating this trilemma demands more than just technical expertise; it requires a delicate balance of innovation, policy reform, and societal engagement.\n\nAtty. Monalisa C. Dimalanta, chairperson and CEO of the Energy Regulatory Commission, said in her keynote address at a recently-concluded BusinessWorld Insights and Project KaLIKHAsan forum that the energy trilemma comprise the \"most urgent and critical issues of our time, right up there with food security and health.\"\n\nAtty. Dimalanta noted that such an encompassing issue demands attention from the entire country, not simply from the government.\n\n\"Some would say, in fact, that the regulator has no role or has very limited role in the discussion of the energy trilemma; and, perhaps in the context of other countries, that is correct. In the Philippine context, however, it is my view that we all have a role to play in charting our country's energy,\" she said.\n\nAtty. Dimalanta identified the various government programs that aim to address the different facets of the energy trilemma, such as the Green Energy Auction Program, the Net-Metering Program, and the revised Renewable Portfolio Standards.\n\n\"In all of these programs, the primary driver of course, is the desire to achieve an energy industry in the Philippines that is secure, despite our lack of fossil fuel resources; equitable, knowing that it is energy that is fueling our growing economy; and environmentally sustainable, because we are only stewards of these resources. We owe it to the next generation of Filipinos to leave them with a fighting chance for a better future.\"\n\nEnergy sustainability\n\nAgnes C. De Jesus, chief sustainability officer of First Philippine Holdings Corp. (FPH), discussed about energy sustainability, which she defined as striking the right balance between energy security and environmental protection towards uplifting present and future generations.\n\nShe noted that the transformation of the energy sector goes beyond changing power sources and thus lies within production, distribution, and consumption of power.\n\n\"Because transition is not just changing the type of power to renewable energy. By transformation (and energy sustainability), we mean changing the way we produce power, changing the way we distribute power, and use power,\" Ms. De Jesus said in her presentation.\n\nHer presentation added that with the rise of energy demand coinciding with the imperative to mitigate emissions, crucial steps have to be taken, among them developing low-carbon solutions are feasible and cost-effective.\n\nMs. De Jesus also commented during the forum's panel discussion that investments in sensors, thermal imagers, green transformers, and carbon-capturing technologies can aid in the Philippine's transition.\n\nShe further expressed that the country has to be practical in the transition to renewable energy (RE), citing studies from the University of Finland as well as climate analytics from November last year.\n\n\"While we want 100% [REs] and technically it's feasible, there are certain considerations that were also listed that the government has to pay attention to and systematically work on. For example, for us to be 100% RE, we need to surge our solar [capacities]. If we don't want gas to be our transition fuel, we need to drastically lower the costs of batteries that support solar,\" Ms. De Jesus explained.\n\nEnergy security\n\nPresenting about energy security, Felino M. Bernardo, head of energy transition projects of Aboitiz Power Corp. (AboitizPower), defined energy security as \"having dependable and affordable access for everyone.\"\n\n\"In this complex process we are undergoing, there is no cheap way to go through this and we have to be deliberate around the cost. But, how we select, how we decide on the cost is by making decisions today not only for us but for generations to come. It entails and ensures a stable energy supply that can meet the population and economy's needs while safeguarding against destruction and external shocks,\" Mr. Bernardo said in his presentation.\n\nMr. Bernardo added that several steps are being taken to ensure a secure and more sustainable energy landscape, such as diversifying energy mix; exploring cleaner and more abundant fuels; and investing in grid modernization, which is expected to incorporate a growing amount of RE and recover quickly from natural disasters.\n\nRegarding the potential of nuclear energy for the country, Mr. Bernardo said that results from other countries show that the resource can help deliver a more affordable and secure energy source, although the Philippines still has quite a long way to develop capabilities and regulations.\n\n\"It's going to be part of the solution, definitely. Eventually, it should be part of the energy mix. It's a good source of baseload energy, dispatchable, safe, and carbon-free,\" Mr. Bernardo shared during the panel discussion.\n\nMr. Bernardo also added that distributed power through energy packets and the transformation of retired power plants with innovations can also be a solution to the transmission problem.\n\n\"We have to look at what we have today and optimize that before we proceed with other technologies because we already have great [plants]. We should look at options of what should we do to optimize what we have, so it's using existing power plants and converting them to be cleaner, upgrading the current transmission system by using newer technology for it to be able to carry more power to the load centers,\" Mr. Bernardo said.\n\nA long-term effort\n\nDepartment of Energy Undersecretary Giovanni Bacordo also joined the forum with a closing address on the current landscape and long-term goals of the country's energy sector.\n\n\"My first takeaway when I first reported to the Department of Energy way back September of 2020 is that whatever we are doing at the department now, will be felt ten years from now. It's not like building a waiting shed or a small building, which can be finished within the year,\" Mr. Bacordo said.\n\nHe is confident that currently, as the government puts into motion its comprehensive energy program, the Philippines can look forward towards an energy system that is inclusive, secure, and sustainable.\n\n\"The realization of the energy plan, which embeds energy transition strategies, entails both a whole-of-government and a whole-of-nation approach. The path towards energy transition is a mutual effort and this resonates with the departments' continued engagement with government agencies, the regulators, energy stakeholders, development partners, and financing institutions,\" Mr. Bacordo noted.\n\n\"Again, let me reiterate what we are doing now will be felt ten years from now.

This is being applied to all business aspects, including supply chains. However, the same principles are drilling further down and into the fundamentals, namely power.\n\nAs the effects of climate change are being increasingly felt, and emission reduction deadlines approach, to a backdrop of outages and constrained power supply, power resilience and energy storage have been shown to be vital in ensuring that renewable energy sources (RES) can be integrated into national grids and made suitable to power the digital economy across the region.\n\nThe application of digital technologies to energy, in the form of Electricity 4.0, has the potential to support growth and sustainability, while ensuring resilience. In the same manner as Industry 4.0 is seeing the digitalization of industry, Electricity 4.0 is the similar digitalization of electricity generation and distribution.\n\nRenewable progress:\n\nThe adoption of RES has continued apace across the region. The non-profit group Global Energy Monitor reports specific states within the area have set targets for a fivefold increase in wind and solar by 2030. There are planned wind and solar projects by some of the major renewable investors in the region which outstrip plans for new gas-fired power plants four-fold. The plans will add 73.4GW to the 12GW of utility-scale solar and wind power currently in operation, with 60.9GW of the new capacity to come online before 2030.\n\nThe MENA Power Projects Forum last year reported that overall investment in the MENA power sector will exceed a total of $250 billion, making it the highest among all energy sectors. Of these, nearly $60 billion worth of power projects are being developed in Saudi Arabia. In a recent report, United Arab Emirates has announced plans to triple its RES and invest up to $54 billion over the next seven years to meet growing energy demands. Similarly, Egypt has $37 billion worth of power projects in progress.\n\nWhile this is welcome news for emission reduction and energy availability, it also brings with it major challenges. RES generation is characterized by variability due to the fluctuating intensity of the sun and wind, which impacts generative power.\n\nTo effectively address this and enable the integration of intermittent renewable energy, grid-scale energy storage is a critical component of the required infrastructure. By implementing grid-scale energy storage solutions, it becomes possible to support the development of resilient-grids capable of accommodating 70% or more RES, as demonstrated by MIT research.\n\nLong duration storage:\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) is a major technical challenge, where requirements could be for hours, days, weeks or even months. Pumped-storage hydroelectricity is the most widely used storage technology and holds considerable untapped potential in several regions. However, batteries remain the most scalable type of grid-scale storage due to their packaging, modular deployment, and easy availability, and the market has seen strong growth in recent years according to the IEA. Other storage technologies include compressed air and gravity storage, but they play a comparatively small role in current power systems.\n\nAdditionally, the emerging technology of hydrogen, according to the IEA holds promise for the seasonal storage of renewable energy.\n\nMicrogrid support:\n\nAlthough not providing LDES, microgrids offer short term storage capacity that can help in terms of smoothing peak grid usage, leveraging technologies such as intelligent UPS estates, as well as with the overall variability concerns. This is seen as a benefit where proximity to the RES generation may be an issue, and for more rural deployments. These combined capabilities also provide resilience for the energy supply, ensuring that even when entire generation sites are offline for any reason, whether due to atmospheric conditions or disruption, power can flow and meet immediate needs until other measures can be brought to bear.\n\nBroader facilities:\n\nAs many nations move towards implementing smart national grids to meet future needs, microgrids are seen as a significant factor. Through new management and orchestration systems, large energy users can be rewarded for their storage and resupply capabilities, as well as demand side management to support peak usage across the grid.\n\nThe ability to quickly implement such measures through economies of scale, reference designs and vendors' relentless pursuit of efficiency, combined with facilities such as product environmental profiles (PEP), mean that organizations can confidently build out capacity, while supporting wider efforts to decarbonize, and move the entire region closer to a net zero energy future.\n\nSchneider Electric offers a range of solutions in this area, including many variations on solar, to further provide options for many scenarios.\n\nDigital innovation in power:\n\nSchneider Electric is contributing to these efforts through the concept of Electricity 4.0. The digitalization of energy is a key factor ensuring the benefits of digital technologies can support smart grids, microgrid integration, RES adoption, and the path to net zero.\n\nDigital innovation brings greater visibility in energy generation and distribution, eliminating waste and driving efficiency. Digital technology such as metering and monitoring enables everyone to see how they are using our energy. In addition, smart devices, apps, analytics, and software go a step further and enable us to deploy smart energy more efficiently, meaning we can address a huge amount of untapped potential for energy savings. Providing businesses and service providers with the solutions and services to fully orchestrate digital energy management means that everyone can plug in and contribute to a more renewable-powered, sustainable energy future.\n\nPart of the solution:\n\nRenewable energy sources are likely to form a significant proportion of energy generation in the future, as part of a solution to achieve a decarbonized, net zero goal. Grid-scale energy storage and the resilience that it provides will be critical in facilitating those renewable energy sources in the digitalized smart grids of the future.\n\nLarge energy consumers, leveraging digitalized energy systems can be a part of that solution, supporting change, increasing transparency, and underpinning the development of digital economies that are sustainable and accessible to all.", "source": {"uri": "mid-east.info", "dataType": "news", "title": "mid-east.info"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rizza_pawaon@mid-east.info", "name": "Rizza Pawaon", "type": "author",

As a result, at the end of 2023, there were around 1,500 funds focusing on the climate, up from about 200 in 2018.\n\nYet, it isn't a straight line growth trajectory for renewable energy shares as numerous challenges persist. Industry watchers highlight that clean energy adoption faces short-term setbacks due to high costs and demand fluctuations. In fact, over the past year, the S&P Global Clean Energy Index fell 25%, underperforming the benchmark S&P 500 Index, which returned close to 25%. Nevertheless, many investors recognize the long-term promise of sustainable practices and technologies.\n\nTherefore, let's explore three top renewable energy stocks to buy amid the global green shift.\n\nAmong renewable energy stocks to buy, Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP) can be a compelling long-term investment option. BEP owns and operates a diversified portfolio of clean energy assets, including hydroelectric, wind, solar and battery storage facilities. This spread helps mitigate risk by not relying on a single technology. Also, it positions BEP on a strong foothold to capitalize on the overall growth across the renewable energy landscape.\n\nWhile the broader market for renewable energy stocks has experienced some turbulence especially in the past year, BEP has shown resilience as the recent first quarter results highlighted. Revenues came in at $1.49 billion compared to $1.33 billion for the year-ago quarter. Basic and diluted loss per unit was 23 cents. But, these results were below Wall Street's estimates.\n\nMeanwhile, in early May, Brookfield and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced their collaboration to deliver over 10.5 GW of new renewable power capacity globally. Wall Street noted the large size and global scope of this deal with approval.\n\nSince January, BEP stock is down almost 2%, while the dividend yield is a generous 5.5%. Wall Street remains bullish on BEP shares with a 12-month price forecast of $30.50, suggesting an upside potential of 18% from current levels.\n\nInvestors may also consider ReNew Energy Global (NASDAQ:RNW). With headquarters both in India and the U.K., RNW mainly provides utility-scale renewable energy solutions in India. With wind, solar and hydro energy projects across India, the company offers a slice of the rapidly growing renewable energy sector in a major developing economy.\n\nThe green energy group released the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 results in late February. Total revenue for the quarter was $232 million, compared with $193 million for the same period 12 months ago. Management increased the bottom line guidance for fiscal year 2024 by 2%.\n\nIn addition, management recently announced that RNW has completed constructing 1.94 GW of renewable energy assets. This takes the cumulative capacity set up by the company to over 10 GW. Currently, the company provides 10% of the total renewable energy capacity of India.\n\nDespite the growth story, the stock declined almost 17% year-to-date (YTD). Yet, the 12-month median price forecast is at $8.59 suggesting an upside potential of 35% based on current prices.\n\nWe conclude today's discussion with a renewable energy sector ETF, namely the Global Energy iShares ETF (NASDAQ:ICLN). Established in June 2008, the fund offers broad exposure with a basket of around 100 companies across the clean energy spectrum. Those include solar, wind and other renewable sources.\n\nGeographically, ICLN boasts a diversified allocation, with the U.S. leading at 35%, followed by Denmark (11%), China (9%), Brazil (8.5%) and Spain (7%). The fund's sectoral breakdown highlights its comprehensive approach, encompassing electric utilities (29%) and renewable electricity (23%). There are also stocks from ancillary industries supporting the clean energy transition such as heavy electrical equipment (10%), semiconductor equipment (10%) and semiconductors (10%).\n\nPotential investors should note that ICLN offers concentrated exposure, with the top 10 holdings comprising over 50% of the fund's net assets exceeding $2 billion. Among them are established players like First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) and Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH). Additionally, the ETF has utility giants like Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED), and international market leaders such as Spanish renewable energy leader Iberdrola (OTCMKTS:IBDRY) and Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas Wind Systems (OTCMKTS:VWSYF).\n\nSince January, ICLN has declined around 10%. Currently, it is changing hands at 14.5 times trailing earnings and 1.6 times book value. Finally, the dividend yield is 1.8% and expense ratio is 0.41%.", "source": {"uri": "investorplace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestorPlace"}, "authors": [{"uri":

As part of our journey in tackling the climate crisis Ireland signed up to the Paris Agreement in 2015 ]. The Paris Agreement includes commitments from developed and developing countries to reduce their emissions and work together to adapt to the impacts of climate change and calls on countries to commit to sustained climate mitigation measures. The Paris Agreement calls for emissions to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. To reach these targets all countries must develop and deliver a balanced pathway that takes all our energy needs, use and emissions into account. In an Irish context, the challenge is to knit energy and economic policy into a meaningful pathway - that is capable of delivery. Moreover, Ireland is rapidly reacting to REPowerEU [hyperlink] through the accelerated development of policies to develop and deliver on hydrogen, offshore wind and related industrialisation. The Paris Agreement also provides a pathway for developed nations to assist developing nations in their climate mitigation and adaptation efforts while creating a framework for the transparent monitoring and reporting of countries' climate goals. The Paris Agreement set out about getting countries to recognise the need to work on an integrated basis and commit to a global framework targeting measures to limit global warming to below 2\u00b0C. The Paris Agreement also aims to strengthen countries' ability to deal with the impacts of climate change and support them in their drive to reach these targets. \"Energy pathway\" is not a meaningless aspirational term - it is at the core of global and domestic climate change policy that reaches into all aspects of the global economy. The importance of that term is accelerating.\n\nThe past 18 months has demonstrated the manifest complexity and interdependence of food and energy production, global warming and impact of conflict (specifically, the Russian invasion of Ukraine). A new ambitious pathway is a critical necessity. Introducing a balanced energy pathway requires a coordinated and multi-faceted approach. It involves aligning policies, mobilizing investments, fostering innovation, and engaging all stakeholders to create a sustainable and resilient energy system for the future.\n\nWhere does hydrogen sit in a 'balanced pathway?\n\nA balanced pathway, in energy terms, refers to a sustainable energy system that tackles the energy trilemma of sustainability, security and affordability. This trilemma has, however, been further complicated by the need to deliver a just transition to net zero; there are knock on social and economic aspects of the pathway. These four aspects form the cardinal points on the compass as we create and navigate our way along the balanced pathway. With the global surge in new sources of power including solar and offshore wind and political steps in key countries (including the USA), the prospect of decarbonising large chunks of society and industry is a real prospect. The pathway will involve the use of a mix of energy sources, including renewable and non-renewable sources, in a way that minimizes negative environmental impacts while ensuring reliable and affordable energy supply.\n\nA balanced pathway is the transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, bio, hydropower, geothermal and more. This new green journey will have markers en route indicating the amount of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change with additional markers or information signposts indicating increasing energy security and resilience.\n\nImportantly, any balanced pathway will also recognise that some non-renewable energy sources, such as natural gas (low but not zero carbon energy source), will still be needed to manage and provide reliable energy supply during times when renewable energy sources are not available or during periods of high energy demand.\n\nWhat are the steps on a balanced pathway?\n\nThe steps on a balanced pathway towards a sustainable energy system comprise and require a series of hard political, economic, and commercial choices backed up by non-sequential actions focused on reducing fossil fuel use and decarbonisation. In recognition of the different mix between countries' industrial mix and energy use, energy pathways will differ between countries. Whilst there would be a typical number of high-level steps, each country would need to focus on key steps to accelerate their pathway whilst ensuring the direction of travel to net zero is maintained.\n\nA pathway includes the following 3 primary steps:\n\n1. Energy use and identifying areas for improvement:\n\na. Energy:\n\nConsumption: analysing fuel use, energy consumption patterns, identifying areas where energy efficiency improvements can be made, and setting energy use reduction targets. Identifying decarbonised replacement fuels, e.g., replacing natural gas with green hydrogen, etc.\n\nb. Conservation: especially at peak times: This involves promoting behavioural changes to reduce energy use, such as turning off lights and appliances when not in use (especially at peak times such as 5pm-7pm).\n\nc. Efficiency: improving energy efficiency reduces the amount of energy required to achieve the same level of output or service, thereby reducing overall energy consumption.\n\n2. Develop the mix of energy use and storage sources/solutions:\n\na. A balanced pathway involves transiting the mix of energy sources currently consumed from non-renewable to renewable sources, in a way that minimizes negative environmental impacts while ensuring reliable and affordable energy supply. Replacing the role which fossil fuels play today with renewable energy and hydrogen will be key to this pathway.\n\nb. Promoting renewable energy: this involves increasing the use and investment in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower, and increasingly reducing the reliance on non-renewable sources such as fossil fuels in the hard to abate sectors through hydrogen.\n\nc. Implementing energy storage solutions: energy storage technologies such as batteries, pumped hydro and hydrogen to ensure reliable energy supply even when renewable energy sources are not available. Energy storage is poorly understood in many areas; it is a core lever for decarbonisation of all economies by addressing intermittency, security of supply and demand management. In each instance, storage mitigates the necessity to rely on short term fossil fuel support; the storage of renewable molecule at TWh scale is needed to secure the energy transition.\n\n3. Enacting policies and regulations:\n\na. Governments can play a key role in promoting a balanced pathway by implementing policies and regulations that encourage and incentivise energy efficiency, renewable energy, hydrogen, and sustainable energy use.\n\nb. Investing in research and development: Ongoing research and development can help to identify new energy sources and technologies, improve energy efficiency, and reduce the cost of renewable energy.\n\nOverall, a balanced pathway involves a coordinated and multifaceted approach that considers the economic, environmental, and social aspects of energy production and consumption.\n\nClean energy solutions, renewable energy opportunities and carbon reduction technologies/applications differ from country to country depending on renewable opportunities. It is this geographical energy opportunity that must be addressed regionally by national governments and organisations and develop a bespoke national balanced pathway to net zero.\n\nGreen Hydrogen - Ireland's bespoke clean energy carrier\n\nWith the publication of the National Hydrogen Strategy https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/624ab-national-hydrogen-strategy/ on 12th July 2023, Ireland now has the vision and tools to promote the comprehensive diversification of energy sources by transitioning away from fossil fuels and increasing the share of renewable energy in the nation's energy mix. This strategy broadens our energy reach and will increase investments in 'Hydrogenewables' - hydrogen from renewable energy sources including solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass.\n\nGreen hydrogen is a promising transformative energy carrier that has the potential to play a crucial role in achieving net-zero emissions. Hydrogen can be produced from various sources such as water, natural gas, biomass, or even waste, and when burned or reacted with oxygen, it produces only water and heat, making it a zero-emission fuel. However green hydrogen produced from renewables is the cleanest form of hydrogen and has zero CO2 emissions.\n\nOne of the key benefits of green hydrogen is its versatility. It can be used in a range of sectors such as transport, industry, power generation and buildings. For instance, in the transport sector, hydrogen can be used to power fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) for trucks, HGVs, coaches, etc, while in industry, it can replace fossil fuels in high-temperature processes. It can be stored and transported easily, allowing it to balance the intermittency of wind and making it a viable option for areas where renewable energy sources are not readily available.\n\nHydrogen also has an essential in producing dispatchable , zero carbon electricity to back up wind and solar. There is no alternative to green H2 that aligns with Ireland's natural resources and reduces our exposure to volatile fossil fuel markets.\n\nOne of the key challenges in transforming our energy system from fossil fuels to renewable energy is storage. Green hydrogen offers a solution to enable renewable energy produced today to be stored to produce energy when required in subsequent days, weeks, or months.\n\nGreen hydrogen as advocated by Hydrogen Ireland can be catalyst to accelerates Irelands journey to a balanced pathway towards net-zero emissions.\n\nMoreover, it is also important to ensure that the transportation and distribution of hydrogen are done safely and efficiently. This includes developing or, where possible, re-purposing appropriate infrastructure such as pipelines and storage facilities.\n\nGreen hydrogen is a promising pathway advocated by Hydrogen Ireland and has the potential to accelerate Ireland's journey to net-zero emissions. It is produced through the process of electrolysis using renewable energy sources such as solar or wind power and does not emit any carbon dioxide or other harmful pollutants during production, making it a clean and sustainable alternative to grey hydrogen, which is produced through the process of natural gas reforming and emits carbon dioxide.\n\nHowever, the widespread adoption of green hydrogen faces several challenges, including the high cost of production and the current lack of infrastructure to support its use. To overcome these challenges, there is a need for continued innovation and investment in the technology and infrastructure necessary for the production, storage, and distribution and use of green hydrogen. which will require significant investment in research, development, and infrastructure to maximise its potential benefits.\n\nConclusion\n\nDelivering a balanced energy pathway requires a comprehensive approach across environmental, economic, and social initiatives - inertia is not an option.\n\nThe Department for the Economy in Northern Ireland has launched an ambitious new energy strategy that includes plans to place hydrogen as a key energy source for the future. The Irish National Hydrogen Strategy includes a development roadmap of how the hydrogen economy could develop and scale up over the coming decades. The 21 actions identified will be implemented through the ongoing review of the Climate Action Plan and target the key building blocks for the balanced pathway.\n\nPM 27.7.2023\n\nThis will require long-term commitment, collaboration, and a shared vision to ensure the pathway is sustainable and continues to meet our goals for clean energy and a secure and prosperous future.\n\nAchieving success on a balanced energy pathway requires a comprehensive approach that involves and balances several key strategies and actions across environmental, economic, and social initiatives - it is about creating a balance between these that then allows Ireland to construct a pathway to achieve the climate goals of 2030 and 2050. A pathway that is open to and encompasses all.\n\nBy following these steps detailed above and adopting a holistic approach, Ireland can through the cohesion of government, businesses, and individuals, work together to achieve success on constructing a sustainable balanced energy pathway. With the publication of the National Hydrogen Strategy, the ongoing review of the Climate Action Plan and other strategies Ireland has the plans and building blocks for the pathway, but it also requires long-term commitment, collaboration, and a shared vision to ensure the pathway is sustainable and continues to meet our goals for a clean energy future.\n\nIreland's challenge is creating and successfully transitioning to a balanced energy pathway that will deliver positive outcomes contributing to sustainability, environmental protection, economic benefits, and social equity. It is also important to ensure that, unlike our railway system, our balanced pathway, whilst bespoke is also a fit with other global pathways. We must ensure the Irish Energy Camino is of the same energy gauge as all other countries, that it enables international cohesion and is part of a global climate challenge success.", "source": {"uri": "energycentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Energy Central"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Green hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Effects of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-renewable_resource", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Non-renewable resource"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hydrogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient_energy_use", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Efficient energy use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_storage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Energy storage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_wind_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Offshore wind power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Just transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politics of climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_issues", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmental issues"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pumped-storage hydroelectricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Northern Ireland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://energycentral.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_meta/public/ece/node_main/2024/5/real20map20of20ireland_400dpi_dec201920web203.jpg?itok=_h2M9zEh", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545731", "eventUri": "eng-9545731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

This is being applied to all business aspects, including supply chains.\n\nHowever, the same principles are drilling further down and into the fundamentals, namely power.\n\nAs the effects of climate change are being increasingly felt, and emission reduction deadlines approach amid a backdrop of outages and constrained power supply, power resilience and energy storage have been shown to be vital in ensuring that renewable energy sources (RES) can be integrated into national grids and made suitable to power the digital economy across the region.\n\nThe application of digital technologies to energy, in the form of Electricity 4.0, has the potential to support growth and sustainability, while ensuring resilience. In the same manner as Industry 4.0 is seeing the digitalisation of industry, Electricity 4.0 is the similar digitalisation of electricity generation and distribution.\n\nRenewable progress\n\nThe adoption of RES has continued apace across the region. The non-profit group Global Energy Monitor reports specific states within the area have set targets for a fivefold increase in wind and solar by 2030.\n\nThere are planned wind and solar projects by some of the major renewable investors in the region which outstrip plans for new gas-fired power plants four-fold. The plans will add 73.4 gigawatts to the 12GW of utility-scale solar and wind power currently in operation, with 60.9GW of the new capacity to come online before 2030.\n\nThe MENA Power Projects Forum last year reported that overall investment in the MENA power sector will exceed a total of $250 billion, making it the highest among all energy sectors. Of these, nearly $60 billion worth of power projects are being developed in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIn a recent report, United Arab Emirates has announced plans to triple its RES and invest up to $54 billion over the next seven years to meet growing energy demands.\n\nSimilarly, Egypt has $37 billion worth of power projects in progress.\n\nWhile this is welcome news for emission reduction and energy availability, it also brings with it major challenges. RES generation is characterised by variability due to the fluctuating intensity of the sun and wind, which impacts generative power.\n\nTo effectively address this and enable the integration of intermittent renewable energy, grid-scale energy storage is a critical component of the required infrastructure.\n\nBy implementing grid-scale energy storage solutions, it becomes possible to support the development of resilient-grids capable of accommodating 70% or more RES, as demonstrated by MIT research.\n\nLong duration storage\n\nLong-duration energy storage (LDES) is a major technical challenge, where requirements could be for hours, days, weeks, or even months.\n\nPumped-storage hydroelectricity is the most widely used storage technology and holds considerable untapped potential in several regions.\n\nHowever, batteries remain the most scalable type of grid-scale storage due to their packaging, modular deployment, and easy availability, and the market has seen strong growth in recent years according to the IEA.\n\nOther storage technologies include compressed air and gravity storage, but they play a comparatively small role in current power systems.\n\nAdditionally, the emerging technology of hydrogen, according to the IEA holds promise for the seasonal storage of renewable energy.\n\nMicrogrid support\n\nAlthough not providing LDES, microgrids offer short term storage capacity that can help in terms of smoothing peak grid usage, leveraging technologies such as intelligent UPS estates, as well as with the overall variability concerns.\n\nThis is seen as a benefit where proximity to the RES generation may be an issue, and for more rural deployments.\n\nThese combined capabilities also provide resilience for the energy supply, ensuring that even when entire generation sites are offline for any reason, whether due to atmospheric conditions or disruption, power can flow and meet immediate needs until other measures can be brought to bear.\n\nBroader facilities\n\nAs many nations move towards implementing smart national grids to meet future needs, microgrids are seen as a significant factor. Through new management and orchestration systems, large energy users can be rewarded for their storage and resupply capabilities, as well as demand side management to support peak usage across the grid.\n\nThe ability to quickly implement such measures through economies of scale, reference designs and vendors' relentless pursuit of efficiency, combined with facilities such as product environmental profiles (PEP), mean that organisations can confidently build out capacity, while supporting wider efforts to decarbonise, and move the entire region closer to a net zero energy future.\n\nSchneider Electric offers a range of solutions in this area, including many variations on solar, to further provide options for many scenarios.\n\nDigital innovation in power\n\nSchneider Electric is contributing to these efforts through the concept of Electricity 4.0. The digitalisation of energy is a key factor ensuring the benefits of digital technologies can support smart grids, microgrid integration, RES adoption, and the path to net zero.\n\nDigital innovation brings greater visibility in energy generation and distribution, eliminating waste and driving efficiency. Digital technology such as metering and monitoring enables everyone to see how they are using our energy.\n\nIn addition, smart devices, apps, analytics, and software go a step further and enable us to deploy smart energy more efficiently, meaning we can address a huge amount of untapped potential for energy savings.\n\nProviding businesses and service providers with the solutions and services to fully orchestrate digital energy management means that everyone can plug in and contribute to a more renewable-powered, sustainable energy future.\n\nPart of the solution\n\nRenewable energy sources are likely to form a significant proportion of energy generation in the future, as part of a solution to achieve a decarbonised, net zero goal.\n\nGrid-scale energy storage and the resilience that it provides will be critical in facilitating those renewable energy sources in the digitalised smart grids of the future.\n\nLarge energy consumers leveraging digitalised energy systems can be a part of that solution, supporting change, increasing transparency, and underpinning the development of digital economies that are sustainable and accessible to all.", "source": {"uri":

See our commentary guidelines for more information.\n\nElectrification and energy efficiency improvements promise comfortable lives with lower energy footprints. But U.S. energy consumption has not declined for the last 25 years, despite massive rollouts of energy efficiency standards, electrification laws, and hybrid and electric vehicle purchases.\n\nThe potential benefits of these technologies drove me to become an engineer and enter the solar manufacturing industry. While inside the industry, I repeatedly saw homeowners, lawmakers, and innovators treat the availability of cheap solar as an excuse to use more energy, not less. Since leaving the industry and researching sustainability, I've learned that this phenomenon is neither new nor specific to the solar industry: it's called the Jevons Paradox.\n\nIn 1865, William Stanley Jevons noted that increasingly efficient steam engine designs were leading to increases in overall coal consumption, instead of decreases. Researchers have since found that the same effect applies to gasoline, electricity, computer processors, doctors, and any other factor of production. As production becomes more efficient, the number of things that are profitable to produce increases. This leads the economy to use more of a given resource as technology to process it becomes more efficient, unless there are external limits.\n\nWith the right policies, however, this overall increase can be prevented. California, for instance, has held its per-capita electricity use almost entirely steady from 1980 to 2020, despite major electrification. This was the result of careful policy measures that incentivized utilities to increase efficiency instead of increasing production. These incentives overcame the typical motivation to use more electricity as machines and appliances became more efficient. As families and businesses switch to energy-saving electric appliances, vehicles, and renewable energy, deliberate policy is necessary to ensure that the end result is an overall decrease in energy use.\n\nStates should enact caps on total per-capita energy use to lock in the benefits of efficiency gains over the coming decades. There is a clear precedent for doing so. After 25 years of unmet pollution reduction promises, the EPA enacted similar caps on daily pollution for states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, called Total Maximum Daily Loads. These limits forced states to act decisively and make progress that -- given prior failures -- likely would not have been made otherwise. Given the 25 years of energy use stagnation in the U.S., similar caps could enable the U.S. to begin actually reducing its energy footprint.\n\nThe exact structure of these caps is important to avoid reductions in individuals' quality of life or perverse incentives. The limits should decrease over time to match improvements in energy efficiency, and allow renewables to actually replace fossil fuels instead of becoming yet another power source. Energy allowances could be distributed equally to every resident of a state each year, and energy producers would then have to pay for the right to sell energy to consumers or businesses (in the form of electricity, gasoline, natural gas, or even propane). Similar markets already exist quite successfully for renewable energy certificates, or RECs.\n\nThis creates a strong incentive for companies and government organizations to lower their energy footprint, while also providing a consistent source of income for all state residents. The funds could be used by residents to help cover utility costs or even allow for otherwise rare solar projects in low-income communities.\n\nRight now, non-fossil fuel energy production does not displace fossil fuel energy production.

Photo for The Washington Post by Tristan Spinski\n\nHeat pump installation, benefiting from government subsidies, is fueling clean energy job growth in Maine, according to a state report released Wednesday.\n\nThe study commissioned by the Governor's Energy Office shows that Maine's \"clean energy economy\" reached 15,000 jobs at the end of 2022, or about 2.3% of the state's workforce of 656,400. Its increase was greater than the economy generally: Since 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic, employment in Maine rose 1%, while clean energy employment increased by nearly 3%.\n\nThe energy efficiency sector is the largest among five categories, accounting for more than 8,600 jobs in 2022, or 58% of the state's clean energy workforce.\n\nThe sector includes workers who are involved in the research, manufacture, sales, installation, repair and professional service support of technologies and services intended to improve the efficiency of commercial, residential and industrial buildings. That includes high efficiency heating, ventilation and air conditioning and renewable heating and cooling. It accounted for more than 3,700 workers, or 43% of Maine's energy efficiency workers in 2022, according to the report.\n\nThe other sectors of the clean energy economy are clean energy power generation, alternative transportation, clean grid and storage and clean fuels.\n\nSubsidies of up to $10,600 for heat pump installation include rebates of as much as $8,000 by Efficiency Maine Trust, a quasi-state agency that promotes energy efficiency, and federal tax credits of up to $2,600. In addition to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, the public money is helping to drive job growth to install, repair and service electric heat pumps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther jobs on the rise in the energy efficiency sector are in energy efficient software, energy auditing and other areas.\n\nView this document on Scribd\n\nThe administration of Gov. Janet Mills had set a goal of installing 100,000 heat pumps in Maine homes by 2025, which has been surpassed. Last summer, the governor updated her goal to include an additional 175,000 heat pump installations by 2027.\n\nIn addition to boosting employment, the push for clean energy is prodding workers to spend more time on clean energy-related jobs, according to the report. So-called \"intensity-adjusted clean energy employment\" increased by 11% between 2018 and 2022 as clean energy employment expanded by nearly 6%. The report cites an HVAC firm in 2018 with six installers who only occasionally installed heat pumps and now employs six installers who exclusively do so.\n\nAs a result, the number of clean energy workers would not change, but the number of labor hours working with heat pumps increased and \"intensity-adjusted jobs\" would show a corresponding increase, the report said.\n\nThe report by BW Research Partnership uses data based on the annual United States Energy and Employment Report in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nAfter energy efficiency, the next largest clean energy segment was renewable electric power generation, which employs about one-fifth of the state's clean energy workers.\n\nAll clean energy technology segments grew since 2018. Jobs in alternative transportation increased at the greatest rate, 28%, adding nearly 200 jobs. The renewable electric power generation segment -- wind, geothermal, bioenergy, and hydropower -- added the greatest number, 300, between 2018 and 2022.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

This provides an ideal path for investors who are seeking the best clean energy stocks to buy.\n\nInvestors are seeking opportunities that not only align with their ethical values, but also promise substantial returns on investment. The growth of the solar, wind, hydrogen, hydroelectric and energy storage market will provide ample opportunity to capitalize on the energy transition. While the overall clean energy sector is packed with promise, some individual stocks could offer a remarkable chance for 300% gains or more by 2028.\n\nNow, let's discover the top clean energy stocks to buy with 300% upside or more by 2028!\n\nLinde (NASDAQ:LIN) might seem like an odd choice for a clean energy portfolio. However, this industrial gas giant plays a pivotal role in the advancement of the hydrogen economy.\n\nLinde is a powerhouse in the industrial gas market. They're the world's largest industrial gas company by market share and revenue. What makes their business extremely appealing is that they cover the full spectrum from manufacturing to distribution with more than 100 gases and mixed gases in their portfolio. However, their growing long term growth prospects in the hydrogen market have investors excited. The company has committed $1.8 billion to new hydrogen projects to new and existing customers in the Gulf Coast. Additionally, management plans to invest between $7-$9 billion into clean energy infrastructure by 2026. As the global demand for hydrogen soars, Linde is positioned to reap tremendous benefits. This makes Linde one of the top clean energy stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) semiconductors are integral to the clean energy revolution, enabling the development of power-efficient technologies. The company primarily focuses on power and sensing solutions, which are key elements in electric vehicles (EVs), solar power grids, and energy storage systems.\n\nON Semiconductor's valuation becomes more appealing by the day, even despite the recent headwinds to the business. Inflation and higher interest rates has had an extremely negative impact on the EV and clean energy markets. Over the last 12-18 months, there has been a broad slowdown in buying and construction activity. This has been a crutch to their business, which saw its revenue flat in the 2023 fiscal year. However, even despite these challenges the business has remained resilient. In Q1 FY24, revenue fell 5% YOY with EPS up a modest 1%. But things won't look so meek towards the end of the year. If you're bullish on a rebound in the EV, clean energy and energy storage markets, ON Semi is certainly one of the best clean energy stocks to buy now.\n\nFerrari NV (NYSE:RACE), the iconic luxury sports car manufacturer might seem like an unconventional inclusion in the clean energy sector. However, their steadfast commitment to sustainability makes them a candidate to keep on your radar.\n\nFerrari stock has been on a tear over the last several years. The company has been reinvigorated as revenue, profits and FCF accelerate to record highs. This can be largely attributed to management's strong execution, as well as operational and brand expertise in the luxury car market. Ferrari is slowly turning into a clean energy titan, with the company vowing that 60% of its models will be fully electric or hybrid by 2026. The ball is moving forward fast, and the company plans to release the first ever fully electric Ferrari GT with up to 1000 horsepower.

Let us dig in!\n\nQ: Should We Be Pessimistic Or Optimistic About The Energy Transition? A: Yes!\n\nWe'll start, as we so often do, with energy reporter David Roberts, whose Volts podcast on climate 'n' energy helps us avoid climate despair. On a recent episode, Roberts interviewed clean energy analyst Michael Liebreich about a pair of blog posts Liebreich wrote about \"the five horsemen\" and \"five superheroes\" of the transition to clean energy, forces (not individual people) that will make the transition to net zero much harder than you might think, but also much easier than you might worry.\n\nThe podcast is full of nerdy information, and while I won't summarize the whole thing, I'll say it left me with a better understanding of what we're up against, like the huge cost of getting the last 30 percent or so of the transition finished once we deploy solar, wind, and batteries widely. Those challenges are especially tough in the developing world. And then there's the politics of it all: not just getting people to engage with the issue, but also fighting off the powerful greedheads who can slow things down to protect profits.\n\nBut oh, the superheroes are impressive, and that was the part of the podcast where I kept saying \"wow\" at stuff I'd never given thought to before, like the fact that as renewable energy starts taking over, metric shit-tons of greenhouse emissions will fade away as the world stops devoting so much energy to sustaining the fossil fuel economy.\n\nF'rinstance, 40 percent of ocean shipping today involves moving coal, oil, and fossil gas from one place to another, mostly on ships burning \"bunker fuel,\" itself among crude oil's most polluting and carbon-intensive derivatives. Rebuild some of the ships to run on clean fuels, but scrap most for the steel -- recycled using carbon-free processes. Ports then need fewer tugboats -- which burn diesel or bunker oil -- and other carbon-emitting infrastructure. And so on.\n\nAnother brain-exploder: Fossil fuels are so inefficient, wasting about two-thirds of their energy as heat, that we'll actually need less renewable energy to replace it, at least in terms of \"Primary Energy Demand,\" the metric used to calculate the world's total energy needs. Thing is, that metric includes all that wasted combustion that doesn't make the car go or warm the house, so in terms of useful clean energy to replace it, you don't need a one-to-one match, especially as the clean energy powers cleaner stuff like EVs and heat pumps and even little ol' things like lightbulbs.\n\nAs Liebreich explains, if you replace a 75-watt incandescent bulb, lit by power from a (35 percent efficient) coal-burning power plant, with a 10-watt LED bulb powered by renewables, you'd reduce total energy \"demand\" by 95%, and with zero CO2 emissions -- all while producing the same amount of light. Electric vehicles charged by solar? Zero emissions and 75 percent less Primary Energy Demand, but just as much travel. On the podcast, he notes that by one measure, the percentage of clean energy needed to replace all current fossil fuels is a reassuring 42, for all you Douglas Adams fans waving towels around.\n\nThis New York Times story (gift link) about how grid-scale batteries are changing California's energy landscape will gladden your heart and give you a better idea of what energy will look like as the transition moves forward.\n\nAs the story notes, one complication of getting more energy from the sun than any other state is that while solar powerful is plentiful during the day, peak energy use hits in the early evening. To meet that demand, California utilities had to turn on more fossil gas plants and import energy from other states.\n\nBut just as the cost of solar dropped sharply in recent years, giant batteries are becoming cheaper and being deployed more widely, and they're beginning to replace some of the fossil fuel use in those evening hours. As the Times explains,\n\nbetween 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. on April 30, for example, batteries supplied more than one-fifth of California's electricity and, for a few minutes, pumped out 7,046 megawatts of electricity, akin to the output from seven large nuclear reactors.\n\nHere's the exciting thing: This is just the start. In just the last three years, US grid battery storage capacity\n\nhas grown tenfold, to 16,000 megawatts. This year, it is expected to nearly double again, with the biggest growth in Texas, California and Arizona.\n\nAs we like to say, terrific article, go read the whole thing!\n\nAnd if you really want to dig into how clean energy will keep the power on even when the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing, here's another Volts podcast for you, looking at the solutions that are already in use and those that are in development.\n\nHere's a neat little story about a plucky startup, Voltpost, that thinks it has a solution to the problem of charging electric vehicles in urban areas where people can't just plug the car in overnight in the garage, because no garage: Just find a streetlight, step out of the shade, and say \"You and me, babe, how about it?\" The company's modular design for level-2 EV chargers takes advantage of the fact that streetlights are already connected to the grid, so there's your power, with no need to dig up the streets and sidewalks to connect to power.\n\nIt's also designed to survive on America's mean streets, where clumsy drivers and malicious jerks can quickly take streetside EV chargers out of action.\n\nNeat story, go read it, and enjoy the above photo from a US government report on curbside and other charging solutions, showing the work of an enterprising electricity pirate who dragged a washing machine onto a sidewalk and powered it from a light post. Don't try that at home, please. [Canary Media]\n\nLive In Colorado? Buying An E-Bike? There's A Tax Credit For That!\n\nIn April, Colorado rolled out a $450 point-of-purchase tax credit on the purchase of qualifying electric bikes (that's most of 'em) from participating retailers (not all of 'em). You don't even need to have a tax liability to take advantage of the deal. Any Colorado resident -- including students going to school there! -- qualifies to buy one e-bike a year.\n\nFull details, participating dealers, bike guidelines, and necessary documents (to prove you live in Colorado and aren't sneaking in from Kansas for e-bike bennies) at the Colorado Energy Office.\n\nMinnesota Replaces Coal Plant With Solar, You Bet!\n\nWe usually think solar energy is for places like California or Texas or Arizona, but one of the biggest solar projects in the USA is just about to go into service in Minnesota, where it's being built \"on former potato farms near the site of a retiring coal plant.\"\n\nDon't worry, solar energy will not cause a potato shortage.\n\nSome deets from Canary Media:\n\nThe Sherco solar and energy-storage facility will be the largest solar project in the Upper Midwest, and the fifth-largest in the U.S. by the time it's fully completed in 2026. The first phase of the project should begin sending emissions-free electricity to the grid this fall, heralding the start of a new era in a state whose largest solar project until now has been just 100 megawatts. This new project will have a capacity of 710 megawatts.\n\nNot only will it replace part of the 2,200-megawatt output of the retiring coal plant, it'll also have a unionized workforce, with jobs and tax revenue for the community of Becker. Xcel Energy, the owner of both the coal plant and the new solar installation, plans to manage the transition without any layoffs, shifting some workers to the solar plant and others to its other facilities around Minnesota.\n\nThe solar plant will use the coal plant's existing grid connection, avoiding the challenge of new transmission lines and navigating the \"interconnection queue\" -- the long wait list for new grid connections. Best of all: The coal plant it'll help replace is Minnesota's single biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAlso extremely cool: It'll be one of the nation's first big energy facilities to use long duration iron-air batteries, which don't need no stinkin' lithium. These suckers will be\n\ncapable of storing 10 megawatts of power for up to 100 hours. That's enough backup for the grid to ride out a plant shutdown from a weather event such as a polar vortex, and far more than the 4-hour duration of the lithium-ion batteries that now predominate grid storage.\n\nYr Wonkette is funded entirely by reader donations.

However, this may pose some challenges for economies, for example, how to minimise the impact on vulnerable groups and subjects, especially the impact of electricity price increases on poor households, and remarkable structural changes in industries related to fossil energy,\" she added.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, in a net-zero scenario, behavioural changes would reduce emissions and reduce energy demand for buildings, road transport, and aviation. The total amount of CO2 emissions in the period 2021-2050 is estimated to decrease by about 4 per cent if there are more effective energy-saving behaviours by authorities, organisations, businesses, and individuals.\n\nIn the 2023-2025 period, the annual growth rate of electricity demand in Vietnam is increasing by about 8.5 per cent, higher than the economic growth rate. So understanding various aspects of energy and behavioural change is important, Thuy added.\n\nRealising the importance of the movement, numerous businesses have prepared specific strategies and plans to convert and adapt to the energy transition trend.\n\nPetroVietnam Exploration Production Corporation (PVEP) in January updated its action programme to adapt to the energy transition. Dinh The Hung, head of Technology and Environmental Safety at PVEP, said that the newly updated action programme has set out specific goals and solutions to implement and adapt to the energy transition trend.\n\n\"They include applying new environmentally friendly technologies, shifting product structure towards increasing the proportion of gas compared to oil, and implementing carbon collection and storage projects, among other areas. These solutions will help PVEP gradually adapt to the current trend and contribute to the energy transition of the country,\" Hung said.\n\nThe corporation is focused on groups of solutions like managing the implementation of energy transition, energy management, net emission reduction, and recycled energy. These include nine tasks and over 80 specific actions for each department to follow.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment has compiled lists of priority projects to implement the Just Energy Transition Partnership starting in 2024, including Pha Lai Thermal Power Corporation (PPC). Pha Lai 1 coal thermal power plant will use 100 per cent suitable fuel, without carbon emissions for four units. If possible, the Pha Lai 2 coal thermal power plant will switch to using 100 per cent suitable fuel without carbon emissions by gradually switching from co-firing to absorption.\n\nPPC chairman Mai Quoc Long said, \"We aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, hit net-zero emissions by 2050, and contribute positively to the international community in protecting the earth's climate, shifting the growth model to improve the economy's resilience and competitiveness.\"\n\nHowever, the transition from using fossil fuels to using clean fuels struggles with big issues, Long warned. \"Therefore, we need the support of relevant ministries and agencies to provide policies, quickly approve procedures, and create stronger conditions for investments and technical assistance,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "vir.com.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vietnam Investment Review - VIR"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_job", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green job"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmentally_friendly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Environmentally friendly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pollution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hanoi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Vietnam"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_supply_and_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World energy supply and consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socioeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socioeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aviation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thermal power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Consulting", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Associations", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Environment", "label": "news/Environment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://vir.com.vn/stores/news_dataimages/2024/052024/09/10/in_social/wide-participation-can-boost-nations-energy-transition-20240509104935.jpg?randTime=1715227362", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545731", "eventUri": "eng-9545731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

Currently, 75 percent of buildings in Europe are inefficient, leading to higher energy consumption and increased CO2 emissions. The project renovates buildings through 25 case studies to demonstrate real results and provide energy-efficient solutions.\n\nThe Local Energy Action Award recognizes sustainable initiatives led by groups of citizens or consumers (associated with local authorities or other stakeholders) in the field of energy, contributing to the clean energy transition at the community or local level. This year, the finalists are De Energiecentrale project, the Centrales Villageoises initiative, and AUSL Romagna.\n\nDe Energiecentrale aims to simplify and make energy renovation more accessible to households in Ghent, Belgium. Due to technical, financial, and administrative challenges, homeowners often give up on energy renovation of their households. De Energiecentrale provides free guidance and assistance to citizens in undertaking energy renovations.\n\nResidents of Ghent can receive support throughout the process, from visits by experts who assess the needed renovations to finding contractors, comparing offers, and applying for grants and loans.\n\nThe second finalist in the Local Energy Action category is French initiative Centrales Villageoises. Citizens that are involved in it unite through local cooperative enterprises for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects at the community level. The initiative has facilitated the installation of over 500 solar rooftop installations.\n\nAUSL Romagna, a regional healthcare agency in Italy, has developed a comprehensive approach to energy efficiency across dozens of hospitals and buildings. Its approach integrates energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable mobility. The agency utilizes all available funding sources as well as awareness-raising initiatives among its 15,000 employees and over one million citizens.\n\nThe Woman in Energy Award highlights the activities of women that, if replicated elsewhere, contribute to accelerating the transition to clean energy in Europe. Special attention is given to efforts to advance the gender mainstreaming agenda and support equality and equal opportunities in the energy sector.\n\nThis year's finalists are Fran\u00e7oise R\u00e9fabert, Rita Gomes, and Karolina Attspodina.\n\nFran\u00e7oise R\u00e9fabert, after 25 years of work in the banking sector, founded a consultancy in Paris in 2010. She developed a model for financing energy efficiency measures in collaboration with local authorities, enabling third parties to borrow money for energy renovation.\n\nHer work led to the establishment of the Serafin association, which helps low-income households access long-term interest-free loans for home renovation.\n\nArchitect Rita Gomes, leveraging dye-sensitized solar cells, transforms household items into renewable energy-producing devices. She is the director of the award-winning startup Seenergy in Porto, Portugal, which works on democratizing solar energy production by integrating solar cells and batteries into furniture.\n\nEntrepreneur Karolina Attspodina, originally from Ukraine, founded the company WeDoSolar in Berlin in 2022, which develops solar panels easy to install on balconies.\n\nWeDoSolar

New jobs in construction and manufacturing now account for over half of all energy employment.\n\nAfrica's abundant solar, wind, and hydroelectric resources present unique opportunities for sustainable development. Project Management Institute's Job Trends 2024 report suggests that investments in infrastructure and energy will spark demand for project management talent that can deliver next-gen infrastructure on time and within budget.\n\nWith a growing trend toward project-based approaches in many industries, a rising demand for skilled project managers is expected to increase significantly over the next decade. However, this demand is contrasted by a shrinking workforce in many countries due to aging populations and falling birth rates.\n\n\"As more countries and corporates in the region commit to lowering emissions, the transition to clean energy is poised to boost employment opportunities significantly. Turning the vision into reality means lots of projects and lots of jobs. There's abundant potential in Africa, which is home to 60percent of the top solar sites globally -- yet contains just 1percent of solar PV capacity,\" says George Asamani, MD, Sub-Saharan Africa, PMI.\n\nSeveral countries are leading the renewable charge in Africa. Senegal, an unlikely renewable energy hotspot, with oil and gas driving its forecasted 8.8percent GDP growth in 2024, is aiming to generate as much as 40percent clean energy by 2030.\n\nGhana's US$2 billion Ada Foah project is set to produce 1,000 megawatts of power by capturing tidal wave energy in the Gulf of Guinea. Even oil-rich Nigeria is calling for renewables to meet 60percent of the country's energy demands by 2050. In South Africa, some 66GW of wind and solar projects are at various stages of development, with 18GW at an advanced stage.\n\nAmid the many positive trends emerging for clean energy employment, skilled labour shortages are already plaguing the sector. The sector needs higher-skilled workers than most industries; 36percent of energy jobs are within high-skilled occupations by International Labour Organisation definitions, compared with 27percent in the broader economy.\n\n\"The number of Africans pursuing certifications relevant to project management is not keeping pace with the growing demand. Last year, China certified over 100,000 individuals, North America had 33,000, while Africa only managed 3000. Meanwhile, the global economy needs 25 million project professionals by 2030. To meet this demand, the biggest coming from sub-Saharan Africa, an estimated 2.3 million individuals must enter project management-oriented employment annually,\" adds Asamani.\n\n\"Cultivating a certified pool of project professionals should be a strategic priority for the region looking to be energy sufficient. Project management plays a key role in driving development outcomes and is one of the factors that contribute to competitiveness.\"\n\nAccording to the World Energy Outlook Report, by 2030, energy investment will need to double to over $200 billion per year for Africa to achieve all its energy-related development goals, including universal access to modern energy. About 600 million people lack access to electricity in Africa, with 98percent residing in sub\u2010Saharan Africa.\n\n\"Countries must determine what skills they need for the just transition and accordingly build bench strength - these could be in construction, project management, technical, stakeholder management, etc. We are working with several government institutions like the South African Council for the Project and Construction Management Professions, and Bureau Op\u00e9rationnel de Suivi du Plan S\u00e9n\u00e9gal \u00c9mergent to build local project management capacity,\" says Asamani in conclusion.\n\n\"As the region shifts away from coal-powered infrastructure and systems, companies must upskill and reskill employees in new areas of expertise. I call on all stakeholders to use this momentum to drive the skills development agenda.\"\n\nLarge renewable energy projects are complex, capital-intensive, and involve extensive development periods and multiple stakeholders. These projects, whether they employ mature technologies like hydropower, solar, and wind or emerging technologies like green hydrogen, without effective project management, will likely not meet the

It was a harbinger of a war on domestic energy -- one that would come with a hefty price tag for Americans.\n\nThis decision, part of a broad capitulation to radical environmentalist agendas, placed woke ideological victories above the economic well-being of hard-working Americans. From day one, the Biden administration made it clear that, for them, the pursuit of an unblemished green energy narrative justifies the steep cost to middle-class families already struggling to make ends meet.\n\nThe enactment of radical Green New Deal policies under the guise of the so-called \"Inflation Reduction Act\" revealed that the touted green energy subsidies would cost an astounding $1.2 trillion, three times the initial claim. These policies, which claim to pave the way for a cleaner future, paradoxically enrich companies in high-polluting nations like China while we at home bear the brunt.\n\nUnfortunately, the halt of new oil and gas leases was only the beginning. The implications of the administration's acquiescence to far-left interests, particularly on Americans' wallets, quickly became apparent. When Biden took over, inflation was at 1.4%, and filling up your car cost about $2.39 a gallon. Fast-forward to today, and prices have jumped nearly 18% across the board, with gas about 40% more expensive compared to the day Biden took office. To add fuel to fire, Biden recently doubled down on these efforts by proposing some of the most aggressive emission standards to date.\n\nIt begs the question: What tangible benefits have Utahns received from these Green New Deal policies?\n\nThe answer? Higher prices at the pump, dwindling job opportunities and increased vulnerability to the whims of international energy markets. We're forced to contend with the depletion of America's strategic energy reserves to historic lows, ostensibly for political gain, and now face the daunting task of replenishing these reserves at significantly higher costs.\n\nWe can't afford to continue down this path any longer.\n\nOur country needs new leaders who grasp the intrinsic link between a thriving energy sector, the environment and the well-being of the middle class. The current administration's penchant for blocking critical energy infrastructure and canceling energy leases on federal lands has hampered our energy independence and sowed uncertainty on an already volatile global stage.\n\nWe need champions for new energy infrastructure projects and advocates for permitting reform that modernizes the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), ensuring we can develop our natural resources. Initially intended in 1970 as a procedural statute for agencies to consider the environmental consequences of their actions, NEPA has become activists' favorite tool to delay projects they dislike indefinitely, nuclear being on the frontline. The truth is, with new technologies and innovation, we can unlock America's energy potential and continue to be good stewards of the environment.\n\nThe American dream, characterized by the pursuit of prosperity and the opportunity for all to achieve success through hard work, is fundamentally supported by the nation's ability to cultivate and utilize its own resources. However, as the administration enforces policies restricting the full use of these resources, the dream seems increasingly out of reach for many.\n\nAmerica needs leaders who understand that a robust and independent American energy sector is a cornerstone of our economic security, our national security and a lifeline for the middle class. We need policies that lead to a comprehensive, all inclusive approach to energy, to assert America as a dominant force in the global energy market.\n\nI stand ready to be that leader. With a background deeply rooted in the energy sector and a clear vision for America's future, I am prepared to champion policies that restore our energy independence, bolster our economy, balance environmental concerns and ensure that the American Dream remains within reach.\n\nAs our government works through the complexities of energy policy, we must not forget that the decisions made today will shape the future of our children and grandchildren. By harnessing the nation's energy resources wisely, the United States can fuel not just its cars and factories but the aspirations and ambitions of its people.\n\nIt's time for leaders who understand the value of a gallon of gas but also the value of a vision for an America empowered by its own energy, secure in its future and prosperous in its present.\n\nLet's recall the moment when Biden's war on energy began, not to lament but to learn -- and to choose leaders who not only want America to be energy independent but also want to expand our production to achieve American dominance.\n\n(Photo courtesy JR Bird) JR Bird\n\nJR Bird founded Paragon Oilfield Products, serves as the mayor of Roosevelt City, and is a current candidate for Utah's 3rd Congressional District.\n\nThe Salt Lake Tribune is committed to creating a space where Utahns can share ideas, perspectives and solutions that move our state forward.

Construction of the 100MW Sbikha solar photovoltaic (PV) plant in Kairouan began on Wednesday\n\n\"Once operational, this renewable energy plant will create more than 40,000 jobs and reduce the cost of producing electricity from natural gas by about TND 50 million per year,\" said Wael Chouchene, Secretary of State to the Minister of Industry in charge of Energy Transition.\n\nChouchene, who was joined by the Minister of Industry, Energy and Mines and the Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to Tunis for the launch of the project, told TAP the project, which will cost around TND 300 million, is a landmark project in terms of increasing the share of renewable energy in the energy mix and reducing dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nIt will promote sustainable development, encourage local investment and create new employment opportunities in engineering, construction and maintenance, he added.\n\nThe tender for the Sbikha solar plant project, launched by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines in 2019, was won by Emirati Company AMEA POWER, which implements alternative and renewable energy projects in 20 countries around the world.\n\nThe aim of the 200-hectare plant is to diversify energy sources through the use of clean energy and to strengthen Tunisia's energy transition.\n\nThis is the first project in a series of renewable energy initiatives with a total capacity of 500 MW.\n\nThe projects will be implemented in 5 governorates of the country: Tataouine (200 MW), Tozeur (50 MW), Sidi Bouzid (50 MW), Kairouan (100 MW) and Gafsa (100 MW).\n\nSpeaking at the event, Hussain Al Nowais, Chairman of AMEA POWER, said that the project, which is co-funded by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the International Finance Corporation (IFS), falls within the framework of investments in renewable and green energy.\n\nWork on the project will take 18 months and the plant will be operational by 2025, he said.\n\nTunisia's national energy strategy aims to achieve a 35% share of renewable energy in the electricity mix by 2030.\n\nTo achieve this goal, several alternative energy projects need to be implemented, the level of energy independence has to be improved, energy sources for electricity production need to be diversified and the cost of subsidies for the development of the green economy has to be reduced.", "source": {"uri": "tap.info.tn",

of the Energy Commission of Nigeria (ECN) gazette on national energy policies and national energy master plan for strategic planning and coordination of its policies.\n\nHe said that the steps taken by the commission would enhance recognition at the international level while facilitating cooperation and alignment with international standards.\n\nWhile calling on stakeholders to adhere to the

energy, Olu Verheijen, said the gazette on national energy policies and national energy masterplan for strategic planning and coordination requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders, including public and private sectors, civil societies, and the international communities.\n\nVerheijen, who unveiled the gazette said the process was to ensure reliable and affordable energy access for all Nigerians.\n\nEarlier, the director-general of the ECN, Dr Mustapha Abdullahi, said the document has also highlighted the best way of efficiently using our energy that will help save instead of just concentrating on generation alone.\n\nThis, he said, would help the masses, stakeholders, and investors to invest in energy and would also advise the nation on the best source of energy to use.\n\n\"If we must guarantee energy security, then we must diversify so we are saying that we have so many sources of energy that are yet untapped and this document also gives the roadmap to solar,

Microsoft CPPAs will contribute 28% of renewable agreements required to reach this goal.\n\nCorporate Vice President of Cloud Operations and Innovation at Microsoft, Noelle Walsh, stressed the importance of partnerships between business and government to advance sustainability goals. Walsh said 'Microsoft is committed to becoming carbon-negative by 2030, working with governments globally to accelerate the journey to a net-zero future'.\n\n\"With these agreements, we support new renewable energy infrastructure in Ireland. We are proud to be partnering with leading energy providers to bring this additional renewable energy on stream and help industry and government and the broader energy sector to achieve its climate action ambitions,\" said Walsh.\n\nThe CPPAs announced included agreements with Statkraft, Energia Group, and Power Capital Renewable Energy. These partnerships are aligned with Microsoft's recently-announced goal of having 100% of data centre energy consumption matched by zero-carbon energy purchases by 2030.\n\nData centre power consumption has long been an industry concern. Even more attention is being paid to it, as the increasing adoption of AI and quantum computing drives energy demand in data centres even higher.\n\nNational Grid CEO John Pettigrew recently noted, \"Future growth in foundational technologies like AI and quantum computing will mean larger scale, energy-intensive computing infrastructure.\"\n\nPettigrew added the UK is at a pivotal moment in energy demand due to constraints on the existing grid. He said this is a 'moment in time that requires innovative thinking and bold actions to create a transmission network for tomorrow's future'.\n\nLast week, Microsoft, Brookfield Asset Management, and Brookfield Renewable signed a five-year global deal to generate over 10.5GW of new renewable energy capacity.

This week, I'm going to look at the issues facing Georgia in its energy efficiency goals - in particular, Georgia's residential buildings. In my next article, I'll go into greater detail about what the Georgian government is doing with its partners to develop Georgia's energy efficiency in line with Western standards.\n\nFollowing the signing of the Association Agreement with the European Union in 2014, aligning with the EU regulatory framework became a key driver for changes in Georgia's energy sector, among them the integration of renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, promoting competitive markets, and protecting consumer rights. Tackling energy poverty has emerged as a central focus within these reforms, as it represents a major barrier in Georgia, typically characterized by households lacking access to vital energy services and products.\n\nGeorgia's Energy Poverty\n\n\"One of the key issues of energy sector reform is the fight against energy poverty. The phenomenon, defined as the inability of households to access essential energy services and products, remains a major challenge in Georgia,\" Tutana Kvaratskhelia, a senior energy policy analyst and energy poverty researcher at the think tank World Experience for Georgia (WEG), told GEORGIA TODAY in our March interview with her.\n\nEnergy poverty is defined as the inability to access affordable, reliable, and modern energy services for basic needs like cooking, heating, and lighting.\n\nIn Georgia, as in many post-Soviet countries, several factors contribute to energy poverty. These include outdated and energy-inefficient building infrastructure, a sizable portion of the population experiencing social vulnerability, and the prevalence of inefficient energy technologies and limited access to clean energy alternatives.\n\nA 2021 Energy Community Secretariat study posited that 24.6% of households in Georgia are \"energy-poor,\" while the draft Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan of Georgia suggests that nearly half of Georgia's population might be experiencing some form of energy poverty.\n\nHow energy efficient are Georgian homes today?\n\n\"As of July 1st 2023, all new buildings should meet minimum energy efficiency standards,\" Giorgi Mukhigulishvili, Researcher in Energy and Climate Change Studies, tells us. \"In parallel, old buildings must be renovated, and this renovation strategy is currently being developed by the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development. Through it, they will set some plans and financial mechanisms to move things forward. Minimum standards already exist for walls, doors, windows, roofs, basements, etc., and refer to heat transference and heat resistance. These follow EU standards, but with local specificity in mind, as we have three different climate zones in Georgia, each with their own requirements and standards in energy efficiency.\"\n\nAccording to Geostat data, the majority of households in Georgia primarily depend on either individual heating facilities, such as wood stoves (81%), or a central heating system (25.6% in urban areas and 6% in rural areas). Natural gas and firewood are the primary sources of heating in Georgia. Firewood is used by 35.4% of all households for individual heating, with the majority (86.1%) of these located in rural areas.\n\nGeostat reports that to manage the burden of high heating expenses, around 43% of Georgia's households often resort to reducing living space during winter, heating only one room of the house. This is usually the kitchen- where the family eats, sleeps and interacts day-to-day, snuggled around the wood stove. In a 2021 Geostat survey, it was also revealed that many of those with central heating maintain household temperatures below the World Health Organization's recommended minimum of 18\u00b0C in order to reduce their energy bill.\n\nFurther, currently, most buildings in Georgia lack proper insulation, resulting in high costs for heating and other energy services, Kvaratskhelia told us. \"EU directives require countries to assess the number of households living in energy poverty and to include measures to address this issue in their integrated energy and climate plans (NECPs). Georgia has already drafted its first NECP with measures to address energy poverty. These include programs to increase access to clean energy sources and technologies, financial support to the population to cover energy bills, etc.\"\n\nOne of those programs is mass gasification. Over the past two decades, Georgia has had a big drive to gasify the country. But, Mukhigulishvili notes, despite energy tariffs being relatively low, with gas and electricity heavily subsidized in the residential sector, citizens newly connected to the grid at first only used gas for cooking, not heating; continuing to rely on wood stoves for that function.\n\n\"If we compare the market price of gas in the region overall, around $300 per 1000 cubic meters, in some of Georgia's regions it is priced at just $40 per 1000m3,\" Mukhigulishvili informs us. \"Yet, when they gasified the regions of the country, gas consumption did not increase as much as anticipated, as people avoided use of gas for heating, only using it for cooking. Later, because of unsustainable consumption and inaccessibility to wood, people only then installed central heating systems.\"\n\n\"I always advocate for efficient stoves being provided over gasification, especially in the high mountain regions, because, if you make a cost-benefit analysis on a national level, it is inefficient to gasify areas where families are few and often only live seasonally. It's far better to have efficient stoves available and encourage the practice of using dried fuel and briquettes,\" Mukhigulishvili says.\n\nThe burning of wood in traditional, inefficient stoves is known to contribute to indoor air pollution and associated health risks. Indeed, short-term exposure to smoke from inefficient wood-burning heaters, or from the wrong (or damp) fuel burned, can aggravate asthma or worsen pre-existing heart conditions, while long-term exposure can cause heart and lung disease. This is where the right marketing comes in, and Mukhigulishvili tells us that there have been campaigns run by both the state, with donor support, and local NGOs, such as CENN, where energy efficient stoves and solar heaters were provided to a selection of families nationwide. However, he rightly points out that the number of households impacted by these campaigns is not representative of the scale of the issue.\n\n\"The good news is that local production of these energy efficient stoves has increased in recent years. Not only those big, traditional Svan stoves, but also, with UNDP and GIZ support, for example, provision of smaller more efficient stoves,\" he says.\n\nWe ask Mukhigulishvili about the fuel for those stoves.\n\n\"Briquettes are a more efficient and more environmentally friendly solution, created using the waste of different kinds of biomass. Thanks to donor support, we have several production units in different regions of the country, for example in Kakheti - in Akhmeta, in Samegrelo, in Svaneti and Adjara. But because of the low cost of wood, briquettes are not yet as competitive as they should be in the Georgian market.\"\n\nThe Forest Code Georgia adopted in 2020 demands sustainable practices in the forest, meaning, among other things, that forest waste is used alongside the wood that is cut, lowering the impact on the forest.\n\n\"Since the 1990s, we've noted the unsustainable manner in which citizens and businesses use our forest resources, not only for energy purposes, but also industrial,\" Mukhigulishvili says. \"That's why, to relieve the pressure on the forest, we're increasingly turning - and encouraging our citizens through legal reforms and education to turn to wooden biomass products, solid waste products, gasification, renewable energy resources, heat pumps, solar water heaters, energy efficient insulation materials for building exteriors and interiors, etc. And there are already suppliers of such products and services countrywide. It is now on us to develop all these resources and support their expansion.\"\n\nIt is clear that, alongside government reforms and international partner support, the private sector in Georgia has a key role to play, and we will be looking into that in our next energy efficiency article.\n\n***\n\nThis article was inspired by the EU-funded Georgia Energy Sector Reform Program (GESRP)'s three-day

They will often be in remote areas that will need to be connected to the grid. New energy sources for both export and renewable energy for green hydrogen developments will challenge existing commercial models. Additionally, decommissioning and repurposing of coal infrastructure into essential \"bridging\" decarbonization assets will require financing that is fair and just to local people and businesses.\n\n\"Nevertheless, ample opportunities exist in the Asia Pacific to integrate a mix of different generation, transmission, and distribution technologies at the right price point and at the right time to achieve commercial and environmental success,\" said Narsingh Chaudhary, President, Asia Pacific and India, Black & Veatch.\n\n\"Black & Veatch has been at the forefront of building critical energy infrastructure for several decades and is committed to supporting the rising energy needs in Asia Pacific with low and no-carbon energy sources,\" said Chaudhary.\n\nAs Asia Pacific economies transition from a carbon-based economy to an electron- and molecule-based one, the region must find the right energy mix for near-term requirements and long-term change. Different levels of access to energy resources and differing energy needs demand a broad range of solutions.\n\nLiquefied natural gas (LNG) can support the shift from coal and the additional energy mix needed to fuel economic growth in developing markets.\n\nEnergy storage technologies, like Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH), enhance energy security by balancing sudden and significant drops in power production from variable renewable energy resources to improve grid reliability and stability.\n\nIn the longer term, hydrogen has the potential to provide seasonal energy storage and serve as the missing link for utilities, commercial businesses, and industries seeking to operate sustainably.\n\nBetter-planned and designed transmission systems, including interconnection lines, interconnection substations, and switching facilities, will help Asia Pacific address voltage and frequency variability and grid code requirements across the grid.\n\nAt Future Energy Asia 2024, Chaudhary will present global best practices for scaling low-carbon technologies in carbon reduction. Chaudhary will share his insights on the role of gas and LNG as a transition fuel.\n\nOther topics Black & Veatch subject matter experts will discuss at Future Energy Asia include:\n\nEnabling integration of renewable energy with smart grid technologies Cross-industry collaborations advancing climate action, solutions and innovations Optimizing solar PV and BESS deployments Green hydrogen utilization /Public Release.

Gujarat tops the list with 2.8 GW, followed by Maharashtra by 1.7 GW.\n\nA recent report by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) stated that only 20 percent of rooftop solar capacity installations are in the residential sector, with the majority in commercial and industrial sectors.\n\nThe CEEW report suggests that 25 crore households in India could deploy 637 GW of solar energy on rooftops, and just one-third of this could meet the entire residential electricity demand in the country.\n\nHowever, the joint report by IEEFA and Ember has recognised the considerable efforts that the Indian states are making towards transitioning to clean energy and recommended strengthening state-level regulatory ecosystems to accelerate the pace of transition, ensure compliance, promote growth, data tracking and monitoring, and to set up a conducive environment for business.\n\nLauding the policies adopted by India that balance economic growth and the country's long-term climate action plan, the Economic Review, in its chapter on India's climate action, highlighted the government's achievement in placing developmental priorities at the core of its energy transition efforts.",

They will often be in remote areas that will need to be connected to the grid. New energy sources for both export and renewable energy for green hydrogen developments will challenge existing commercial models. Additionally, decommissioning and repurposing of coal infrastructure into essential \"bridging\" decarbonization assets will require financing that is fair and just to local people and businesses.\n\n\"Nevertheless, ample opportunities exist in the Asia Pacific to integrate a mix of different generation, transmission, and distribution technologies at the right price point and at the right time to achieve commercial and environmental success,\" said Narsingh Chaudhary, President, Asia Pacific and India, Black & Veatch.\n\n\"Black & Veatch has been at the forefront of building critical energy infrastructure for several decades and is committed to supporting the rising energy needs in Asia Pacific with low and no-carbon energy sources,\" said Chaudhary.\n\nAs Asia Pacific economies transition from a carbon-based economy to an electron- and molecule-based one, the region must find the right energy mix for near-term requirements and long-term change. Different levels of access to energy resources and differing energy needs demand a broad range of solutions.\n\nLiquefied natural gas (LNG) can support the shift from coal and the additional energy mix needed to fuel economic growth in developing markets.\n\nEnergy storage technologies, like Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) and Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH), enhance energy security by balancing sudden and significant drops in power production from variable renewable energy resources to improve grid reliability and stability.\n\nIn the longer term, hydrogen has the potential to provide seasonal energy storage and serve as the missing link for utilities, commercial businesses, and industries seeking to operate sustainably.\n\nBetter-planned and designed transmission systems, including interconnection lines, interconnection substations, and switching facilities, will help Asia Pacific address voltage and frequency variability and grid code requirements across the grid.\n\nAt Future Energy Asia 2024, Chaudhary will present global best practices for scaling low-carbon technologies in carbon reduction. Chaudhary will share his insights on the role of gas and LNG as a transition fuel.\n\nOther topics Black & Veatch subject matter experts will discuss at Future Energy Asia include:\n\nBlack & Veatch is a 100-percent employee-owned global engineering, procurement, consulting and construction company with a more than 100-year track record of innovation in sustainable infrastructure.

Cover cleantech, energy, finance.\n\nEnergy is an input in everything. If you want to lower input costs across the board, then providing the dynamics to incentivize rapid energy growth is a good first step.\n\nThe above isn't hypothetical, as we saw the benefits of this with the growth of US shale. The US was able to see significant economic expansion without major inflation, as energy costs declined due to a flood of capital and technology amongst US oil and gas producers. Bonds rose year over year as it steadily looked as if there were fewer inflation risks on the horizon. We now face the opposite: inflation is proving stickier than expected, and low-cost energy of all types is less than sure. With significant energy demand driven by fiscal policy, AI, demographics, and economic trends, it remains to be seen whether inflation can truly be beat with accelerating energy demand at a time when it is more difficult for energy projects to advance.\n\nThe constraints to energy development today are simple. Suppose you are an oil and gas executive team. In that case, you are being asked not to reinvest in growth, facing windfall taxes now or in the future, extended permitting, and a variety of other constraints depending on the jurisdiction. All of this removes capital that would otherwise be invested in new supply. If you are a renewable executive, it's not a cakewalk either, as you face extended permitting times, and your projects are also getting blocked on environmental grounds. You are also more sensitive to the higher rates, that will persist if inflation doesn't come down, than your oil and gas peers. These are all dynamics that restrict companies from responding to current and incoming energy demand as they might have in the past.\n\nAt the same time we are experiencing several trends on the demand side all at once. AI energy demand is well known with the latest quote from the CEO of ARM referencing that data centers could consume up to 25% of America's power by 2030. This means gas and renewable demand growth at a rate we haven't seen. The reshoring of North American manufacturing has also been written about; some of this is on the back of accelerating fiscal spending, and some results from a recent focus on supply chain security. These two trends are real persistent demand drivers, even if they are more obvious than the dynamics below.\n\nAs usual, the changing demographic trend is likely underestimated, starting with baby boomers. Today, a little over 17% of the population in the United States is retired. In 1970, it was 10% that was retired and eligible for benefits. This is a group that, in a survey of how they wanted to spend their time, every single top response was consumption-based, starting with travel. They've been planning this spending for years, making them a source of relatively inelastic demand, and you are talking about the wealthiest generation. Layoffs don't concern them. Inflation hurts consumption, but at the same time, they are one of the few groups where many sources of income are legally indexed to inflation. All these items make this group less price-dependent. There have been surveys to confirm this, most recently by Wandering RV, which said only 57% of boomers determine their trips based on budgets compared to 81% for Gen Z.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how serious governments decide to get about supporting energy development as the current policy of high fiscal spending, at a time when baby boomers are firing up the RV, likely creates a gauntlet the next few years where energy costs are steadily increasing while citizens want and need them to decline. Something will need to change and aggressive support for energy development of all types is a potential solution.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windfall_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Windfall tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baby boomers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_elasticity_of_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price elasticity of demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshoring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offshoring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Z", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generation Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 52}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/663aff342070b435946357eb/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=2997,1685,x0,y150,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545731", "eventUri": "eng-9545731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Coupled with Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding, the sector is already seeing accelerated production.\n\nOn the turbine front, Ferr\u00e9 points to the success of GE Vernova (GEV), which recently spun off from General Electric (GE). The stock is up 17% since going public, and analysts continue to remain bullish due to increasing investments in the nation's electrical grids.\n\nShe also highlights First Solar (FSLR), the largest supplier of domestically produced solar modules, with a backlog that will continue into 2027. First Solar has also secured major direct partnerships with data centers like Microsoft.\n\nIn the utilities sector, NextEra Energy (NEE) is up 19% year-to-date. The company delivers energy through renewables, natural gas, and nuclear power. In its most recent earnings call, the CEO pointed to the domestication of industries in the US as a major tailwind, alongside data center energy usage.\n\nThe sector in focus on Wall Street today.But the clean energy transition in the US going well beyond cars, it also involves upgrading the electrical grid to support increased power demand for A I and data centers.So which companies will likely benefit from that transition?Yahoo Finance has the list for us.Hey, hey ma yeah, we saw how higher interest rates last year put pressure on the clean energy sector but surging electricity demand is expected to benefit companies working on renewable.So this year is different, improving infrastructure incentives from the government's Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA that is aimed at accelerating the transition to green, domestically produced technologies are also expected to lift the sector.So which of the companies are we looking at?Well on a clean energy chart here, you can see Ver Nova, this is the company that just recently spun off out of GE and the stock is up seven percent since going public.This is a renewable energy company.They make gas turbines, they make wind turbines and analysts are bullish on this stock because of increasing electricity demand and also grid investments.You've got seven buys, four hold and one cell on this stock.We're also taking a look, by the way, this is a year to date chart.We're also taking a look at first solar.This is the biggest, the largest supplier of domestically produced solar modules.Their backlog goes into 2027 year to date.The stock is up 11% Goldman Sachs.Recently in a note talking about how for solar also has in direct partnerships with data centers like Microsoft, for example, so bullish on that stock.And then we're also taking a look at the utility space which by the way, utilities is the third best performing sector out of the S and P 500 this year.And we are taking a look at next era energy up a year to date up 19%.This company delivers energy that's in, in the form of renewables and natural gas, also nuclear and their CEO in their latest earnings call talked about the redation of industries in the US being a tailor for this company.Data center energy usage also being a tailwind for this company.17 buys five hold and one sell.So while we do see in the overall renewable space, we are still seeing weakness in that area.We are seeing companies that are these bright spots uh within that space, especially with the expectation of interest rates being cut later this year, guys, some that are well positioned here potentially for the coming years.All right.And that great stuff.Thanks.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

And what the increase in renewables will mean for consumers' pocketbooks is still unclear.\n\nLocally, the latest battle played out before the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission (PUC), which every four years has to approve Peco's energy procurement, or default service plan (DSP), where the utility explains how it intends to buy electricity.\n\nPeco's current DSP is set to expire next May.\n\n\" READ MORE: POWER Interfaith proposes the 'People's Energy Plan,' pushing Peco to use more renewable energy\n\nIn February, Peco filed its 1,235-page purchase plan with the regulators, essentially promising to do what it has been doing: obtaining the least expensive electric supply and purchasing 8% of its power from renewable sources, including 0.5% of solar energy generated within the state.\n\n\"Peco is proposing no change to its procurement process used in its prior default service program,\" according to the company's filing. It's a move that the company said guards against price volatility.\n\nThe PUC held two days of hearings on Peco's DSP at the end of April. About 80 people testified, including members of the Energy Justice Advocates (EJA), a group that includes POWER Interfaith, Vote Solar, Clean Air Council, Sierra Club, Physicians for Social Responsibility, and PennEnvironment.\n\n\"In my opinion, these criteria are insufficient and outdated. No less important but missing in PECO's list of criteria are the safety and health of Pennsylvanians, as well as the urgent need to address our climate crisis,\" testified Howard Sherman, a Peco customer from Lansdowne.\n\n\"For every hundred dollars that PECO spends on energy, it plans to spend 50 cents on solar.\"\n\n\"For every hundred dollars that Peco spends on energy, it plans to spend 50 cents on solar,\" Wendy Greenspan, a co-convener of POWER Interfaith's People's Energy Plan Campaign Group, said when she testified at the hearing.\n\n\"That's what Peco did in its last DSP four years ago. That's what it plans to do in this DSP for the next four years.\"\n\nAccording to the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission Climate Action Plan, the energy used in residential buildings in the Philadelphia area for everyday uses -- heating, cooling, cooking, and electricity -- accounts for about 19% of greenhouse gas emissions. The plan warned that \"significant action is needed in the residential building sector to implement energy efficiency, electrification, and clean energy measures.\"\n\nThe EJA contends that it wants Peco to play more of a leadership role in encouraging renewables, starting with the energy supply mix Peco plans to purchase, which is generated almost entirely by burning fossil fuel.\n\n\"Why isn't Peco transitioning to more renewable energy?\" Greenspan asked. \"Many utilities across the country are. Why is Peco digging in its heels and resisting the use of renewable energy?\"\n\nIn response, a Peco spokesperson said: \"Our filing is designed to comply with Pennsylvania law and regulations, which require us to procure electricity at the least cost over time, through a prudent mix of energy purchases to ensure adequate and reliable service, as well as price stability. These rules and regulations are designed to protect customers, including our low- and moderate-income customers, from paying above-market prices for their energy use.\"\n\nOil and gas industry experts counter that the state is retiring fossil fuel generation too quickly, before the capacity to replace it is available, forcing job losses and threatening grid resilience and reliability as demand for electricity is rising.\n\nWhen the Biden administration temporarily paused new approvals of liquefied natural gas exports, both of the state's Democratic U.S. senators, Bob Casey and John Fetterman, issued a joint statement: \"If this decision puts Pennsylvania energy jobs at risk, we will push the Biden administration to reverse this decision.\"\n\nPennsylvania, a fossil fuel powerhouse, trails other states in terms of new renewable energy. Over the last decade, no state's has grown more slowly, according to PennEnvironment Research & Policy Center's report \"Renewables on the Rise 2023'':\n\n\"Pennsylvania ranks a lowly 50th in the nation for percent growth in total solar, wind and geothermal generation since 2013,\" stated the report. It further explained: \"In the last decade, Pennsylvania has tripled solar production -- most of this growth coming since 2019. Yet in contrast, the U.S. saw a 12-fold growth in solar power and the leading state, Texas, built out a whopping 90 times as much renewable power as Pennsylvania.\"\n\n\"Texas built out a whopping 90 times as much renewable power as Pennsylvania.\"\n\nHowever, the move to solar is growing, especially amid large users.\n\nThe city, which owns about 600 buildings, recently announced a contract to buy solar-generated electricity from Energix Renewables, which will supply about a quarter of its need.\n\nSwarthmore and Haverford Colleges and the University of Pennsylvania also announced that they will be purchasing all the electricity produced from solar facilities.\n\n\" READ MORE: Philadelphia begins powering City Hall and the airport by a solar array 100 miles away\n\n\"Peco has presented the commission and its customers with its preference for four more years of wasted opportunities.\" testified Karl R. R\u00e1bago of Colorabo-based R\u00e1bago Energy LLC. R\u00e1bago accused Peco of short-sightedness and looking at lowest price generation over addressing the long-term impact of climate change.\n\nPOWER Interfaith continues to sponsor public events,

Uranium prices are soaring as the world snaps up nuclear fuel, public favor for nuclear power is at a 10-year high in the United States, Russia is busily expanding its own nuclear energy empire in emerging economies in Africa, and even Japan is moving back to the carbon-free energy source 13 years after the Fukushima nuclear disaster. All told, approximately 60 new nuclear reactors are currently under construction around the globe, and another 110 are in planning stages.\n\nBut there's one major detractor to the new nuclear revolution. A year ago, Germany took its last three nuclear power plants offline. And it seems pretty clear that they won't ever be bringing them back on. Germany's staunch anti-nuclear stance is a surprising one in many ways. The European nation is an outspoken proponent of the green energy transition, but has opted to take away one of its most reliable forms of carbon-free energy production as a matter of higher priority than transitioning away from coal - the dirtiest fossil fuel.\n\nGermany's move to eliminate the last vestiges of its nuclear energy sector also comes at a time when the nation's energy security is a cause for some concern. Critics had been warming for years that Europe - and Germany in particular - were dangerously reliant on Russian energy imports to keep the lights on. And those warnings proved to be correct when the continent was plunged into an energy crisis due to the energy sanctions brought against Russia in the wake of Moscow's illegal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The German economy and energy sector was hit hard, as the country was reliant on Russia for a whopping 50% of its natural gas supplies at the time of the invasion.\n\nBut instead of extending the life of its nuclear sector in the interest of low-emissions energy security, Germany has chosen to spend billions on its own new natural gas plants, augmented by significant renewable energy expansion, and to fall back on coal when energy supplies are short. For many energy and climate experts, the move has been nothing short of baffling.\n\nSo what gives? According to a recent report from The Conversation, Germany's stance on nuclear energy is the product of a long history rather than a grappling with current geopolitical realities. The decision to completely phase out nuclear energy production \"can only be understood in the context of post-war socio-political developments in Germany, where anti-nuclearism predated the public climate discourse,\" the report argues. Motivations for the vehement anti-nuclear discourse of the time included \"a distrust of technocracy; ecological, environmental and safety fears; suspicions that nuclear energy could engender nuclear proliferation; and general opposition to concentrated power (especially after its extreme consolidation under the Nazi dictatorship).\"\n\nBut the arguments at the time, which favored energy alternatives like solar and wind, were not actually based around concern for the climate. Instead they revolved around the decentralization and democratization of energy resources and their potential to contribute to greater self-sufficiency and citizen empowerment. It was an argument for a bottom-up rest of entrenched and autocratic power relations. Which means, to critics, that the anti-nuclear stance in Germany is rooted in a reality that no longer exists. The Cold War has given way to global warming, and new ideas and strategies are needed to meet these new existential threats.\n\nNow, a year after the total shutdown, more than half of Germans think that the timing of the nuclear pullout was a mistake, and industry experts say that Germans pay more for energy as a direct result of the pivot. However, even with an ideological shift and an update of political platforms, the German nuclear industry couldn't come back online overnight. New nuclear plant development is a slow and costly endeavor, oftentimes stretching well over a decade. Starting from zero, when the threats posed by climate change as well as energy security are so urgent, makes no sense for Germany. While the rest of the world galvanizes around a nuclear energy resurgence, Germany will have to forge its own path.", "source": {"uri": "zerohedge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Zero Hedge"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_nuclear_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fukushima nuclear disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_in_the_European_energy_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia in the European energy sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-nuclear_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-nuclear movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uranium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil fuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear reactor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Conversation (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic sanctions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Energy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Energy_Efficiency", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Energy Efficiency", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Employment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2024-05/german%20nuke%20plant.jpg?itok=mp-3PnWm", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9545731", "eventUri": "eng-9545731", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

But our need for energy continues year-on-year and we have retiring old plants, so we really need a lot of new capacity,\" said AboitizPower Head of Energy Transition Projects Felino Bernardo. \"We will need more LNG-to-power projects, RE capacity, and, at some point in time, we believe that these new and emerging technologies will come in to further accelerate the transition to more decarbonized sources of electricity.\"\n\nAccording to the Philippine Electricity Market Corporation, 51% of the country's registered capacity is from power plants that are more than 20 years old.\n\nAmidst the impending depletion of the Malampaya gas field by 2027 and the moratorium on greenfield coal-fired power plants, LNG-to-power is considered a cleaner baseload alternative to coal, as it is less greenhouse gas intensive. Gas turbines also cycle more quickly, providing more flexibility when addressing the intermittencies of solar and wind power.\n\n\"We need baseload support for RE. It's not a competition to RE, it's an enabler for RE to grow,\" Bernardo explained.\n\n\"Talking about what's on the other side of the bridge, it's the new technologies that are coming in. Unfortunately, we need to continue to lengthen and strengthen the bridge because there are still uncertainties on when they're going to be available and become more affordable,\" he added.\n\nThe AboitizPower official also maintained that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to an evolving and dynamic process like the energy transition, emphasizing on the necessity of diversifying the energy mix, especially to minimize reliance on one single energy source.\n\n\"We're approaching this with our balanced portfolio strategy. We want affordable electricity that can be provided by coal plants. We want a bridge technology that can be secured by LNG. And we are pursuing our RE targets to support decarbonization. All of these are needed for us to be able to deliver a balanced outcome for the energy needs of the country,\" Bernardo said.\n\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) projected peak electricity demand to increase annually by 6.6% from 2020 to 2040. This coincides with the Philippine government's economic growth targets of 6%-7% for 2024, 6.5%-7.5% for 2025, and 6.5%-8% for 2026 to 2028.\n\nIn 2022, the primary energy supply mix comprised over 50% net imported coal and oil, and 49% indigenous energy mostly from geothermal, biomass, coal, natural gas, and hydro.\n\nUnder the Clean Energy Scenario of the Philippine Energy Plan, it was also forecasted that 50% of gross generation in 2040 will eventually come from indigenous renewable energy sources and 26% will be from LNG.\n\n\"LNG is something that we can access. Southeast Asia and North Asia are among the biggest buyers of LNG. A lot of LNG is going this way to our market, so we can access that commodity for energy security,\" Bernardo said.\n\nThe DOE also said that a capacity of 1,200 megawatts from nuclear power is targeted to take part in the Philippine power mix by 2032.\n\n\"With respect to micro modular reactors, it can address specific market needs -- powering decentralized grids, data centers, and providing process heat for the industry. For medium-sized SMRs, at 300 megawatts, it's a good source of baseload energy -- dispatchable, safe, and carbon-free,\" Bernardo commented. \"But we are still a long way from seeing the first-of-a-kind (FOAK) installation and in developing human capability and the supply chain.\"\n\nTaking into account the inherent costs and tradeoffs in the energy transition, Bernardo reminded fellow industry players to be very deliberate in their decisions as it will affect the energy security and affordability of present and future generations.\n\n\"What does it mean to be energy secure? Simply put, it's having electricity every time at the right cost and the least harm,\" he maintained.\n\nSpotlight is BusinessWorld's sponsored section that allows advertisers to amplify their brand and connect with BusinessWorld's audience by publishing their stories on the BusinessWorld Web site.

These two plants will create 100 jobs.\n\nHe announced that construction would begin in 2025 and production would start in 2026.\n\nHe went on to say that these projects represent a major step forward in Tunisia's energy transition, adding that they will help reduce the need to import natural gas and guarantee the country's energy security.\n\nThe foundation stone for the photovoltaic power plant was laid in the El Metbasta region (Kairouan governorate). It will have a capacity of 100 MW (under the concession system).\n\nThe secretary of state said this project is part of the first phase of the renewable energy programme, which has approved five projects with a capacity of 500 MW in five governorates.\n\nChouchane said that these projects would reduce the cost of producing and selling electricity by a third compared to the cost of producing electricity using natural gas.\n\nHe added that these projects would have a positive impact on several regions, such as Kairouan, Gafsa and Tataouine, and announced that other projects would soon be implemented in the governorates of Gafsa and Tozeur at a total cost of 300 million dinars.\n\nThe Secretary of State announced that the government intends to launch a series of projects and tenders between 2024 and 2025 with a production capacity of 1,700 MW.\n\nCEO of STEG, Faisal Trifa, said that these projects would reduce the deficit in the trade and energy balance.\n\nThe Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister, Samia Charfi, stressed the importance of this project, which aims to diversify energy sources by using clean energy and photovoltaic technologies to ensure Tunisia's energy transition.\n\nShe also reaffirmed that Tunisia's ambition, through the implementation of alternative energy projects, is to improve its energy independence, diversify the energy mix used to produce electricity and control the energy compensation budget, in addition to developing the green economy and contributing to the global effort to reduce gas emissions.\n\nThe National Energy Strategy has set the target of achieving 35% of electricity production from renewable sources by 2030.", "source": {"uri": "tap.info.tn", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u0648\u0643\u0627\u0644\u0629

The utility seeks to modify its generation profiles and pricing schemes to encourage energy efficiency and greater use of renewable resources among its customer base.\n\nThe CPUC's review of this Advice Letter is particularly critical as it comes at a time when California is wrestling with high energy demand, a shift towards electric vehicles, and the need for a resilient power grid in face of climate-induced challenges. Stakeholders from various sectors, including consumer advocacy groups and renewable energy proponents, have weighed in, highlighting the need for tariffs that not only promote sustainability but also protect consumers from undue financial burdens.\n\nThe key elements of SDG&E's proposal include:\n\nAdjustments to Peak Time Pricing: This is intended to better reflect the actual cost of energy production and encourage consumers to reduce usage during peak hours, thereby aiding grid management.\n\nSupport for Renewable Energy Projects: Enhanced incentives for residential and commercial solar installations, aligning with California's goal for a carbon-neutral future. Grid Reliability Measures: Investments in grid infrastructure to improve reliability and accommodate more renewable energy sources.\n\nReactions to the proposal have been mixed. Consumer advocates express cautious optimism, noting that the changes could lead to fairer pricing structures. However, they also warn of the need for vigilant oversight to ensure that lower-income households are not disproportionately affected. Renewable energy advocates applaud the support for solar and other renewables but call for more aggressive measures to phase out fossil fuels.\n\nAs the CPUC deliberates on SDG&E's Advice Letter 4361-E-A, the outcomes will likely have significant implications for the utility's business practices, its customers, and California's energy landscape at large. Stakeholders are urged to participate actively in the discussion to ensure that the final decisions support both economic and environmental health.\n\nAbout Today at the CPUC: This series provides updates and insights on the activities and decisions of the California Public Utilities Commission, focusing on developments that affect the energy sector and public interest.\n\nBradley Bartz is the founder of ABC Solar Incorporated and a vocal advocate for solar energy.

Artificial intelligence and other technologies will take it to a new level by increasing reliability, reducing emissions, and cutting costs.\n\nThe research and development done at the national laboratories is making room on the grid for more renewables and electric vehicles. The goal now is to ensure a smooth and dependable transition. Indeed, green energy grew by 250,000 megawatts over the last decade while EVs are gaining market share. The decreased usage of fossil fuels will lead to greater electricity consumption, requiring a smarter grid and advanced energy storage.\n\nArtificial intelligence or AI \"will drive unprecedented innovation,\" says Steven Ashby, director of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. \"An AI-empowered grid could make autonomous decisions to manage load and generation in real-time,\" adding that AI could also help streamline the permitting process.\n\nAshby spoke at a virtual press event last week hosted by the United States Energy Association, where I was a panelist.\n\nElectricity is the lifeblood of American commerce, making up 7% of the U.S. economy. However, the nation's transmission network must grow and improve to handle a massive influx of EVs and wind and solar plants. In 2022, commercial and industrial energy customers announced clean energy deals worth nearly 17 gigawatts, which is record-breaking. Amazon, Meta, Google, Verizon, Ford, and General Motors led the charge, said the Clean Energy Buyers Association.\n\nGovernment policies are backing the objectives. The country can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030 from a 2005 baseline with some help from the Inflation Reduction Act that provides $369 billion for 21st-century energy and climate projects.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy says the grid may need to expand by 60% by 2030 and triple by 2050 to meet clean energy demands. Upgrading the grid is also an option -- or adding new digital components so that the wires can carry more electrons. \"Reconductoring\" is a solution that involves installing new conductor wires onto the existing transmission.\n\nConsider the Tennessee Valley Authority: Reconductoring has the potential to increase the throughput of its lines \"two to four times.\" That's huge, says Stephen Streiffer, director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The numbers will only get better with advancements in technologies and materials.\n\n\"We will need a solid transmission system in the United States,\" adds Martin Keller, director of the National Renewable Energy Lab. \"We must continue to invest in the research to develop this, but also build transmission as quickly as possible.\"\n\nInnovation is paramount to enhancing transmission and battery technology, which harnesses wind and solar electrons and releases them when needed. Lithium-ion batteries are the go-to battery storage device today. They use cobalt, which is difficult to mine and leads to thermal runaways or fires. However, the technology has greater density and allows more energy storage.\n\nCompeting technologies are on the horizon. One is \"solid-state\" batteries that avoid lithium and use oxides, sulfides, phosphates, and solid polymers. Flow batteries are another. They can be charged and recharged multiple times a day for decades. Short-term lithium-ion batteries, in contrast, will wear down after 10 years.\n\n\"The cost of batteries has come down by an order of magnitude that is massive,\" says Claus Daniel, associate director for advanced energy at Argonne National Laboratory. The batteries contain various raw materials such as copper, cobalt, nickel, lithium, and magnesium. Cobalt is the \"only material\" that Argonne is \"worried about,\" he says, adding that much of the lab's research goes to \"changing the energy materials in there.\"\n\nBeyond that, the focus is on recycling the existing materials, diversifying supply chains, and making more efficient use of the materials, adds Kimberly Budil, director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. For instance, Tesla says recycling is less expensive than buying those minerals, noting it can recover 92% of a battery's materials.\n\nBetter raw material management is imperative if the global community is to comply with the Paris Agreement. That includes reaching 33,000 gigawatts of renewable energy and electrifying 90% of the transport sector by 2050 -- all predicated on a clean energy infrastructure.\n\nThe energy transition is well underway, facilitated in considerable measure by the national labs' work in conjunction with private enterprises. Technology will continue to leap forward. In truth, AI, smart grids, and battery technology have the potential to revolutionize the way electricity is generated and delivered, improving reliability.

However, a recent report from the Energy Efficiency Movement shows that while there is optimism and appetite among businesses to invest in energy efficiency, the survey also identified barriers, including a lack of specialist resources (33%).\n\nTo address this deficit and help businesses take the first step on their journey towards energy efficiency, ABB is launching an online calculator which offers easy access to data insight based on the energy performance of motor-driven systems. By inputting basic details about their motor fleet, running hours and average operating power, the customer can estimate energy and emissions savings, and payback period. The online calculator is a light version of the in-depth energy efficiency audit used by ABB's experts in a full study and is based on the same algorithm.\n\n\"Improving energy efficiency is one of the fastest and most cost-effective ways for industrial organizations to reduce their environmental impact and operating costs,\" said Erich Labuda, President of the Motion Services division at ABB. \"However, many businesses lack the data insights needed to act. Our new online calculator democratizes access to this valuable information and helps businesses understand the scale of the opportunity.\"\n\nThe calculator provides an initial estimate of the potential energy and cost savings achievable by upgrading pump and fan systems driven by low voltage direct online (DOL) motors which are installed without a variable speed drive (VSD) to control their speed. The calculator focuses on low-voltage motors of efficiency class IE3 and below. It estimates the energy savings that could be achieved by upgrading to the latest motor and drive technology - the IE5 SynRM package - for optimal energy efficiency gains.\n\nAfter seeing the potential results, the next step in the energy efficiency journey is a full energy efficiency audit, where ABB's experts gather site-specific data to precisely identify an operator's top opportunities for saving energy. Once an audit's recommendations are implemented, the final step is to protect their investments with customized service agreements that keep their motors and drives operating efficiently and reliably through their lifetime.\n\nTo try the online energy efficiency calculator, click here.\n\nABB Motion, a global leader in motors and drives, is at the core of accelerating a more productive and sustainable future.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nUniversal Credit, State Pension, PIP claimants have been warned over payment shake-ups. The Department for Work and Pensions has confirmed it will pay Personal Independence Payment (PIP) early in August, as well as Universal Credit and State Pension prematurely too.\n\nMoney expert Andy Wood said: \"In light of the upcoming Bank Holiday on August 26, many people receiving benefits from the Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) can expect their payments to arrive earlier than usual. Normally, benefit payments align with the operational days of DWP offices and phone lines.\n\n\"However, on bank holidays, payments are typically issued on the last working day before the holiday. Those expecting payments on Monday, August 26, will likely see them in their accounts by Friday, August 23. This adjustment lets people pay their bills on time and avoid any financial stress. Early payments are a routine practice for Bank Holidays, offering stability and predictability for those receiving benefits.\n\nREAD MORE Foreign Office warns over Greek 'cultural difference' that'll get Brits arrested\n\n\"This adjustment affects several benefits, including Attendance Allowance, Carer's Allowance, Employment Support Allowance (ESA), Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA), Pension Credit, Personal Independence Payment (PIP), State Pension, and Universal Credit. HMRC has already confirmed that Child Benefit and Tax Credits due on August 26 will be advanced to August 23, so DWP payments will likely follow the same schedule.\"\n\nAndy said: \"Benefit payment frequencies differ: Carer's Allowance and Jobseeker's Allowance are typically paid every two weeks, while State Pension and Universal Credit are usually paid every four weeks and monthly, respectively. These payments are directly deposited into recipients' banks, building societies, or credit union accounts.\n\n\"If you receive benefits from the DWP, the early payment before the August 26 Bank Holiday means you will have access to your benefit funds sooner, helping you manage your finances better. If you live in Scotland, an earlier bank holiday on August 5 means that tax credits and potentially other Social Security payments will be made on August 2. This early payment adjustment means you can plan your finances and manage bills better.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rodger@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "James Rodger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Pension_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State Pension (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Independence_Payment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal Independence Payment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Universal Credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Work_and_Pensions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Department for Work and Pensions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobseeker's_Allowance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jobseeker's Allowance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attendance_Allowance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attendance Allowance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carer's_Allowance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carer's Allowance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_and_Support_Allowance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Employment and Support Allowance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_Credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pension Credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Revenue_and_Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "HM Revenue and Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_Support", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Income Support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_benefit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child benefit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social Security (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/article29639087.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_dwp.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773713", "eventUri": "eng-9773713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-26", "textStart": 483, "textEnd": 492, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-23", "textStart": 922, "textEnd": 931, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 2246, "textEnd": 2254}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-02", "textStart": 2341, "textEnd": 2349}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

In their manifesto, the new Labour Party government pledged to tackle the cost of living crisis by dealing with its underlying causes.\n\nWork and pensions secretary Liz Kendall has said the DWP will focus on tackling \"economic inactivity,\" aiming to boost employment with their new 'Back to Work' plan. \"It is time for change in every corner of the country,\" said Ms Kendall.\n\n\"We'll create more good jobs, make work pay, transform skills, and overhaul job centres, alongside action to tackle the root causes of worklessness including poor physical and mental health.\"\n\nREAD MORE Foreign Office warns over Greek 'cultural difference' that'll get Brits arrested\n\nBut how does the eighth month of the year impact DWP benefits and payments? BirminghamLive has rounded up five major details and shake-ups impacting millions of benefits claimants who are up and down the country.\n\nTax credits reminder from HMRC\n\nHMRC reminders have been sent to about 730,000 households about tax credits. The deadline to respond with information about one's circumstances, including income details for the previous tax year (April 6, 2023, to April 5, 2024), is July 31. In 2024/25, the DWP will contact the remaining tax credit claimants (those also receiving other legacy benefits), and all claimants of Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA), and Housing Benefit. The DWP aims to send migration notices to these households - around 440,000 in total - by September 2024.\n\nManaged migration from DWP\n\nManaged migration letters have been sent, and claimants have three months from the letter's date to comply. In 2024/25, the DWP will contact the remaining tax credit claimants (those also receiving other legacy benefits), and all claimants of Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA), and Housing Benefit.\n\nThe DWP aims to send migration notices to these households - around 440,000 in total - by September 2024.\n\nPayment dates from HMRC\n\nCarer's allowance, tax credits (from HMRC) and child benefit are either weekly or every four weeks. And maternity allowance is either every two weeks or every four weeks. If the date you usually expect your benefit payment falls on a weekend or a bank holiday, then your benefit will be paid on the working day before.\n\nPayment dates from DWP\n\nIf you are due to receive a DWP benefit payment on this day, you may find you receive it early. If your payment is due on August 26, you will receive it on August 23. If you're payment is due on a different day, it will arrive in your account as normal and the amount you are due to be paid will remain the same\n\nThe usual benefits and pension payments will be going out mostly as normal in August. These are:\n\nUniversal Credit State pension Pension credit Child benefit Disability living allowance Personal independence payment Attendance allowance Carer's allowance Employment support allowance Income support Jobseeker's allowance Household Support Fund\n\nIn the spring Budget, former chancellor Jeremy Hunt confirmed the Household Support Fund (HSF) would be extended for six months beyond the original 31 March deadline.\n\nThe HSF is funding given to all local councils to support vulnerable households in their area. Councils are free to allocate the funds however they feel is best.\n\nFor instance, some have provided cash grants, supermarket vouchers, or energy bill assistance. Visit your local council's website to find out what help may still be available.\n\nChild Benefit deadline from HMRC\n\nChild Benefit and Guardian's Allowance payments increased by 6.7 per cent on April 6. Families with one child will now receive up to \u00a31,331 in the 2024/25 financial year - an annual increase of \u00a383.20, and up to \u00a3881 this year per additional child, which is an annual increase of \u00a354.60.\n\nThere is no limit to how many children families can claim for. Parents will receive \u00a3102.40 every four weeks (\u00a325.60 per week) for the first or only child and \u00a367.80 every 4 weeks (\u00a316.95 per week) for each additional child.\n\nParents have just weeks to take action or risk losing up to \u00a31,331 in child benefit payments. Letters are being posted to parents of teenagers asking them for an update about their child's future education plans.\n\nSeparately, all working parents in the UK are currently entitled to 30 hours of free childcare for children aged 3 to 4. From April 1, this entitlement will expand to include 15 hours of free childcare for 2-year-olds.\n\nYou must apply online and reconfirm your eligibility every three months, in time for each school term. Working parents can also apply for tax-free childcare, giving back 20p for every 80p you put towards childcare, up to a maximum of \u00a3500 a year.", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rodger@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "James Rodger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Kendall", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liz Kendall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Revenue_and_Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "HM Revenue and Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobseeker's_Allowance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jobseeker's Allowance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tax credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_Work_and_Pensions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Secretary of State for Work and Pensions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Work_and_Pensions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Department for Work and Pensions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u2013present_United_Kingdom_cost-of-living_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021\u2013present United Kingdom cost-of-living crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_Benefit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Housing Benefit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_Support", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Income Support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_benefit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Child benefit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manifesto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carer's_Allowance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carer's Allowance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_holiday", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank holiday"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hunt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremy Hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Credit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Universal Credit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_(education)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor (education)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Family_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Family Resources", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/article29639169.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_dwp1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9773713", "eventUri": "eng-9773713", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-31", "textStart": 3361, "textEnd": 3369}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 1398, "textEnd": 1405}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-26", "textStart": 2677, "textEnd": 2686}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-23", "textStart": 2711, "textEnd": 2720}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-06", "textStart": 3832, "textEnd": 3839}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-01", "textStart": 4619, "textEnd": 4626}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Experts warn the policy is forcing families to live int substandard and overcrowded accommodation, some of which is infested with rats.\n\nThe welfare support limit, which was set in motion back in 2013 by the Tory government but remains in place today under Labour, has been criticised for pressuring families to scrape by on as little as \u00a34 a day per person. A study by the London School of Economics revealed that affected households across various regions are stuck in low-quality, privately rented properties.\n\nCommenting on the findings, University of York's Professor Ruth Patrick, who contributed to the research, stated: \"Any government committed to driving down child poverty and giving children better lives must get rid of the two-child limit and the benefit cap. These two policies symbolise the austerity years and should have no place in a socially just country.\"\n\nAlison Garnham, Chief Exec at the Child Poverty Action Group, argued: \"The government's new child poverty taskforce must make an early commitment to abolishing this cruel policy.

This impacts not only Universal Credit but also a range of other benefits including Child Benefit, Housing Benefit, Jobseeker's Allowance, and various others for those aged 16 or over who have not reached State Pension age such as Bereavement Allowance, Child Tax Credit, Employment and Support Allowance.\n\nThe cap also covers Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance, Maternity Allowance, Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance, and Widowed Parent's Allowance (also applicable to those who were receiving Widowed Mother's Allowance or Widow's Pension before April 9 2001).",

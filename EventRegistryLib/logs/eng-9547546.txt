In his place, it is being reported that Mattias Janmark would start on the left wing with Connor McDavid, but that Janmark may not be a permanent fixture. Connor Brown will see his first action in the playoffs if Henrique can't go and the Oilers will try to fill Henrique's skates by committee.\n\nHenrique has not skated with the team since the end of the series with the Los Angeles Kings and while the extra days off between the two series was expected to be helpful, it's not clear if his ankle issue has had enough time to get better. Few expected this to linger as much as it has and it seems unlikely he will play tomorrow night as the series kicks off in Vancouver.\n\nAccording to reports, including one from Jason Gregor of Sports 1440:\n\n\"Knoblauch said they don't have one guy who can replace Henrique. Will have a few guys take shifts on top line with McDavid and Hyman. Janmark will start there but wants him fresh for PK, so others will get looks. Brown will come in and play on 4th line RW.\n\nAs for why Janmark is getting the first look, Gregor notes it's because the coaching staff likes Janmark's defensive awareness and strong play along the boards. He plays smart away from the puck, but can also keep up with higher-skilled players.\n\nHenrique had a goal and an assist in the Oilers' first game against the Los Angeles Kings but didn't score again in the remaining four meetings.

But it sure seems unlikely Henrique will suit up Wednesday for a few reasons.\n\nHenrique hasn't been skating with the team. Knoblauch said Connor Brown will be inserted into the lineup to make his Oilers playoff debut. And Mattias Janmark was bumped up from the fourth line to Henrique's spot next to Connor McDavid and Zach Hyman for the last two practices.\n\n\"Janmark will definitely be there for some shifts,\" Knoblauch said.\n\nAs Knoblauch stated, Janmark won't be locked into top-line duty.\n\nLeon Draisaitl will be moved there periodically, as he always is, at the very least after penalty kills -- of which Janmark is a part. Dylan Holloway or Warren Foegele, the third and fourth left wingers for now, could get a bump -- especially if the Oilers are trailing.\n\n\"I'm probably going to play with a lot of players throughout the series,\" Janmark said. \"But any time you get a chance to play with players like that, you want to do well and seize the opportunity. This is a chance to do it.\"\n\nThat Janmark's even being considered for that role seems like a puzzling choice given the sheer volume of offensively inclined forwards on the Oilers roster.\n\nTo put it another way, it wouldn't be the least bit surprising if Janmark had been the last choice to be McDavid and Hyman's linemate for any length of time.\n\nHe doesn't drive play. He had four goals and 12 points in 71 games during the regular season. McDavid can put up those numbers in a week.\n\nBut Knoblauch likes the fit because of Janmark's ability to \"make the next play\" with someone of McDavid's calibre and his awareness without the puck.\n\n\"The winger's job is to get the puck in a skilled centreman's hands,\" the coach said. \"That's very crucial. Janny's good at that. That's one part of it.\n\n\"The other part of it is, he is good defensively. He'll be playing a lot of minutes against Vancouver's top-skilled offensive players. Now you've got a defensive player who can help in those situations.\"\n\nSo, to understand or appreciate Janmark's game is like peeling back layers of an onion.\n\nHe'll seldom make you jump out of your seat, but it's the subtle things he does that have always made him a coach's favourite. That goes for teammates, too. Knoblauch described him as someone \"everyone likes to play with.\" Ryan Nugent-Hopkins concurs.\n\n\"Just a great hockey mind,\" the veteran forward said. \"An easy guy to plug into different spots throughout the lineup. Obviously, a lot of skill, a lot of speed, too. A great skater.\n\n\"What makes him so versatile is the way he thinks the game and how good his hockey IQ is.\"\n\nJanmark, 31, wasn't always a defensive specialist.\n\nDrafted in the third round in 2013 by the Detroit Red Wings, Janmark was dealt to the Dallas Stars by his current GM Ken Holland as part of a package for Erik Cole. He became an NHL regular with the Stars in 2015-16 and had 15 goals and 29 points in 73 games.\n\nEven after a devasting knee injury -- Osteochondritis dissecans -- cost him the entire next season, Janmark returned in 2017-18 and had his most productive big-league campaign with 19 goals and 34 points in 81 contests. He might have been the Stars' fourth most important forward.\n\nThe Stars then morphed into more of a defensive team. Janmark was pushed down the lineup as the coaches changed behind the bench -- first from Ken Hitchcock to Jim Montgomery and then from Montgomery to Rick Bowness.\n\n\"You've got to find ways to stick in the lineup,\" Janmark said. \"That's where the defensive side comes in.\"\n\nBy the time Janmark signed with the Oilers in the 2022 offseason, he was entrenched as a depth forward.\n\nFormer Oilers coaches Jay Woodcroft and Dave Manson made him more of a focal point on the penalty kill than he'd ever been in his career. Janmark led Oilers forwards with 1:56 short-handed minutes per game last season. He and Nugent-Hopkins were tied for top spot this season at 1:48.\n\n\"I learned to become more of a defensive player and then you try to have the offensive side,\" Janmark said.\n\nJanmark's offensive totals were impressive last season -- all things considered.\n\nHe didn't play his first game with the Oilers until Nov. 10 because he was shuffled off to AHL Bakersfield for cap reasons. He was recalled only because Evander Kane went on LTIR with that gruesome wrist injury. Janmark recorded 10 goals and 25 points in 66 games. The Oilers re-signed him ahead of free agency last offseason.\n\nHis numbers were down this season, but Janmark chalks that up to fewer chances up the lineup. Part of that can be attributed to Knoblauch preferring the more conventional lineup construction of 12 forwards and six defencemen compared to how often Woodcroft went with the 11-7 scheme. Also, the Oilers were fortunate when it came to man games lost to injuries.\n\n\"But (there was) maybe a little bit more of a set role defensively this year and I've been trying to do that well,\" Janmark said.\n\nThe Oilers were up 2-1 on the scoreboard in the 43 minutes Janmark played at five-on-five in the first round against the Kings. He chipped in with two assists. Janmark was the Oilers' second most-used forward on a penalty kill that went a perfect 12-for-12.\n\nAfter what happened last postseason, he's just pleased to be contributing.\n\nJanmark broke his foot blocking a shot in the first game of the opening round and missed the rest of the series against the Kings. He returned for Game 1 of the second round against Vegas but played just four minutes before he fell awkwardly and hit his head against the boards. He missed two games.\n\nIn Game 5, he took a bad high-sticking penalty while the Oilers were already short-handed. That was the turning point as the Golden Knights scored twice on the power play as part of three goals in a span of 89 seconds.\n\nJanmark skated just 4:54 and 6:18, respectively, in the last two games of the series with the Oilers in chase mode.\n\n\"That playoffs last year was a disappointment -- getting injured two times in not even a period and playing hurt the whole playoffs and not really playing that much,\" he said. \"I didn't get a chance to play my game. You wait the whole year for that time of year, so I'm trying to take advantage this year.\n\n\"This is the time of year where everyone wants to play good. I'm trying to do that.\"\n\nHe has been doing just that in an understated role.\n\nNow, the stage is set for him to do even more next to McDavid and Hyman -- even if it's just for short stints here and there.\n\n\"It's more of a complementary role,\" Janmark said. \"I'll try to help them out, use my smarts out there and play the same way but try to open up some space and let them do their thing.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_nugent_bowman@theathletic.com", "name": "Daniel Nugent-Bowman", "type":

Kris Knoblauch delivers injury update on Oilers center", "body": "In a crucial update ahead of tonight's matchup against the Vancouver Canucks, Edmonton Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch has confirmed that Adam Henrique will be sidelined for Game 1 due to a lower-body injury. The Oilers' struggle to sustain their momentum from the opening round is certainly compounded by the absence of the center.\n\n\"Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch says Adam Henrique out for Game 1, but they are hopeful he can play Friday. Connor Brown draws in,\" Elliotte Friedman shared on X.\n\nThe Oilers express optimism that Henrique could return for Game 2 on Friday as his injury status remains day-to-day. The seasoned forward, who played a pivotal role in Edmonton's first-round victory over the Los Angeles Kings, contributed one goal and one assist across five games.\n\nWith Henrique sidelined, the Oilers will turn to forward Connor Brown to fill the void in the lineup for Game 1. Brown, an experienced player, brings considerable experience despite not having played in a playoff game since 2019 with the Toronto Maple Leafs. During the regular season, the 30-year-old contributed four goals and eight assists in 71 games.\n\nWith Connor Brown joining the lineup, the Oilers aim to sustain their momentum and secure a positive result in Game 1 as they push to advance further in the playoffs.\n\nMattias Janmark was initially considered a choice to fill in for Adam Henrique\n\nThe Edmonton Oilers were facing a challenge with Adam Henrique's suspected lower-body injury, leaving a gap at first-line left wing. Coach Kris Knoblauch knew that there was no clear replacement for Henrique, leading to a \"by committee\" approach to fill the void in Game 1 against the Vancouver Canucks.\n\nKnoblauch was considering Mattias Janmark as a potential candidate for the top-line role. Although Janmark was not the obvious choice, given his defensive-oriented style and modest offensive stats, Knoblauch had faith based on his ability to support players like Connor McDavid and Zach Hyman.\n\n\"The winger's job is to get the puck in a skilled centreman's hands,\" the coach said. \"That's very crucial. Janny's good at that. That's one part of it.\" (Via The Athletic)\n\n\"The other part of it is, he is good defensively. He'll be playing a lot of minutes against Vancouver's top-skilled offensive players,\" Knoblauch added.\n\nJanmark's journey from a depth forward to a key penalty-killer and defensive specialist with the Oilers shows that he is adaptable and could've contributed. However, right now it's more about winning the game, and the coach is not taking any chances.\n\nConnor Brown is set to make his playoff debut in Henrique's place.", "source": {"uri": "sportskeeda.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportskeeda"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhilasha_aditi@sportskeeda.com", "name": "Abhilasha Aditi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Knoblauch", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kris Knoblauch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Henrique", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Henrique"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Brown_(ice_hockey)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Connor Brown (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattias_Janmark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mattias Janmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winger_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winger (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Hyman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zach Hyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2024/05/23058288-1715197014.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547546", "eventUri": "eng-9547546", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

However, game day is finally here again, as the team prepares to face the Vancouver Canucks on Wednesday night, in game one of their second round best-of-seven playoff series.\n\nThere are of course plenty of storylines and factors to consider, in the all-Canadian, Pacific Division matchup which will determine who advances to the Western Conference final. This includes the health of both teams.\n\nStarting with the Oilers, the biggest -- and only -- concerns are the injury situations of both Adam Henrique and Evander Kane, who both missed practice over the weekend and again on Monday. The updates are mixed, ahead of puck drop at 8 p.m. MT at Rogers Arena.\n\nStarting with the negative, Adam Henrique is now doubtful to play in game one, after Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch had previously continually said he would be ready to go. However, even with an extra day to rest and recover, the forward has now been listed as day-to-day.\n\nHenrique has been dealing with an ankle injury, which he suffered during the Oilers' series-clinching 4-3 win over the Los Angeles Kings in round one. Technically Knoblauch has not ruled him out for game one in Vancouver, but the reality is he won't be suiting up on Wednesday night.\n\nOf course the loss of Henrique is a tough blow for the Oilers, with him settling in nicely since he arrived in a trade from the Anaheim Ducks. The question is, who will replace him on the first line alongside Connor McDavid and Zach Hyman?\n\nThe answer is likely Mattias Janmark, with him playing with McDavid and Hyman during practice in the absence of Henrique. Asked about Janmark by the media following practice on Tuesday prior to flying out to Vancouver, Knoblauch said: \"I think Janmark's the guy everyone likes to play with. He's responsible, he can make the next play, (and) he's good with the puck.\n\nAt the same time though, the responsibility won't just fall on Janmark. Knoblauch added: \"I think it will be a little more by committee. Janmark will definitely be there for some shifts, but whoever's playing well, moving up and down (will be in there). Obviously Janmark is a huge part of our penalty kill, we need to make sure he's fresh and ready for that. We've got a lot of guys who we think can move up and play there periodically.\"\n\nOn the more positive side, Kane will be ready to go, after taking part in practice on Tuesday. In the case of him, it has always been more about giving him as much rest as possible, after recently confirming he has been dealing with a sports hernia for the majority of this season.\n\nWhen considering this, it actually makes the 32-year-old's production during the 2023-24 campaign more impressive. He contributed three points during the Kings series and overall played some of his best hockey of the season.\n\nAlso speaking to the media on Tuesday after practice, Kane discussed the value of maintenance days and time off following the conclusion of the Oilers' first round series. He said: \"It was valuable for me. I think the more time we had (between games), it was great for a bunch of guys. At the same time, guys want to get going. I would like to play a few days ago myself, but we'll take the time as it comes and get ready for tomorrow night.\"\n\nDuring practice on Tuesday, Kane played alongside Leon Draisaitl and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins on the second line which, as per The Athletic's Daniel Nugent-Bowman, is the expected lineup for game one. This is something to keep an eye on, just because Kane and Draisaitl have struggled at certain times to build a productive chemistry when playing together this season.\n\nAs for the Canucks, the key absence continues to be Thatcher Demko. He hasn't played, since suffering a knee injury near the conclusion of game one versus the Nashville Predators in the first round.\n\nDon't expect Demko to return any time soon either, with Frank Seravalli of Daily Faceoff advising on Tuesday that the goalie will be out through at least game four. His earliest possible return is game five, but according to Seravalli, even this is pushing it.\n\nIn one respect, to not have a Vezina Trophy finalist between the pipes is a tough blow for the Canucks. At the same time however, coach Rick Tocchet's team has been just fine in goal without him, at least up to this point of the playoffs.\n\nCasey DeSmith is 1-1-0 in two playoff starts, in the process producing a .911 save percentage and 2.02 Goals Against Average (GAA). However, the real story for the Canucks has been the play of Arturs Silovs, who is 2-1-0 in three starts, with a .938 save percentage and 1.70 GAA.\n\nOverall, the Oilers remain favourites to advance despite losing the season series 4-0-0, by virtue of having the better overall roster - injuries or not. However, the Canucks have been underestimated all season long, while continuing to find ways to win when it matters; this should be an extremely interesting and close series between the two Canadian rivals.", "source": {"uri": "oilonwhyte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oil On Whyte"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Henrique", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Henrique"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evander Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vancouver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Division_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Division (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NHL)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NHL)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_Canucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vancouver Canucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoff_format", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoff format"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Blue_Jackets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbus Blue Jackets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogers_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rogers Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forward (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattias_Janmark", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mattias Janmark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Hyman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zach Hyman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Draisaitl", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leon Draisaitl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-handed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Short-handed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaheim_Ducks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anaheim Ducks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatcher_Demko", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thatcher Demko"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Predators", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nashville Predators"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vezina_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vezina Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Nugent-Hopkins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Nugent-Hopkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goals_against_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goals against average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_DeSmith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casey DeSmith"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_6549,h_3683,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/156/01hxan0gd7q13c8jv1fr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9547546", "eventUri": "eng-9547546", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Still, he said there could be some extra rotation in that top-line position as Game 1 progresses, with individual players' roles and responsibilities at different times in the game playing a big part in determining who might slot into that spot at any given moment.\n\nJanmark is a part of the Oilers' perfect 11-for-11 penalty kill in the 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs and could be summoned for defensive responsibilities at different times during the game, with Edmonton being limited as the road team without the last change.\n\nThat will likely result in other forwards like Warren Foegele, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Evander Kane Dylan Holloway and others taking shifts on the top line in a 'revolving door' type of approach to filling Henrique's potential absence.

There's no excuse for giving up a three-goal lead in a game where you've scored four times yourselves.\n\nAt the same time however, it's still just one game. Win on Friday night, and the Oilers will get a crucial 1-1 split on the road and in the process wrestle home-ice advantage from the Canucks.\n\nIn order to win game two, the Oilers need every edge they can get. This includes having Adam Henrique back in the linueup.\n\nHenrique has proven to be an excellent addition since his trade from the Anaheim Ducks (via the Tampa Bay Lightning). He immediately provided a boost in the top six, which continued over into the first round of the playoffs versus the Los Angeles Kings.\n\nUnfortunately for the Oilers, the 34-year-old suffered an ankle injury during the series-clinching 4-3 win over the Kings. To begin with, it was claimed he would be ready to go for the beginning of the second round series against the Canucks.\n\nHowever, even with a week off before playing again it was soon clear something was not quite right, as Henrique continued to be held out of practice. Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch finally admitted on Tuesday that the forward was doubtful to play, before he was officially ruled out a day later prior to game one in Vancouver.\n\nWhile there are no guarantees the presence of Henrique would have changed the outcome of the series opener, it would have at least put the team in a better position. The combination of his experience, high hockey IQ and talent would have proved invaluable in the heat of playoff battle.\n\nOf course, this all leads to the question of when the 2008 third round draft pick will actually return? As per Daniel Nugent-Bowman of The Athletic, he has been listed as day-to-day, which Knoblauch saying he hopes the two-time Memorial Cup winner can play in game two.\n\nThe fact Knoblauch is hoping as opposed to expecting, does not necessarily instil the most confidence in Henrique being ready to go on Friday evening in Vancouver. This is the same type of language Knoblauch used when discussing his player's injury status on Monday in the lead-up to game one.\n\nTo be clear, we appreciate that it is better for the Oilers to be careful with Henrique's situation as opposed to pushing for him top soon.

Obviously, being 0-4 in the series and being outscored as badly as we were, there are some adjustments that we need to make.\"\n\nThe second-round series between the two western Canadian clubs marks the first time they have faced one another in the postseason since 1992.

A really good team,\" Oilers captain Connor McDavid told reporters this morning. \"Defensively, as well. They do a great job of collapsing on their net. They've got big [defencemen] that don't go too far from their own net, and they make it tough to get on the inside.\"\n\nTonight's game will mark the first time the Oilers have played in a week following their 4-1 series win over the LA Kings. It is a long time to have off, but McDavid and company aren't looking for any sort of excuses.\n\n\"A little bit of a strange scenario with a week in between games, but we had a good week of practice,\" McDavid said. \"Guys are rested and ready to go.\"\n\nWith official confirmation that Adam Henrique is out of the lineup tonight due to a lower-body injury, Connor Brown will step in for the first time this postseason.\n\n\"I'm really excited,\" Brown said. \"It's my first time since Toronto getting back in the playoffs. Obviously disappointing sitting out that first round, but watching the way the boys played was inspiring. I'm excited to get out there and do my thing.\"\n\nAs for lines, Mattias Janmark is expected to be promoted to the first line alongside Connor McDavid and Zach Hyman, while Leon Draisaitl will centre the second line with Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Evander Kane.\n\nRyan McLeod is expected to be down the middle on the third line with Corey Perry and Dylan Holloway, while Derek Ryan will centre the fourth line with Brown and Warren Foegele as his wingers.

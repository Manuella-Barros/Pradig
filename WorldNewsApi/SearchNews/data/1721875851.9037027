{"id": 239760794, "title": "P Chidambaram writes: Opposition and opportunity", "text": "The results of the elections to the 18th Lok Sabha threw up a formidable parliamentary Opposition that was missing in the 16th and 17th Lok Sabha. In the previous two elections of 2014 and 2019, the Congress was the main Opposition party with just 44 and 52 seats, respectively, and it could not win the position of the Leader of the Opposition. All other non-BJP parties won fewer seats. The Opposition\u2019s voice was drowned out by the numbers and noise made by the BJP, its pre-election allies and the undeclared allies (YSRCP and BJD). The BJP did not pause to consider how, given the imbalance in the numbers, the hallowed traditions of Parliament could be maintained. As it transpired \u2014 and the Opposition parties repeatedly complained \u2014 the traditions were not observed. According to many impartial observers, the two Houses of Parliament became dysfunctional. The LS elections of 2024 have given an opportunity to both the Treasury and the Opposition to revive the great traditions of Parliament. Not just the form but the substance of a parliamentary democracy. The Opposition is firmly in place with 236 seats. The Opposition should bury the Arun Jaitley thesis that obstruction of the House is a legitimate parliamentary instrument and is in \u2018favour of democracy\u2019. That was a piece of fiction, the opposite is true. Notable Promises The Opposition could begin with the Congress\u2019 Manifesto 2024, Nyay Patra, that contained the following promises: ? We promise that the two Houses of Parliament will each meet for 100 days in a year and the great traditions of Parliament that prevailed in the past will be revived and scrupulously observed. ? We promise that one day in a week will be devoted to discuss the agenda suggested by the Opposition benches in each House. ? We promise that the presiding officers of the two Houses will be required to sever their connection with any political party, remain neutral, and observe the age-old norm that the \u2018Speaker does not speak\u2019. The I.N.D.I.A. bloc may consider adopting these promises and fighting resolutely to fulfill them. The BJP cannot have any valid objection to 100 days of sittings, one day a week for the Opposition\u2019s agenda, and neutral presiding officers. Prevent Defections Mr Narendra Modi and, because of him, the BJP, seem to have overcome the shock of 240 seats against the goal of 370 for the BJP and 400+ for the NDA. They tried to celebrate but the rank of file was in no mood to celebrate. The \u2018minority\u2019 tag will haunt the BJP\u2019s leadership, and they will make every effort to get rid of it. The tempting targets are YSRCP (4 members), AAP (3), RLD (2), JDS (2), AGP (1), AJSU (1), HAM (1) and SKM (1). Not even JDU (12) is safe. Some of these parties are already part of the NDA but that will not deter the BJP (remember what happened to the Shiv Sena). The Tenth Schedule of the Constitution has gaping holes in which MPs of smaller parties can fall and disappear. The Congress\u2019 Manifesto 2024 had an elegant formulation that will forestall BJP\u2019s plan: ? We promise to amend the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution and make defections (leaving the original party on which the MLA or MP was elected) an automatic disqualification of the membership in the Assembly or Parliament. The Opposition must bring an amendment to the Tenth Schedule. The Treasury Benches will be damned in the eyes of the electorate if they oppose the Amendment Bill. Push Jobs Agenda The BJP is most vulnerable on the issue of management of the economy. While none can quarrel with fiscal prudence or infrastructure development, all economic policies must aim to achieve the twin goals of creating millions of jobs and containing inflation. BJP-NDA failed on the two counts and paid the price in the LS elections. Whether the BJP\u2019s leadership will change course will be known in the President\u2019s Speech and in the Budget. Meanwhile, the Congress and the I.N.D.I.A. bloc must press the following jobs agenda (taken from the Congress\u2019 Manifesto 2024): ? We are opposed to monopolies and oligopolies and crony capitalism. ? We will ensure that no company or person arrogates to itself or himself the financial or material resources or the business opportunities or the concessions that ought to be available to every entrepreneur. ? Our policy preference will be in favour of business enterprises that create a large number of jobs. ? Fill the nearly 30 lakh vacancies in sanctioned posts at various levels in the central government\u2026 ? Create a new employment-linked incentive (ELI) Scheme for corporates to win tax credits for additional hiring against regular quality jobs. ? We will launch an urban employment programme guaranteeing work for the urban poor in reconstruction and renewal of urban infrastructure. ? Provide jobs for low-education, low-skilled youth by launching a Water Bodies Restoration Programme and a Wasteland Regeneration Programme that will be implemented through village panchayats and municipalities. The Opposition parties must act as if they were the government. They must seize the opportunity and set the narrative for the government. It will be interesting to see how the short-of-majority BJP responds to the new and energized Opposition.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/opposition-opportunity-lok-sabha-elections-2024-parliament-democracy-chidambaram-9409026/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/EMPL14id.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:30:33", "author": "P Chidambaram", "authors": ["P Chidambaram"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.33}

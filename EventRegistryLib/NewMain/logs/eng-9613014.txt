JOSE JORDAN / AFP\n\nNo club can come close to the Spanish giants' success in the competition and they are strong favourites against a Dortmund side that have beaten the odds just to make it to London.\n\nMadrid's habit of somehow getting over the line when it matters in the Champions League has been exemplified in their run to the final.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti's men withstood a barrage from defending champions Manchester City to win their quarter-final tie on penalties before another legendary late fightback at the Santiago Bernabeu to beat Bayern Munich in the last four.\n\nThe Spanish champions rightly travel to the English capital with confidence as they look to cap a memorable season.\n\nMadrid have lost just twice in 54 games in all competitions, storming to the title in La Liga by 10 points and thrashing Barcelona 4-1 to lift the Spanish Super Cup along the way.\n\n\"I came here because I wanted to win, and to expect it,\" said Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham, who left Dortmund for the Spanish capital 12 months ago.\n\n\"It is a bit greedy almost, but you have to be confident when you're playing with so many great players.\"\n\nBellingham's career path shows the scale of the task awaiting Dortmund.\n\nPlucked from English Championship side Birmingham as a teenager, he was moulded and developed by the German giants before being picked off by Madrid for a transfer fee in excess of 100 million euros ($109 million).\n\nWithout him, Dortmund struggled domestically this season, finishing fifth in the Bundesliga, 27 points adrift of Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nYet, Edin Terzic's men have saved their best for the Champions League stage to reach the final for the third time in the club's history and first since they lost at Wembley to Bayern Munich 11 years ago.\n\nDortmund topped the group of death featuring Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Newcastle.\n\nPSV Eindhoven and Atletico Madrid were then seen off before a heroic defensive display kept out PSG over two legs in the semi-finals.\n\n\"They've prepared their season around the run in the Champions League,\" added Bellingham.\n\n\"They've played amazingly, the character and mentality they've shown in a lot of games. They've had a tough run to the final as well and you have to respect that.\"\n\nAs impressive as keeping out Real-bound Kylian Mbappe was in the last four, Dortmund realise they must go to another level if Madrid are to lose a European final for the first time since 1983.\n\n\"Our goal wasn't to qualify for the final, our goal is to win the Champions League,\" said Dortmund fan turned coach Terzic.\n\n\"And if you want to win the Champions League, you have to beat the champions. Now the absolute champion in the history of soccer and especially in this competition is waiting for us. The ultimate boss.\"\n\nMadrid's rich Champions League tradition means there are also a number of personal feats at stake on Saturday.\n\nAncelotti can extend his record as the only coach to win the European Cup four times.\n\nDani Carvajal, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, in the final club game of his career, could match Madrid legend Paco Gento as the only player to win the competition six times as a player.\n\nUEFA will be hoping the focus is on the protagonists on the field come full-time to ensure their decision to return to Wembley for a major final is not questioned.\n\nThree years ago, the final of Euro 2020 was marred by violence as ticketless fans stormed the stadium doors to gain entry.\n\nUEFA were also forced to apologise to Liverpool fans for the organisation of the 2022 Champions League final in Paris that an independent review found \"almost led to disaster\".\n\nThe English Football Association (FA) have invested \u00a35 million ($6 million) into improving safety and infrastructure at Wembley, which is also set to host the Euro 2028 final.\n\n\"We never foresaw events like that for the Euros final and I'm not sure we will again but we've learned lessons and additional measures have been implemented,\" said the FA's director of tournaments and events Chris Bryant.", "source": {"uri": "vir.com.vn", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vietnam Investment Review -

We preview Saturday's final at Wembley Stadium with our Borussia Dortmund vs Real Madrid prediction and insights.\n\nBorussia Dortmund vs Real Madrid Stats:\n\nReal Madrid are the favourites to win the UEFA Champions League final, with the Opta supercomputer predicting a 55.4% chance of victory in 90 minutes over Borussia Dortmund.\n\nDortmund have only won three of their 14 encounters with Madrid in this competition (D5 L6).\n\nIf they avoid defeat here, Los Blancos will have gone unbeaten across a European Cup/Champions League season for the first time in their history.\n\nMatch Preview\n\nReal Madrid aim to extend their unparalleled record in the UEFA Champions League as they face Borussia Dortmund in Saturday's final.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti's squad, boasting 14 European titles, stands unmatched in the competition's history. Opposing them at Wembley Stadium is Dortmund, appearing in their third Champions League final.\n\nThe Bundesliga side claimed their sole Champions League title in 1996-97, defeating Juventus 3-1. They reached the final again in 2012-13 but lost to Bayern Munich at Wembley.\n\nThis year, Real Madrid edged past Bayern Munich with a 4-3 aggregate win, thanks to Joselu's late brace securing a 2-1 victory in the second leg. A contentious offside call nullified Matthijs de Ligt's potential equalizer, allowing Madrid to advance.\n\nReal Madrid have dominated their matches this season, trailing for only 7.5% of their total game time in the Champions League. They've staged four comeback victories, a feat matched only by Barcelona (1999-2000) and Real Madrid themselves (2016-17).\n\nIn contrast, Dortmund's journey to the final saw their opponents hit the woodwork 12 times, including six in their semi-final against PSG. Edin Terzi\u0107's team reached the final after a 2-0 aggregate win over PSG, with Mats Hummels' decisive header at Parc des Princes.\n\nHummels, who has played every minute of Dortmund's campaign, could become the first outfield player to do so in a winning season since Cristiano Ronaldo in 2017-18. The last defender to achieve this was Sami Hyypi\u00e4 with Liverpool in 2004-05.\n\nDortmund will need to contain Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, who has five goals and four assists in the Champions League this season. Over the past three campaigns, Vin\u00edcius has been involved in more goals (31) than any other player, with 17 contributions in knockout stages.\n\nDortmund will be without S\u00e9bastien Haller, Ramy Benseba\u00efni, and Julien Duranville. Niclas F\u00fcllkrug is expected to lead the attack, supported by Jadon Sancho, Karim Adeyemi, and Julian Brandt.\n\nAncelotti faces a selection dilemma between Thibaut Courtois and Andriy Lunin in goal, with David Alaba and Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni sidelined. Toni Kroos is set to play his final club match, while 20-year-old Jude Bellingham will aim to secure his first Champions League title against his former club.\n\nBorussia Dortmund vs Real Madrid Head-to-Head record\n\nThis will be the 15th meeting between these sides in the Champions League. Madrid have faced Dortmund 14 times, more than any other opponent except Bayern (22) and Juventus (16). Dortmund have only won three of these encounters (D5 L6), with their lowest win percentage against any team they've faced at least five times.\n\nDespite winning their last two league matches, Madrid's focus on the final is evident. They could become the second Spanish side to win the Champions League unbeaten in a single campaign, after Barcelona in 2005-06.\n\nDortmund, finishing fifth in the Bundesliga, are the second-lowest ranked German side to reach a Champions League final, after Bayern Munich in 1974-75.", "source": {"uri": "newsable.asianetnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Asianet News Network Pvt Ltd"},

Reuters\n\nIn a little over 24 hours, Borussia Dortmund will be locking horns with Real Madrid in what arguably is the biggest game in club football and one of the most important fixtures in the sporting world -- the UEFA Champions League final.\n\nA quick comparison between Madrid and Dortmund and their record at the elite continental tournament would make the former solid favourites for another title. Carlo Ancelotti's men had won the tournament as recently as the 2021-22 season, and were in the reckoning for a second on the trot in 2022-23 before getting eliminated by eventual champions Manchester City.\n\nSport, however, doesn't always work that way and there have been plenty of giant-killing acts in the 'Beautiful Game' over the years, and fans of 'Die Schwarzgelben' will be hoping the latest of those occurs on Saturday.\n\nBefore the final gets underway, we take a look at the journey to the final for both teams, their record at the tournament as well as live streaming and other details:\n\nReal Madrid's journey to Champions League final\n\nReal Madrid, who had recently secured the LaLiga title for the 36th time with a 10-point gap at the top, had topped Group C with six wins in as many outings against Napoli, Braga and Union Berlin, along with a healthy Goal Difference of +9.\n\nMadrid defeated RB Leipzig 2-1 on aggregate in the Round of 16 before knocking defending champions Manchester City out on penalties at the latter's home venue after the two sides level on four goals each at the end of the two legs.\n\nAfter City, it was coach Ancelotti's former side Bayern Munich's turn to suffer a knockout punch with a 2-1 loss at the Santiago Bernabeu after a 2-2 draw at Munich's Allianz Arena, reaching the European Cup/ Champions League final for the 18th time in the process.\n\nBorussia Dortmund's journey to Champions League final\n\nBorussia Dortmund too topped their group though they weren't anywhere as dominant as Madrid, winning three and drawing two besides suffering a 2-0 away defeat the hands of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG).\n\nIn what was one of the most closely-fought groups in the league, Dortmund managed to advance to the knockouts with 11 points, three more than PSG and AC Milan who were locked on 8 points each and Newcastle United, who finished fourth with five points.\n\nThe Edin Terzi\u0107-coached side defeated PSV Eindhoven 3-1 on aggreggate in the Round of 16, and were on the verge of bowing out of the competition after suffering a 2-1 loss against Atletico Madrid away from home before bouncing back in style with a 4-2 victory that helped them edge narrowly ahead of the Spanish side, finishing 5-4 on aggregate.\n\nDortmund would then knock PSG out with a 1-0 victory in both legs in the semi-final to enter the Champions League final after more than a decade -- and for only the second time overall.\n\nMadrid vs Dortmund head-to-head record\n\nMadrid and Dortmund have faced each other 14 times till date, with the current LaLiga champions winning five times and holding the Germans to a draw on five occasions. Dortmund have beaten Madrid thrice, the last of which was a 4-1 victory at home during the 2012-13 Champions League semi-finals.\n\nAlso Read | Bellingham vs Can and other key battles that could determine Champions League final\n\nHowever, there hardly is a comparison between the two when it comes to their European Cup/Champions League record. Dortmund have reached the UCL final just twice -- beating Juventus in the final in 1997 and before losing against fellow Germans Bayern Munich in the summit clash in 2013.\n\nMadrid, in comparison, have won the tournament a whopping 14 times in 17 appearances in the final -- twice the number of titles as AC Milan (7), the team that's second on Champions League title count. That includes four titles in a span of five editions between 2013-14 and 2017-18.\n\nWhen and where will the 2023-24 UEFA Champions League final take place?\n\nThe 2023-24 UEFA Champions League final will take place at London's Wembley Stadium on Saturday, 1 June (2nd June in India)\n\nWhat time will the 2023-24 UEFA Champions League final kick off?\n\nThe match will kick off at 12.30 am Indian Standard Time (8 pm British Summer Time).\n\nWhere can I watch live coverage of the 2023-24 UEFA Champions League final?\n\nThe Real Madrid vs Borussia Dortmund Champions League final will be telecast on the Sony Sports Network (Sony Ten 2 and Ten 2 HD). For those who don't have access to cable television, you can tune into the live stream on the SonyLIV app.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_UEFA_Champions_League_final", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2021 UEFA Champions League final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1._FC_Union_Berlin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1.

They've had a tough run to the final as well and you have to respect that.\"\n\nAs impressive as keeping out Real-bound Kylian Mbappe was in the last four, Dortmund realize they must go to another level if Madrid are to lose a European final for the first time since 1983.\n\n\"Our goal wasn't to qualify for the final, our goal is to win the Champions League,\" said Dortmund fan turned coach Terzic.\n\n\"And if you want to win the Champions League, you have to beat the champions. Now the absolute champion in the history of soccer and especially in this competition is waiting for us. The ultimate boss.\"\n\nMadrid's rich Champions League tradition means there are also a number of personal feats at stake on Saturday.\n\nAncelotti can extend his record as the only coach to win the European Cup four times.\n\nDani Carvajal, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, in the final club game of his career, could match Madrid legend Paco Gento as the only player to win the competition six times as a player.\n\nUEFA will be hoping the focus is on the protagonists on the field come full-time to ensure their decision to return to Wembley for a major final is not questioned.\n\nThree years ago, the final of Euro 2020 was marred by violence as ticketless fans stormed the stadium doors to gain entry.\n\nUEFA were also forced to apologize to Liverpool fans for the organization of the 2022 Champions League final in Paris that an independent review found \"almost led to disaster.\"\n\nThe English Football Association (FA) have invested \u00a35 million ($6 million) into improving safety and infrastructure at Wembley, which is also set to host the Euro 2028 final.\n\n\"We never foresaw events like that for the Euros final and I'm not sure we will again but we've learned lessons and additional measures have been implemented,\" said the FA's director of tournaments and events Chris Bryant.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors":

A trophy on Saturday would mark a sixth Champions League title in an 11-year stretch for Real Madrid, and the 15th overall for the club.\n\nGiven that Los Blancos have added a wealth of young talent to the club and are set to sign arguably the best player in the world, Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, in the summer, Real Madrid is well positioned to remain at the top of European football for years to come. While this was supposed to be a transition year for Borussia Dortmund after selling top stars Erling Haaland and Jude Bellingham in consecutive summers, Dortmund made a remarkable run in the competition to reach the final despite only finishing fifth in the domestic German league.\n\nTo preview the Champions League final, I compiled 17 things you need to know before the match kicks off at Wembley Stadium.\n\n1. There are 23 clubs that have won the UEFA Champions League/European Cup, and only 13 have won the competition multiple times. Borussia Dortmund could become the 14th to hoist the trophy for at least a second time.\n\nDortmund last won the Champions League in 1996-97, beating Italian giants Juventus 3-1 in the final. Dortmund's only other appearance in the title match was in 2013, when fellow German side Bayern Munich beat them 2-1. Bayern (six) is the only German team to win the competition multiple times.\n\n2. Borussia Dortmund entered the group stage with the lowest odds of advancing to the knockout stage in their group after being placed in the \"Group of Death\" with Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan, and Newcastle United. Dortmund went on to win the group (14.5 percent implied probability at the start of the tournament) while conceding only four goals (more on that later), beating Newcastle twice in consecutive matches and taking four out of six possible points against Milan. Dortmund was also a solid underdog in its Champions League quarterfinal against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (40 percent market implied) and in its semifinal against PSG (32 percent).\n\n3. There are only two players from that 2013 Dortmund Champions League final team still with the club today, and only one player who has stayed with Dortmund entirely through the last 11 years. That player is Marco Reus, and Saturday will be his final match before he leaves the club in the summer. Reus scored an incredible free kick goal in his final home match two weeks ago.\n\nThe 35-year-old midfielder may or may not start in Saturday's final, but he'll be one of the first names manager Edin Terzi\u0107 turns to off the bench if Dortmund needs a second-half difference maker. Reus has played in 428 matches for the club and tallied 170 goals and 131 assists. While Reus never managed to get Dortmund over the top for a Bundesliga title in his time there, Dortmund won the DFB-Pokal -- Germany's domestic knockout tournament -- in 2017 and 2021.\n\nThe other player that was part of that 2013 Dortmund team is center back Mats Hummels, who spent nine seasons at Dortmund (2008-2016) before transferring to Bayern Munich, then switching back to Dortmund in 2019. Hummels has been a key player throughout this Champions League run, scoring in the semifinal against PSG, and will likely start in the final on Saturday.\n\n4. Reus isn't the only club legend playing his final match for his team on Saturday. Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos received his sendoff at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u last week, and now will play his final match for Los Blancos in the Champions League final. Kroos is set to retire from the sport following this summer's Euro 2024, where his home country of Germany will host the tournament. But first, in London, Kroos is likely to start at the base of midfield for Real Madrid before being replaced in the second half by fellow aging star Luka Modric.\n\nKroos has played 10 full seasons at Real Madrid and his partnership with Casemiro and Modric formed what many consider to be one of the best midfield groups of all time. During their spell together, Real Madrid won the Champions League three consecutive times from 2016-18.\n\n5. If Dortmund is going to win this match, it's going to need to rely on red-hot goalkeeper Gregor Kobel. The Swiss international ranked second out of 33 goalkeepers in the Bundesliga in goals saved over expected this season. He helped cover for a Dortmund defense that has been average by underlying metrics for most of the year. (More on this in a bit.)\n\nKobel is estimated to have prevented about 3.8 goals over the course of the season in domestic play. His Champions League performances have been even better. Kobel has a plus-6 post-shot expected goal difference in 12 CL matches, which means he's saving around a half goal per match on average with his pure shot-stopping ability.\n\n6. Dortmund has needed Kobel because the team's defensive metrics have been mediocre all season. The German side conceded 52 expected goals in 34 league matches, which ranked ninth in the 18-team Bundesliga. Dortmund was eighth in shots allowed, 12th in average shot distance conceded, and ninth in touches allowed in their own penalty area. BVB did allow the fourth lowest pass completion rate in Germany because of their pressing intensity, but their inability to stop the ball in transition led to consistent defensive breakdowns. Their defensive issues were further exposed in the Champions League, too, which makes this run to the final all the more improbable.\n\nDortmund only allowed nine goals in 12 CL matches, but that came from 22.2 expected goals. They lost or tied the xG battle in 10 of their 12 matches, with the lone xG victories coming in the group stage against Newcastle. It's the beauty of the knockout format that has allowed Dortmund to make it this far, but there's a reason betting markets have Real Madrid around 76 percent probability to lift the trophy on Saturday.\n\n7. While Kobel is the unquestioned no.1 goalkeeper for Borussia Dortmund, there is a very difficult decision for manager Carlo Ancelotti to make for Real Madrid. Ancelotti has claimed in the past that starting goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois is the best in the world, and he's back to near full fitness after major knee injuries cost him most of his season. In a vacuum, a fit and healthy Courtois would be the clear selection in goal for Los Blancos. Courtois's incredible shot-stopping performance in the 2022 Champions League final against Liverpool is pretty much the only reason they beat a superior side that day in Paris.\n\nNevertheless, Courtois is coming off of a serious injury, and backup Andriy Lunin has been excellent in his place. Lunin made numerous saves against both RB Leipzig and Manchester City to help propel Madrid through the knockout stage, including a penalty shootout victory against City, the defending champions.\n\nBecause Courtois did at least start four of the final five matches of the La Liga season, I fully expect Courtois to be in goal when the lineup is released on Saturday. In four matches, he made 15 saves, conceded zero goals, and saved about 3.1 goals over expected.\n\n8. Set pieces were another major issue for Terzic's defense this season. Dortmund allowed the fifth-most expected goals off of set pieces in the Bundesliga and finished fifth in the league table. The only four teams who conceded more chances from set plays finished 14th, 16th, 17th, and 18th. The last two were relegated to the second division. As much as Kobel was an elite shot stopper this season, one of his primary weaknesses was defending crosses. He ranks in just the 5th percentile in crosses claimed in the last calendar year. Real Madrid finished the La Liga season 11th in xG created from set plays and just eighth in goals scored, so it's not a primary method of attack for the Spanish side. Even still, Dortmund's vulnerability there is the kind of weakness that often decides finals and high-profile matches.\n\n9. As much as defensive set pieces were a liability for Dortmund, attacking ones were a major advantage given Dortmund's size in the air. First choice striker Niclas Fullkrug, center backs Mats Hummels and Nico Schlotterbeck, and defensive midfielder Emre Can all contributed to BVB creating the most set piece expected goals in the entire Bundesliga. As much as Dortmund is likely to concede from a dead-ball situation, the attack produced 0.49 expected goals per match from set plays alone. The problem for Dortmund is Real Madrid's set piece defense. Madrid allowed just two league goals all season from set plays, the fewest in Europe's top five leagues.\n\n10. There were a couple notable exceptions -- like Real Madrid's recent 4-4 draw against Villarreal in a dead rubber -- but Madrid really improved defensively in the second half of the season. Madrid conceded 1.07 xG per 90 minutes between the start of the league year in August and January 1. From January 1 to May 1, which doesn't include end-of-season matches after which the league was already clinched, Madrid's defense conceded just 0.77 xG per 90 minutes. That's not quite Arsenal or Inter Milan level, but Real Madrid had one of the best defenses in Europe.\n\nWhen Real Madrid made its miraculous run through the Champions League in 2022 with dramatic upsets and comebacks, it was the product of the team overcoming a relatively mediocre defense. While it hasn't always been elite this year, the second-half improvements and management of a midseason center back injury crisis gave Madrid a more solid defensive foundation. Even though the club did need two late goals to come back and beat Bayern in the semifinal, it's also true that Bayern produced just 1.25 non-penalty expected goals across two legs.\n\n11. Real Madrid's out-of-possession tactics are different from most of the top superteams in Europe in that they don't constrict passing and possession of their opponents nearly as much as the elites. While Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester City, Barcelona, and Bayern all try to press high up the pitch and force mistakes, Ancelotti's side has the joint highest pass completion rate (82.2 percent) allowed in La Liga this year.\n\nOnly Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, a team that famously sits deep in its defensive third of the pitch, allowed an equal percentage of passes completed. Real Madrid is elite in transition when it wants to be, but it's not because Los Blancos force a ton of high turnovers. Madrid is eighth in passes per defensive action in La Liga, a measure of pressing intensity. They are considerably lower than Barcelona and Real Sociedad, who press the ball at almost every opportunity. As a result, Real Madrid is fourth in high turnovers forced, and significantly behind fellow top-five teams Athletic Club and Barcelona. I wouldn't expect Real Madrid to dominate possession in this match, especially with them being so comfortable defending without the ball. Even despite the lack of pressing, Real Madrid allowed the second fewest touches in its own penalty area in La Liga this year.\n\n12. Real Madrid bought Jude Bellingham from Dortmund for 103 million Euros last summer, and even the most optimistic Bellingham and Madrid fans couldn't have predicted this level of goal output from the young English superstar. Bellingham is just 20 years old, and many players usually see their goal production and creative output decline when leaving the Bundesliga due to the league's unique high-scoring nature and traditionally open play. Bellingham's first season in Madrid was the opposite. Only two players in Spain -- Girona's Artem Dovbyk and Villarreal's Alexander Sorloth, both strikers -- scored more goals than the midfielder in league play.\n\nMadrid was left without a true reliable striker after the sale of Karim Benzema to Saudi Arabia last summer, but the front three of Bellingham, Rodrygo, and Vinicius Junior proved to be more than enough offense. (Joselu and Brahim Diaz also combined for 18 league goals).\n\nBellingham went from an excellent all-around midfielder at 19 to potential Ballon d'Or winner at 20. He'll be 21 during the Euros this summer. The Euros and Saturday's final will matter for his Ballon d'Or case, but Bellingham already has four goals and four assists in 10 CL matches to add onto 19 league goals as a midfielder who only took one penalty for the club this year. He was Dortmund's best player last year, and now he's the best player in this Champions League final.\n\n13. The loss of Benzema also meant that Real Madrid would be dangerously low on shot volume unless Vinicius Junior took another leap forward in his production. The 2021-22 season had been a breakout campaign for Vinicius, who scored the game-winning goal in Real Madrid's 1-0 upset of Liverpool in Paris. But he took a bit of a step back last year in overall production -- as did Real Madrid as a whole -- only for him to reach new heights this year in his age-23 season.\n\nVinicius Junior had marginally fewer winger responsibilities and focused more of his production toward being a goalscorer. His xA per 90, dribbles, and carries into the penalty area remained at previously elite levels while his shots and goals took a leap.\n\nDortmund has some recent experience in dealing with explosive wide forwards who can wreck games with their pace and dribbling ability. Dortmund did a solid job containing Mbapp\u00e9 in the semifinals, and Vinicius Junior is the closest player in the sport to Mbapp\u00e9's skill set right now.\n\n14. Borussia Dortmund made two key loan additions in the January transfer window, and both have walked right into the first team. Ian Maatsen and Jadon Sancho weren't getting any playing time at Chelsea and Manchester United, respectively, and Dortmund pounced like the well-run club they are to get these talented players for basically nothing. Sancho had already made his name at Dortmund -- he and Haaland used to wreck Bundesliga defenses for fun -- and Maatsen found himself as an odd man out after a Chelsea transfer splurge last summer. Maatsen's defensive and pressing energy has helped Dortmund more frequently win the ball in midfield and has contributed to a marginally better defense, albeit still one with flaws, as previously noted.\n\nSancho has not found the consistent shot and goal output since returning to Dortmund, but he's been immensely valuable as a ball carrier and wide ball progression engine. Sancho scored a key goal at home against PSV in the second leg of the Round of 16, and he was Dortmund's clear best player in the first leg at home in the semifinal win against PSG. Sancho is passing the ball into the penalty area more than twice per match in all competitions since rejoining the club in January. Maatsen is combining for more than three tackles + interceptions per match, and his ability to defend is a considerable improvement over the previous left back situation.\n\n15. While Dortmund was comfortably the fifth-best team in Germany this season, the trendline was clearly trending up as the season progressed. Dortmund finished the first 17 matches of the Bundesliga season with a minus-0.02 xG difference per match. Opponents were creating more quality chances per match than Dortmund did, which is alarming for the usually elite German team. That would be their worst mark since at least 2017 -- the furthest back I could find Bundesliga xG data. The defense was allowing 1.81 xGA per match and that matches up with their Champions League defensive performances. Dortmund regularly conceded at least two xG to every quality team they played.\n\nSancho and Maatsen have played some role in the improvements as Dortmund's second half has been plus-0.66 xG per 90. The defense went from a legitimate below average team to a barely above average one. You can't just ignore half of a season's worth of data, but it's worth noting even a plus-0.66 xG difference is below the standard set by previous good Dortmund teams that challenged for league titles.\n\n16. Real Madrid's ability to play without the ball and successfully exploit teams in transition has made them a monster with a lead in recent history. I don't have Champions League data for specific game states, but the La Liga data from 2023-24 paints a clear picture.\n\nWhat does this data tell us? The score of the match is hugely important in soccer. Real Madrid produces a ton of chances when trailing and they have to take huge risks to come back into games. Most teams park the bus and defend for their lives when leading against a team of Real Madrid's caliber, and most elite teams produce huge xG totals when trailing.\n\nThe amazing piece in the data is that Real Madrid actually produces more chances per minute when leading then when trailing, and way more than when tied. Madrid is most average in neutral game states and most dominant when already playing with the lead. If Real Madrid goes up early, and Dortmund has to take more risks, that will play right into the strengths of Ancelotti's side.\n\n17. We've seen this kind of David vs. Goliath matchup in the Champions League final before. Inter Milan was an even bigger underdog in the betting markets last year and still outplayed Manchester City for a lot of that match. Spurs rode a similarly incredible wave to the 2019 Champions League final before an early penalty doomed them against Liverpool. Chelsea famously won this title in 2012 despite not finishing in the top four in England. Atl\u00e9tico Madrid came within minutes and a penalty shootout of beating city rivals Real Madrid twice in three years in the mid-2010s.\n\nThe Analyst's power rankings, powered by Opta, have Real Madrid as the second-best club team in the world. They have Dortmund ranked 11th -- betting markets would have them even lower.\n\nBorussia Dortmund would be the unlikeliest champion since that Chelsea team, and maybe even longer. If not for the Champions League expansion next year, this match would be Dortmund's only way of qualifying for next year's competition, further adding onto the Chelsea comparisons. If Kobel has one more masterclass performance left in him, then Terzic and Dortmund could well lift the trophy in London to avenge the 2013 loss to Bayern in the same stadium. More likely than not, though, the most successful club in European history will further add to its trophy case and prepare to add the world's best player right afterward.", "source": {"uri": "theringer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Ringer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thibaut_Courtois", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thibaut Courtois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mats_Hummels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mats Hummels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Reus", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco Reus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Both teams have bested some of the finest European teams to reach the showpiece event.\n\nEdin Tarzic's Dortmund topped arguably the toughest group in the 2023-24 UEFA Champions League season -- featuring Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), AC Milan, and Newcastle United -- to set up the Round-of-16 clash with Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven. They claimed a fairly straightforward 3-1 aggregate win and moved to the quarter-finals, where they faced Diego Simeone's gritty Atletico Madrid. Los Rojiblancos beat Dortmund 2-1 in the first leg but fell to a 4-2 defeat in Borussia Dortmund's backyard. In the semi-finals, Dortmund overcame PSG once more, bagging a 2-0 aggregate victory.\n\nReal Madrid, on the other hand, topped with their group in style, doing the double over Union Berlin, Napoli, and Braga. In the Round of 16, Los Blancos secured a 2-1 aggregate win over RB Leipzig, setting up a mouth-watering quarter-final with reigning champions Manchester City. The two teams were tied at 4-4 at the end of extra time in the second leg, leading to a nail-biting penalty shootout. Madrid, thanks to their unwavering confidence, came out on top, securing a 4-3 shootout win.\n\nFinally, in the semi-finals, they crossed paths with familiar foes Bayern Munich. After holding them to a 2-2 draw at the Allianz Arena, Madrid beat them 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu.\n\nNow, it all boils down to the showdown at Wembley Stadium, and it is almost impossible to predict which way this one will go. Yet, under no duress, we will stick our neck out and make five bold predictions for the UEFA Champions League final. Let's begin!\n\nThe final on Saturday will feature some of the most creative players on the planet, but we believe, Borussia Dortmund's Julian Brandt will outshine them all. The attacking midfielder is an excellent passer, can slide into little pockets of space, and rarely makes a mistake in the final third. In the 2023-24 Bundesliga season, Brandt completed 133 shot-creating actions. He also registered 74 progressive carries and played 116 progressive passes. His initiative helped him snag seven goals and 11 assists in 32 games.\n\nHe has also proven his mettle in the UEFA Champions League this season, recording two goals, two assists, 44 shot-creating actions, and three goal-creating actions in 11 outings.\n\nArguably the best winger in the world, Vinicius Jr. has been enjoying his best-ever season in 2023-24. The Real Madrid superstar has scored an impressive 23 times and claimed 11 assists in only 38 matches, helping his team to the La Liga title, the Supercopa de Espana trophy, and, of course, to the final of the UEFA Champions League.\n\nLike Brandt, Vinicius also likes to take initiative. He always tries to take defenders on, go on a vertical charge, and make himself useful in the final third. His best performance of the season came in the UEFA Champions League semi-final first leg against Bayern Munich, where he scored a brace to restrict the Bavarians to a 2-2 draw.\n\nHis first goal, which came in the 24th minute, showed the world his technical ability. The way he engineered space to allow Toni Kroos to play a defense-splitting through-ball was a thing of beauty. Vinicius Jr. does not need a second invitation to punish opponents, and we feel Dortmund will feel his wrath the first time they fail to mark him.\n\nVinicius Jr. and Co. will certainly keep Gregor Kobel on his toes, but we believe Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois will have a busier night.\n\nWith Eder Militao still finding his feet and first-choice holding midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni out with a foot injury, Los Blancos will not be at their best in defense. This should allow Borussia Dortmund to be more adventurous and take the fight to the 14-time European champions.\n\nCourtois is excellent at organizing his back line, but even then, we see him rushing into action at least four or five times over the course of the 90. Carlo Ancelotti will hope his goalkeeper has not lost his sharpness after spending 90% of the season on the treatment table (ACL).\n\nThe UEFA Champions League final will be an emotional event for Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham. Not only will he play his first-ever Champions League final, but he will also do it against his former club Borussia Dortmund at the iconic Wembley Stadium -- the England national team's official stomping ground. Bellingham will give everything in his power to deliver the performance of his lifetime, and we are backing him to succeed.\n\nBellingham has enjoyed a sensational debut campaign at Real Madrid. Since his switch from Dortmund in July 2023, Bellingham has played 41 games across tournaments, bagging 23 goals and 12 assists. The 20-year-old had a quiet semi-final by his lofty standards, but we expect him to be back to his very best for the final game of the 2023-24 season.\n\nReal Madrid and Borussia Dortmund have done superbly to book a place in the UEFA Champions League final. Both deserve to take the European crown home, but, unfortunately, only one team can. After careful consideration, we have decided to give the edge to Real Madrid, thanks to their head-to-head record with Dortmund and unbelievable Champions League pedigree.\n\nMadrid and Dortmund have crossed paths 14 times in the UEFA Champions League so far. The Spaniards have won six times, the Germans three times, and five games have ended all square. Their last UEFA Champions League meeting came around seven years ago. Los Merengues did the double over Dortmund in the group stage of the 2017-18 season, beating them 3-1 and 3-2 respectively. Madrid are also unbeaten in the UCL finals since the tournament got a facelift in 1992, winning the competition eight times.\n\nBorussia Dortmund will do everything in their power to soil Real Madrid's 100% record, but we do not expect them to be successful. We predict the European giants will beat Die Borussen 2-1 at Wembley Stadium to claim their record-extending 15th Champions League trophy.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sushan_chakraborty@sportslens.com", "name": "Sushan Chakraborty", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Brandt", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julian Brandt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1._FC_Union_Berlin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1.

The Germans recovered from a 1-0 opening defeat in Paris to top the group with flying colours, recording three wins and two defeats thereafter, and finishing three points clear of French and Italian giants, PSG and Milan.\n\nPSV Eindhoven of the Netherlands were swept aside in the round of 16 but another Madrid club awaited Dortmund in the quarterfinals where Atletico claimed a 1-0 lead after the first leg in Spain. A 4-2 win at Signal Iduna Park ushered the home side into the last four.\n\nPSG would await Dortmund once again in the semifinals and, even after their display in the group, the French champions were the favourites one again but 1-0 wins in each leghttps://kmaupdates.com/?p=67900&preview=true saw the Parisians' European dreams end yet again.\n\nMadrid, who last lifted the Champions League trophy two seasons ago, stormed to the top of their group with a maximum 18 points beating Italian champions Napoli into second while Sporting Braga and Union Berlin were eliminated.\n\nThe knockout stages provided far sterner tests with Leipzig, Manchester City and Bayern Munich all pushing Madrid to the brink, the latter two requiring penalties and a last-minute turnaround respectively to progress.\n\nFor Dortmund, their task is not only to take down the latest crop of Galacticos on a relentless road to the final but also, arguably, the competition's greatest manager. Carlo Ancelotti has won six of his seven appearances in Champions League finals.\n\nThe 64-year-old Italian has won a record four titles as a coach and two as a player but will not be taking this game, or the latest shot at extending his own record haul, lightly.\n\n\"It's the same as it was the first time,\" Ancelotti said. \"First there is the joy of being here, then the concerns will come and the fear will come. The cold sweat will arrive Saturday afternoon, it's normal, I'm already prepared for it.\n\n\"[But] this team gives me a lot of confidence, I see them focused on the match, they are in Champions [League] mode.\"\n\nAncelotti guided Madrid to the Champions League trophy in 2014 and 2022 and having previously won the competition as a player and manager with AC Milan.\n\nIn the other dugout, Edin Terzic who, at 41 years of age, is at the other end of his managerial career. Indeed in 2013, when Dortmund won their only European crown, Terzic was a fan in the stands and only beginning to forge his way as a coach having never played professionally.\n\n\"We have our own story,\" Terzic said of Dortmund's challenge, much as his own, in facing proven European winners. \"We have the story of ups and downs of the last years. We are a team that builds up to compete every year, but now we are there and we are facing teams that are built to win the Champions League.\"\n\nOutside Germany, a lot of fans believe Dortmund is a middling club but in reality, they are the closest challengers to German powerhouse Bayern Munich.\n\nLast season, they only needed to beat Mainz to claim the Bundesliga title. A 2-2 draw saw Bayern skip ahead to lift the trophy on the final day.\n\nTheir league campaign this season has been underwhelming with Bayer Leverkusen upsetting both Munich and Dortmund to claim the title by 17 points from Stuttgart while last season's top two finished third and fifth respectively.\n\nOnly Nurnburg, whose last of their nine titles came in 1969, better Dortmund's challenge of eight crowns to Munich's 33 titles in Germany. Dortmund's last Bundesliga came in 2011-12 when they completed back-to-back titles for the second time in their history. Indeed, Dortmund were runners-up in four of the five seasons prior to this campaign's drop-off.\n\nFinancially Bayern's value is more than double that of Dortmund ($465m), who have slipped to fourth on the German financial list. It's not bad for a club whose city is the seventh largest in Germany - yet the club have the country's second-largest fan membership.\n\nMadrid's financial value, meantime, has risen to more than a billion dollars with the Spaniards at the top of the globe's football-rich list.\n\n\"For me they're the biggest club in the world, I've always wanted to play against Real,\" Borussia Dortmund defender Nico Schlotterbeck said ahead of the final.\n\n\"But we shouldn't be afraid, we shouldn't be in awe.\n\n\"It has to be a completely normal game for us. We were often the underdogs in the Champions League this season, and that has suited us quite well.\"\n\nSchlotterbeck, 24, is part of a formidable pairing in the centre of defence with 35-year-old Mats Hummels, who won the Player of the Match award in both legs of the semifinal against PSG. It is a solid foundation upon which Dortmund can build and free them to focus on their own game against Real.\n\n\"For us, it means getting into our game quickly, moving the ball quickly, and imposing our game on Real Madrid a bit,\" Schlotterbeck said.\n\n\"If we can do that, then I'm optimistic that we can make it.\"\n\nHummels was part of the 2013 side, along with the soon-to-depart club legend Marco Reus, that helped Dortmund to their last Champions League final only to be defeated by a last-minute Arjen Robben goal for Bayern Munich. A game that was also played at Wembley Stadium.\n\nThis current run has seen Dortmund keep clean sheets in six of their last 11 Champions League games. Madrid, however, have only lost one of their last 20 UEFA competition matches against German teams, winning 13.\n\nA strong season for the Germans ended last year with a heavy thump, a more difficult campaign this time around could be about to end with a high experienced only once before.\n\n\"Perhaps we thought too much about it [the league] back then. But we know what happens here in the city when we win a title and what it means to people,\" Schlotterbeck added.\n\n\"Last season we had something to lose against Mainz, now we have something to win.\n\n\"We have to seize this opportunity.\"\n\nReal Madrid are boosted by the return of Thibaut Courtois in goal. The Belgium international has played only four times this season and has not featured in the Champions League.\n\nHis stand-in during that period, Andriy Lunin, missed the flight to London with flu but is expected to link up with the squad ahead of the game. David Alaba is absent through injury while fellow defender Eder Militao is struggling to prove his fitness after a long layoff.\n\nSebastien Haller is Dortmund's only doubt as the Ivorian striker struggles to regain full fitness following an ankle problem. Julien Duranville and Ramy Bensebaini are both definitely out.\n\nBorussia Dortmund: Kobel, Ryerson, Hummels, Schlotterbeck, Maatsen, Can, Sabitzer, Adeyemi, Brandt, Sancho, Fullkrug\n\nReal Madrid: Courtois, Carvajal, Nacho, Rudiger, Mendy, Valverde, Kroos, Camavinga, Bellingham, Rodrygo, Vinicius Junior", "source": {"uri": "kmaupdates.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "kmaupdates.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Dortmund, with just three wins out of 14 encounters against the formidable Spanish side, will aim to defy the odds. Real Madrid, boasting a rich history in European finals, will seek to secure their 15th title and reaffirm their dominance on the grand stage.

With an eye towards winning their second-ever crown in the competition, the German squad is scheduled to play the Spanish giants at Wembley. Terzic forcefully addressed Los Blancos with a clear message in a self-assured interview with Sky Germany, expressing his will and motivating his team:\n\n\"The absolute final boss is waiting. We're breaking everything down to this one game. In a game, anything is possible. If anyone has shown that, it's us. It's time for this series (of Real Madrid), eight games, eight wins in finals, to end.\"\n\nAlso Read: Chhangte 'ready' to step up as next No. 9 in post Chhetri era\n\nDortmund only ever won the UEFA Champions League once, in 1997, and they made their final appearance in 2012 at Wembley against Bayern Munich.

However, their quest for another triumph faces a challenge from Dortmund, who are entering their third final appearance in this competition.\n\nDortmund secured their sole Champions League title in the 1996-97 season by defeating Juventus 3-1 in the final, marking a significant achievement in their history. Their journey to glory was temporarily halted in the 2012-13 final against Bayern Munich at Wembley.\n\nThis season, the possibility of an all-German final loomed large until Real Madrid thwarted Thomas Tuchel's Bayern side with a 4-3 aggregate victory, clinched by Joselu's late brace securing a 2-1 win in the second leg. However, controversy surrounded their semi-final triumph, as Matthijs de Ligt's crucial equalizer was disallowed due to an overly zealous offside decision.\n\nThe champions of La Liga remain unfazed by the contentious officiating error, as they gear up for their 18th appearance in UEFA's premier club tournament final. Their remarkable track record of 17 previous showpiece appearances already stands as the most in the history of the competition.\n\nWhile Tuchel may express frustration over the late-game decision in the Spanish capital, Madrid asserts their rightful claim to their place in one of Europe's grandest stages. Ancelotti's squad has trailed for only 7.5% of their total game time in this season's Champions League (90 minutes out of 1,200), the lowest among all competing teams.\n\nMoreover, Madrid has showcased resilience by mounting comebacks to secure victory in four matches during this campaign. Only Barcelona in 1999-2000 and Real Madrid themselves in 2016-17 have achieved more comeback wins in a single Champions League season (five each).\n\nIn a sharp contrast, Dortmund may perceive their journey to this stage as somewhat fortuitous, especially considering the numerous times their opponents hit the woodwork in the Champions League this season. This includes six instances during the two-legged semi-final encounter with Paris Saint-Germain, totaling 12 times overall -- a record for the most woodwork hits by a team in a single campaign since 2003-04.\n\nUnder Edin Terzi\u0107's guidance, Dortmund advanced to the brink of European glory following a 2-0 aggregate triumph over PSG. Their victory included a 1-0 win in the second leg, where Mats Hummels' decisive header at Parc des Princes made the pivotal difference.\n\nNotably, Hummels, Dortmund's hero in the second leg, has not missed a single minute of action in the Champions League this season. Should he maintain this feat, he could become the first outfield player since Cristiano Ronaldo in 2017-18 to play every minute of a winning season, while the last central defender to achieve this was Sami Hyypi\u00e4 in 2004-05 with Liverpool.\n\nPutting individual records aside, Hummels and the rest of the defense will be hoping they can contain Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior effectively. The Brazilian forward has contributed significantly with five goals and four assists in the Champions League this season, building on his impressive tally of seven goals and five assists in the previous 2022-23 campaign.\n\nIt's worth noting that only one player in the history of the competition has achieved the feat of registering 5+ goals and 5+ assists in consecutive seasons. Lu\u00eds Figo accomplished this remarkable feat in 1999-00 for Barcelona (5 goals, 9 assists) and then in 2000-01 for Real Madrid (5 goals, 7 assists).\n\nOver the last three UEFA Champions League campaigns, Vin\u00edcius has emerged as the most prolific player in terms of direct goal involvement, contributing to a total of 31 goals (16 goals, 15 assists). Particularly concerning for Dortmund, 17 of these contributions have occurred during the knockout stages (eight goals, nine assists), surpassing any other player in this timeframe.\n\nRegarding team updates, Dortmund will have to contend with the absences of S\u00e9bastien Haller, Ramy Benseba\u00efni, and Julien Duranville. Haller's unavailability likely means Niclas F\u00fcllkrug will lead the attacking line, supported by Jadon Sancho, Karim Adeyemi, and Julian Brandt.\n\nMeanwhile, Ancelotti faces a decision between the fit-again Thibaut Courtois and Andriy Lunin for the goalkeeper position. With David Alaba and Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni sidelined due to injury, Toni Kroos is confirmed to start in midfield, marking his final appearance for the club in a distinguished career.\n\nIn a contrasting scenario to Kroos, 20-year-old Jude Bellingham will confront his former team Dortmund on familiar ground at England's national stadium. Bellingham aims to secure his first Champions League triumph as he faces his former club.\n\nDortmund vs Real Madrid: Head-to-head\n\nIn the upcoming encounter between Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid, it will mark the 15th meeting between these two European giants, all of which have taken place in the Champions League. Dortmund has faced Madrid more times in the competition than any other opponent (14), with only Bayern Munich (22) and Juventus (16) featuring more frequently in Madrid's European encounters.\n\nDortmund has secured victory in only three of their previous meetings with Madrid (with five draws and six losses). Among opponents faced at least five times in the competition, Dortmund's win percentage against Madrid stands at 21%, which is only marginally higher than their win percentage against Manchester City (17%).\n\nDespite Madrid's victories of 3-1 away and 3-2 at home during their last encounter in the 2017-18 group stage, Dortmund can hold onto hope. Neither team has managed to achieve three consecutive wins in this fixture in European competition prior to this encounter.\n\nDortmund vs Real Madrid: Recent Form\n\nIn their recent league fixtures, Ancelotti's team has encountered a slight dip in form, failing to secure victories in their last two outings. They settled for a goalless draw against Real Betis following a thrilling 4-4 draw with Villarreal. However, this downturn in performance could be attributed to Madrid's unwavering focus on the impending final.\n\nThe heightened emphasis on European success is evident, as Madrid stands on the brink of completing a historic unbeaten European Cup/Champions League season, currently boasting a record of played 12, won 8, and drawn 4. Achieving this milestone on Saturday would mark the first time in their history.\n\nShould they maintain their unbeaten streak, Madrid would join Barcelona as the only Spanish teams to lift the trophy without suffering a single defeat throughout the campaign. Barcelona achieved this feat in the 2005-06 season, having played 13 matches, won 9, and drawn 4.\n\nOn the other hand, Dortmund enters this significant European fixture after a disappointing league campaign marked by typical inconsistency. They suffered a 3-0 defeat against Mainz before bouncing back with a convincing 4-0 victory against Darmstadt at Signal Iduna Park.\n\nTerzi\u0107's side concluded the Bundesliga season in fifth place, positioning them as the second-lowest ranked German team to reach a European Cup/Champions League final, following in the footsteps of Bayern Munich in the 1974-75 season, where they finished 10th in the league.\n\nDortmund vs Real Madrid: Team News and Predicted Line-up\n\nIn team news for the upcoming clash between Dortmund and Real Madrid, there are some notable updates.\n\nDortmund: Team News\n\nSebastien Haller remains the primary concern for Dortmund, casting doubt over his availability for the upcoming match. However, it is anticipated that Niclas Fullkrug will assume the striker role, supported by Jadon Sancho and Julian Brandt in the attacking lineup.\n\nIn addition to Sebastien Haller's uncertainty, Dortmund will be without the services of Ramy Bensebaini and Julien Duranville due to injury.\n\nFurthermore, Marco Reus is eager to contribute in any capacity, even if it means coming off the bench, in what could be his farewell appearance for the club.\n\nReal Madrid manager Ancelotti faces a crucial decision regarding the starting goalkeeper, with Thibaut Courtois and Andriy Lunin both contenders for the role. Courtois, who recently returned from an extended injury layoff, and Lunin, who battled flu symptoms in the lead-up to the final, are vying for the position.\n\nIn unfortunate news, David Alaba and Aurelien Tchouameni are confirmed absentees due to injury. Tchouameni's unavailability guarantees a starting spot for Toni Kroos in what will be his final club match, marking the end of a remarkable career in club football.\n\nPredicting outcomes in the Champions League this season has been particularly challenging, given the remarkable drama witnessed in the knockout stages.\n\nDortmund's journey to the final has been impressive, overcoming strong opponents such as Atletico Madrid and PSG. However, their quest for victory in London might end in disappointment.\n\nReal Madrid's formidable presence in this competition makes them formidable opponents, often proving difficult to defeat despite their performance level. All signs suggest another European triumph is on the horizon for them.\n\nReal Madrid UEFA Champions League Squad\n\nWhere to Watch the Match LIVE in India?

The Germans recovered from a 1-0 opening defeat in Paris to top the group with fly colours with three wins and two defeats thereafter, finishing three points clear of French and Italian giants, PSG and Milan.\n\nPSV Eindhoven of the Netherlands were swept aside in the round of 16 but another Madrid club awaited Dortmund in the quarterfinals where Atletico claimed a 1-0 lead after the first leg in Spain. A 4-2 win at Signal Iduna Park ushered the home side into the last four.\n\nPSG would await Dortmund once again in the semifinals and, even after their display in the group, the French champions were the favourites one again but 1-0 wins in each leg saw the Parisians' European dreams end yet again.\n\nMadrid, who last lifted the Champions League trophy two seasons ago, stormed to the top of their group with a maximum 18 points beating Italian champions Napoli into second while Sporting Braga and Union Berlin were eliminated.\n\nThe knockout stages provided far sterner tests with Leipzig, Manchester City and Bayern Munich all pushing Madrid to the brink, the latter two requiring penalties and a last-minute turnaround respectively to progress.\n\nFor Dortmund, their task is not only to take down the latest crop of Galacticos on a relentless road to the final but also, arguably, the competition's greatest manager. Carlo Ancelotti has won six of his seven appearances in Champions League finals.\n\nThe 64-year-old Italian has won a record four titles as a coach and two as a player but will not be taking this game, or the latest shot at extending his own record haul, lightly.\n\n\"It's the same as it was the first time,\" Ancelotti said. \"First there is the joy of being here, then the concerns will come and the fear will come. The cold sweat will arrive Saturday afternoon, it's normal, I'm already prepared for it.\n\n\"[But] this team gives me a lot of confidence, I see them focused on the match, they are in Champions [League] mode.\"\n\nAncelotti guided Madrid to the Champions League trophy in 2014 and 2022 and having previously won the competition as a player and manager with AC Milan.\n\nIn the other dugout, Edin Terzic who, at 41 years of age, is at the other end of his managerial career. Indeed in 2013, when Dortmund won their only European crown, Terzic was a fan in the stands and only beginning to forge his way as a coach having never played professionally.\n\n\"We have our own story,\" Terzic said of Dortmund's challenge, much as his own, in facing proven European winners. \"We have the story of ups and downs of the last years. We are a team that builds up to compete every year, but now we are there and we are facing teams that are built to win the Champions League.\"\n\nOutside Germany, a lot of fans believe Dortmund is a middling club but in reality, they are the closest challengers to German powerhouse Bayern Munich.\n\nLast season, they only needed to beat Mainz to claim the Bundesliga title. A 2-2 draw saw Bayern skip ahead to lift the trophy on the final day.\n\nTheir league campaign this season has been underwhelming with Bayer Leverkusen upsetting both Munich and Dortmund to claim the title by 17 points from Stuttgart while last season's top two finished third and fifth respectively.\n\nOnly Nurnburg, whose last of their nine titles came in 1969, better Dortmund's challenge of eight crowns to Munich's 33 titles in Germany. Dortmund's last Bundesliga came in 2011-12 when they completed back-to-back titles for the second time in their history. Indeed, Dortmund were runners-up in four of the five seasons prior to this campaign's drop-off.\n\nFinancially Bayern's value is more than double that of Dortmund ($465m), who have slipped to fourth on the German financial list. It's not bad for a club whose city is the seventh largest in Germany - yet the club have the country's second-largest fan membership.\n\nMadrid's financial value, meantime, has risen to more than a billion dollars with the Spaniards at the top of the globe's football-rich list.\n\n\"For me they're the biggest club in the world, I've always wanted to play against Real,\" Borussia Dortmund defender Nico Schlotterbeck said ahead of the final.\n\n\"But we shouldn't be afraid, we shouldn't be in awe.\n\n\"It has to be a completely normal game for us. We were often the underdogs in the Champions League this season, and that has suited us quite well.\"\n\nSchlotterbeck, 24, is part of a formidable pairing in the centre of defence with 35-year-old Mats Hummels, who won the Player of the Match award in both legs of the semifinal against PSG. It is a solid foundation upon which Dortmund can build and free them to focus on their own game against Real.\n\n\"For us, it means getting into our game quickly, moving the ball quickly, and imposing our game on Real Madrid a bit,\" Schlotterbeck said.\n\n\"If we can do that, then I'm optimistic that we can make it.\"\n\nHummels was part of the 2013 side, along with the soon-to-depart club legend Marco Reus, that helped Dortmund to their last Champions League final only to be defeated by a last-minute Arjen Robben goal for Bayern Munich. A game that was also played at Wembley Stadium.\n\nThis current run has seen Dortmund keep clean sheets in six of their last 11 Champions League games. Madrid, however, have only lost one of their last 20 UEFA competition matches against German teams, winning 13.\n\nA strong season for the Germans ended last year with a heavy thump, a more difficult campaign this time around could be about to end with a high experienced only once before.\n\n\"Perhaps we thought too much about it [the league] back then. But we know what happens here in the city when we win a title and what it means to people,\" Schlotterbeck added.\n\n\"Last season we had something to lose against Mainz, now we have something to win.\n\n\"We have to seize this opportunity.\"\n\nReal Madrid are boosted by the return of Thibaut Courtois in goal. The Belgium international has played only four times this season and has not featured in the Champions League.\n\nHis stand-in during that period, Andriy Lunin, missed the flight to London with flu but is expected to link up with the squad ahead of the game. David Alaba is absent through injury while fellow defender Eder Militao is struggling to prove his fitness after a long layoff.\n\nSebastien Haller is Dortmund's only doubt as the Ivorian striker struggles to regain full fitness following an ankle problem. Julien Duranville and Ramy Bensebaini are both definitely out.\n\nBorussia Dortmund: Kobel, Ryerson, Hummels, Schlotterbeck, Maatsen, Can, Sabitzer, Adeyemi, Brandt, Sancho, Fullkrug\n\nReal Madrid: Courtois, Carvajal, Nacho, Rudiger, Mendy, Valverde, Kroos, Camavinga, Bellingham, Rodrygo, Vinicius Junior", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_hand@aljazeera.com", "name": "Kevin Hand", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nAs the two Champions League finalists set off for London, the contrasting moods among the squads said enough. For Real Madrid, it's a sense of duty. There's excitement about returning to this stage, sure, but also an awareness that this is simply what they do. They go to these games and win them. For Borussia Dortmund, there's a sense of genuine wonder. Manager Edin Terzic has described it as \"a dream\". This is just the third Champions League final in their history and first in 11 years. Many of their players are aware they may never get this chance again. For club stalwart Marco Reus, it may even be the last chance to properly fulfil his talent and win a major trophy.\n\nAs rare as this feeling is for Dortmund, though, it actually isn't that infrequent for this showpiece. The Champions League final may be the biggest global event in club football - and maybe all of sport, after the World Cup final - but it has rarely featured a showdown between the two best teams in Europe. They have tended to come earlier in the knockouts, usually involving Madrid and Manchester City in recent times. The curiosity of that goes back further, through what has been one of the Champions League's last remaining unpredictabilities. In the 11 years since Dortmund's last appearance at this stage, there have arguably been six finals where there was one outstanding favourite. This is certainly the second in a row, after Inter Milan's surprisingly spirited 1-0 defeat to City last season.\n\nIt may also be the last year of this. From next season's expanded \"Super Champions League\", the knock-out stages will be entirely seeded after the first-round open table. So, while you might well get Real Madrid and Arsenal on the same side of the draw again, it's unlikely you get all of Madrid, City, Arsenal and Bayern Munich on the same side. Or whoever their equivalents are as the four best teams next season. It's certainly going to be that bit more difficult for teams who aren't at that elite level, while representing just another way elite football is curated and engineered.\n\nIt is maybe why this final should be relished, in the same way as the Dortmund players are looking at it. If it is to be the last of an era, this match almost represents an extreme. The simple numbers say enough, before you get into bigger issues like finance.\n\nMadrid are going for their 15th Champions League and sixth in 11 years, while Carlo Ancelotti can win his fifth as a manager. Dortmund are hoping for just their second, and first in 27 years.\n\nReflecting that is the relative chasm between league positions. With Real Madrid the champions of Spain and Dortmund fifth in the Bundesliga, it is the biggest gap between the league position of finalists since the foundation of the Champions League in 1992. Only two previous finals match it, which was 2001 between Bayern Munich and Valencia and 2012 between Bayern and Chelsea. That was first against fifth, and second against sixth, respectively. The latter produced a \"surprise\" but Chelsea's long-term strength ensured it was nothing close to what a Dortmund victory would be here.\n\nThat has created a slightly odd build-up to this game for a Champions League final. It doesn't feel epic, although that obviously won't be the case for the tens of thousands of Dortmund fans who travel. You might almost call it 2002 World Cup syndrome. As exhilarating as shocks and surprises are, they often suppress the actual final. There's just too much of a gap by that point. Consequently, very few people are looking at this match and expecting anything other than a Madrid victory. The anticipation is mostly about how long Dortmund can stay alive; how close they get to causing something big.\n\nAncelotti won't let Madrid think like that of course. He has already pointed to how people would have said similar about Dortmund's run to this final so far. The German side probably should have been knocked out by both Atletico Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. Luck is a large part of why they are here, to go with what was actually the more forgiving side of the draw.\n\nThat has an emotional momentum of its own, that can lift teams to higher levels on occasions like this.\n\nIt's just that no one tends to go to a higher level than Madrid in these games and that applies to the extent of luck they enjoy, too. Ancelotti's side really should have lost their last final, against Liverpool in 2022, except for the excellence of Thibaut Courtois. Madrid won again. That's what they do. It is why there is an extra psychological obstacle. Dortmund don't just have to overcome Madrid's current quality. They also have to overcome the knowledge of their historic record in finals.\n\nMadrid have not lost in this fixture since the defeat to Liverpool in 1981. That wouldn't necessarily stand out except for the fact that, in the time since, they have won eight successive Champions League finals. That is more finals than every other European club has been to in their entire history, outside AC Milan, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Juventus and Barcelona.\n\nIt does have to end sometime, so might that be in a season that has already featured one surprise run; where strange things have happened? Wembley's showpiece has the potential to be an odd game. Both teams would prefer to stand off. Terzic has made Dortmund more pragmatic. Ancelotti would prefer to simply release Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo on the break. In between them, Jude Bellingham has been carrying an injury.\n\nThere is a central local rivalry, too, with how the English midfielder faces revitalised compatriot Jadon Sancho. The on-loan Dortmund winger is a Londoner, if not from the Wembley area. He was superb in the semi-finals against Paris Saint-Germain to win the tie but it would likely take something even beyond that to turn this. Madrid just have too much class, that will be capable of picking more holes in Dortmund's porous backline. The best hope is almost Terzic's side keeping it tight for as long as possible and then hoping that kind of knock-out magic takes over.\n\nIt says much that we're reaching for the intangibles, but then that was also the theme going into last weekend's FA Cup final. Manchester United stunned Manchester City. It will take even more for Dortmund to shock Madrid - but it can happen.\n\nRegarding previous games here, and recent iterations of this fixture, both Wembley and Uefa could do with this going smoothly. The last Uefa event here was the disastrous Euro 2020 final. The last two Champions League finals have been logistical nightmares, with that 2022 game in Paris fortunate to avoid death.\n\nBoth the Football Association and Uefa have taken all this in. Another outer perimeter is to be built, there are improved gates. The hope is everything goes smoothly.\n\nOn the pitch itself, Madrid will just seek to do what they always do. Dortmund are aiming to give us something we haven't seen in years.\n\nThe Champions League arguably needs it. Another Madrid win would just be more of the same, the record barely meaning much more. For Dortmund, it would be everything.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Reus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Reus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valencia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valencia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Valencia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thibaut_Courtois", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thibaut Courtois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Borussia Dortmund is aiming to pull off one of football's biggest upsets in recent memory.\n\nWhoever wins the Champions League final on Sunday morning (AEST) will be defying the odds in their own way.\n\nMadrid's domination of European club football's biggest prize confounds belief. Its record of 14 titles is twice as many as its closest rival AC Milan.\n\nWatch the 2024 UEFA Champions League final between Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund on June 2 AEST, streaming ad free and live on Stan Sport\n\n\"The club has created its history in this competition,\" coach Carlo Ancelotti says.\n\nMadrid's record in the Champions League era is even more impressive: Eight wins since the tournament was rebranded in 1992; three in a row from 2016-18 and five in the last 10 years. In the same period, Madrid has won La Liga only four times.\n\nMadrid has also been a semifinalist in 12 of the last 14 seasons.\n\n\"It's something special for the club, for all the Madridistas (fans) and for us, who are also Madridistas. It's a competition where we're more focused,\" says Ancelotti, who can win a record-extending fifth Champions League as a coach.\n\nTeams are not supposed to enjoy such superiority in a competition filled with the biggest and richest clubs in the world.\n\nNot even great teams of recent times such as Pep Guardiola's Barcelona or Alex Ferguson's Manchester United -- both repeat finalists -- could come close to the kind of hold Madrid has had on the Champions League.\n\nAnd even in the face of competition from state-backed teams like Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain, the all-time king of Europe refuses to be dethroned.\n\nWhich is why this final is so intriguing.\n\nIt is a clash between the old money and glamour of Madrid and the savvy approach of a Dortmund team that has found an alternative way to compete with Europe's superpowers.\n\nThere is no better illustration of the contrast between the rivals than Jude Bellingham, who swapped Dortmund for Madrid last year in a deal worth up to $139 million.\n\nBellingham could well be the match-winner, having helped fire Madrid to the Spanish title in a spectacular debut season.\n\nYet, in his absence, Dortmund stands on the brink of adding to its lone Champions League triumph in 1997 in its third final ever.\n\nSelling the likes of Bellingham is part of the German club's strategy of buying emerging talents and then cashing in.\n\nA year earlier, it was Erling Haaland who was sold to Man City. The roll call of stars who have passed through the club includes Jadon Sancho, Christian Pulisic, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Ousmane Dembele and Robert Lewandowski.\n\nNot that Dortmund represents a fairytale in the strictest of terms. Forbes ranks it as the 12th most valuable soccer team in the world in its most recent rich list. But it represents a different way of competing at the top.\n\nDortmund's willingness to give opportunities to young players before selling them to bigger clubs has made it an appealing option for the likes of Haaland and Bellingham, who were both targets of Manchester United before choosing to develop their careers in Germany.\n\n\"I was at Dortmund for three years, I took a path that's a bit unfamiliar for players in England,\" Bellingham has said. \"But I am grateful for the opportunities I've been given in European football. Maybe they wouldn't be as accessible in England.\"\n\nBellingham's move has paid off for all parties. He is playing beside Vinicius Junior and Eduardo Camavinga, and they are expected to be joined next season by Kylian Mbappe.\n\nSuch talent has been the bedrock of Madrid's Champions League dominance. Many of the game's greats have worn the white shirt from Zinedine Zidane to Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nDortmund do it a different way. Besides the youngsters, it has squeezed last flings out of aging stars Mats Hummels, Niclas Fullkrug and Marcel Sabitzer to plot a path to a first final in 11 years. The loan signing of Sancho after his troubled spell at United has also been key.\n\nWhile it has endured a disappointing Bundesliga season, finishing fifth and 27 points adrift of champion Bayer Leverkusen, Dortmund has eliminated Dutch champion PSV and French champion PSG in the Champions League under Edin Terzic.\n\n\"Our objective is to win the Champions League and to do that you have to beat the champions. Now the absolute champion historically, and in particular in this competition, awaits us,\" Terzic says.\n\n\"If anyone has shown that you can achieve a lot in one game, it has been us, especially this season and especially in this competition.\"\n\nWHO IS PLAYING IN THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL?\n\nBorussia Dortmund were first to book their place in the final after defeating Paris Saint-Germain on aggregate 2-0. Real Madrid, meanwhile, made it through with a 4-3 aggregate win against Bayern Munich.\n\nWHERE IS THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL?\n\nWembley Stadium in London will host the final. It's the eighth time the venue has hosted the final. It's just the third time the final has been held at the stadium in the UEFA Champions League era after 2011 and 2013.\n\nStan Sport will have live, ad-free, and exclusive coverage in 4K UHD of the final from 4.15am AEST.\n\nWHICH TEAM IS THE FAVOURITE?\n\nReal Madrid are the short-priced favourite at $1.61 while Dortmund are at long odds paying $5 as of Friday morning.\n\nIf the scores are level after 90 minutes, two 15-minute periods of extra time will be played. If the score remains level after that then the winner will be determined by a penalty shootout.\n\nCHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL REFEREE\n\nSlovenia's Slavko Vincic will referee the final for the first time.

Los Blancos are the favourites as they aim to secure the trophy for the 15th time.\n\nReal Madrid have the experience to beat Dortmund 3-1 in the Champions League final.\n\nThe first of our Dortmund vs Real Madrid predictions is for Carlo Ancelotti's side to win the match in normal time. Real beat Manchester City and Bayern Munich to reach the final at Wembley. They are unbeaten in 47 matches across all competitions, so confidence is high coming into this one. Ancelotti's men scored 1.51 more goals per game than their opponents on their remarkable winning run.\n\nDortmund have strutted their best stuff in the Champions League this season. They slumped to a 5th-place finish domestically, but were impressive in their wins over Atletico Madrid and PSG in this competition. However, this showdown with Real looks to be a step too far.\n\nBet 1: Real Madrid to win @ 1.66 bet9ja\n\nThese sides last went head-to-head in the Champions League in 2017. There was a glut of goals in both group meetings on that occasion, and this one also has the potential to be high-scoring. Dortmund lost the home game 3-1 and the away game 3-2. Edin Terzic's side have been scoring an average of 1.88 goals per game this season.\n\nReal Madrid have found the net in 46 of their last 47 matches across all competitions. They scored an average of 2.4 goals per game over that period. Both teams have scored in nine of their 12 Champions League matches this season and in five of their six matches in the knockout stages.\n\nBet 2: GG & over 2.5 @ 1.94 Bet9ja\n\nVinicius Junior has been a crucial part of Real Madrid's success this season, particularly in the latter stages of the Champions League. He has scored five and assisted another four in his nine appearances in this competition. The Brazilian's two goals in the first leg of their semi-final clash at the Allianz Arena were key in them edging past Bayern Munich. We are backing him to come up trumps once again.\n\nVinicius has played as part of a strike pairing with Rodrygo this season. He has scored 15 goals in 26 league appearances and his pace will undoubtedly cause problems here. The attacker has a non-penalty xG of 0.5 per 90 minutes played, which means he ranks in the 83rd percentile when compared with all other forwards across Europe's top five leagues. Vinicius also scored the last time Real Madrid were in the Champions League final in 2022.\n\nBet 3: Vinicius to score @ 2.40 Bet9ja\n\nReal Madrid are the masters of finding a way to win. They have ridden their luck at times this campaign, but have managed to come out on top in some tricky ties. Carlo's side will likely face adversity here. Nevertheless, we are backing them to win the match, despite conceding in this one.\n\nBorussia Dortmund have scored in their last 10 Champions League matches, averaging 1.7 goals per game during that run. Their only defeat in that period came against Atletico Madrid. They later avenged that defeat in the second leg, but there will be no chance of redemption following Saturday's final.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "betting_expert@punchng.com", "name": "Betting Expert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allianz_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allianz Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/29121615/Dortmund-vs-Real-Madrid-predictions-865x630.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613014", "eventUri": "eng-9613014", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The most highly anticipated game on the club soccer calendar -- the UEFA Champions League final -- is finally upon us. This year, Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid will battle it out for the ultimate European honor, marking their first meeting at this stage. Continue reading to learn all you need to know about the final game of the 2023-24 season.\n\nUEFA Champions League Final: Borussia Dortmund vs Real Madrid - Where To Watch In US\n\nBorussia Dortmund and Real Madrid will meet in the UEFA Champions League final at the iconic Wembley Stadium on Saturday night (June 1). The game will kick off at 8 PM UK Time / 3 PM EDT / 12 PM PT.\n\nIn the United States, CBS will air the final. Fans who do not have access to the channel can stream it live on Paramount+.\n\nBorussia Dortmund did not have the most memorable Bundesliga campaign. Amassing only 63 points from 34 matches, Edin Terzic's boys finished fifth in the rankings. However, thanks to German teams' impressive performance in Europe in 2023-24, they will feature in next year's UEFA Champions League final, irrespective of what happens at Wembley on Saturday.\n\nDortmund closed their Bundesliga campaign with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Darmstadt, with Ian Maatsen, Marco Reus, Julian Brandt, and Donyell Malen scoring one goal each.\n\nReal Madrid, on the other hand, secured the La Liga title with four games to spare. They suffered only one defeat throughout the Spanish top-flight campaign -- against Atletico Madrid at the Civitas Metropolitano Stadium -- and snagged 29 wins. They also scored the most goals (87) and conceded the fewest (26).\n\nThey, however, could not close their La Liga season with a victory. Los Blancos played out a goalless draw with Real Betis in Toni Kroos' final match for Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.\n\nFitness\n\nBorussia Dortmund will be without Ramy Bensebaini (knee) and Julien Duranville (muscle) whereas doubts remain over Sebastien Haller's fitness. Haller has returned to full team training, but may not be 100% for the UEFA Champions League final. In any case, Niclas Fullkrug will edge him out and book a place in the starting XI.\n\nReal Madrid, meanwhile, will have to make do without David Alaba (ACL) and Aurelien Tchouameni (foot). Goalkeeper Andriy Lunin, whose heroics helped Madrid to the final, may also sit this one out after contracting flu in the worst possible moment. With him out of the running, Thibaut Courtois will be an automatic pick in goal for Carlo Ancelotti.\n\nHead-To-Head\n\nBorussia Dortmund and Real Madrid have locked horns 14 times in the UEFA Champions League over the years. The 14-time European champions have a comfortable head-to-head lead, winning six times and losing thrice. So far, five games have ended all square.\n\nTheir most recent meeting came in the group stage of the 2017-18 season. Los Merengues won both encounters, beating the German side 3-1 and 3-2 on Matchday 2 and 6, respectively.\n\nBorussia Dortmund vs Real Madrid: Prediction\n\nBorussia Dortmund and Real Madrid have overcome some formidable teams to make it into the final of the UEFA Champions League. Both teams have multiple match-winners at their disposal and will be eager to give their club legends, Marco Reus and Kroos, the send-off they deserve.\n\nIt is difficult to predict which way this one will go. But we cannot help but give the edge to serial winners Real Madrid. They have won all eight of their UEFA Champions League finals (since 1992), have a fine blend of young and experienced players, and, most importantly, have a coach who knows all about winning cup finals.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportslens.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sushan_chakraborty@sportslens.com", "name": "Sushan Chakraborty", "type": "author",

Either Real Madrid will emerge with a record 15th European title, the most of any club in history, or Dortmund will become just the 14th club to win multiple European titles, looking for their first since 1997.\n\nKeeping a tight defensive structure can win trophies, but those who score goals are the ones who get crowned as legends. In European finals, it's not always the most likely individuals who crop up in front of goal, just as it was Rodri who gave Manchester City the 2023 crown.\n\nThe last four Champions League finals have all finished 1-0, so the team on the board first will enjoy a massive swing toward their chances of emerging victorious. The Sporting News breaks down who could be the ones to find the net on the biggest stage in club football, as well as which players could find themselves booked and which side could rack up scoring opportunities.\n\nMORE: Predicting who will win the 2024 Champions League final between Real Madrid and Dortmund\n\nGoals may be hard to come by in this match, but there are a few ways to find value amongst the odds, especially given the market's heavy swing towards Real Madrid players to find the net. Vinicius Jr is a big-game player, having scored in a Champions League final already in his career. With Kylian Mbappe likely to join Real Madrid this summer, Saturday could be the last time he participates in an event as iconic as this as the unrivalled titan in Madrid's attack.\n\nThe Brazilian has taken to scoring early in matches of late, looking to set the tone. Vinicius has scored first on five separate occasions since bagging the opener against Girona in early February, including twice in the Champions League (once against RB Leipzig and again against Bayern Munich, both German sides). Add in four other goals this season in the first half-hour of matches, and Vinicius is a real candidate to breach Gregor Kobel's goal early in this game.\n\nOn the flip side, Jude Bellingham is Real Madrid's closer. He has nine game-winning goals this season across all competitions, and has been a game's last goal scorer on eight occasions, including five goals in the final 10 minutes plus stoppage time. If this game is in the balance late, he could be an option to finish it off for the Spanish giants.\n\nFor Dortmund, there's one clear option up front and that's Niclas Fullkrug, who is ending the season in great form headed into the Euros. As Sebastien Haller struggles with fitness, Fullkrug has established himself as the clear option in front of net, scoring in both legs against PSG and leading the team in shots by a solid margin.\n\nShots on target are a fickle thing, especially in a match where both teams will be looking to attack their opponents with pace. Borussia Dortmund have a clear frontrunner for shots with No. 9 Niclas Fullkrug, who has 31 shots in the Champions League this season, eight more than anyone else in the Dortmund squad. He's exceptional in the air as Dortmund are proficient on set-pieces, an area where Real Madrid have been somewhat soft this season, and he has had opportunities with his head in recent Champions League games.\n\nDonyell Malen was a shot merchant off the wing early in the Champions League season, but he has lost his starting place to the effective wide duo of Karim Adeyemi and Jadon Sancho. The latter is more exclusively a creator, but Adeyemi can crop up in front of goal himself, putting six of his 12 efforts on frame this season in Champions League play, including a pair of efforts against PSG last time out.\n\nReal Madrid are not so easy to sort out, which makes them a dangerous attacking team with multiple options in front of goal. Backing them to rack up shots is as much a bet on Borussia Dortmund to put Madrid in poor shooting positions than it is on Real Madrid to overwhelm their opponent. Dortmund have conceded nearly 16 shots per 90 minutes in the Champions League this season, and almost 2.0 xG.\n\nReal Madrid will be well positioned to take advantage of that, as they average 16.8 shots per match in Champions League play, and have their entire attacking unit fit and ready to start. Madrid should have opportunities, it's a matter of whether they can capitalize.\n\nWhile some of the averages seem to indicate a high corner count, especially for Real Madrid, there's a few reasons why this match could end up with a lower total than many expect.\n\nBorussia Dortmund have conceded the most corners per game of any Champions League knockout stage participant this year, but if they have their way, they'll keep Madrid away from set-piece opportunities like they did in the first leg against PSG, where the French giants racked up just three total corners to Dortmund's three.\n\nMadrid have collected the fifth-most corners per game of the 12 knockout stage sides, indicating verticality isn't exactly their game. The Spaniards love to hit on the counter, and so do Dortmund, so working possession down to the end line isn't what either of these clubs are most comfortable doing.\n\nRegardless of the total, there are likely to be more corners after halftime as whoever trails will look to flood numbers forward in a desperate late attempt to get back level, just as PSG did against Dortmund in the second half of their second semifinal leg, where they piled on nine corners in an unsuccessful attempt to find the net.\n\nReferee: Slavko Vincic (Slovenia)\n\nVAR: Nejc Kajtazoovic (Slovenia)\n\n4th official: Francois Letexier (France)\n\nIt's been tough to get a read on Slavko Vincic from a disciplinary standpoint. That's probably a good thing from a sporting perspective, because it means he can read a game well and adapts to the situation at hand rather than have tendencies one way or another, but from a predictions standpoint it makes things difficult.\n\nIn the 2022 Europa League final between Eintracht Frankfurt and Rangers refereed by Vincic, the Slovenian dished out just two bookings, both in the second half.\n\nThe swing here is the recent history of discipline in the Champions League final, where referees do their absolute best to keep all 11 players for each team on the pitch. Last year's final between Man City and Inter boasted five bookings, but three of those came deep in stoppage time when tempers flared. Prior to that, two straight Champions League finals went under this total, including Real Madrid's win over Liverpool two years ago that saw just one player booked all game.\n\nOne player who could be at risk of a yellow card is Eduardo Camavinga, who will likely start due to the injury keeping Aurelien Tchouameni sidelined. The 21-year-old midfielder is a talented and versatile player, but discipline is one of his weaknesses. He picked up a booking in just 20 minutes off the bench against Bayern Munich in the semifinal, and has been shown four cards in La Liga play since the start of March. He averages 2.1 fouls per game in this year's Champions League and has picked up 12 cards across league and Europe this season.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Here's what you need to know before the European Cup final -including odds and prize money\n\nReal Madrid will face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League final tomorrow night.\n\nThe final pits two high-profile English players against each other. Jude Bellingham has been outstanding for Real Madrid this season and in the build-up to the final his team-mate Luka Modric explained the precise moment he realised that Bellingham was the club's future.\n\nMeanwhile for Dortmund, Jadon Sancho will be a goal threat. He too has enjoyed a productive season since being sent on loan by Manchester United, where he fell out badly with Erik ten Hag.\n\nShould Madrid win, they will secure a double, having won La Liga for a 36th time. By contrast Borussia Dortmund finished fifth in the Bundesliga. The German side were also beaten in the round of 16 in the German Cup.\n\nReal Madrid have won the European Cup 14 times, more than any other club. Dortmund were winners in 1997 when Lars Ricken's famous chip from distance helped them beat Juventus.\n\nNew security arrangements at Wembley will be put to the test, with millions of pounds spent to avoid a repeat of the mayhem that surrounded the Euro 2020 final.\n\nWhen is the Champions League final?\n\nThis year's Champions League final is tomorrow: Saturday, June 1.

City were knocked out by Real Madrid in the quarter-finals this year.\n\nLatest newsFA promises no repeat of 2021 mayhem as it beefs up Wembley security\n\nMulti-million pound security improvements at Wembley since mayhem at Euro 2020 will be put to the test at Saturday's Champions League final.\n\nThe Football Association has invested \u00a35 million on measures including extra closed-circuit TV, reinforced doors, more fencing and a new \"Zone X\" control room.\n\nChris Bryant, the FA's director of tournaments and events, recognised \"a lot of people\" will be thinking of 2021 as he promised such scenes will be avoided this time. \"We are doing all we can to ensure fans have a smooth arrival process and nice experience as they come to the stadium,\" he said of a co-ordinated plan, which includes the now regular drinking ban on Wembley Way.\n\nAn independent review by Baroness Casey identified more than 20 \"near-misses\" that could have resulted in serious injury or death as a result of ticketless individuals trying to gain entry, and in some cases succeeding, for the England v Italy match in July 2021.\n\nEntrance to the stadium will be allowed four hours before kick-off instead of two, and Transport for London will run extra services to aid the flow of supporters to and from the ground.\n\nBryant acknowledged the steward supply at the Euro 2020 final was at a low point off the back of the coronavirus pandemic, and said Saturday's match would see \"the highest ever stewarding deployment in Wembley Stadium history\".\n\n\"One thing in the Euros final was very much the supply of stewarding, which I can say was at a low point off the back of Covid,\" he said. \"We're very confident the supply of stewarding which you've seen in the industry has bounced back.\"\n\nWhat is the prize money for the Champions League?\n\nThe winner of the final will receive \u20ac20 million (\u00a317.1 million) from Uefa. However, with the accumulative prize money on offer as a team progresses through the tournament, the winner could net up to \u20ac85.14 million (\u00a372.69 million), depending on their results. Last year Man City earned around \u00a385 million for winning the trophy for the first time.\n\nWho have won the most European Cups?\n\nReal Madrid have won the European Cup the most times (14), AC Milan (7) are second, with Liverpool and Bayern Munich tied for third with six wins. Barcelona have five wins, Ajax have four, Manchester United and Inter Milan have three apiece, while five teams have won it twice: Chelsea, Nottingham Forest, Juventus, Benfica and Porto. Ten teams have won the title once: Man City, Aston Villa, Celtic, Borussia Dortmund, Hamburg, Feyenoord, PSV Eindhoven, Marseille, Red Star Belgrade and Steaua Bucharest.\n\nWhat are the latest odds?Borussia Dortmund: 5/2Real Madrid: 3/10\n\nOdds correct as of May 31", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_morgan@telegraph.co.uk", "name": "Tom Morgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_UEFA_Champions_League_final", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2020 UEFA Champions League final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_Modri\u0107", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luka Modri\u0107"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BT Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFB-Pokal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DFB-Pokal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.C._Sampdoria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "U.C.

They are absorbant sponges of pressure and have proven capable at avoiding concession while threatening on the other end.\n\nIt's no surprise that Real Madrid are solid favorites in this one-off final, sporting around 2/3 odds to win in regulation and 1/3 odds to emerge with a record 15th European title.\n\nDortmund, for their efforts, sit at almost 4/1 odds to win in 90 minutes plus over 2/1 odds to win a second Champions League title in club history and a first outside of German soil.\n\nThe way Borussia Dortmund have been playing has been extremely impressive, but their route to the final has been unsustainable. First and foremost, the knockout stage bracket was exceedingly lopsided, seeing Real Madrid emerge from a half boasting most of the best teams in Europe, while Dortmund navigated a weakened half with a number of pretenders.\n\nSecond, Dortmund were battered across the two legs against PSG, avoiding conceding a goal but seeing PSG rack up a whopping 44 shots and 4.95 xG. While a solid amount of that came across the final half of the second leg with PSG chasing a deficit, it still speaks to an opponent's ability to find openings in this Dortmund back line.\n\nReal Madrid are extremely well-positioned to hack away at the German side and find room past Gregor Kobel and into the back of the net.\n\nThe only first-team regular whose fitness is a concern for this match is striker Sebastien Haller whose season has been laden with injuries. Haller has logged just 514 total minutes for Dortmund this season, and hasn't started a match since mid-September. An ankle injury has his status for this Champions League final, but otherwise just Ramy Bensebaini will miss the match with a knee issue. Everyone else should be available for the German side.\n\nReal Madrid will likely be without goalkeeper Andriy Lunin who has played much of the season but has reportedly come down with the flu. That leaves first-choice Thibaut Courtois, who was left off Belgium's roster for Euro 2024, to step in and take charge in net for Los Blancos after missing much of the year due to a torn ACL. Madrid will also be without Aurelien Tchouameni who has been out since late April with a foot injury but should be fit for duty with France at the Euros this summer. Those are all the players missing for Madrid, outside of the absence of David Alaba who has been out since the winter with a cruciate ligament tear.\n\nWhile both these teams, and Real Madrid especially, boast strong attacking units, there's tons of suggestion that this will be a match with razor-thin margins. Chief amongst them is the fact that each of the last five Champions League finals have finished under the total, including the last four which all finished 1-0.\n\nBorussia Dortmund, as mentioned previously, have conceded loads of chances to strong European opposition this season, but they have done well to keep a lid on most of those matches. Gregor Kobel has been exceptional in net all season long for the German side, and opposite him will be Thibaut Courtois, who many regard as the best goalkeeper in the world and who has proven he is back to top form after his serious knee injury.\n\nReal Madrid finished their league season with a cagey 0-0 draw against Real Betis last time out, and while Dortmund have shown good attacking form domestically of late, their league performances have not translated to how they play on the continental stage.\n\nThis is as much a bet on Borussia Dortmund to put Madrid in poor shooting positions than it is on Real Madrid to overwhelm their opponent. Dortmund have conceded nearly 16 shots per 90 minutes in the Champoins League this season, and almost 2.0 xG.\n\nReal Madrid will be well positioned to take advantage of that, as they average 16.8 shots per match in Champions League play, and have their entire attacking unit fit and ready to start. Madrid should have opportunities, it's a matter of whether they can capitalize.\n\nVinicius Jr is a big-game player, having scored in a Champions League final already in his career. With Kylian Mbappe likely to join Real Madrid this summer, Saturday could be the last time he participates in a match as big as this as the unchallenged biggest player in the attack.\n\nThe Brazilian has taken to scoring early in matches of late, looking to set the tone. Vinicius has scored first on five separate occasions since bagging the opener against Girona in early February, including twice in the Champions League (once against RB Leipzig and again against Bayern Munich). Add in four other goals this season in the first half-hour of matches, and Vinicius is a real candidate to breach Gregor Kobel's goal early in this game.\n\nWith that in mind, in matches Vinicius Jr. has scored in this season, Real Madrid have not lost a single time, securing 14 wins and two draws. If Vinicius finds the back of the net, it's almost surefire certainty that Los Blancos will emerge with the trophy.\n\nThe biggest match of the 2024 club campaign will be televised in the United States on CBS in English, with a Spanish-language broadcast available on both TUDN and Univision. All of those channels are available to stream on Fubo, who are offering a FREE trial for new users.\n\nThe entirety of the Champions League season has been available to stream on Paramount+, and the final will also be made available on the CBS streaming service as well. Paramount+ are also offering a FREE trial to new users.\n\nIn Canada, the match will be streamed on Champions League rights-holders DAZN, while in the UK it will be televised on TNT Sports 1 with streaming on discovery+.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF",

Reuters\n\nThe wait is almost over. Real Madrid will take on Borussia Dortmund in the final of the 2023-24 UEFA Champions League at Wembley on Sunday. Real Madrid, one of the European heavyweights, will go into the final as favourites as they eye a record 15th European Cup title.\n\nIt won't be easy, especially against a Dortmund side who have beaten teams like Atletico Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain along the way.\n\nChampions League final | How Wembley is preparing for Real Madrid vs Borussia Dortmund\n\nNo matter the result, it's set to be an emotional farewell for Real Madrid's Toni Kroos and Dortmund's Marco Reus, both of whom are set to play their final game for their respective clubs. Yet, the focus will be largely on those key player battles which will add context and excitement to the title clash.\n\nVinicius Junior vs Julian Ryerson is going to be one of the most interesting player battles come the Champions League final. Vinicius has scored five goals in the Champions League so far, the same amount of goals as Joselu and Rodrygo, but the Brazilian has been impactful nevertheless. The youngster did miss the first half of this season through injury, but has only got stronger and stronger.\n\nAfterall, he has contributed 31 times in the Champions League over the last three seasons, that is the most by any player during this phase. This includes both goals and assists combined.\n\nVinicius is likely to come against Dortmund defender Julian Ryerson, who was impressive against Kylian Mbappe when Dortmund faced PSG in the semi-finals. Ryerson has shown that he can deliver in pressure situations with his passing and dribbles, and will be a force to be reckoned with in the final.\n\nJude Bellingham vs Emre Can\n\nJude Bellingham and Emre Can know each other quite well since the former's Dortmund days. This time around, both will be in opposing sides with Bellingham plying trade for Real Madrid.\n\nBellingham has been a lethal force when it comes to the final third for the Los Blancos. And t is in that final third where Emre Can could make interceptions and deny the England international those goal-scoring opportunities.\n\nAntonio Rudiger vs Niclas Fullkrug\n\nAntonio Rudiger has been a wall in Real Madrid's defence. Rudiger was integral in Real Madrid reaching the final, seeing off the Erling Haaland threat against Manchester City in the quarter-finals whereas he did the same against Bayern Munich in the semi-finals after he saw off a Harry Kane scare.\n\nMeanwhile, Niclas Fullkrug has been lethal up front for Dortmund in terms of both goals and assists, with a combined tally of six this season in the Champions League. That may not be a big number but the German has it in him to see Rudiger off the picture and create gaps and chances for Dortmund to score.\n\nJadon Sancho vs Ferland Mendy\n\nEver since returning to Dortmund on loan from Manchester United, Jadon Sancho has rediscovered confidence and has stepped up when it mattered. He adds depth to Dortmund's attack with fellow winger Karim Adeyemi.\n\nSancho could very well be up against Ferland Mendy, the Real Madrid defender. Sancho is known for his high-speed attacking capabilities and immense creativity, and with Sancho in top form, Mendy will clearly have his task cut out.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Ryerson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julian Ryerson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Reus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Reus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emre_Can", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emre Can"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atl\u00e9tico_Madrid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atl\u00e9tico Madrid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Kroos", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toni Kroos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_R\u00fcdiger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antonio R\u00fcdiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joselu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joselu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karim_Adeyemi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karim Adeyemi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferland_Mendy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferland Mendy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/2024-04-17T220016Z_1211653299_UP1EK4H1P4EIZ_RTRMADP_3_SOCCER-CHAMPIONS-MCI-MAD-REPORT-1-2024-05-94ca28e6a5ee1acf37cc46ee99206acc-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613014", "eventUri": "eng-9613014", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

It will also mark a fond farewell for two German football legends hoping to bow out with the ultimate title win.\n\nThe men's UEFA Champions League final is the most watched annual sporting event on the planet. Around 450 million football fans are expected to tune in on Saturday as record winners Real Madrid face Borussia Dortmund -- a team even their own supporters never expected to get this far.\n\nThe contrast between the 14-times champions Madrid and a Dortmund team who have won it just once -- back in 1997 -- extends to the coaches. Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti, 64, has lifted the famous trophy twice as a player and four times as a manager. He has coached fellow European heavyweights such as Bayern Munich, AC Milan, Chelsea, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain.\n\nDortmund coach Edin Terzic meanwhile has only ever managed the Germans and his only trophy is the German Cup in 2021. The 41-year-old previously made a modest impression as a player in the German lower leagues.\n\nAncelotti may beat Terzic when it comes to experience, but he still gets nervous.\n\n\"The cold sweat and fear will arrive on Saturday afternoon. This is quite normal, it is always like that in this kind of matches,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"(But) I have experience. My team gives me a lot of confidence... because I see them focused on the match. They are in Champions League-mode.\"\n\nMadrid last won the trophy in 2022 when they beat Liverpool 1-0 in the final, Vinicius Junior scoring the winner. The Brazil international will again be a key player for the recently crowned Spanish champions, who won La Liga and reached the Champions League final this season despite not really boasting a starting number nine.\n\nAfter the departure of Karim Benzema to Saudi Arabia last year and the expected arrival of France star Kylian Mbappe from PSG this July, Madrid decided to risk the season with wingers Vinicius and Rodrygo as the main forwards -- with loan signing Joselu offering height and muscle when they desperately needed goals.\n\nThe Spanish forward promptly obliged with two late goals in the dramatic Champions League semifinal victory over Bayern, but whether he starts on Saturday remains to be seen.\n\nDortmund, in contrast, play very much with a number nine. Germany's Niclas F\u00fcllkrug has had a mixed first season at the Black and Yellows as they finished fifth in the Bundesliga. But he has scored crucial goals in Europe, including in the semifinal win over PSG, as Dortmund saved their best performances for Europe's premier club tournament.\n\nCoach Terzic said: \"I am firmly convinced that anything is possible in a single match. And if anyone has shown that you can achieve a lot in one match, it is us, especially this season, especially in this competition.\n\n\"I think Madrid have been in the Champions League final eight times and they've never lost. But the important thing is not what happened in the last eight finals, but what happens in the next one. And we are responsible for that.\"\n\nIt is not just in the dugout and in forward areas where the two teams look different. But they both have one thing in common on Saturday -- they will be saying goodbye to German veterans who have been the heart and soul of their clubs for years.\n\nMidfielder Toni Kroos is retiring from football after Germany's run at the home European Championship from June 14. This Saturday is therefore his final game for Madrid and in club football after already totting up five Champions League titles.\n\nDortmund playmaker Marco Reus, meanwhile, is leaving after Saturday's showpiece following 12 years with his hometown club. He is not guaranteed to start but it would be an almighty leaving present to gift his side their second Champions League triumph. Reus played the last time Dortmund reached the final, in 2013, when they lost to arch-rivals Bayern Munich on the same Wembley pitch they will enter on Saturday.\n\n\"There are worse ways to complete your career at a club than to start with a Champions League final in 2013 and end it with a Champions League final in 2024,\" Reus said.", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deutsche Welle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nBorussia Dortmund will battle Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League Final on Saturday afternoon as both clubs look to secure the title of the best team in Europe.\n\nThe German club has only won the Champions League one time in 1996-97 and last appeared in the final in 2012-13. Meanwhile, Madrid holds the record for the most competition championships and is looking to add yet another to its gaudy count.\n\nHere's a look at our Champions League Final odds, picks and predictions:\n\nChampions League Final odds and preview\n\nThe match pits the unassuming, blue-collared nature of Dortmund -- not even the largest club in Germany -- against the Goliath that has ruled the competition for decades.\n\nDortmund enters the match fresh off a 4-0 win over SV Darmstadt 98 in the Bundesliga. They beat PSG 1-0 in both semifinal legs and only tasted defeat twice in 12 Champions League matches en route to the final.\n\nMadrid tied both of its recent matches against Real Betis and Villareal and did not lose a Champions League match. However, it didn't dominate its opponents, as it managed three wins (one on penalties) and three draws in its last six matches in the competition.\n\nDortmund's job will be to remain resolute in defense and deal with the speed of the Madrid attack. They'll also need to use their consistent solidarity to overcome the Spanish side's experience in the competition.\n\nThis will be the final match at Dortmund for club legend Marco Reus, who has been with the team since 2012. Madrid's Toni Kroos will also retire at the conclusion of the match after amassing one of the best resumes of any midfielder.\n\nThe match will be broadcast on CBS at 3 p.m. Eastern on Saturday, June 1.\n\nDortmund vs. Real Madrid predictions: Dortmund to lift the cup (+250 or better)\n\nMadrid has the better team on paper and more experience -- that much is true. But Dortmund was more impressive in the semifinal with consecutive victories over PSG and also has more added motivation from their drought in the competition compared to Madrid's dominance.\n\nThe German club is quick on the counter-attack and has forwards that can have a run at the Madrid defense, which often sits higher up the pitch because they control possession for so long.\n\nThe battle of the midfield will go a long way to determining the winner. Madrid has the technical advantage but likes to get players forward and could suffer in the engine room later in the match.\n\nThe Spanish side has also needed late-game moments to propel them to the final. They deserve credit for coming up clutch when needed, but Dortmund has quietly taken care of business without ever breaking their unassuming mold.\n\nChampions League Final prop bets: Real Madrid over 4.5 corners (+132 or better)\n\nDortmund's center-backs, Mats Hummels and Nico Schlotterbeck, aren't the quickest pairing in the world, and Julian Ryerson and Ian Maatsen on the outside aren't as quick as Vinicius Junior, Rorygo or Federico Valverde. As such, attacking the wings will be crucial for Madrid.\n\nThe German team is likely going to play a lower defensive line out of possession and concede the ball as they often did against PSG (30.5% possession in the second leg, 42.7% in the first). That should give Madrid more room on the wings to explore.\n\nThe concern is that a lower defensive block could take the sting out of Madrid's attack, but their wide players love to have a run at defenders and should help get this over the total.\n\nBest Champions League betting sites\n\nYou must be over 21 to play.

Following that escape, Los Blancos had another stunning late show against Bayern Munich as Joselu scored in the 88th and 91st minute to make it 4-3 on aggregate.\n\nMadrid have lost just twice in 54 games in all competitions this season. They cruised to La Liga title by 10 points and smashed their Spanish rivals Barcelona 4-1 in the domestic Cup competition.\n\nIt has been quite the first year for Bellingham and continues his stunning rise from Birmingham, to Dortmund to the cusp of a treble with Real Madrid.\n\n\"I came here because I wanted to win, and to expect it,\" said Bellingham, who was voted La Liga's player of the season this week. He scored 19 goals and had six assists in 28 league games this season, and tallied 23 goals and 12 assists in all competitions for the club.\n\n\"It is a bit greedy almost, but you have to be confident when you're playing with so many great players.\"\n\nBellingham is preparing to face his old teammates, who have struggled in his absence. They finished fifth in the Bundesliga, 27 points behind Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nIt has been a different story in the Champions League though where they will line up for a third final.\n\nEdin Terzic team won the toughest group - featuring Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Newcastle - and then won knockouts against PSV Eindhoven, Atletico Madrid and PSG in the semis.\n\nThat result ended Kylian Mbappe's chance of a European title with PSG - and the French superstar is expected to link up with Bellingham in Madrid white next season.\n\n\"They've prepared their season around the run in the Champions League,\" said Bellingham of his former team.\n\n\"They've played amazingly, the character and mentality they've shown in a lot of games. They've had a tough run to the final as well and you have to respect that.\"\n\nOdds makers have Dortmund a $3.35 outsider to Madrid's $1.30 to win the tie but Dortmund fan turned head coach Edin Terzic is defiant.\n\n\"Our goal wasn't to qualify for the final, our goal is to win the Champions League,\" said Terzic.\n\n\"And if you want to win the Champions League, you have to beat the champions. Now the absolute champion in the history of soccer and especially in this competition is waiting for us. The ultimate boss.\"\n\nIn the other technical area is a master of the coaching game - Carlo Ancelotti.\n\nHe can become the only coach to win Europe's top trophy four times.\n\nMeanwhile his players Dani Carvajal, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, in the final club game of his career, could match Madrid legend Paco Gento as the only players to win the competition six times.\n\nAncelotti is the very definition of cool - although he acknowledges he will feel the stress at kickoff.\n\nThis is his sixth European Cup final as a coach, Real's sixth in 10 years, and the 1,324th game Ancelotti has taken charge of in his career.\n\n\"I'm the same [as always]. The week is happiness, enjoy it, then the worry will come, the fear, but that's normal and until it does I want to enjoy it,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"The fear, the cold sweat, comes on Saturday afternoon: that's every game. I have my routine that I will follow, nothing special. A little bit of superstition because I have been taught that not having it brings bad luck.\"\n\nAncelotti also revealed his stress reliving strategy.\n\n\"I like to eat... Broccoli. Salmon. And pasta. That's what I'll eat. Then I'll have an hour's siesta, if I can. I think that's good. Then there's all the thoughts about the game. Just before the team talk starts and the heart rate starts to go up: 110 beats per minute, 120. And it stays there until the game starts. And when the game starts, it returns to normal.\n\n\"But that's normal, and my team gives me confidence: they're focused, in Champions League mode. We have a week to prepare the game and the most important thing is for the players to have a clear idea of what to do. We give them clear information, because that's the best way to reduce the stress.\n\n\"Can we say the best two teams have reached the final? Yes, the best two teams have reached the final of the Champions League.\n\n\"We have all the excitement and optimism in the world. Calm, confidence, positive.\"\n\nThe final will be a test for UEFA as a major event returns to Wembley after distressing and violent scenes for the 2020 European Championships final recently documented in a Netflix program titled Attack on Wembley.\n\nUEFA were also forced to apologise to Liverpool fans for the organisation of the 2022 Champions League final in Paris that an independent review found \"almost led to disaster\".\n\nThe English Football Association (FA) have invested \u00a35 million ($6 million) into improving safety and infrastructure at Wembley, which is also set to host the Euro 2028 final.\n\n\"We never foresaw events like that for the Euros final and I'm not sure we will again but we've learned lessons and additional measures have been implemented,\" said the FA's director of tournaments and events Chris Bryant.", "source": {"uri": "theroar.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Roar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

It has to be a completely normal game for us.\n\n\"We were often the underdogs in the Champions League this season, and that has suited us us quite well.\"\n\nThe defender said Dortmund should focus on their own game against Real.\n\n\"For us, it means getting into our game quickly, moving the ball quickly, and imposing our game on Real Madrid a bit.\n\n\"If we can do that, then I'm optimistic that we can make it.\"\n\nAhead of the final match of the club season before joining Germany's Euros camp, Schlotterbeck drew parallels with Dortmund's final league match of the previous campaign.\n\nWith their 82,000-seat strong Westfalenstadion at full boil, Dortmund needed to beat mid-table Mainz to win the league for the first time in a decade.\n\nDortmund were however down 2-0 after 25 minutes and despite fighting back for a 2-2 draw, would watch as the title went to arch rivals Bayern Munich for an 11th straight time.\n\nFifth in the league this season and 27 points behind champions Bayer Leverkusen, last season still weighs heavily on Dortmund.\n\n\"Perhaps we thought too much about it back then. But we know what happens here in the city when we win a title and what it means to people.\"\n\nThe defender however said the tables have turned, with few favouring Dortmund against the might of Madrid.\n\n\"Last season we had something to lose against Mainz, now we have something to win.

With a perfect record in the group stage, Los Blancos are now vying for their 15th Champions League title. Their opponents, Borussia Dortmund, have survived the \"Group of Death,\" defeating Atletico Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain to reach another UCL final, defying the odds to compete for the title.\n\nIt's been a terrific season, and it will all come to an end on June 1, 2024, when the Champions League final takes place at Wembley Stadium in London. All eyes are on the Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid and the unstoppable Germans' Borussia Dortmund. The UCL fantasy season will conclude with this match and return in September 2024.\n\nJoin me, The FPL Manual, as I assess the top players for Matchday 13 and recap the highlights of a great 2023-24 Champions League campaign so far.\n\nLet's reassess what transpired in the heart of the knockout phase for the top two European finalists.\n\nThe titans faced a major test against Manchester City, holding on to a thrilling 3-3 draw in a game full of epic goals. They then traveled to England, where they secured another draw and won the round on penalties. In the next stage, Real Madrid defeated Bayern Munich with a 3-2 aggregate, thanks to Joselu's brace from the bench, earning their final spot.\n\nBorussia Dortmund survived a 2-1 defeat away to Atletico Madrid in Spain but knocked out Los Colchoneros with a 4-2 victory at home. The Black-Yellows then achieved a narrow 1-0 home win against Paris Saint-Germain and secured another 1-0 victory in Paris, knocking out the French giants and achieved back-to-back clean sheets in this round.\n\nIn addition, we witnessed rare moments where Real Madrid forward Vinicius Junior and Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels both secured back-to-back Player of the Match Awards in the semi-finals.\n\nThe 23-year-old Brazilian has earned five attacking returns in his last four Champions League games, highlighted by a brace against Bayern Munich in the semi-finals.\n\nWith all of the top players out of the competition, Vinicius Junior is the most reliable captain for the Champions League final, where he hopes to secure Real Madrid's 15th trophy.\n\nIt's not often that a defender is recommended for captaincy. However, with 47 points accrued in his last five Champions League outings, Mats Hummels is currently leading in UCL Fantasy with a total of 91 points.\n\nHummels tops all defensive statistics with 114 ball recoveries, 34 tackles won, and six clean sheets for Borussia Dortmund. These stats are crucial for earning bonus points. If the final ends in a goal-less draw, Hummels would be a compelling choice for the armband.\n\nSince rejoining his former side Borussia Dortmund on loan in January, Jadon Sancho's career has lighted back up, as evidenced by his 12 dribbles completed in a game against Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-finals.\n\nAfter being overlooked by England for UEFA Euro 2024, Sancho is ready to help the Black-Yellows win their first Champions League title this weekend. The Englishman might provide UCL fantasy managers with a cutting edge and stands out as a top differential in the final.\n\nApproaching the final day of the Champions League campaign, fantasy managers are only allowed to bring in five players. To this extent, it limits the selection made, especially for folks like myself who have at least four or more Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain players who have been knocked out.\n\nReal Madrid - Assuming most managers already have Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham on their fantasy teams, here are the top-five picks from Real Madrid: Antonio Rudiger, Toni Kroos, Rodrygo, Federico Valverde and Dani Carvajal.\n\nBorussia Dortmund - I expect a good number of managers have Mats Hummels or Ian Maatsen selected, and here are my top-five picks for the final: Niclas Fullkrug, Julian Brandt, Marcel Sabitzer, Jadon Sancho, and Gregor Kobel.\n\nIf you still have any of wildcard or limitless chips left, now could be a perfect time to use it and get in those recommended players from Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid to bolster your fantasy team.\n\nThe latest update offers a detailed look at the injury situation and status of important players from the two teams gearing up for the UCL final.\n\nReal Madrid players David Alaba and Aurelien Tchouameni will be unavailable due to injuries, while top goalkeeper Andriy Lunin has missed out on team training for four days in a row due to illness. He will travel to London with the Real Madrid squad, though he remains a doubt for the final.\n\nFor Borussia Dortmund, Julien Duranville and Ramy Bensebaini will be out of action owing to injuries, and Sebastien Haller was considered doubtful but made the final squad list going to England. There appears to be some fitness concerns surrounding Niklas Sule; however, he is also available for selection.\n\nIt is worth noting that Toni Kroos and Marco Reus will play their farewell matches for their respective teams and say their final goodbyes at Wembley Stadium in London. Don't forget to make your transfer before the deadline. Good luck to everyone.", "source": {"uri": "rotoballer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "rotoballer.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fpl_manual@rotoballer.com", "name": "Fpl Manual", "type": "author",

Wembley Stadium in England is the setting for Germany's Borussia Dortmund to face... Spain's Real Madrid. So close.\n\nOf course, Madrid are in the final yet again. This will be their eighth appearance in the Champions League decider since the turn of the century as they look to extend their dominance of the competition with a 15th European title (only one other club, AC Milan of Italy, has even managed seven) -- and their sixth in 10 years.\n\nEven the kindest statistical models and betting companies have Madrid as overwhelming favourites to get their hands on the trophy Manchester City lifted last year, but Dortmund have been writing a compelling underdog story in Europe this season where its last chapter be the best one of the lot.\n\nWho will be most threatening in transition? Can Dortmund keep Madrid's left flank quiet? Is this the most balanced Madrid side in recent memory?\n\nAllow The Athletic to provide a definitive preview of the 2023-24 Champions League final...\n\nBorussia Dortmund will be looking to exorcise some demons as they return to Wembley for another Champions League final 11 years after their 2-1 defeat to fellow Germans Bayern Munich there in the 2012-13 fixture, when a team managed by Jurgen Klopp was undone by a late Arjen Robben winner.\n\nDortmund fans will be hoping Edin Terzic's side present the European version of themselves on Saturday night rather than this season's comparably disappointing domestic one. It has been a confusing season for the club, reaching the Champions League final but finishing fifth in the Bundesliga, 26 points adrift of title winners Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nEven looking beyond their points tally, Dortmund's expected goal difference -- which measures the quality of chances a side has created and conceded -- of 0.3 per 90 minutes was also fifth-best in the German top flight.\n\nTheir Jekyll-and-Hyde season was best encapsulated during the week they qualified for the Champions League final, following up a 2-0 aggregate victory over French champions Paris Saint-Germain with a 3-0 loss against relegation candidates Mainz just four days later.\n\nThat is not to say that the omens should be against Dortmund, as there have been plenty of sides who have struggled domestically but become a different animal on the European stage -- Liverpool (2004-05), Chelsea (2011-12), and Madrid themselves (1997-98 and 1999-2000) being the most salient examples in recent times.\n\nDortmund did not just scrape through the competition's Group of Death containing PSG, Newcastle United and AC Milan -- they won it, making their navigation through the knockout phase comparably easier than what was happening on the other side of the draw.\n\nPSV Eindhoven (round of 16), Atletico Madrid (quarter-final) and PSG all provided stern tests across two legs, but there is little doubt that Terzic's side earned a kinder route to the final after that tricky group stage.\n\nDortmund's journey to Wembley has been underpinned by their collective effort. Terzic's side have spread the goals around when on the European stage, with 12 players contributing to their total of 17 -- Niclas Fullkrug leads the way with just three.\n\nAfter an initial shift to a back three for their first group game against PSG, Dortmund have largely set up in a 4-2-3-1 shape in their 12 European fixtures this season so far. Emre Can will often drop between the centre-backs in build-up, allowing the full-backs to have a higher starting position as the other midfielders -- typically Marcel Sabitzer and Julian Brandt -- rotate vertically and their wide players stay on the last line of the opposition defence.\n\nFullkrug has been the one to spearhead the attack, with pace in wide areas being provided by Karim Adeyemi, Donyell Malen and, in the knockout phase, a rejuvenated Jadon Sancho, who rejoined the club in January on loan from Manchester United, two and a half years after leaving for Old Trafford.\n\nA lot of Dortmund's threat in that semi-final against PSG came through Sancho -- particularly in the first leg at home. The 24-year-old's 18 attempted take-ons that night were the second most by any player in a single game in the Champions League this season, with his 12 completed dribbles being the most from any individual in a Champions League semi-final since Lionel Messi in 2008 (for Barcelona against Manchester United).\n\nSancho's \"cage football\" style comes alive when Dortmund tap into their transitional attacking approach. Even accounting for the number of games played, their direct attacks (as a proxy of counter-attacking play) have been among the highest in this year's Champions League. Particularly during the knockout stage, it has been Sancho and Adeyemi -- often found by the attacking creativity of Brandt -- who have led the charge on goal.\n\nUnfortunately for Terzic's side, they are up against an equally transitional side in Madrid, whose six goals from fast breaks in Europe -- more than any other team -- outline just how punishing they can be when a match opens up. If the final descends into a basketball-style game of back-and-forth, you would suspect it will suit the 14-time European champions a little more.\n\nDortmund are likely to need those pacy wingers to tuck in and drop back to support their full-backs, in the same manner that they did in the second leg against PSG in Paris. It was not uncommon to see Dortmund forming a situational back five at times that night, as Adeyemi...\n\n...and Sancho had the defensive awareness to counteract the threat of the opposition wingers by condensing the space in wide areas.\n\nOut of possession, Dortmund's success in this year's competition has been grounded in their defensive solidity and compactness, having conceded just nine goals in their 12 matches and kept six clean sheets -- their most in the Champions League since 1997-98, when they were defending their European title and got to the semi-finals before losing to... Real Madrid.\n\nSure, they might have ridden their luck at times, with PSG hitting the woodwork on six occasions without scoring once across the two semi-final legs. Yes, PSG's second-leg xG tally of 3.3 was the highest of any team in the Champions League this season without finding the net. But in knockout competitions, a dollop of luck is par for the course, and Dortmund earned theirs with some staunch defending led by one man in particular -- Mats Hummels.\n\nNo player logged more than Hummels' 10 clearances, four tackles and three interceptions during the semi-final's second leg, and his headed goal that night made him the oldest German (aged 35 years and 143 days) to score a goal in a Champions League knockout match.\n\nHummels and fellow stalwart Marco Reus, who is leaving the club this summer, are the only remaining players who played for Dortmund in the 2013 final (Hummels had three seasons with Bayern in between but returned in 2019), and they will be hoping to exonerate the ill-feeling of that loss at Wembley more than a decade on.\n\nThat defensive compactness led by Hummels will be crucial if they are to find a way to win against Madrid.\n\nExpect to see plenty of examples below of their tight shape, with Terzic empowering his team to be comfortable out of possession and ready to spring a counter-attack when the moment is right.\n\nWhat might make that difficult is that their illustrious opponents have more than one way of breaking you down.\n\nIf you glance through Madrid's goals in this year's competition, you would struggle to find too much of a pattern in the way they score. Cutbacks, counter-attacks, long-rangers, headers, moments of individual brilliance, they are all there, and do you know what the best part is? They don't even need to be playing well to score.\n\nMadrid thrive in moments of suffering, and it feels as though so many of their goals have come against the run of play, having arguably ridden their luck for long periods in each of their knockout tie against RB Leipzig, Manchester City and Bayern.\n\nYou know the script by now, but Carlo Ancelotti's side have a knack for making the unpredictable... well, predictable. Just when the opposition feel like they have Madrid in a chokehold, they find a way to wriggle out. Like any James Bond film, you know what is going to happen, but it does not make watching it unfold any less exciting.\n\nThis makes it rather difficult to offer too many reliable tactical patterns, but Ancelotti's use of a 4-4-2 diamond in possession has allowed plenty of rotations at the top end of the field. Unsurprisingly, those rotations are skewed towards the left flank.\n\nIn the Champions League this season, 42 per cent of Madrid's attacking touches have been channelled down their left third of the pitch as Vinicius Junior and Rodrygo take it in turns to face up and torment the opposition full-back.\n\nNo player has attempted more take-ons than Vinicius Jr's 184 since the start of last season, so you can understand why his team-mates will look to him to cause havoc -- but that left-sided dominance is not just about their No 7.\n\nOf course, there will be occasions where it is best to give Vinicius Jr the space and freedom to attack on his own and isolate opposition defenders before darting past them. In the second of their semi-final with Bayern at the Bernabeu, the 23-year-old's 14 take-ons were comfortably more than he's had in any other Champions League game all season, as he had the beating of right-back Joshua Kimmich.\n\nHowever, Madrid will also overload that left side with their best technical players as they bounce the ball through the lines and bear down on goal.\n\nYou will be equally likely to see Toni Kroos pull into the left half-space, with Rodrygo pulling to that touchline as Vinicius Jr rolls inside, while Jude Bellingham will drift over to support with runs that often drag opposition defenders with him.\n\nThat trio of Bellingham, Vinicius Jr and Rodrgyo have undoubtedly been Madrid's strongest attacking players this season. Our eyes can see it, and statistical models seemingly support it.\n\nTwenty First Group is a sports intelligence firm that advises clubs, leagues and investors, and its player model generates ratings for over 145,000 players worldwide across 250 competitions. These ratings are calculated based on factors such as the strength of a player's team, their position, their playing time, and their contribution towards their team's attack or defence.\n\nAnalysing the distribution of these ratings across this year's Madrid squad -- with a minimum of 180 La Liga minutes played -- is rather revealing.\n\nThe boxplot graphic below shows this spread of ratings, with the white line reflecting the average player rating in the squad, with most of its members falling within the middle 50 per cent of the group (shown by the gold box).\n\nInterestingly, that quality gap from Dani Ceballos (lowest rating) to Vinicius Jr (highest rating) is notably small when compared with previous Madrid squads across the past decade.\n\nBased on Twenty First Group's model, Madrid's 2014-15 iteration had the strongest average player quality, with this year's squad only good enough to be their sixth-best since 2013-14 -- and the fourth-best one to reach a Champions League final. However, this year's distribution of ratings (based on the standard deviation, for those wondering) is the most well-balanced it has been across this period, shown by the tighter boxplot below.\n\nLosing Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema in recent years will undoubtedly weaken any side, but Ancelotti has overseen a rebuild that is packed with youthful exuberance and high technical quality, even as the likes of Kroos and Luka Modric sail off into the sunset.\n\n\"The attitude and commitment (of the players) has allowed us to have a fantastic season,\" Ancelotti said this week. \"There's also individual quality, but (Madrid great Alfredo) Di Stefano's quote ('No player is as good as everyone combined') is the best quote.\"\n\nFor a club synonymous with signing galacticos and superstars to wear a white shirt, having the highest floor has been as important as having the highest ceiling among Madrid's latest generation -- with Ceballos being the best \"weakest player\" of any Madrid squad in the past 12 seasons, according to Twenty First Group's player rating model.\n\nSure, one of Vinicius Jr, Bellingham and Rodrygo is likely to grab the headlines on Saturday, but there is a steeliness to Madrid that runs right through the squad.\n\nIt is a key reason why their Bond-esque escapology acts have become so normalised.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_carey@nytimes.com", "name": "Mark Carey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mats_Hummels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mats Hummels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karim_Adeyemi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Karim Adeyemi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emre_Can", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emre Can"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

This time, Madrid faces off against one of the more unexpected opponents in recent memory. Borussia Dortmund made its first final since 2013, which ended in a loss to bitter rivals Bayern Munich.\n\nWe don't have much to go off of in terms of history between these two sides. These teams last faced off in the competition in the 2017 group stage.\n\nFor Dortmund, it's a massive overachievement to reach this final. This core of players came so close to winning the Bundesliga last season but has not won a trophy since 2021.\n\nOn the injury front, midfielder Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni is out and goalkeeper Andriy Lunin is likely to sit for Real Madrid. Thibaut Courtois is likely to start in goal and has not conceded a goal since returning from his injury issues this season including a 10-save match on May 14 against Deportivo Alav\u00e9s. Courtois was arguably man of the match in the most recent UCL final Madrid was a part of two years ago against Liverpool. There is some hesitancy to trust a player like this after a long period of absence. However, with the recent build-up in minutes, the argument for trusting one of the world's best can't be ignored in a match of this magnitude.\n\nIt's also worth watching for the final matches of a number of long-time players at these clubs. Toni Kroos is leaving Madrid after this season and Luka Modri\u0107 could be as well. Marco Reus is also playing his final match for Dortmund.\n\nMadrid is of course a massive favorite. BetMGM's odds for \"lift the trophy\" have Madrid at a staggering -300, giving them an implied win chance of 75 percent. Dortmund is +230.\n\nTo find more value on this game, I like going with same-game parlays. A Madrid win and over 1.5 goals is listed at -115. This is a rather safe play if you anticipate Los Blancos to win. This match can be a cagey affair with chances few and far between, but a relatively small ask of two goals is doable. If you're willing to bump the over to 2.5 with a Madrid wins, the odds shift to +130.\n\nThere is a sneaky solid price on both teams to score and either team to win in regulation (+140). If you anticipate goals and you can see a winner but are not sure which one, this bet is right up your alley.\n\nUltimately, I think Real Madrid win this 2-1 with Vinicius Jr. and Jude Bellingham scoring the goals for Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti lifts his fifth Champions League trophy, whilst Kroos and Modri\u0107 ride off in the sunset with their fifth and sixth UCL trophies.\n\nI am hard-pressed to think Dortmund can win this match within the 90 minutes. Even if this match manages to go into extra time, it becomes even more difficult to go against Real Madrid. Madrid has proven time and time again that it is the most inevitable team in all of sports. It just never feels like a good time to pick against them.\n\nBoth Olympiacos and Atalanta pulled off massive upsets in the finals of the other European competitions, but Madrid hasn't lost a Champions League final since 1981, a 1-0 defeat against Liverpool.\n\nPicking Dortmund in regular time is at +400, but there aren't many scenarios to pick from with Dortmund winning so if I can't pinpoint that type of scenario I would keep it basic and take the +230 to lift the trophy.\n\nI like pairing Real Madrid winning with a player scoring. Jude Bellingham is the primary penalty taker for Real Madrid, and, him scoring with a Madrid win sits at +160.\n\nThere is some value to be had in general with these goal-scorer markets for Real Madrid, but be careful. Arda G\u00fcler, who has barely played to start this season, is sitting at +160 for an anytime goal and, likely, he doesn't even feature in this match. Joselu (+140) and Rodrygo (+200) are bigger threats. Those odds have better value.\n\nI don't have a strong feeling towards any player for Dortmund. Reus, Julian Brandt and Karim Adeyemi are all sitting at two goals during this campaign with Niclas F\u00fcllkrug being their top scorer in the competition with two goals. F\u00fcllkrug is sitting as Dortmund's most likely scorer at +275. Most of Dortmund's lineup is a longer shot given how heavily favored Madrid is in the match.\n\nI also like over 9.5 on corners. It's -135, but has happened in five of six knockout matches for Real Madrid. Real Madrid's total on corners is -120 for over 5.5 corners. They have only gone over this number just once in the knockout phase whereas Dortmund has gone over 4.5 (+115) in half of its knockout matches. I like Dortmund's number.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF",

He's also the author of \"Net Gains: Inside the Beautiful Game's Analytics Revolution.\"\n\nEveryone knows Real Madrid are a heavy favorite to win the Champions League for an even-bigger-record 15th time Saturday.\n\nThey're Real Madrid, of course, and they're taking on Borussia Dortmund, who just finished fifth in the German Bundesliga. Per ESPN Bet, Madrid have a 75% chance of lifting the trophy, while Dortmund are 1-in-4 to win their second European Cup. That makes Madrid somewhere close to the biggest favorite of the past 20 years.\n\nBut it's still only one game, and anything can happen. Just ask Manchester City, who were taken down in the 2021 Champions League final by Chelsea, the team that finished fourth in their same league. Or Bayern Munich, who also fell to Chelsea in 2012, the year that the Blues finished sixth in the Premier League team. Or, heck, Man City, who lost the FA Cup last week to Manchester United, a team that finished in eighth place in the Premier League, just days after City won the same league.\n\nThese single-game finals tend to be decided by individual moments -- whether greatness or error -- from individual players rather than tactical triumphs. So, ahead of Saturday's Champions League final, let's rank the 30 best players between these two teams who will decide the next Champions League winner.\n\n1. Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, forward, Real Madrid\n\nSomehow, a young, flashy, uber-productive, trophy-winning Brazilian winger for Real Madrid has become ... Underrated? While his defensive impact has started to wane as he's aged closer to his prime years of 24 to 28, he's the best player in the world at perhaps the deepest position in the world: left wing.\n\nNo one's better at carrying the ball, and no one who comes close to his ball-carrying contribution can also come close to his attacking production. He impacts every game he plays, and I'm not convinced that he isn't the best player in the world.\n\n2. Toni Kroos, midfielder, Real Madrid\n\nWhat a way to go out. For the 10th year in a row, Kroos has played more than 2,000 league minutes. Per Michael Imburgio's DAVIES model, which essentially puts a value on every on-ball action that happens across the field, the 34-year-old German added 4.97 goals with his build-up passing. That's nearly a goal more than second-best Rodri (4.07), who played 800 more minutes for Manchester City.\n\nDespite all of Madrid's young talent in midfield, that's going to be near-impossible to replace.\n\n3. Jude Bellingham, midfielder, Real Madrid\n\nWhy not No. 1? He outperformed his expected goals by 7.7 -- he scored 18 non-penalty goals from 10.3 xG. If that kind of finishing form -- the third highest over-performance of anyone in Europe -- is real, then he's the best player in the world. No question about it. Of course, no one finishes that well over a long run, and he underperformed his xG in all of his previous four professional seasons.\n\nHe's an incredible player, but the current reality is likely closer to the one we saw in the second half of the season, rather than the first.\n\n4. Rodrygo, forward, Real Madrid\n\nHis attacking production dipped a bit this year, but he still came in over 0.5 goals+assists per 90 minutes, and I think some of that comes down to him having to facilitate and vacate space for Bellingham to run into. Rodrygo carried and passed the ball upfield more than he ever has this past season. He finds a way to fit into whatever talent is around him; he's just a winning player.\n\n5. Federico Valverde, midfielder, Real Madrid\n\nSpeaking of winning players, Valverde is a brilliant, dynamic, athletic, versatile player who makes his teammates better. He's the exact kind of guy that Madrid lacked in the first Galacticos era: a superstar role player who not only fills in the gaps behind all the bigger names but can also contribute decisive moments by himself. My one gripe:\n\nTrade some of those terrible shots from outside the box for a couple more runs into the penalty area.\n\n6. Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni, midfielder, Real Madrid\n\nIt feels like we still haven't really seen Tchouam\u00e9ni fully realized at Madrid. Kroos somehow getting better with age lessened the need for him to contribute in build-up play, while injuries across the backline have required him to play out of position next to Antonio Rudiger at center back.\n\nAt the same time, he was playing out of position at center back at 24 years old for a team that won LaLiga and took down both Manchester City and Bayern Munich. My guess is he'll be the one asked to fill the Kroos-shaped void next season.\n\n7. Antonio R\u00fcdiger, center back, Real Madrid\n\nHe flourished at Chelsea -- but that was in a back three. In his first season at Madrid, he wasn't always a first-choice starter. In his second season at Madrid ... He's pretty much been the only healthy center back and he's been immense playing for a team that doesn't really do all that much to protect its center backs. Two Champions Leagues in four years, with two different teams, would be a pretty nice haul.\n\nI'm not sure this is a popular opinion, but I love this guy. Bundesliga center backs are notoriously hard to assess because of how different the league is, stylistically, to everyone else. But if you want a defender who is going to help you win games with the ball, there aren't many better than Schlotterbeck. He's been starting Bundesliga games since he was a teenager, and he'll still only be 24 at the start of next season.\n\n9. Eduardo Camavinga, midfielder, Real Madrid\n\nCamavinga, meanwhile, will only be 21 at the start of next season. He has a ridiculous amount of minutes under his belt already, and I'm pretty confident he's going to be a star -- if he isn't already. The only hesitation is that he still hasn't become a full-time starter at Madrid. If the semifinals are any indication, he'll be coming off the bench at Wembley, too.\n\n10. Mats Hummels, center back, Borussia Dortmund\n\nHummels is 35 years old. Hummels has won more tackles than any player in the Champions League this season. Hummels has intercepted more passes than any player in the Champions League this season.\n\nI just can't quit him. Out of any Dortmund player, he's the one most capable of taking over the match and deciding the result on his own. No player has completed more than five successful take-ons against Madrid this season, but one of those players was Bayern Munich's Jamal Musiala in the first leg of the semifinals. And his teammate, Leroy San\u00e9, completed four of his own in the same game. In the first leg of the Champions League semifinal against PSG, Sancho completed 13.\n\n12. Gregor Kobel, goalkeeper, Borussia Dortmund\n\nThis is a different Dortmund team than you're used to seeing. With an average age, weighted by minutes played, of 26.8, Dortmund are older than your average Bundesliga side.\n\nThere's no Sancho 1.0, or Erling Haaland, or Bellingham -- the superstar prospect who will obviously leave the club sometime soon. But someone should take a look at Kobel, the 26-year-old who stood on his head against PSG and has allowed nearly seven goals fewer than expected in his three years at Dortmund.\n\n13. Luka Modric, midfielder, Real Madrid\n\nOn a per-minute basis, 38-year-old Modric isn't too different from 31-year-old Modric -- except for the part where 38-year-old Modric is not expected to start the Champions League final.\n\n14. Julian Brandt, attacking midfielder, Borussia Dortmund\n\nHe's one of Dortmund's most important players, a link between midfield and attack who can score and create a fair bit on his own. Outside of Schlotterbeck, no Dortmund player featured in more minutes this season, either. At the same time, I'm not sure he'd get much playing time at all if he were on Real Madrid's roster.\n\n15. Whoever is starting at goalkeeper for Real Madrid\n\nThis was a tricky one. Andriy Lunin has great shot-stopping numbers over a decent sample of games that extends beyond just this season and beyond just Madrid. Thibaut Courtois, meanwhile, is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, but he's just coming back from a succession of serious knee injuries.\n\nESPN reports suggest that Courtois is in line to take the job back from Lunin and start against Dortmund. Given there's still uncertainty over the form of Courtois and it's not yet guaranteed that he will play, we're splitting the difference and putting the Madrid goalkeeper right in the middle of the rankings.\n\n16. Brahim D\u00edaz, attacking midfielder, Real Madrid\n\nAt Milan, Diaz played a lot of minutes without producing much. At Madrid, Diaz played much fewer minutes and produced much more. He's the ideal profile of an off-the-bench attacker for a big club -- energetic, but also not so expensive or accomplished that he'll want to leave if he doesn't frequently start matches.\n\n17. Ian Maatsen, fullback, Borussia Dortmund\n\nMaybe he should be higher? Maatsen's only season of top-flight performance is his current half-year loan spell with Dortmund. But he's almost immediately become one of the club's most important contributors since heading to Germany. He's done a nice job functioning in that kind of fullback-midfielder hybrid role where you're not really an overlapping outlet, but instead helping to progress the ball up the field.\n\n18. Marcel Sabitzer, midfielder, Borussia Dortmund\n\nSabitzer is a strange player. He's technically one of Dortmund's two holding midfielders, but he's rarely dictating play from deep -- that's for the center backs to do. Instead, a couple times per match, he'll just pop up in incredibly important areas with the ball at his feet, with the potential to make a decisive play that either pushes Dortmund a step closer to scoring a goal or provides the opposition with an opportunity to counterattack in the other direction.\n\n19. Niclas F\u00fcllkrug, center forward, Borussia Dortmund\n\nFor his career, he's something like a goal or an assist every other game-type striker. And that's about it. He'll have a couple moments of savvy holdup play every match, but he's ultimately on the ball very little, receiving very few forward passes, and not even getting too many touches in the penalty area, either.\n\nThere aren't many hulking target strikers around these days, though, and I think Fullkrug's unique profile has thrown off some of Dortmund's European opponents.\n\n20. Joselu, center forward, Real Madrid\n\nWith both Diaz and Joselu, Real Madrid this season have been a small-scale study in both team and sub effects. When you play with better players, it's easier to produce. And when you play most of your minutes off the bench against tired legs, it's easier to produce. When you do both? Your goals+assists rate jumps from a career mark of 0.4 per 90 all the way up to 0.64 per 90.\n\n21. Dani Carvajal, fullback, Real Madrid\n\nI have a feeling I might regret putting Carvajal here on the list. At this stage in his career, the 32-year-old Carvajal feels like he's either karate-chopping a volley into the upper corner, or pleading with the referee not to send him off for his fifth-straight foul on whatever winger just ran past him. He tends to show up in finals, though.\n\n22. Emre Can, midfielder, Borussia Dortmund\n\nHe's the only safe passer in the team, but pretty much all of the valuable forward passing comes from players in the backline. Along with the center backs, he'll be tasked with tracking any of Bellingham's runs through the middle.\n\n23. Nacho, center back, Real Madrid\n\nAll things considered, the 34-year-old club lifer was at best Madrid's fourth-choice center back coming into this season, behind the injured duo of \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o and David Alaba, Rudiger and maybe even Tchouameni, too. Although Militao has made an incredible recovery from a torn ACL earlier this season, it seems like Nacho will still get the nod Saturday.\n\nWhile we're here, though: A fully healthy Militao would've comfortably slid into the top 10 of these rankings.\n\n23. Ferland Mendy, fullback, Real Madrid\n\nHe keeps the ball when he gets it. Other than that, he's not creating anything on the attacking end and rarely winning the ball back defensively. If Dortmund are going to win, it seems like they'll be pressing the Sancho-on-Mendy mismatch, over and over and over again.\n\n25. Karim Adeyemi, forward, Borussia Dortmund\n\nHe's incredibly fast, and he also trips over the ball multiple times per match. Adeyemi is the Luis Mendoza of European soccer.\n\n26. Donyell Malen, forward, Borussia Dortmund\n\nPer the DAVIES model, there are 10 players between these two teams who have added at least 0.1 goals per 90 minutes: Kroos, Vini, Bellingham, Rodrygo, Modric, Hummels, Brahim, Valverde, Schlotterbeck and Malen.\n\nMalen, the 25-year-old Dutchman, comes from the Marcus Rashford mold of wingers: stay high, and when you get the ball, drive it into the box and rip a shot. Ironically, that profile balances nicely with Sancho's touch-heavy approach on the other wing.\n\nWere Malen healthy, he'd be significantly higher on this list, but a succession of leg injuries in April mean that he hasn't played 90 minutes in a match since St. Patrick's Day.\n\n27. Lucas V\u00e1zquez, fullback, Real Madrid\n\nI don't know if he'd hold up over a starter's workload for a full season, but he's become a quite effective backup fullback as he's aged deeper into his 30s. Seems bizarre to write this out, but Real Madrid would be totally fine if Vazquez had to play right back in the Champions League final.\n\n28. Niklas S\u00fcle, defender, Borussia Dortmund\n\nMaybe there's a world where he starts the final, in an effort to slow down Vini, but the gigantic defender just hasn't been able to string together any consistency over his career. After a breakout season with Bayern Munich as a 22-year-old in 2018-19, he's broken the 2,000-minute mark in just one of the past five seasons.\n\n29. Marco Reus, forward, Borussia Dortmund\n\nThis is how aging tends to work for attacking wingers: At age 34, Reus is averaging his highest pass completion percentage of the past seven seasons while attempting the fewest take-ons over that same stretch. He's been quite effective in limited minutes this season -- nearly 0.8 goals+assists per 90 -- but his lack of burst has been evident against better competition.\n\n30. Julian Ryerson, fullback, Borussia Dortmund\n\nIf you're wondering where the Champions League might be won and lost, No. 1 on this list will likely be directly matched up against No. 30 on Saturday.",

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nBorussia Dortmund will battle Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League Final on Saturday afternoon as both clubs look to secure the title of the best team in Europe.\n\nThe German club has only won the Champions League one time in 1996-97 and last appeared in the final in 2012-13. Meanwhile, Madrid holds the record for the most competition championships and is looking to add yet another to its gaudy count.\n\nHere's a look at our Champions League Final odds, picks and predictions:\n\nChampions League Final odds and preview\n\nThe match pits the unassuming, blue-collared nature of Dortmund -- not even the largest club in Germany -- against the Goliath that has ruled the competition for decades.\n\nDortmund enters the match fresh off a 4-0 win over SV Darmstadt 98 in the Bundesliga. They beat PSG 1-0 in both semifinal legs and only tasted defeat twice in 12 Champions League matches en route to the final.\n\nMadrid tied both of its recent matches against Real Betis and Villareal and did not lose a Champions League match. However, it didn't dominate its opponents, as it managed three wins (one on penalties) and three draws in its last six matches in the competition.\n\nDortmund's job will be to remain resolute in defense and deal with the speed of the Madrid attack. They'll also need to use their consistent solidarity to overcome the Spanish side's experience in the competition.\n\nThis will be the final match at Dortmund for club legend Marco Reus, who has been with the team since 2012. Madrid's Toni Kroos will also retire at the conclusion of the match after amassing one of the best resumes of any midfielder.\n\nThe match will be broadcast on CBS at 3 p.m. Eastern on Saturday, June 1.\n\nDortmund vs. Real Madrid predictions: Dortmund to lift the cup (+250 or better)\n\nMadrid has the better team on paper and more experience -- that much is true. But Dortmund was more impressive in the semifinal with consecutive victories over PSG and also has more added motivation from their drought in the competition compared to Madrid's dominance.\n\nThe German club is quick on the counter-attack and has forwards that can have a run at the Madrid defense, which often sits higher up the pitch because they control possession for so long.\n\nThe battle of the midfield will go a long way to determining the winner. Madrid has the technical advantage but likes to get players forward and could suffer in the engine room later in the match.\n\nThe Spanish side has also needed late-game moments to propel them to the final. They deserve credit for coming up clutch when needed, but Dortmund has quietly taken care of business without ever breaking their unassuming mold.\n\nChampions League Final prop bets: Real Madrid over 4.5 corners (+132 or better)\n\nDortmund's center-backs, Mats Hummels and Nico Schlotterbeck, aren't the quickest pairing in the world, and Julian Ryerson and Ian Maatsen on the outside aren't as quick as Vinicius Junior, Rorygo or Federico Valverde. As such, attacking the wings will be crucial for Madrid.\n\nThe German team is likely going to play a lower defensive line out of possession and concede the ball as they often did against PSG (30.5% possession in the second leg, 42.7% in the first). That should give Madrid more room on the wings to explore.\n\nThe concern is that a lower defensive block could take the sting out of Madrid's attack, but their wide players love to have a run at defenders and should help get this over the total.\n\nBest Champions League betting sites\n\nYou must be over 21 to play.

Fans have selected the Team of the Tournament, which showcases top talent such as Vinicius Jr and Kylian Mbappe. Toni Kroos is included as he prepares for an emotional final game in a Real Madrid jersey, capping off his illustrious career on a high note.\n\nNew champions of Europe will be crowned as Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund face off in the 2024 Champions League final at Wembley Stadium.\n\nRelated Predicting Dortmund and Real Madrid's Starting Line-Ups for UCL Final Both Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid can field great teams for the 2024 Champions League final, despite both sides missing players through injury.\n\nThere will be an abundance of world-class talent on display, with both sides possessing some of the best in the game who will be looking to stamp their authority on proceedings. In fact, a recent post from TNT Sports on social media shows that seven players who will feature in Saturday's grand finale have been selected for the fans' team of the tournament.\n\nConsisting of some of the brightest young stars and players having their last hurrah, this XI is one that would probably win the European Cup with ease if they played together.\n\nFans' Champions League Team of the Tournament\n\nPosition\n\nPlayer\n\nClub\n\nGK\n\nAndriy Lunin\n\nReal Madrid\n\nRB\n\nJoshua Kimmich\n\nBayern Munich\n\nCB\n\nMats Hummels\n\nBorussia Dortmund\n\nCB\n\nAntonio Rudiger\n\nReal Madrid\n\nLB\n\nIan Maatsen\n\nBorussia Dortmund\n\nCDM\n\nRodri\n\nManchester City\n\nCM\n\nJude Bellingham\n\nReal Madrid\n\nCM\n\nToni Kroos\n\nReal Madrid\n\nRW\n\nVinicius Jr\n\nReal Madrid\n\nST\n\nHarry Kane\n\nBayern Munich\n\nLW\n\nKylian Mbappe\n\nParis Saint-Germain\n\nGK - Andriy Lunin Real Madrid\n\nIf anyone had asked Andriy Lunin at the start of the season what his Champions League experience would look like, it would be safe to assume this wouldn't be his answer. The Ukranian was always meant to be back-up to Thibaut Courtois. When the Belgian went down with an injury, Kepa Arrizabalaga came in to replace him.\n\nShaky performances from the Spaniard gave Lunin his chance, and he's never looked back, with his heroics against Manchester City in the quarter-final penalty shootout likely to remain a highlight of his career.\n\nRelated Man Utd Reach Agreement to Sign Andriy Lunin According to Nacional, the Red Devils have 'reached agreement' for the shot stopper's services. RB - Joshua Kimmich Bayern Munich\n\nThere had been much speculation surrounding the future of Joshua Kimmich throughout the season. It had been rumoured that his relationship with Thomas Tuchel was not a positive one and that the German could have been on his way to Liverpool in the summer.\n\nWith Tuchel leaving, news on this front has quietened down, much to the relief of many Bayern Munich fans. Kimmich is as reliable as ever and other than a torrid time against Vinicius Jr, he impressed every time he stepped out underneath the floodlights.\n\nCB - Mats Hummels Borussia Dortmund\n\nMats Hummels is a man who has rolled back the years this season, looking like a defender in the prime of his life rather than in his mid-thirties. The young Dortmund starlets have captured everyone's imagination this season, but without their leader in defence, they would perhaps not have reached such heights.\n\nNot only has the former Bavarian been a rock at the back, but he has also contributed in attack when it mattered most. His goal in the Parc de Prince ensured Dortmund made it to Wembley, where Hummels will be looking to make up for the last time he and Dortmund competed in a European Cup final at the home of English football.\n\nRelated 18 Best Defenders in World Football Right Now (Ranked) The 18 best defenders on the planet right now have been ranked in order CB - Antonio Rudiger Real Madrid\n\nThe fact that this isn't a centre-half pairing at this summer's European Championships beggars belief. Julian Nagelsmann had the two most in-form central defenders at his disposal and still decided that it was only worth selecting one of them for his squad.\n\nThe one he opted for was Antonio Rudiger, who has excelled in the Spanish capital. A previous winner with Chelsea, the 31-year-old has not only continued to prove his defensive prowess but has grown into a mature character in the absence of David Alaba. He is one-for-one in terms of Champions League final clean sheets. He'll be determined to keep that 100% record in the upcoming clash.\n\nLB - Ian Maatsen Borussia Dortmund\n\nIf the world had worked out differently, we could be talking about how Ian Maatsen was part of a Burnley team that were unceremoniously relegated from the Premier League this season. The Chelsea youngster starred for the Clarets during their 2023 promotion efforts and Vincent Kompany - now manager of Maatsen's great rivals Bayern Munich - was desperate to keep the Dutchman for another season.\n\nInstead, Maatsen was shipped out on loan and sent to a place that has been a hotbed for young talent for a long time. There, the 22-year-old showed his potential and has become one of the most exciting prospects in Europe.\n\nCDM - Rodri Manchester City\n\nDuring the early years of Pep Guardiola's reign at Manchester City, there was a fear that the Noisy Neighbours were never going to replace Fernandinho. Not only have they managed to do that, but they have found a player who almost never loses when he plays.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Rodri's unbeaten run lasted 74 games before he was finally defeated by Manchester United in the 2024 FA Cup final.\n\nFor all of City's attacking talent, history has proven that Rodri is the club's most influential player. The man who scored the only goal in last season's Champions League final has had yet another stellar campaign, even if he will not be able to get his hands on the trophy for a second time.\n\nRelated 15 Longest Unbeaten Runs for Premier League Players Some of the Premier League's best players have enjoyed entire seasons without defeat. Here's how Rodri compares... CM - Jude Bellingham Real Madrid\n\nWhat a debut season Jude Bellingham has had in the Spanish capital. Arriving as a teenager with the world at his feet, the former Birmingham City academy product arrived in Madrid, stuck his chest out and wore Zidane's number five shirt with the same swagger as the legendary Frenchman.\n\nThe 20-year-old will be holding the hopes of a nation in the palm of his hands this summer, but first, he will need to secure a European honour for his club when he lines up against his former employers on Saturday night. It is written in the stars for Bellingham to have his say.\n\nCM - Toni Kroos Real Madrid\n\nAlthough Saturday's final will all be about the prize at stake, it is undoubtedly going to be an emotional affair seeing Toni Kroos don the famous all-white jersey of Real Madrid one final time.\n\nThe German shocked everyone when he announced that he would be retiring at the end of the season, stating that his desire to leave whilst still at the top of his game was the driving factor behind his decision. There is no more fitting game in football for such a majestic midfielder to take his bow in club football after yet another magnificent tournament.\n\nRelated 14 Top Footballers That Retired Too Early Toni Kroos becomes the latest world-class footballer to announce a premature end to his incredible career. RW - Vinicius Jr Real Madrid\n\nOne of the favourites to walk away with the 2024 Ballon d'Or, Vinicius Jr already knows a thing or two about leading his team to Champions League victory. The Brazilian scored the only goal of the game the last time Los Blancos were victorious, and has played like a man possessed trying to guide them back to the top of European football.\n\nWith 10 goal contributions in nine games, the winger has dominated, such as in the aforementioned Bayern Munich tie where he had Kimmich not knowing where he was. One more game like that and Vinicius will have another Champions League in his trophy cabinet surpassing the tallies of legends such as Neymar and Ronaldinho.\n\nST - Harry Kane Bayern Munich\n\nHe may not have gotten his hands on the trophy he was desperate to get, but if Harry Kane's move to Bayern Munich reinforced anything, it is that he belongs on the Champions League stage. Kane is the joint top scorer in the competition this season, and it will likely stay that way unless Rodrygo or Vinicius manage to score four on Saturday.\n\nWhether or not next year will be Kane's year remains to be seen, but for now, he can focus on finding European success in the form of the Euros instead. The Englishman still had an extremely fruitful 2023/24 season in front of goal, even if he doesn't have anything shiny to show for it.\n\nLW - Kylian Mbappe Paris Saint-Germain\n\nIt wasn't the fairytale ending to his time at Paris Saint-Germain that he may have dreamed of, but Kylian Mbappe did ensure that he gave everything to their Champions League efforts this season. With eight goals, the Frenchman joined Kane as the top scorer of the 2023/24 competition, but he still fell a couple of hurdles short of lifting the trophy.\n\nNevertheless, the 25-year-old could still represent the European champions next season, with a move to Real Madrid expected to be finalised following his departure from the French capital. Surely then it will be a matter of time before Mbappe fulfills his destiny.\n\nAll statistics in this article are courtesy of Transfermarkt (Correct as of 31/05/2024)", "source": {"uri":

Jadon Sancho is expected to start the game for Dortmund and could cap off a difficult season in incredible fashion. Real Madrid's star-studded potential line-up, featuring the likes of Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr, means they are the overwhelming favourite\n\nWatch the UEFA Champions League Final exclusively live on TNT Sports and for free on discovery+ by signing up HERE .\n\nThe biggest match in the European club football calendar is nearly upon us, with the 2024 Champions League final set to kick off on Saturday 1st June. Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund both travel to London for the match at Wembley, aiming to add another European trophy to their collections.\n\nMadrid come into the tie as the overwhelming favourites, having dispatched Manchester City and Bayern Munich on their way to the final. Carlo Ancelotti's squad is brimming with talent, including the likes of Vinicius Jr and Jude Bellingham, just two incredible players in a star-studded squad.\n\nBut this is knockout football, where anything can happen. Dortmund, despite not having the firepower of their opponents, will be confident of securing an upset, especially after their win against Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-finals. Should they prevail against their Spanish competitors, then it will be only the second time they have won the Champions League in their history.\n\nRelated All 8 World-Class Players in the Champions League Final Ahead of the Champions League final, we take a look at eight stars that can be considered 'world-class' from Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund.\n\nSo, with the hype building and with supporters counting down the hours until the game gets underway, how will the teams shape up ahead of the game? Here is who might start for both teams, with the latest injury news all accounted for.\n\nBorussia Dortmund's Predicted Line-Up Jadon Sancho to start\n\nEdin Terzic is laregly untroubled by injuries ahead of Saturday's mammoth tie, with just two players certain to miss out. Julien Duranville and Ramy Bensebaini will be ruled out of the tie, while striker Sebastien Haller faces a race to be fit in time for kick-off. The Ivorian has struggled with an ankle issue since April and was only fit enough for a spot on the bench during both legs against PSG. He has not played since Dortmund's 2-1 win against Borussia Monchengladbach.\n\nBVB will likely select a similar line-up to the one that triumphed in the semi-finals. Gregor Kobel is a near-certainty to start, with Nico Schlotterbeck and Mats Hummels, who scored the winner in the semi-final second-leg starting in front of him. The veteran has enjoyed the finest Champions League campaign of his career, making more tackles per game (4.0) than anyone else in the competition this season.\n\nJulian Ryerson is predicted to start at right-back, and Ian Maatsen will line up on the opposite flank. Having failed to break into Chelsea's first team, the loanee now finds himself in the biggest match of his young career. It could be the Dutchman's final appearance in a black and yellow shirt, although speculation about a future permanent move back to the Signal Iduna Park continues to rage.\n\nIn front of the defence are the reliable midfield duo of Emre Can and Marcel Sabitzer, while Julian Brandt will play as the attack-minded creator. That means there is no starting place for Marco Reus, despite it being his final match for the club after 12 years at the club.\n\nKarim Adeyemi will start the match on the wing, and Terzic will be hoping that the dynamic winger's pace will cause Madrid's defence all sorts of trouble. And, Jadon Sancho, bouncing back from his failed stint at Manchester United, has the chance to silence all his doubters in the English capital. The 24-year-old has looked like a man re-born back in Germany, and could lift Europe's most prestigious trophy to cap off a topsy-turvy season.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Jadon Sancho completed 12 dribbles in the semi-final first leg against PSG, the most by a player in the Champions League since Lionel Messi for Barcelona vs Manchester United in April 2008 (16).\n\nEven without Haller's injury struggles, Niclas Fullkrug was always likely to start the match. The German international only has three goals in this season's competition, but his physicality caused PSG's defence all sorts of problems. However, he will need to be at his best if he is to do the same thing to Madrid's centre-backs.\n\nReal Madrid's Predicted Line-Up Courtois to start in goal\n\nAncelotti is fortunate enough to have pretty much his full squad available to choose from. Goalkeeper Andriy Lunin has suffered from flu this last week, so the Ukrainian will miss the match. Aurelien Tchouameni and David Alaba have also both been ruled out because of long-term injuries, but there is still so much talent left to pick from.\n\nLunin's illness means Thibaut Courtois will start in goal for Los Blancos. The Belgian, having missed most of the season because of two serious knee injuries, has said that he is ready to start and that he is feeling 100% ahead of the game.\n\nDani Carvajal, Antonio Rudiger, Nacho Fernandez and Ferland Mendy will all likely keep their places for the final, having played regularly during the final month of the domestic season. Eder Militao is an option to call upon too, but having missed a substantial chunk of the season because of a cruciate ligament injury, the Brazilian will only be turned to as an option from the bench.\n\nDespite Tchouameni's absence, Madrid are still utterly stacked in midfield. Jude Bellingham is a guaranteed starter, having bagged eight goal contributions so far in the tournament. Federico Valverde and Toni Kroos could both join him in the engine room, as the latter aims to sign off on his club football career with a sixth Champions League.\n\nAlthough Luka Modric's experience makes him a valuable asset in a high-pressure game, Eduardo Camavinga has played in three out of Los Blancos' last four matches, meaning that the Frenchman should take the fourth midfield spot. Ancelotti might turn to the Croatian or even talented youngster Arda Guler should he need a more creative spark instead of a midfield disruptor.\n\nLeading the line, though, are Brazilian duo Rodrygo and Vinicius Jr. With a combined 10 goals in the Champions League so far, the pace and lethal finishing of both men will cause Hummels and Schlotterbeck heaps of problems throughout. After his heroics against Bayern, Joselu could make an appearance from the bench should a focal point be needed.\n\nGiven the sheer amount of quality Madrid have in all areas of the pitch, it is no surprise to see them the favourites for them game. It will take a masterclass from Terzic and Dortmund for them to come out of the game with the silverware.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors":

season.\n\nHere, the PA news agency looks at some of the major talking points ahead of the game.\n\nEngland ace Jude ready to star for Real\n\nJude Bellingham will look to lead Real Madrid to victory (Isabel Infantes/PA)\n\nJude Bellingham has enjoyed a fine first campaign at Real Madrid having joined from Dortmund last summer and will be aiming to top it off with victory over his former club.\n\nThe 20-year-old asked for Zinedine Zidane's old number five shirt when he completed his move and he has certainly started to live up to the lofty expectations that come with such a request.\n\nWith 23 goals and 12 assists over the course of the campaign to date, the England midfielder could be key to Real lifting an unrivalled 15th European Cup.\n\nSancho has a point to prove\n\nJadon Sancho, centre, has helped Borussia Dortmund to the final (Frank Augstein/AP)\n\nAnother Englishman looking to make an impact on proceedings is Jadon Sancho, who has been in good form since returning to Dortmund on loan from Manchester United in January.\n\nThe 24-year-old struggled for consistency at Old Trafford and left under a cloud following a falling out with manager Erik ten Hag.\n\nSince then he has started to rebuild his reputation in Germany with some eye-catching performances en route to the Champions League final.\n\nAnd he will look to create a better personal memory at Wembley after missing in the penalty shoot-out defeat to Italy in the Euro 2020 final three years ago.\n\nKroos control\n\nToni Kroos will play his last club match at Wembley (Alvaro Barreintos/AP)\n\nAfter winning four Champions League titles and four LaLiga crowns during a trophy-laden decade in Madrid, midfielder Toni Kroos will play his final game for the club at Wembley.\n\nThe 34-year-old - who also won three league titles at Bayern Munich as well as the 2014 World Cup with Germany - is hanging up his boots after a home European Championship this summer.\n\nKroos will want to bow out in style as he aims for more silverware to cap a fine career.\n\nCan Bundesliga side upset the odds?\n\nBorussia Dortmund head coach Edin Terzic (PA Wire)\n\nWhile Real will be considered heavy favourites under the Wembley arch, Dortmund will be looking to upset the odds.\n\nHead coach Edin Terzic has filled numerous roles at the club and, in his second stint as manager, could deliver their first Champions League glory since 1997.\n\nAs a scout and coach in the club's academy he answered to former boss Jurgen Klopp but on Saturday he can go one better than the German, who was in charge when Dortmund last reached the final in 2013 - a 2-1 loss to Bayern Munich at Wembley.\n\nA former Potter looking to cast his magic\n\nJoselu endured a tough time at Stoke earlier in his career (Daniel Hambury/PA)\n\nMark Hughes is likely to have been rubbing his eyes in disbelief as he watched Joselu score two late goals to down Bayern Munich in the semi-finals.\n\nWelshman Hughes was the Stoke boss who signed the forward in the summer of 2015 but Joselu managed just four goals before being shipped out on loan - eventually returning to England for a similarly unimpactful two-year stay at Newcastle.\n\nHowever, having moved to the Bernabeu on loan from Espanyol this season, the 34-year-old wrote his name into Real folklore with his match-winning brace and now he will be hoping for a chance to repeat the feat at Wembley.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

What do our experts want to see and what will the score be?\n\nDortmund's path to the Champions League final at Wembley has been somewhat of a fairytale. Now for that fairytale ending? Standing in their way is nothing less than 14 times Champions League conquerors Real Madrid.\n\nMadrid go into Saturday's final as overwhelming favourites, but there's a sea of yellow ready to celebrate an almighty upset in Wembley. Telegraph Sport's football experts predict the outcome.\n\nDortmund's best hope of victory\n\nSam Wallace: Both sides have had minority possession in big knockout games. Real had 36 per cent at the Etihad in the quarter-final second leg and Dortmund just 33 per cent in Paris in the semi-final second leg. Real are a brilliant fast counter-attacking team who pounce on mistakes. Dortmund will seek to counterattack at Wembley as they did against PSG. That is the natural approach in a final of this nature that is obviously mismatched. The risk for Dortmund is that Real's attack simply overrun them.\n\nMike McGrath: Double up on Vinicius Junior. Yes, that might neglect focusing on Toni Kroos' passing or Jude Bellingham's late runs into the penalty area - but Vini Jr is just frightening to defend against and I would take a chance on letting others run off opponents to keep him quiet.\n\nJames Ducker: Defending compactly in a mid-to-low block and seeking to use their pace on the counter attack. Real should see a lot more of the ball than they did in their semi-final against Bayern and Dortmund need to be poised to strike decisively when the opportunity allows. Equally, I could see them having real problems with the quality of Real's attack.\n\nJohn Percy: Dortmund is all about the collective, as a team that is better than the sum of its parts. You have Jadon Sancho and Marcel Sabitzer both jettisoned by Manchester United, Ian Maatsen unwanted at Chelsea, plus Mats Hummels and Niklas Sule dumped by Bayern Munich. If they can be the team, they could - and it is a big could - secure a shock win.\n\nThe one thing I want to see\n\nWallace: Two great sides and great players on both - but we all like an upset. A Dortmund win would be good for the Champions League and European football. Like Real, they are a club majority-owned by their fans but unlike Real, their debt is tiny. They do not have access to the kind of long-term sales of future revenue which have funded Real's stadium renovation. In the 1990s, when Dortmund won their only European Cup/Champions League, nine different clubs from eight different countries - including Real - won the competition. In the last ten years, six clubs from only three nations have won it and none on the relatively modest budget Dortmund work to.\n\nMcGrath: Jadon Sancho enjoying his football and rising to the occasion at Wembley. He looked like he had a point to prove in the semi-finals and it would send a big message to Manchester United if he put in another big performance.\n\nDucker: A season that could not have started much worse for Jadon Sancho after his public and bitter falling out with Erik ten Hag could yet end with the England forward, on loan at Dortmund from Manchester United, with a Champions League winners' medal. It would be some story.\n\nPercy: Carlo Ancelotti's eyebrow in glorious high definition\n\nWhich player will take the limelight\n\nWallace: Judging by his semi-final performance, Vinicius Junior is the most in-form player in Europe. He should be the star.\n\nMcGrath: Andriy Lunin could be an unlikely hero, providing he recovers from flu in time. The \u20ac9 million signing from Zorya Luhansk in Ukraine has been loaned out to Leganes, Valladolid and Oviedo in recent seasons but has seized his chance this season after Thibaut Courtois' serious knee injury. Showed against Manchester City in the quarters that he holds his nerve in a penalty shoot-out.\n\nDucker: There will inevitably be a huge amount of attention on Jude Bellingham, up against his old club, but Vinicius Jr has proven time and again he is a player who brings his best on the biggest occasions and I expect no different here.\n\nPercy: The focus will inevitably be on Jude Bellingham and Sancho, but this could be a significant night for Mats Hummels. At the age of 35, the old warrior may well be preparing for his last ever showpiece final. Hummels has been so consistent, and indeed arguably under-rated, over the years and will be absolutely crucial at Wembley.\n\nScoreline\n\nWallace: Hard to see past Real - could see them winning 3-1\n\nMcGrath: Borussia Dortmund 1 Real Madrid 3\n\nDucker: Hard to see beyond a 15th European Cup for Real. 3-1 to Carlo Ancelotti's side.\n\nPercy: Real Madrid 2 Borussia Dortmund 1", "source":

"Champions League final talking points - Can Borussia Dortmund upset Real Madrid?", "body": "Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund clash at Wembley on Saturday as the Champions League final brings down the curtain on the club season.\n\nHere, the PA news agency looks at some of the major talking points ahead of the game.\n\nEngland ace Jude ready to star for Real\n\nJude Bellingham will look to lead Real Madrid to victory (Isabel Infantes/PA)Jude Bellingham has enjoyed a fine first campaign at Real Madrid having joined from Dortmund last summer and will be aiming to top it off with victory over his former club.\n\nThe 20-year-old asked for Zinedine Zidane's old number five shirt when he completed his move and he has certainly started to live up to the lofty expectations that come with such a request.\n\nWith 23 goals and 12 assists over the course of the campaign to date, the England midfielder could be key to Real lifting an unrivalled 15th European Cup.\n\nSancho has a point to prove\n\nAnother Englishman looking to make an impact on proceedings is Jadon Sancho, who has been in good form since returning to Dortmund on loan from Manchester United in January.\n\nThe 24-year-old struggled for consistency at Old Trafford and left under a cloud following a falling out with manager Erik ten Hag.\n\nSince then he has started to rebuild his reputation in Germany with some eye-catching performances en route to the Champions League final.\n\nAnd he will look to create a better personal memory at Wembley after missing in the penalty shoot-out defeat to Italy in the Euro 2020 final three years ago.\n\nKroos control\n\nAfter winning four Champions League titles and four LaLiga crowns during a trophy-laden decade in Madrid, midfielder Toni Kroos will play his final game for the club at Wembley.\n\nThe 34-year-old - who also won three league titles at Bayern Munich as well as the 2014 World Cup with Germany - is hanging up his boots after a home European Championship this summer.\n\nKroos will want to bow out in style as he aims for more silverware to cap a fine career.\n\nCan Bundesliga side upset the odds?\n\nWhile Real will be considered heavy favourites under the Wembley arch, Dortmund will be looking to upset the odds.\n\nHead coach Edin Terzic has filled numerous roles at the club and, in his second stint as manager, could deliver their first Champions League glory since 1997.\n\nAs a scout and coach in the club's academy he answered to former boss Jurgen Klopp but on Saturday he can go one better than the German, who was in charge when Dortmund last reached the final in 2013 - a 2-1 loss to Bayern Munich at Wembley.\n\nA former Potter looking to cast his magic\n\nMark Hughes is likely to have been rubbing his eyes in disbelief as he watched Joselu score two late goals to down Bayern Munich in the semi-finals.\n\nWelshman Hughes was the Stoke boss who signed the forward in the summer of 2015 but Joselu managed just four goals before being shipped out on loan - eventually returning to England for a similarly unimpactful two-year stay at Newcastle.\n\nHowever, having moved to the Bernabeu on loan from Espanyol this season, the 34-year-old wrote his name into Real folklore with his match-winning brace and now he will be hoping for a chance to repeat the feat at Wembley.", "source": {"uri":

But he is determined to put aside any sentiment to help Real to more European glory.\n\n\"To play this kind of game is the reason I'm here,\" said Bellingham. \"I always dreamed of playing for this team and scoring goals.

The news and editorial departments had no role in the creation or display of this content.\n\nBorussia Dortmund will battle Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League Final on Saturday afternoon as both clubs look to secure the title of the best team in Europe.\n\nThe German club has only won the Champions League one time in 1996-97 and last appeared in the final in 2012-13. Meanwhile, Madrid holds the record for the most competition championships and is looking to add yet another to its gaudy count.\n\nHere's a look at our Champions League Final odds, picks and predictions:\n\nChampions League Final odds and preview\n\nThe match pits the unassuming, blue-collared nature of Dortmund -- not even the largest club in Germany -- against the Goliath that has ruled the competition for decades.\n\nDortmund enters the match fresh off a 4-0 win over SV Darmstadt 98 in the Bundesliga. They beat PSG 1-0 in both semifinal legs and only tasted defeat twice in 12 Champions League matches en route to the final.\n\nMadrid tied both of its recent matches against Real Betis and Villareal and did not lose a Champions League match. However, it didn't dominate its opponents, as it managed three wins (one on penalties) and three draws in its last six matches in the competition.\n\nDortmund's job will be to remain resolute in defense and deal with the speed of the Madrid attack. They'll also need to use their consistent solidarity to overcome the Spanish side's experience in the competition.\n\nThis will be the final match at Dortmund for club legend Marco Reus, who has been with the team since 2012. Madrid's Toni Kroos will also retire at the conclusion of the match after amassing one of the best resumes of any midfielder.\n\nThe match will be broadcast on CBS at 3 p.m. Eastern on Saturday, June 1.\n\nDortmund vs. Real Madrid predictions: Dortmund to lift the cup (+250 or better)\n\nMadrid has the better team on paper and more experience -- that much is true. But Dortmund was more impressive in the semifinal with consecutive victories over PSG and also has more added motivation from their drought in the competition compared to Madrid's dominance.\n\nThe German club is quick on the counter-attack and has forwards that can have a run at the Madrid defense, which often sits higher up the pitch because they control possession for so long.\n\nThe battle of the midfield will go a long way to determining the winner. Madrid has the technical advantage but likes to get players forward and could suffer in the engine room later in the match.\n\nThe Spanish side has also needed late-game moments to propel them to the final. They deserve credit for coming up clutch when needed, but Dortmund has quietly taken care of business without ever breaking their unassuming mold.\n\nChampions League Final prop bets: Real Madrid over 4.5 corners (+132 or better)\n\nDortmund's center-backs, Mats Hummels and Nico Schlotterbeck, aren't the quickest pairing in the world, and Julian Ryerson and Ian Maatsen on the outside aren't as quick as Vinicius Junior, Rorygo or Federico Valverde. As such, attacking the wings will be crucial for Madrid.\n\nThe German team is likely going to play a lower defensive line out of possession and concede the ball as they often did against PSG (30.5% possession in the second leg, 42.7% in the first). That should give Madrid more room on the wings to explore.\n\nThe concern is that a lower defensive block could take the sting out of Madrid's attack, but their wide players love to have a run at defenders and should help get this over the total.\n\nBest Champions League betting sites\n\nYou must be over 21 to play.

But he is up against Ancelotti, a behemoth figure who will be playing in a record-extending sixth Champions League final.\n\nA master in the competition, four-time winner Ancelotti has injected the idea of polymorphism into this Real Madrid side. In Europe's most elite competition this season, Los Blancos seemed to have absorbed the idea of becoming more fluid, taking the shape of whatever is in front in order to keep flowing.\n\nBe it being aggressive in an attempt to clinch the tie at home against Bayern in the semifinal, or architecting the lowest of blocks away at Etihad in the quarters against defending champions Manchester City -- Real have displayed polarity in terms of approach against different oppositions this season. At times, they were willing to suffer for large portions of matches, and there were moments when they were eager to be on the front foot -- constantly adapting and entirely sold to the idea of doing whatever was necessary to stay alive in the competition.\n\n\"You see, there is no 'Ancelotti style' - there is no style for me because I change,\" Ancelotti told Times.\n\nThe hallmark of Real's attacking threats has been their willingness to create overloads on either side of the pitch, however, preferably on the left flank to spearhead attacks through\n\nVinicius Jr who has found the net five times and provided for his teammates in as many occasions this season. The drifting of Rodrygo and Jude Bellingham with the additional support of left-back Ferland Mendy on the left side have often allowed Real to gain numerical superiority to hurt oppositions.\n\nWith not-so-pacy Julian Ryerson playing at right-back and a 35-year-old Mats Hummels also covering that part of the defence, Los Blancos would have sights set on exploiting that flank through the sheer pace of Vinicius.\n\nA lot will depend on how Dortmund will approach the game. One thing is for certain which is that Real would absolutely enjoy Dortmund taking initiative and for Terzic's men to play on the front foot from the onset, as it will suit Real's strength in more of a passive approach which could see them launch fast counter-attacks after recovering possession.\n\nStarman Toni Kroos will once again be pivotal in setting Real's tempo and the extra onus will be on the likes of Julian Brandt and Marcel Sabitzer, Dortmund's number eights, to get their triggers right when pressing the 'German Sniper'.\n\nFor Dortmund, who have recorded an average possession of below 50 percent in Europe in contrast to 57 in the Bundesliga, their wingers will hold the key.\n\nIndividual brilliance from Dortmund wingers will be on demand to make points of differences. An in-form Jadon Sancho will once again look to make the pitch into his dancefloor from the right and will have Ryerson eager to supply him. The Englishman has been smart to pick up pockets of space while linking up with the others in the final third but has also shown great dribbling ability to go past players. Being inspired by what he did against PSG's Nuno Mendes in the semifinal, Sancho will definitely fancy his chances against Mendy.\n\nOn the other side, Karim Adeyami is expected to unsettle Dani Carvajal with pace and the Spaniard will also have to be wary about Dortmund left-back Ian Maatsen who needs no second invitation to fly forward and join attacks.\n\nThe hold-up play of Niclas Fullkrug has been a key component in making offensive transitions work for Dortmund. The 31-year-old striker has shown great ability with his back against the goal and is often keen to play on his faster-attacking partners to create incisive opportunities. He will also have Hummels complement him utilising their aerial prowess, an aspect\n\nDortmund will most definitely look to use, especially because of the lack of aerial threat from Real.\n\nTerzic and Dortmund will be up against it to trump the enigma that is Real Madrid for they can win a game despite being tactically outplayed the entire duration of a game.\n\nTerzic's side will have no room to second guess themselves and will have to be at their absolute best, making sure to go for the kill because if they leave even the slightest of openings, Real, like they most often do, will conjure up the Boogeyman within to haunt yet another side late in the game.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

This year, Real Madrid has a chance to claim the maximum prize after winning their group with a perfect record.\n\nFor Dortmund, this final marks their first appearance in 11 years, while Real Madrid returns to the final after a two-year hiatus. Dortmund's path to the final has been impressive, overcoming teams like PSV, Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid, and Paris Saint-Germain, despite an inconsistent domestic campaign where they finished fifth in the Bundesliga.\n\nReal Madrid, unbeaten in this season's competition (W8 D4), reached their 18th final with narrow escapes against Leipzig, Manchester City, and Bayern. In contrast, their domestic form was dominant, securing another La Liga title.\n\nDortmund's last Champions League final appearance was also at Wembley, where they lost 2-1 to Bayern Munich in 2013. Veterans Mats Hummels and Marco Reus, who played in that final, will be crucial against a Real Madrid side well-versed in European success, having lost only one of their last 20 UEFA matches against German teams.\n\nTalking Points\n\nDespite finishing fifth in the Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund excelled in Europe. They topped a group featuring Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan, and Newcastle, then knocked out PSV, Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid, and PSG to reach Wembley. Facing Real Madrid, the most successful team in Champions League history, will be their toughest challenge yet.\n\nDortmund's sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, and captain Marco Reus emphasized the team's underdog status could work to their advantage. Reus, reflecting on their previous final at Wembley, remains optimistic about their chances.\n\nInjury concerns loom for both teams.

Their high-profile attack has taken center stage over the course of the campaign - Jude Bellingham emerged as the breakout star of the tournament with three goals and four assists, while each of Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo and Joselu have five goals.\n\nDortmund, meanwhile, are not to be underestimated after a Cinderella run to the final. They eye redemption 11 years after losing the final at Wembley to Bayern Munich and overcame a series of major hurdles along the way. They topped a group that included Paris Saint-Germain, AC Milan and Newcastle United, later meeting PSG again in the semifinals and ousting the French champions. Dortmund come into the final with a strong defensive record, as goalkeeper Gregor Kobel leads the Champions League with six clean sheets, but also some attacking firepower in Marcel Sabitzer, who's in charge of the assist charts with five.\n\nHere's what you need to know before the big game, including picks from experts across the CBS Sports team.\n\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\n\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.

No one really needs to be shown how cruelly effective Vinicius can be when he gets the scent of weak prey. Real Madrid's No.7 has been in devastating form over recent months, saving his most decisive contributions for the biggest games with assists and goals in the triumphs over Manchester City and Bayern. Dortmund did a fine job of slowing but not stopping the advance of Paris Saint-Germain's wide forwards in the semifinals, but they will be tested once more come Saturday night. -- James Benge\n\nMost likely to score a goal - Jude Bellingham: It feels written that the former Dortmund man will come back to haunt his ex-employers. Although Vini Jr. would be another good shout for this, the England international scoring a goal to seal Real's latest UCL crown and throwing down the gauntlet to Kylian Mbappe at the same time feels like the most probable scenario. Up against Los Blancos' firepower, it is hard to see Dortmund's rock solid defense resisting over 90 minutes. - Jonathan Johnson\n\nMan of the Match pick - Jude Bellingham: I'm going to go along with Jonathan here as all signs point to this being the Jude Bellingham show. Playing his former team in front of home fans in England, Bellingham will not only score the winner for Real Madrid but he'll also put in a defensive shift to help contain Dortmund's attack. Already having one of the best debut seasons for a new club that we've seen, Bellingham will end it on the ultimate high winning the UCL final. - Chuck Booth\n\nMatch prediction: Real Madrid are the leading favorites to win their 15th Champions League trophy, but Borussia Dortmund should not be underestimated, considering the importance of the final. The Spanish giants, thanks to the work of Carlo Ancelotti, can make history at Wembley and this is what I expect to happen.

against his former side and at the home of English football.\n\nThe 20-year-old has shone in Spain this term following an \u00a388.5million transfer from Dortmund last summer.\n\nLaLiga's player of the season contributed 19 goals and six assists to help Real win the title by 10 points.\n\nHe has also registered four Champions League goals and will be expected to deliver once again as he bids to sign off a stellar season in style ahead of representing his country at Euro 2024.\n\nWhile Bellingham is on the rise, Sancho's career has stalled since he swapped Dortmund for Manchester United in 2021.\n\nSancho returns to Wembley, where he missed one of England's penalties in their Euro 2020 final shoot-out defeat to Italy, with plenty to prove.\n\nThe 24-year-old forward has been capped just once by Gareth Southgate since but is back playing regularly following his January loan switch from Old Trafford.\n\nSancho will be eager to steal Bellingham's limelight and could celebrate success alongside another Englishman as 19-year-old former Reading and Manchester City academy player Jamie Bynoe-Gittens is also among Dortmund's ranks.\n\nReal manager Carlo Ancelotti and many of his players are in familiar territory.\n\nThe formidable Spanish giants have lifted the Champions League trophy in five of the last 10 seasons, including twice under Ancelotti - a six-time winner as a player and coach.\n\nIn contrast, Dortmund have not even won their domestic title during that period.\n\nThe German club, who are coached by Edin Terzic and finished fifth in the Bundesliga this term, upset red-hot favourites Juventus to clinch European football's top prize 27 years ago, when Scotland's Paul Lambert was in their midfield.\n\nDortmund once again begin as firm underdogs against opposition with far greater continental pedigree.\n\nToni Kroos will bid farewell to Real Madrid after 10 years with the club.\n\nThe Germany midfielder, who will retire following this summer's European Championship in his homeland, has already won the Champions League four times with Real, as well as once with Bayern Munich.\n\nIt also promises to be an emotional occasion for Kroos' former international team-mate Marco Reus.\n\nThe 34-year-old attacking midfielder, who was part of the Dortmund team beaten by Bayern in the all-German 2013 final at Wembley, is set for his final appearance before ending his 12-season stay with the club.\n\nThe key conundrum facing Ancelotti is, unquestionably, in goal.\n\nFirst-choice goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has missed most of the season due to two serious knee injuries.\n\nThe 32-year-old returned this month to keep four consecutive LaLiga clean sheets but was this week left out of Belgium's Euro 2024 squad, casting fresh doubt over his physical condition.\n\nAncelotti rates Courtois as the world's best but he has not made a Champions League appearance since last season's 4-0 semi-final defeat to Manchester City.\n\nUnderstudy Andriy Lunin has been an unsung hero this campaign and will be hoping to retain the starting role.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Bynoe-Gittens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Bynoe-Gittens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C._EDS_and_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C.

During his chat with Mail Sport, Berger's iconic 'Die Continentale'-sponsored kit - worn during Dortmund's 1995-96 title-winning campaign - hung framed above his head.\n\nAnd the man's already warm countenance grew brighter still, when asked to reminisce on his days in the black and yellow. On the subject of Dortmund's first European Cup final in more than a decade, he insisted Edin Terzic's side are capable of upsetting the established elite.\n\n'Of course the Champions League has been [Real Madrid's] competition in the last eight or nine years,' Berger - who has partnered with McDonald's - told Mail Sport. 'Historically they have won the most Champions League trophies and they're in the final again.\n\nBorussia Dortmund booked a place in their first Champions League final in more than a decade by beating PSG home and away in the semi-final\n\nPatrik Berger won the Bundesliga in his single season in Germany with Borussia Dortmund\n\nBerger backed his former side, who he claimed have lots of quality and will be free to play without pressure\n\nPodcast All episodes EPISODE 91: Can Manchester City cope without Pep Guardiola? EPISODE 90: How Manchester United CAN win crunch FA Cup clash EPISODE 89: Why Manchester City aren't the reason the League is boring 'It hasn't worked!' Is VAR the problem or the solution? EPISODE 87: Why United must tear down Old Trafford and move to Wembley Play on Apple Spotify\n\n'So it's obvious that a lot of people think that Real Madrid are going to win it again. But don't forget that Borussia Dortmund are a good side with experience.\n\n'They have so many good players and you don't get to the Champions League final as an average team - they're a really good side too.\n\nRead More Jadon Sancho insists he's doing everything to become 'a better player' as the Borussia Dortmund star eyes glory in the Champions League final... and admits it was 'hard' to get over Euro 2020 shootout final heartbreak\n\n'They know that it's only one game, you're not playing home and away, it's just one game.\n\n'And in one game, they know that anything is possible. I'm sure that they believe that they can beat anybody in one game.\n\n'We have seen it in the past so many times. And the role of underdogs suits them because nobody is expecting anything from them really.'\n\nDortmund were the fifth-best side in the Bundesliga last season and they finished a whopping 27 points behind runaway leaders Bayer Leverkusen.\n\nThanks to the success of German clubs in continental competition, Dortmund are not reliant on victory at Wembley to ensure they are dining at Europe's top table next season. They really have nothing to lose.\n\nHowever, the iconic London stadium does hold painful memories for supporters. Eleven years ago under Jurgen Klopp, Dortmund suffered an agonising 2-1 defeat by their bitter rivals Bayern Munich.\n\nDortmund last Champions league final appearance also came at Wembley, when they suffered a 2-1 defeat by bitter rivals Bayern Munich\n\nBerger and the Czech Republic suffered heartbreak in the Euro 96 final at Wembley as Oliver Bierhoff's golden goal handed Germany the title\n\nReal Madrid are looking to clinch a record-extending 15th Champions League crown\n\nBerger is almost uniquely positioned to empathise, given that he and his Czech Republic team-mates were on the receiving end of Oliver Bierhoff's golden goal for Germany in the final of Euro 96.\n\n'Both teams are careful at the start of every final,' he continued on the tense nature of European showpieces. 'Nobody wants to make mistake.'\n\nIndeed, the last four Champions League finals have been decided by a single goal.\n\n'it's good for the fans if someone is scoring a goal first, so then the game is going to open a little bit, and then hopefully this is going to be the different final.\n\n'Hopefully we're going to see more goals. Football is all about goals. So we want to see as many goals as possible in that final.'\n\nIf the last few encounters between Dortmund and Madrid are anything to go by, fans will be treated to an almighty festival of goals on Saturday night. The four previous meetings have averaged more than four goals a game.\n\nBerger believes that Edin Terzic's side will be more than happy to play the role of underdogs\n\nDortmund solitary triumph in the competition came in a shock win over Juventus in 1998\n\nPushed for a prediction, Berger insisted he was anything but a prophet. Still, he couldn't resist the chance to speak an unlikely Dortmund win - only the second in the club's history - in existence.\n\n'The prediction is with my heart,' he added. 'And I'm going to go 2-1 Borussia Dortmund.'\n\nPatrik Berger is encouraging fans to bag a win with McDonald's new burger - The Hat Trick, available in store and across delivery, nationwide now.

Los Blancos are the favourites as they are the leading team with most trophies in the competition.\n\nReal Madrid is the most successful team in the history of the European Champions League, having won the tournament 14 times in 17 appearances in the final. If they beat Dortmund on Saturday, they'll add to their massive title haul.\n\nReal Madrid\n\nAncelotti's men astonishingly found a way to prevail against defending champions Manchester City - exacting revenge on their 2022-23 semi-final conquerors. The white angels went ahead into the semi's and defeated German big boys Bayern Munich.\n\nThe first leg ended in a draw. Madrid were a goal down in the second leg and with 10 minutes to go they made a dramatic comeback to win 2-1, with brace from skipper Joselu.\n\nBorussia Dortmund, known in their homeland as \"die Schwarzgelben\", with regards to their traditional colours of black and yellow, are seeking their second European trophy since winning the trophy 27 years ago. Dortmund met Atletico Madrid in the round of 8. After losing to them in the first leg away from home, they returned home and made a comeback with goals from Julian Brandt, Ian Maatsen and Marcel Sabitzer saw them through to the semi's.\n\nDortmund later met Paris Saint German where they won the first leg with just a goal, scored by Niclas Fullkrug in the 36th minute.

against his former side and at the home of English football.\n\nThe 20-year-old has shone in Spain this term following an \u00a388.5million transfer from Dortmund last summer.\n\nLaLiga's player of the season contributed 19 goals and six assists to help Real win the title by 10 points.\n\nHe has also registered four Champions League goals and will be expected to deliver once again as he bids to sign off a stellar season in style ahead of representing his country at Euro 2024.\n\nA post shared by Jadon Sancho (@sanchooo10)\n\nWhile Bellingham is on the rise, Sancho's career has stalled since he swapped Dortmund for Manchester United in 2021.\n\nSancho returns to Wembley, where he missed one of England's penalties in their Euro 2020 final shoot-out defeat to Italy, with plenty to prove.\n\nThe 24-year-old forward has been capped just once by Gareth Southgate since but is back playing regularly following his January loan switch from Old Trafford.\n\nSancho will be eager to steal Bellingham's limelight and could celebrate success alongside another Englishman as 19-year-old former Reading and Manchester City academy player Jamie Bynoe-Gittens is also among Dortmund's ranks.\n\nReal manager Carlo Ancelotti and many of his players are in familiar territory.\n\nThe formidable Spanish giants have lifted the Champions League trophy in five of the last 10 seasons, including twice under Ancelotti - a six-time winner as a player and coach.\n\nIn contrast, Dortmund have not even won their domestic title during that period.\n\nThe German club, who are coached by Edin Terzic and finished fifth in the Bundesliga this term, upset red-hot favourites Juventus to clinch European football's top prize 27 years ago, when Scotland's Paul Lambert was in their midfield.\n\nDortmund once again begin as firm underdogs against opposition with far greater continental pedigree.\n\nToni Kroos will bid farewell to Real Madrid after 10 years with the club.\n\nThe Germany midfielder, who will retire following this summer's European Championship in his homeland, has already won the Champions League four times with Real, as well as once with Bayern Munich.\n\nIt also promises to be an emotional occasion for Kroos' former international team-mate Marco Reus.\n\nThe 34-year-old attacking midfielder, who was part of the Dortmund team beaten by Bayern in the all-German 2013 final at Wembley, is set for his final appearance before ending his 12-season stay with the club.\n\nThe key conundrum facing Ancelotti is, unquestionably, in goal.\n\nFirst-choice goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has missed most of the season due to two serious knee injuries.\n\nThe 32-year-old returned this month to keep four consecutive LaLiga clean sheets but was this week left out of Belgium's Euro 2024 squad, casting fresh doubt over his physical condition.\n\nAncelotti rates Courtois as the world's best but he has not made a Champions League appearance since last season's 4-0 semi-final defeat to Manchester City.\n\nUnderstudy Andriy Lunin has been an unsung hero this campaign and will be hoping to retain the starting role.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Fri 31 May 2024, 6:58 AM Last updated: Fri 31 May 2024, 7:18 AM", "source": {"uri": "meathchronicle.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Meath Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadon_Sancho", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadon Sancho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Bynoe-Gittens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Bynoe-Gittens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C._EDS_and_Academy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C.

Borussia Dortmund's impressive run to the Champions League final means that they have three players in Ferdinand's team.\n\nWatch the UEFA Champions League Final exclusively live on TNT Sports and for free on discovery+ by signing up HERE .\n\nIt's been a Champions League season to remember, a term full of shocks and incredible stories. Certain players have stepped up when it matters most, playing integral roles in club triumphs on the biggest stage of all.\n\nWhether it be Vinicius Jr tearing defences to shreds for Real Madrid, or Mats Hummels' imperious performances at the back for Borussia Dortmund, individuals across the pitch have shone in 2023/24. And the two aforementioned players will step foot onto the turf for one final time as they bid to get their hands on the trophy at Wembley.\n\nRelated Predicting Dortmund and Real Madrid's Starting Line-Ups for UCL Final Both Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid can field great teams for the 2024 Champions League final, despite both sides missing players through injury.\n\nBut which players have been the brightest sparks during the season? TNT Sports pundit Rio Ferdinand was given the difficult task of selecting the best XI from this season's Champions League. The Manchester United legend had some big calls to make, whittling down an extensive list to just 11 players. And you know how good a year some individuals have had when the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Rodrygo, and no Arsenal stars make it in.\n\nGoalkeeper: Andriy Lunin Real Madrid\n\nStatistically speaking, Borussia Dortmund's Gregor Kobel can feel hard done by. The Swiss international has prevented over six goals in the tournament during his team's run to the final. Nevertheless, Ferdinand opted for Madrid's Andriy Lunin, who has played a key role in his team's success.\n\nExpected to deputise for Thibaut Courtois, but thrust into the team after the Belgian picked up two serious knee injuries, the Ukrainian has been a stable presence at the back. Pulling out big stops, including penalty saves against Manchester City in the quarter-finals, it's his calmness between the posts that makes him Ferdinand's first-choice.\n\n\"Nothing special, nothing spectacular, just solid all round.\"\n\nRight-back: Julian Ryerson Borussia Dortmund\n\nPerhaps not the biggest name to choose from, especially considering the likes of Dani Carvajal, Ben White, Kyle Walker and Achraf Hakimi all made it to the last eight at least. But Julian Ryerson has been exceptional for Edin Terzic's side. The Norwegian has enjoyed a steady rise in importance since arriving at the Signal Iduna Park from Union Berlin, and has made nine appearances in the competition this term.\n\nWhile he hasn't got any goal contributions during the tournament, the solidity the 26-year-old has provided on the right flank has proved invaluable to BVB. Making 2.7 tackles per game, his 1.4 dribbles per 90 also show he's been a nuisance going forward, even without the output to show for it. Nevertheless, it's his showings at the back which have impressed Ferdinand the most.\n\n\"I think the way they've had to defend this tournament has been nothing short of miraculous at times.\"\n\nCentre-back: Antonio Rudiger Real Madrid\n\nThere aren't many fans who would deny Antonio Rudiger a spot in this team. The Real Madrid centre-back has been phenomenal ever since joining Los Blancos from Chelsea, becoming an absolute unit and solidifying his world-class status. And that has been no different in this season's Champions League.\n\nPlaying 11 times, he has even popped up with two assists against Napoli and Bayern Munich, but it's how well he's organised the team's defence which has been most impressive of all. The German international will be integral for Carlo Ancelotti against Dortmund as they bid to deal with Niclas Fullkrug, with Ferdinand hailing him as \"a rock\" in Madrid's backline.\n\nCentre-back: Mats Hummels Borussia Dortmund\n\nMats Hummels' showings for Borussia Dortmund this season have silenced anyone who questioned whether he was nearing his decline. Ever-present at the back for BVB during their Champions League run and not missing a single minute of their campaign, the 35-year-old still looks like he could play for years to come.\n\nAn intelligent and composed defender whose experience has been crucial to Dortmund, his knack of popping up when it matters most was there for all to see in the two legs against Paris Saint-Germain, as he made a crucial block at the Parc des Princes and popped up with a match-winning goal. Ferdinand believes it's his complete game which earns him a spot in the team over the likes of William Saliba, Ruben Dias, and others.\n\n\"Two man of the match performances in the semi-finals. Experienced, but also his ball-playing, outside of the boot passing, especially over those two games... Beautiful.\"\n\nLeft-Back: Ian Maatsen Borussia Dormtund (on loan from Chelsea)\n\nYou have to question some of the decision-making going on at Chelsea. The club didn't look convincing in 2023/24 consistently under Mauricio Pochettino, and one of the problem areas for them was at left-back. Which begs the question: why on earth did they not make the most of Ian Maatsen?\n\nThe Dutchman could not get a sniff at Stamford Bridge, and was loaned to Borussia Dortmund after signing a deal which included a \u00a335m release clause. He has flourished for the German club, making 1.7 interceptions per 90 while being a creative threat going forward. He even bagged an important goal in the 4-2 in the second leg, and that has impressed Rio Ferdinand to no end.\n\n\"I think he's been brilliant going forward, inexperienced but looks and plays way beyond his years.\"\n\nCentre-Midfield: Toni Kroos Real Madrid\n\nLuka Modric and Toni Kroos have been synonymous with Champions League glory for years at this point, dominating games and lifting the famous trophy five times. While there is no space for the former in Ferdinand's team, the German international has still been pulling the strings in the engine room for Madrid this season, and, therefore, makes the cut.\n\nMaking 68.1 accurate passes per game and 1.8 key passes per 90 for his side, Kroos seems like he could still play for a few more years. Nevertheless, the 34-year-old is set to retire, and will be hoping to end his career on a high. For Ferdinand, it's nothing more than he deserves, as he's been the best midfielder in the competition this season in the eyes of the former United man.\n\n\"I think he's been the best midfielder in the competition. He's been playing for so long, his energy is inspirational.\"\n\nCentre-Midfield: Jude Bellingham Real Madrid\n\nJude Bellingham lines up next to his Real Madrid in Ferdinand's team of the tournament, and rightly so. The Englishman, in his debut year for the Spanish giants, has been absolutely sensational. From scoring wondergoals against Napoli in the group stages to putting in dominant showings in the knockout ties, the 20-year-old has all the necessary qualities to become a Ballon d'Or winner in the future. If he wins the competition, then it will be hard to deny him the honour.\n\nRelated Next 15 Ballon d'Or Winners Predicted by AI (2024-2038) Real Madrid duo Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr are among the names that AI has predicted will win the Ballon d'Or in the next 15 years.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti has praised Bellingham's maturity ahead of the final, a quality which has helped him settle in Spain immensely. And Ferdinand has also showered him with praise, saying that he could not pick a midfield without the former Dortmund man.\n\n\"What this guy has done as a young 20-year-old, taken the world, not just Europe, not just the Champions League by storm.\"\n\nCentre-Midfield: Rodri Manchester City\n\nIt says alot about Rodri's performances in the Champions League this season that Ferdinand has picked him for his third midfield spot, despite Manchester City exiting the competition at the quarter-final stage. The Spaniard, who was named man of the match in the 2022/23 final after scoring the goal which won the Premier League champions their first Champions League, continued his impressive form when the competition restarted this season.\n\nPraised by the TNT Sports pundit as the best holding midfielder in the world right now, the 27-year-old possesses incredible in-game IQ, snuffing out danger with ease. On top of that, he's been a growing threat in attack, illustrated by his goal and three assists in the competition this term. A worthy final pick for Ferdinand's engine room.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: No player has played more passes than Rodri in the 2023/24 Champions League (920). Only Ruben Dias (895) has completed more than the midfielder (851).\n\nRight-Wing: Phil Foden Manchester City\n\nWhat a season it has been for Phil Foden. The Stockport-born winger has enjoyed his best season in a City shirt to date, lifting the Premier League for a sixth time while being crowned Player of the Season after 19 goal contributions. And that has extended to the Champions League too.\n\nFive goals across the competition this season, including one against finalists Madrid in the last eight, show just how impactful he was for Pep Guardiola's side in their run to the knockout stages. While the likes of Ousmane Dembele and Rodrygo might have reached later stages of the competition, Foden's influence on City is why Ferdinand went for him.\n\n\"What a wonderful football player. Goals and assists galore, but also impacting the games in different ways as well.\"\n\nLeft-Wing: Vinicius Junior Real Madrid\n\nArguably up there with Jude Bellingham as Real Madrid's most important player this season, Vinicius Jr's stock has only continued to rise after yet another impressive term. Five goals and five assists have been key to Los Blancos returning to the final of the competition once again, with the dynamic forward's pace, finishing, and technical ability making him one of the best wingers in world football today.\n\nAnd that hasn't gone unnoticed by Ferdinand, who highlighted his performance in the two legs of the semi-finals. Two goals against Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena put Madrid in a strong position for the return leg at the Santiago Bernabeu, and although the Brazilian didn't score or assist in the second game, he was still dangerous throughout.\n\nStriker: Harry Kane Bayern Munich\n\nThe striker position was always likely to be one of Mbappe or Harry Kane, given that they lead the likes of Antoine Griezmann and Erling Haaland for goals scored. But despite the Frenchman's efforts for PSG, Ferdinand opted to select the Bayern Munich man for his output.\n\n\"Top goalscorer in the tournament. You know what you're getting. It says it on the tin. He's gonna score goals and he never disappoints.\"\n\nKane's game, however, is so much more than just being a poacher. England's all-time top scorer drops deep to link play superbly well, and he can also create, something which is illustrated by his four assists on top of his eight goals during the tournament this season. That, combined with his lethal finishing, makes him one of the greatest attackers in the world today, and the best forward in the Champions League this season.\n\nRelated 20 Best Footballers in the World (2024) We rank the best 20 footballers in the world right now - in order.\n\nAll statistics taken from Transfermarkt and Sofascore - Correct as of 31/05/24", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mats_Hummels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mats Hummels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BT_Sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BT Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Ferdinand", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rio Ferdinand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Ryerson", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Julian Ryerson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andriy_Lunin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Andriy Lunin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_R\u00fcdiger", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antonio R\u00fcdiger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Maatsen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ian Maatsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_White_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ben White (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achraf_Hakimi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Achraf Hakimi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Carvajal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dani Carvajal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1._FC_Union_Berlin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1.

They failed. Bayern held the trophy aloft as the Yellow Wall mourned. It's their fate, to finish second. They have lost three of their three finals of various iterations of the Champions League, the last at the same venue, Wembley. Seven times this century they have ended up in second spot in the Bundesliga, winning just thrice.\n\nIn the opposite spectrum is Real Madrid, who they encounter to win their second-ever Champions League. Fourteen times have they conquered Europe, only thrice have they stumbled in the final, the last coming as far back as 1981. Dortmund doesn't want to repeat history; Madrid wants it to repeat.\n\nThe soul of the clubs are different. Madrid's success model has traditionally depended on buying developed players -- who they make greats.\n\nDortmund's is the opposite -- they mould and then sell the players. Madrid has exhausted 631 million Euros on acquiring the best players of the generation in the last five years; on the other hand, Dortmund acquired a wealth in excess of one billion from the sales proceeds of the twinkling talents they nurture. Madrid embodies glamour; Dortmund grit. Madrid sparkles; Dortmund let other teams sparkle.\n\nThere can't be an better example than Jude Bellingham, the heartbeat of Madrid this season. In 41 games in all competitions, he has netted 23 goals and finessed 11 assists.\n\nUntil last year, he was one of Dortmund's. Now he is Madrid's. They spend 103 million pounds for his services. Every penny seems well spent. If Dortmund laid the plaster on the floor, Madrid added rooms and floors and converted him to a high-riser, sniffing the stratosphere of the Ballon d'Or.\n\nDon Hutchison, the former Liverpool midfielder and a Sony Liv pundit can't stop gushing about him. \"He is built like a real, old-school midfielder, with strong knees like Zinedine Zidane, and physically strong, sort of like Patrick Vieira... Steven Gerrard. But technically gifted too.\"\n\nThere is a surreal calm when the ball reaches him. \"He doesn't look as though he ever had a bad day,\" he says, before adding: \"I am sure he will have a few days like that, but he's just a really cultured, handsome young man that takes everything in his stride.\"\n\nHis manager Carlo Ancelotti has simply unleashed him, letting him roam without any tactical shackles. \"I think he said to Bellingham, just go and entertain me, don't worry about tactics. We signed you for a reason, because you are a good player. So just show the public what you can do. Tactically, you know he has got a lot of praise, but it is his man management that makes him the manager he is,\" he says.\n\nNot just Bellingham, there is a flurry of players who could win the game with just a moment of magic in Real Madrid. Not that they are an incoherent force on the field, but they have considerable individual flair in every patch of the ground.\n\n\"For Dortmund to come through, it has to be a collective effort. It can't just be about Jadon Sancho,\" Hutchinson observes.\n\nIt has not been about Sancho either, with their 17 goals in the tournament scored by 12 different players.\n\nThe England international had been at the heart of Dortmund's march since arriving on loan from Manchester United after a bitter and public falling out with manager Erik Ten Hag. On a redemption journey is Dortmund manager Edin Terzic himself, who was in the Wembley stands as a fan to watch his team's agonising defeat in the final against Bayern Munich in 2013.\n\nLater, he himself would explain the pain as only a fan could. \"You see how tough and hard the sport is that we chose to love. It is hard when you see only one goal is missing. There was no happy end for us and it hurts a lot,\" he once said.\n\nAnd one goal has often been the difference between teams in the Champions League final. The last four finals were decided by a lone goal. \"Dortmund had to score the first goal if they are to win,\" says Hutchinson, but with a caveat: \"Even if they are trailing at the last minute, Madrid will believe they can comeback and win the game. The semifinal for instance.\"\n\nAs with finals in recent times, Hutchinson expects this game to be a cagey affair, despite the teams' penchant for fast breaks. They are two of the finest transitional sides in Europe. Dortmund would have to deal with the snappy pace of Vinicius Junior. As much as 42 per cent of Madrid's attacking touches have been through their left third, with the Brazilian at the heart of it.\n\nDefending robustly\n\nBut Dortmund have defended robustly, shepherded by the seasoned Mats Hummels, shipping in only nine goals in 12 games, keeping six clean sheets. Often when defending, one of the two wingers too would join, making it a back five. But Madrid have a variety of patterns to unlock defences -- so much so that it's difficult to pinpoint something as their biggest strength. But Dortmund manager Edin Terzic remains unfazed.\n\n\"We're breaking everything down to this one game. In a game, anything is possible. If anyone has shown that, it's us. It's time for this series (of Real Madrid), eight games, eight wins in finals, to end,\" he would say. His team needs one final step to seize glory, but a step where Dortmund has often slipped and Madrid leapt over.\n\nTiming Live on Sony Sports Ten 2 SD & HD, Sony Sports Ten 3 SD & HD (Hindi), Sony

They've had a tough run to the final as well and you have to respect that.\"\n\nAs impressive as keeping out Real-bound Kylian Mbappe was in the last four, Dortmund realise they must go to another level if Madrid are to lose a European final for the first time since 1983.\n\n\"Our goal wasn't to qualify for the final, our goal is to win the champions league,\" said Dortmund fan turned coach Terzic.\n\n\"And if you want to win the champions league, you have to beat the champions. Now the absolute champion in the history of soccer and especially in this competition is waiting for us. The ultimate boss.\"\n\nMadrid's rich champions league tradition means there are also a number of personal feats at stake on Saturday.\n\nAncelotti can extend his record as the only coach to win the European Cup four times.\n\nDani Carvajal, Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, in the final club game of his career, could match Madrid legend Paco Gento as the only player to win the competition six times as a player.\n\nUEFA will be hoping the focus is on the protagonists on the field come full-time to ensure their decision to return to Wembley for a major final is not questioned.\n\nThree years ago, the final of Euro 2020 was marred by violence as ticketless fans stormed the stadium doors to gain entry.\n\nUEFA were also forced to apologise to Liverpool fans for the organisation of the 2022 champions league final in Paris that an independent review found \"almost led to disaster\".\n\nThe English Football Association (FA) have invested \u00a35 million ($6 million) into improving safety and infrastructure at Wembley, which is also set to host the Euro 2028 final.\n\n\"We never foresaw events like that for the Euros final and I'm not sure we will again but we've learned lessons and additional measures have been implemented,\" said the FA's director of tournaments and events Chris Bryant.", "source": {"uri": "thepeninsulaqatar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Peninsula"},

He's also the author of \"Net Gains: Inside the Beautiful Game's Analytics Revolution.\"\n\nEveryone knows Real Madrid are a heavy favorite to win the Champions League for an even-bigger-record 15th time Saturday.\n\nThey're Real Madrid, of course, and they're taking on Borussia Dortmund, who just finished fifth in the German Bundesliga. Per ESPN Bet, Madrid have a 75% chance of lifting the trophy, while Dortmund are 1-in-4 to win their second European Cup. That makes Madrid somewhere close to the biggest favorite of the past 20 years.\n\nBut it's still only one game, and anything can happen. Just ask Manchester City, who were taken down in the 2021 Champions League final by Chelsea, the team that finished fourth in their same league. Or Bayern Munich, who also fell to Chelsea in 2012, the year that the Blues finished sixth in the Premier League team. Or, heck, Man City, who lost the FA Cup last week to Manchester United, a team that finished in eighth place in the Premier League, just days after City won the same league.\n\nThese single-game finals tend to be decided by individual moments -- whether greatness or error -- from individual players rather than tactical triumphs. So, ahead of Saturday's Champions League final, let's rank the 30 best players between these two teams who will decide the next Champions League winner.\n\nSomehow, a young, flashy, uber-productive, trophy-winning Brazilian winger for Real Madrid has become ... Underrated? While his defensive impact has started to wane as he's aged closer to his prime years of 24 to 28, he's the best player in the world at perhaps the deepest position in the world: left wing.\n\nNo one's better at carrying the ball, and no one who comes close to his ball-carrying contribution can also come close to his attacking production. He impacts every game he plays, and I'm not convinced that he isn't the best player in the world.\n\nWhat a way to go out. For the 10th year in a row, Kroos has played more than 2,000 league minutes. Per Michael Imburgio's DAVIES model, which essentially puts a value on every on-ball action that happens across the field, the 34-year-old German added 4.97 goals with his build-up passing. That's nearly a goal more than second-best Rodri (4.07), who played 800 more minutes for Manchester City.\n\nDespite all of Madrid's young talent in midfield, that's going to be near-impossible to replace.\n\nWhy not No. 1? He outperformed his expected goals by 7.7 -- he scored 18 non-penalty goals from 10.3 xG. If that kind of finishing form -- the third highest over-performance of anyone in Europe -- is real, then he's the best player in the world. No question about it. Of course, no one finishes that well over a long run, and he underperformed his xG in all of his previous four professional seasons.\n\nHe's an incredible player, but the current reality is likely closer to the one we saw in the second half of the season, rather than the first.\n\nHis attacking production dipped a bit this year, but he still came in over 0.5 goals+assists per 90 minutes, and I think some of that comes down to him having to facilitate and vacate space for Bellingham to run into. Rodrygo carried and passed the ball upfield more than he ever has this past season. He finds a way to fit into whatever talent is around him; he's just a winning player.\n\nSpeaking of winning players, Valverde is a brilliant, dynamic, athletic, versatile player who makes his teammates better. He's the exact kind of guy that Madrid lacked in the first Galacticos era: a superstar role player who not only fills in the gaps behind all the bigger names but can also contribute decisive moments by himself. My one gripe:\n\nTrade some of those terrible shots from outside the box for a couple more runs into the penalty area.\n\nIt feels like we still haven't really seen Tchouam\u00e9ni fully realized at Madrid. Kroos somehow getting better with age lessened the need for him to contribute in build-up play, while injuries across the backline have required him to play out of position next to Antonio Rudiger at center back.\n\nAt the same time, he was playing out of position at center back at 24 years old for a team that won LaLiga and took down both Manchester City and Bayern Munich. My guess is he'll be the one asked to fill the Kroos-shaped void next season.\n\nHe flourished at Chelsea -- but that was in a back three. In his first season at Madrid, he wasn't always a first-choice starter. In his second season at Madrid ... He's pretty much been the only healthy center back and he's been immense playing for a team that doesn't really do all that much to protect its center backs. Two Champions Leagues in four years, with two different teams, would be a pretty nice haul.\n\nOur first BVB player appears on the list!\n\nI'm not sure this is a popular opinion, but I love this guy. Bundesliga center backs are notoriously hard to assess because of how different the league is, stylistically, to everyone else. But if you want a defender who is going to help you win games with the ball, there aren't many better than Schlotterbeck. He's been starting Bundesliga games since he was a teenager, and he'll still only be 24 at the start of next season.\n\nCamavinga, meanwhile, will only be 21 at the start of next season. He has a ridiculous amount of minutes under his belt already, and I'm pretty confident he's going to be a star -- if he isn't already. The only hesitation is that he still hasn't become a full-time starter at Madrid. If the semifinals are any indication, he'll be coming off the bench at Wembley, too.\n\nHummels is 35 years old. Hummels has won more tackles than any player in the Champions League this season. Hummels has intercepted more passes than any player in the Champions League this season.\n\nHummels is everywhere.\n\nI just can't quit him. Out of any Dortmund player, he's the one most capable of taking over the match and deciding the result on his own. No player has completed more than five successful take-ons against Madrid this season, but one of those players was Bayern Munich's Jamal Musiala in the first leg of the semifinals. And his teammate, Leroy San\u00e9, completed four of his own in the same game. In the first leg of the Champions League semifinal against PSG, Sancho completed 13.\n\nThis is a different Dortmund team than you're used to seeing. With an average age, weighted by minutes played, of 26.8, Dortmund are older than your average Bundesliga side.\n\nThere's no Sancho 1.0, or Erling Haaland, or Bellingham -- the superstar prospect who will obviously leave the club sometime soon. But someone should take a look at Kobel, the 26-year-old who stood on his head against PSG and has allowed nearly seven goals fewer than expected in his three years at Dortmund.\n\nOn a per-minute basis, 38-year-old Modric isn't too different from 31-year-old Modric -- except for the part where 38-year-old Modric is not expected to start the Champions League final.\n\nHe's one of Dortmund's most important players, a link between midfield and attack who can score and create a fair bit on his own. Outside of Schlotterbeck, no Dortmund player featured in more minutes this season, either. At the same time, I'm not sure he'd get much playing time at all if he were on Real Madrid's roster.\n\nThis was a tricky one. Andriy Lunin has great shot-stopping numbers over a decent sample of games that extends beyond just this season and beyond just Madrid. Thibaut Courtois, meanwhile, is one of the best goalkeepers in the world, but he's just coming back from a succession of serious knee injuries.\n\nESPN reports suggest that Courtois is in line to take the job back from Lunin and start against Dortmund. Given there's still uncertainty over the form of Courtois and it's not yet guaranteed that he will play, we're splitting the difference and putting the Madrid goalkeeper right in the middle of the rankings.\n\nAt Milan, Diaz played a lot of minutes without producing much. At Madrid, Diaz played much fewer minutes and produced much more. He's the ideal profile of an off-the-bench attacker for a big club -- energetic, but also not so expensive or accomplished that he'll want to leave if he doesn't frequently start matches.\n\nMaybe he should be higher? Maatsen's only season of top-flight performance is his current half-year loan spell with Dortmund. But he's almost immediately become one of the club's most important contributors since heading to Germany. He's done a nice job functioning in that kind of fullback-midfielder hybrid role where you're not really an overlapping outlet, but instead helping to progress the ball up the field.\n\nSabitzer is a strange player. He's technically one of Dortmund's two holding midfielders, but he's rarely dictating play from deep -- that's for the center backs to do. Instead, a couple times per match, he'll just pop up in incredibly important areas with the ball at his feet, with the potential to make a decisive play that either pushes Dortmund a step closer to scoring a goal or provides the opposition with an opportunity to counterattack in the other direction.\n\nFor his career, he's something like a goal or an assist every other game-type striker. And that's about it. He'll have a couple moments of savvy holdup play every match, but he's ultimately on the ball very little, receiving very few forward passes, and not even getting too many touches in the penalty area, either.\n\nThere aren't many hulking target strikers around these days, though, and I think Fullkrug's unique profile has thrown off some of Dortmund's European opponents.\n\nWith both Diaz and Joselu, Real Madrid this season have been a small-scale study in both team and sub effects. When you play with better players, it's easier to produce. And when you play most of your minutes off the bench against tired legs, it's easier to produce. When you do both? Your goals+assists rate jumps from a career mark of 0.4 per 90 all the way up to 0.64 per 90.\n\nI have a feeling I might regret putting Carvajal here on the list. At this stage in his career, the 32-year-old Carvajal feels like he's either karate-chopping a volley into the upper corner, or pleading with the referee not to send him off for his fifth-straight foul on whatever winger just ran past him. He tends to show up in finals, though.\n\nHe's the only safe passer in the team, but pretty much all of the valuable forward passing comes from players in the backline. Along with the center backs, he'll be tasked with tracking any of Bellingham's runs through the middle.\n\nAll things considered, the 34-year-old club lifer was at best Madrid's fourth-choice center back coming into this season, behind the injured duo of \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o and David Alaba, Rudiger and maybe even Tchouameni, too. Although Militao has made an incredible recovery from a torn ACL earlier this season, it seems like Nacho will still get the nod Saturday.\n\nWhile we're here, though: A fully healthy Militao would've comfortably slid into the top 10 of these rankings.\n\nHe keeps the ball when he gets it. Other than that, he's not creating anything on the attacking end and rarely winning the ball back defensively. If Dortmund are going to win, it seems like they'll be pressing the Sancho-on-Mendy mismatch, over and over and over again.\n\nHe's incredibly fast, and he also trips over the ball multiple times per match. Adeyemi is the Luis Mendoza of European soccer.\n\nPer the DAVIES model, there are 10 players between these two teams who have added at least 0.1 goals per 90 minutes: Kroos, Vini, Bellingham, Rodrygo, Modric, Hummels, Brahim, Valverde, Schlotterbeck and Malen.\n\nMalen, the 25-year-old Dutchman, comes from the Marcus Rashford mold of wingers: stay high, and when you get the ball, drive it into the box and rip a shot. Ironically, that profile balances nicely with Sancho's touch-heavy approach on the other wing.\n\nWere Malen healthy, he'd be significantly higher on this list, but a succession of leg injuries in April mean that he hasn't played 90 minutes in a match since St. Patrick's Day.\n\nI don't know if he'd hold up over a starter's workload for a full season, but he's become a quite effective backup fullback as he's aged deeper into his 30s. Seems bizarre to write this out, but Real Madrid would be totally fine if Vazquez had to play right back in the Champions League final.\n\nMaybe there's a world where he starts the final, in an effort to slow down Vini, but the gigantic defender just hasn't been able to string together any consistency over his career. After a breakout season with Bayern Munich as a 22-year-old in 2018-19, he's broken the 2,000-minute mark in just one of the past five seasons.\n\nThis is how aging tends to work for attacking wingers: At age 34, Reus is averaging his highest pass completion percentage of the past seven seasons while attempting the fewest take-ons over that same stretch. He's been quite effective in limited minutes this season -- nearly 0.8 goals+assists per 90 -- but his lack of burst has been evident against better competition.\n\nIf you're wondering where the Champions League might be won and lost, No. 1 on this list will likely be directly matched up against No. 30 on Saturday.", "source": {"uri": "insider.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com

Now for that fairytale ending? Standing in their way is nothing less than 14 times Champions League conquerors Real Madrid.\n\nMadrid go into Saturday's final as overwhelming favourites, but there's a sea of yellow ready to celebrate an almighty upset in Wembley. Telegraph Sport's football experts predict the outcome.\n\nSam Wallace: Both sides have had minority possession in big knockout games. Real had 36 per cent at the Etihad in the quarter-final second leg and Dortmund just 33 per cent in Paris in the semi-final second leg. Real are a brilliant fast counter-attacking team who pounce on mistakes. Dortmund will seek to counterattack at Wembley as they did against PSG. That is the natural approach in a final of this nature that is obviously mismatched. The risk for Dortmund is that Real's attack simply overrun them.\n\nMike McGrath: Double up on Vinicius Junior. Yes, that might neglect focusing on Toni Kroos' passing or Jude Bellingham's late runs into the penalty area - but Vini Jr is just frightening to defend against and I would take a chance on letting others run off opponents to keep him quiet.\n\nJames Ducker: Defending compactly in a mid-to-low block and seeking to use their pace on the counter attack. Real should see a lot more of the ball than they did in their semi-final against Bayern and Dortmund need to be poised to strike decisively when the opportunity allows. Equally, I could see them having real problems with the quality of Real's attack.\n\nJohn Percy: Dortmund is all about the collective, as a team that is better than the sum of its parts. You have Jadon Sancho and Marcel Sabitzer both jettisoned by Manchester United, Ian Maatsen unwanted at Chelsea, plus Mats Hummels and Niklas Sule dumped by Bayern Munich. If they can be the team, they could - and it is a big could - secure a shock win.\n\nWallace: Two great sides and great players on both - but we all like an upset. A Dortmund win would be good for the Champions League and European football. Like Real, they are a club majority-owned by their fans but unlike Real, their debt is tiny. They do not have access to the kind of long-term sales of future revenue which have funded Real's stadium renovation. In the 1990s, when Dortmund won their only European Cup/Champions League, nine different clubs from eight different countries - including Real - won the competition. In the last ten years, six clubs from only three nations have won it and none on the relatively modest budget Dortmund work to.\n\nMcGrath: Jadon Sancho enjoying his football and rising to the occasion at Wembley. He looked like he had a point to prove in the semi-finals and it would send a big message to Manchester United if he put in another big performance.\n\nDucker: A season that could not have started much worse for Jadon Sancho after his public and bitter falling out with Erik ten Hag could yet end with the England forward, on loan at Dortmund from Manchester United, with a Champions League winners' medal. It would be some story.\n\nPercy: Carlo Ancelotti's eyebrow in glorious high definition\n\nWallace: Judging by his semi-final performance, Vinicius Junior is the most in-form player in Europe. He should be the star.\n\nMcGrath: Andriy Lunin could be an unlikely hero, providing he recovers from flu in time. The \u20ac9 million signing from Zorya Luhansk in Ukraine has been loaned out to Leganes, Valladolid and Oviedo in recent seasons but has seized his chance this season after Thibaut Courtois' serious knee injury. Showed against Manchester City in the quarters that he holds his nerve in a penalty shoot-out.\n\nDucker: There will inevitably be a huge amount of attention on Jude Bellingham, up against his old club, but Vinicius Jr has proven time and again he is a player who brings his best on the biggest occasions and I expect no different here.\n\nPercy: The focus will inevitably be on Jude Bellingham and Sancho, but this could be a significant night for Mats Hummels. At the age of 35, the old warrior may well be preparing for his last ever showpiece final. Hummels has been so consistent, and indeed arguably under-rated, over the years and will be absolutely crucial at Wembley.\n\nDucker: Hard to see beyond a 15th European Cup for Real. 3-1 to Carlo Ancelotti's side.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium",

Wembley win would reward a club that still does it differently", "body": "Borussia Dortmund take on Real Madrid in the Champions League one year on from their final-day nightmare in the Bundesliga. Bouncing back to become champions of Europe would be the perfect way to show why this club is so special\n\nMonday marked the start of Champions League final week and Dortmund is duly abuzz as supporters ready themselves for London. But it also marked one year since the miserable day that Borussia Dortmund blew the Bundesliga title.\n\nYou might recall the scenes of disbelief. Needing only victory at home to Mainz to end Bayern Munich's decade of dominance in Germany, the parade plans were already in place. Instead, Dortmund could only scrape their way to a 2-2 draw. Dreams dashed.\n\nOutside the stadium, there were the usual recriminations. The exuberance of Edin Terzic, the team's fan-turned-coach who had ridden the emotions to carry them to the brink of the title, was reframed. Had he been na\u00efve? Were these players ready to win?\n\nInside the stadium, there was none of that. Those were conversations for another time. There was only a community united in disappointment. Terzic was in tears as he and his players applauded the supporters who did just that - supported their broken team. Even so, how do you recover from such a setback?\n\nSpeaking to Carsten Cramer, Dortmund's managing director, on a trip to the city earlier this season, it was the question to ask. \"Maybe you have seen the pictures,\" he replied. \"What happened with the players, what happened with the coach. That is Dortmund.\"\n\nThat is Dortmund, indeed. It is just one reason why their return to the biggest stage - the Champions League final against Real Madrid at Wembley on Saturday - is such a cause for celebration. \"Dortmund is different,\" Cramer explained. He is not wrong.\n\nThis is the best supported club in Europe in terms of average attendance thanks to that Yellow Wall. They belong among the elite - winners of the 1997 Champions League and a club that boasts the second biggest revenues in Germany - but remain an outlier.\n\n\"There are a lot of pieces to the Dortmund puzzle. It is a very special one.\" They have reached this final despite having sold Jude Bellingham to their opponents last summer and sold Erling Haaland to current holders Manchester City the summer before that.\n\nThere is something organic about Dortmund, something beautiful about them beating Paris Saint-Germain to be here. \"We have no government, no company, no Arabian owner spending money. Whatever we do we have to earn it ourselves. That makes us proud.\"\n\nWere it not for the football club, Dortmund would be a relatively unremarkable city in the Ruhr. Neither the prettiest nor the wealthiest. \"If you compare Dortmund as a city to the big ones, most of them are where the money is.\" There is another currency in Dortmund.\n\n\"The most valuable currency of this club is emotion.\" That can be a good thing and a bad thing. \"I do not know any human who is only able to spend positive emotion. Negative emotion, disappointment, sadness and madness belongs to the history of this club.\"\n\nThere have been more difficult moments than squandering the title. \"Twenty years ago we made the mistake of spending money we did not have to overtake Bayern Munich and we almost went bankrupt.\" Lessons were learned. These days, they know who they are.\n\nNow, Bayern's wage bill is around double that of Dortmund - the true context behind their attempts to compete with their Bundesliga rivals. \"That is not to complain but we all know that the more you spend on salary, the higher the probability of success.\"\n\nAnd yet, some rivals will still be envious of Dortmund. So many fans. So many customers. But Cramer and his colleagues understand that there are limitations at this particular club. When the brand is built on authenticity, naked commercialisation can be awkward.\n\nA conversation with Benedikt Scholz, Dortmund's director of internationalisation and commercial partnerships, comes to mind. That famed Yellow Wall is certainly under-commercialised given how photographed it is but that is entirely deliberate.\n\n\"In some ways, you could say we are economically lunatics,\" Scholz suggested. \"Look at the Yellow Wall, there are 25,000 people standing there. If we would just put seats in and 20 more [executive] boxes, our commercial revenue would grow.\"\n\nCramer acknowledged: \"It is sometimes a challenge if there is a red line here and a red line there. It limits the growth. It makes it difficult. But I am happy. Protect your character. Take care of your DNA. Be open to new developments but no revolution.\"\n\nIt means that while there are offices in New York and Singapore, Dortmund cannot expand as others have. They will not be hosting NFL games like Eintracht Frankfurt. But this weakness is a strength. \"It is something which is part of our DNA. We focus on football.\"\n\nHe added: \"Although we have not been champions for 11 years, the stadium is still sold out. The interest in the club did not give up. That is because we are not only a football club. That is why the people spend their heart and not just their money.\"\n\nOne wonders how those conversations go with his fellow executives when they are breaking bread as well as making it. Cramer offered a little insight, reflecting on what Txiki Begiristain, Manchester City's director of football, once told him was the key to sustained success.\n\n\"He told me, 'It is so important that you have 24 equal players in your squad because the players need that pressure.' Of course, I know that it is helpful to guarantee success in sports but we do not have the money to offer the coach 24 equal players.\n\nThey are not Manchester City and they are not the great Real Madrid. Nor do they want to be. They certainly do not want to be like Bayern Munich. \"We do not compare ourselves to Bayern. As long as we try as hard as possible for our members, it is fine.\"\n\nThere is another plan, explained by Cramer that day. \"Try to be Dortmund. At some point, we will be rewarded for this strategy.\" One year on from that disappointment against Mainz, the biggest reward that European club football can offer is only 90 minutes away.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_UEFA_Champions_League_final", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2021 UEFA Champions League final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruhr", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ruhr"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainz", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mainz"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mainz"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sporting director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_competitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA competitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Txiki_Begiristain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Txiki Begiristain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eintracht_Frankfurt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eintracht Frankfurt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/UEFA", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/05/1600x900/skysports-football-champions-league_6568488.jpg?20240529092339", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613014", "eventUri": "eng-9613014", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

Getty Images\n\nBorussia Dortmund and Real Madrid meet at Wembley on Saturday for the UEFA Champions League final in an ultimate David vs. Goliath scenario. As always you can catch coverage of all the action across CBS, Paramount+, CBS Sports Golazo Network and CBS Sports Network. Both sides are former winners, although that is also lopsided with the Spanish giants seeking an unprecedented 15th continental crown and the Germans looking to add their second 27 years after the first.\n\nBVB saw off Paris Saint-Germain to get here while Los Blancos knocked off Bayern Munich to prevent an all-Bundesliga final and Edin Terzic vs. Carlo Ancelotti promises to be an enthralling watch. The Italian tactician is seeking his fifth UCL title while Real's metronomic midfielder Toni Kroos is also bowing out with the La Liga champions here after announcing his decision to retire after UEFA Euro 2024 on home soil.\n\nSo far, Braga, Napoli and Union Berlin were seen off in the group stage and RB Leipzig and then Manchester City followed in the round of 16 and the quarterfinals before Bayern in the semifinals. Real are in their 18th Champions League final with only three defeats to their name and it has been 43 years since they lost to Liverpool in 1981 with eight consecutive final wins.\n\nA treble awaits with La Liga and the Supercopa already secured and a 25-game unbeaten run will have Dortmund worried ahead of this one. Ancelotti's side have also scored in each of their away game in 2023-24 although BVB are this season's defensive kings in the UCL with Gregor Kobel boasting six clean sheets.\n\nHere's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more:\n\nReal Madrid's key concern\n\nAs well as David Alaba who is also missing this summer's Euros with an ACL problem, Aurelien Tchouameni is missing out after injuring his foot and could yet also suffer the same fate in Germany despite being picked for Les Bleus. Ancelotti's solution is readymade with Nacho Fernandez likely to captain the side from central defense alongside Antonio Rudiger with the Real veteran also bowing out after this one like Kroos.\n\nTeam news\n\nReal: Jude Bellingham is fit and raring to go but spare a thought for Andriy Lunin who was expected to lose out to Thibaut Courtois between the sticks but might not even be part of the squad for the game due to an untimely case of flu. Otherwise, Kroos should start alongside Eduardo Camavinga and Federico Valverde although Luka Modric is not expected to start. Joselu is unlikely to force his way in ahead of Rodrygo and Vinicius Junior up top despite being the semifinal hero.\n\nPotential Real XI: Courtois; Carvajal, Rudiger, Nacho, Mendy; Valverde, Camavinga, Kroos; Bellingham; Rodrygo, Vinicius Junior.\n\nHow to watch and oddsDate: Saturday, June 1 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: Wembley -- London, EnglandWatch: Paramount+ and CBSOdds: Dortmund +400; Draw +300; Real -154Head to head\n\nDortmund and Real have met 14 times in the Champions League with the Spaniards boasting six wins to the Germans' three. Their most recent meeting came back in 2017-18 which saw Los Blancos win both group games while BVB won a 2013-14 quarterfinal second leg 2-0 despite a 3-0 first leg loss which saw them eliminated. This is undoubtedly the biggest ever game between the two despite winning one semifinal apiece against each other in years gone by.\n\nPrediction\n\nReal should have enough to win this one despite Dortmund's excellent defense so expect Bellingham to haunt his former club and potentially score the winning goal.

Indeed, Dortmund have been the surprise team in the Champions League this season and they will be desperate to spring one more surprise when they take on the favourites and mighty, Real Madrid, at the iconic Wembley Stadium. Dortmund were ranked outsiders when the tournament kicked off, particularly when they were drawn in a group of death alongside PSG, AC Milan, and Newcastle. Even after they surprisingly topped the group, they were again written off when they faced PSG in the semi-final, but they defied the odds to win 1-0 home and away to leave fans dreaming of their first Champions League title since 1997. The only problem is, they now face a Real Madrid side who have lifted this trophy a record 14 times and are yet to taste a single defeat in the competition this season.\n\nReal Madrid, on the other hand, knocked out this season's favourites and current holders, Manchester City, in the quarter-finals then squeeze past another German giant, Bayern Munich, in the semi-final to secure their spot in the grand finale. The newly crowned La Liga champions will enter this game on the back of a good run of form, having gone unbeaten since they lost to rivals Atletico Madrid in the Copa del Rey in early January. They are now unbeaten in their last 24 matches in all competitions, winning 16 times during this impressive run. Amazingly, they are unbeaten in the Champions League this season and have lost just one league game in La Liga this season, a record that saw them win La Liga by 10 points. Now they are aiming for an unprecedented 15th UEFA title and are overwhelming favourites to achieve the feat.\n\nJustbet customers who makes a bet for $1,500 or more from March 1 to April 28, 2024, will be entered into a draw to win a trip to the 2024 UEFA Champions League finals.\n\n* Dortmund - Dortmund have been in good form recently, winning four of their last five matches including an impressive 1-0 win over PSG in the Champions League semi-finals.\n\n* Real Madrid - Real Madrid have scored in all 12 of their Champions League games played this season and have scored 38 goals in their last 39 matches.\n\n* Both sides - Dortmund have won just one of the last five head-to-head meetings between both teams, while Real Madrid have won twice, with the other two games ending in 2-2 draws.\n\nNewly crowned UEFA Europa League Champions, Atalanta will end their domestic season against Fiorentina at home in a rescheduled game that should have been played in March.\n\nWith this being the final match of the Serie A season, all the positions are already determined, and Atalanta will finish fourth while Fiorentina will end their campaign in eighth place. With that said, Atalanta have been excellent form recently especially in front of goal, scoring at least twice in their last seven league matches. Indeed, Atalanta's in-form attacker Ademola Lookman is on fire. After scoring a memorable hat-trick in the Europa League final he again scored in their most recent match.\n\nFiorentina, on the other hand, may have a difficult time preventing Atalanta from scoring as they have not kept a clean sheet in their last eight matches in all competitions. However, they have been scoring for fun, having scored 15 times in their last six matches which could mean that fans might be in for a goal-fest to end the Serie A campaign. Fiorentina have won two, drawn two, and lost one, in their last five matches, though they were able to book their spot in the UEFA Europa\n\nConference final to be played in midweek against Olympiacos, which means they\n\ncould still end their campaign with a trophy.\n\nJustbet customers who makes a bet for $1,500 or more from March 1 to April 28, 2024, will be entered into a draw to win a trip to the 2024 UEFA Champions League finals.\n\n* Atalanta - Atalanta have won their last six matches in the league and have won their last five home games.\n\n* Fiorentina - Fiorentina are unbeaten in their last four league matches home and away.\n\n* Both sides - Since 2021, both teams have met six times in the league with Fiorentina winning three times and Atalanta winning two and the other ending in a draw.\n\nPrediction Odds on Prediction Odds Calculation\n\nOdds on the Home Team (Dortmund) winning the game 1-0 at full time $15.00 which means that a $1,000 bet would pay $15,000\n\nOdds on the Away Team (R/Madrid) winning the game 1-3 at full time $13.00 which means that a $1,000 bet would pay $13,000\n\nOdds on the game drawing 1-1 at full time $7.50 which means that a $1,000 bet would pay $7,500.\n\nPrediction Odds on Prediction Odds Calculation\n\nOdds on the Home Team(Atalanta) winning the game 3-1 $11.00 which means that a $1,000 bet would pay $11,000\n\nOdds on the Away Team (Fiorentina) winning the game 2-3 at full time $51.00 which means that a $1,000 bet would pay $51,000\n\nOdds on the game drawing 3-3 at full time $71.00 which means that a $1,000 bet would pay $71,000.", "source": {"uri": "jamaicaobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACF_Fiorentina", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ACF Fiorentina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

When Dortmund won the Champions League in 1997, they finished third in the Bundesliga - eight points behind Bayern. In 2013, the gap was 25 points. Conversely, when Klopp won back-to-back titles in 2011 and 2012, they were knocked out of Europe in the group stage.\n\nThis season, Terzic led Dortmund successfully through a daunting group, including home and away wins over Newcastle United, victory over AC Milan in the San Siro and a draw with Paris St-Germain.\n\nTheir European excellence continued into the knockout stages, now boosted by two Premier League loanees - Chelsea's Ian Maatsen and, of course, Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho, back at the club where he'd made his breakthrough.\n\nSancho's final game for Dortmund before joining United had been that 2021 German Cup final under Terzic, whose undisputed man-management qualities are again benefitting the Londoner after a difficult time in Manchester.\n\n\"Jadon and I both know that he's not yet at his maximum level,\" said Terzic in April. \"But we knew that and took it into account when we brought him back here. We see how hard he's working and we're sure he'll hit top form again soon.\"\n\nWhich is exactly what Sancho did, producing a man-of-the-match display in the Champions League semi-final first leg against PSG and setting Dortmund on course for the final.\n\nAt full-time after the second leg in Paris, Terzic disappeared into the jubilant mob of Dortmund fans at the front of the away end. Those same fans who had picked him up on the final day of last season against Mainz.\n\n\"This is why we do it,\" he said afterwards. \"We'd hoped for such scenes last season. Unfortunately, it didn't go as planned but our fans were there for us. Today, we could give them a little bit back.\"\n\nTerzic and Dortmund remain a mystery. \"Who can work out?\" asked tabloid BILD, stating: \"Terzic is unsackable now.\"\n\nAnd for local broadcaster WDR, Dortmund's progression to the final is already \"the triumph of a beleaguered coach\".\n\nAnd what about the fans? Sitting on the train to Dortmund's last game of the season, one BVB supporter admitted he \"would have sacked him at Christmas, but how can you criticise a coach who's taken us to the Champions League final?\"\n\nThe mixed feelings were replicated around the beer stands under the S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne. \"He's brilliant, he's one of us,\" added another. \"But as a coach...?\"\n\nTerzic was a fan at the Olympiastadion in 2012. He was a fan at Wembley in 2013. As he said, however, \"those days are over.\"\n\nNow, he wants to be seen as Terzic, the Borussia Dortmund head coach.\n\n\"Is there anyone who works in football who wasn't once a fan?\" he asked, rhetorically.\n\n\"Whether journalist, steward or press officer, we all fell in love with football as fans and we all had a team which we loved and supported. My path as a fan led to me becoming head coach of Borussia Dortmund. I'm very happy about that.

Sign up to receive it directly to your inbox.\n\nA Champions League final under the famous Wembley arch, what more could you ask for?\n\nIt'll be all white on the night, surely? Real Madrid are clear favourites to win the Champions League on Saturday and there is almost a mythical quality to their legend.\n\n\"They say at the Bernabeu (Madrid's home stadium) there is a god and he wears a white shirt -- and, who knows? Maybe that's true,\" Madrid head coach Carlo Ancelotti told UK newspaper The Times this week.\n\nSome say the white kit was inspired by a London-based amateur team in the early 1900s. Others believe it's plain old superstition: Madrid swapped navy socks for white for the European Cup's inaugural tournament and, as we know, they went on to win it five seasons on the bounce. They now have 14 European titles, twice as many as anyone else.\n\nMadrid can land blows from all angles (though they focus their attacks down the left through Vinicius Jr, see above). Sit deep, they'll jab through you. Press high and they'll do damage with an uppercut of a counter -- their six goals from fast breaks are more than any team in the competition this season.\n\nWe can point to supernatural powers but the reality is Madrid can punish you however they see fit.\n\nSpeaking of Bellingham, how have Dortmund looked since his departure to Madrid last summer?\n\nThe Jekyll and Hyde analogy seems pertinent. Excellent in Europe, inconsistent domestically. Champions League finalists, but finishing only fifth in the Bundesliga.\n\nDortmund -- who have just signed a three-year sponsorship deal with weapons manufacturer Rheinmetall -- have their own demons to exorcise at Wembley after losing their previous Champions League final there in 2013. They will likely be on the ropes for parts of tomorrow night's game, but they seem to be comfortable with that.\n\nThey've only conceded nine goals in their 12 European matches this season, keeping clean sheets in half of them. This is a team who can smother opponents by condensing all 10 outfield players into a fraction of the pitch (see below). The Yellow Wall perhaps shouldn't be a term reserved just for their fans.\n\nMarco Reus and Mats Hummels both played in that 2012-13 final, and the latter will be wanting to channel the frustration from that day -- and missing out on the Germany squad for this summer's Euros -- into his performance.\n\nMeanwhile, the fleet-footed duo of Julian Brandt and Jadon Sancho -- whose semi-final first-leg performance will live long in the memory -- and speed merchant Karim Adeyemi all have the quality to provide counter-punches of their own.\n\nAnd if they win? they will play Adele, of course.\n\nSomeone Like You is a song about heartache and breakups but Dortmund are known to blast the ballad after times of victory and euphoria, it is their 'legal drug'. They played it after beating Paris Saint-Germain in the semis and also when they won the German Cup in 2021.\n\nAnd I get it. It's slow; it's anthemic. It's a symbol of camaraderie, singing arm in arm with a team-mate. It's emotional.\n\nHead coach Edin Terzic (below) -- who was in tears a year ago as Dortmund failed to clinch the Bundesliga title when it was in their hands on the season's final day -- will need his side to perform at their maximum to win but if they do emerge victorious, expect to hear a song now steeped in Dortmund tradition.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa Borussia Dortmund vs Real Madrid, Saturday, 3pm ET / 8pm UK -- CBS, TNT Sports\n\nTo galvanise the Manchester United players ahead of their FA Cup final against Manchester City last weekend, the coaching staff played an edit of Al Pacino's iconic speech from 1999 sports movie Any Given Sunday.\n\nHead coach Tony D'Amato's address to his Miami Sharks before the game that served as the film's climax provided the voiceover to images from United's two seasons under Erik ten Hag, with U2's song One, playing in the background.\n\nWhether United's youthful squad will be aware of a film made before most of them were born or a song released in 1991 is debatable -- apart from 36-year-old Jonny Evans perhaps -- but it worked, as they overcame the odds to defeat their neighbours at Wembley.\n\nTen Hag was able to inspire confidence in his United side last week but do United fans have confidence in him? Seventy-five per cent of supporters who voted in our survey want him to remain as manager, with Mauricio Pochettino their favourite to replace the Dutchman should he leave.\n\nEight players have appeared in the Champions League this season (2023-24) who also took part in the 2007-08 version -- who are they?", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"},

It is the 69th staging of the match and the 32nd since it was renamed from the European Cup. This is the final campaign in its current format of a 32-team group stage with a new expanded format introduced next season.\n\nThis year's Champions League final is between Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund and La Liga champions Real Madrid. It takes place on Saturday, June 1, at London's Wembley Stadium and kicks off 11pm UAE time.\n\nLast year's final was won by Manchester City who became European champions for the first time when they defeated Serie A side Inter Milan in Istanbul 1-0 thanks to a second-half strike from midfielder Rodri. With the Premier League title and FA Cup already secured, victory at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium meant Pep Guardiola's side had completed a trophy treble.\n\nReal Madrid are way out in front in terms of European Cup wins with the Spanish club lifting the trophy 14 times and finishing runners-up on a further three occasions. Serie A side AC Milan are next best with seven victories, one ahead of Bundesliga outfit Bayern Munich and Premier League club Liverpool. Real's Spanish rivals Barcelona have ruled Europe on five occasions.\n\nThe Germans have been champions of Europe once, in 1997, when they defeated Juventus 3-1 at The Olympiastadion in Munich thanks to a Karl-Heinz Riedle double and a superb lob from substitute Lars Ricken. Alessandro Del Piero scored for the Italians to pull the score back to 2-1 but that turned out to be merely a consolation.\n\nDortmund were also beaten finalists in 2013 when a last-minute Arjen Robben goal earned German rivals Bayern Munich a 2-1 win at Wembley.\n\nReal Madrid qualified for the knockout stages after finishing top of Group C, winning all six of their games, against Napoli, Sporting Braga and Union Berlin. They finished eight points clear of second-placed Napoli. RB Leipzig were then dispatched 2-1 on aggregate in the last 16 before Real knocked reigning champions Manchester City out in the quarter-finals via a penalty shoot-out after the match had finished 4-4 on aggregate after extra-time.\n\nIn the semi-finals, two last-gasp goals from substitute Joselu earned Madrid a 2-1 second-leg win over Bayern Munich which meant they came out on top 4-3 on aggregate.\n\nDortmund were drawn in a 'Group of Death' that contained Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain, Italian giants AC Milan and big-spending Premier League side Newcastle United. Despite losing their opening game to PSG, the Germans went on to finish top of Group F by three points.\n\nDutch side PSV Eindhoven were beaten 3-1 over two legs in the last 16 before Dortmund edged out Spain's Atletico Madrid 5-4 on aggregate. They then took on PSG again, defeating the French side 1-0 in both legs to seal their final spot.\n\nThe champions will receive prize money of \u20ac20 million with the runners-up settling for \u20ac15.5 million.\n\nSlovenia's Slavko Vincic will referee the game. He will be officiating his second Uefa club competition final after the 2022 Europa League showpiece between Eintracht Frankfurt and Rangers.\n\nUAE football fans can watch Saturday's final live on beIN Sports.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiastadion_(Berlin)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympiastadion (Berlin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_competitions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA competitions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Istanbul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Istanbul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Heinz_Riedle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Heinz Riedle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Ricken", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lars Ricken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjen_Robben", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arjen Robben"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

League final talking points - Can Borussia Dortmund upset Real Madrid?", "body": "Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund clash at Wembley on Saturday as the Champions League final brings down the curtain on the club season.\n\nHere, the PA news agency looks at some of the major talking points ahead of the game.\n\nThe 20-year-old asked for Zinedine Zidane's old number five shirt when he completed his move and he has certainly started to live up to the lofty expectations that come with such a request.\n\nWith 23 goals and 12 assists over the course of the campaign to date, the England midfielder could be key to Real lifting an unrivalled 15th European Cup.\n\nAnother Englishman looking to make an impact on proceedings is Jadon Sancho, who has been in good form since returning to Dortmund on loan from Manchester United in January.\n\nThe 24-year-old struggled for consistency at Old Trafford and left under a cloud following a falling out with manager Erik ten Hag.\n\nSince then he has started to rebuild his reputation in Germany with some eye-catching performances en route to the Champions League final.\n\nAnd he will look to create a better personal memory at Wembley after missing in the penalty shoot-out defeat to Italy in the Euro 2020 final three years ago.\n\nAfter winning four Champions League titles and four LaLiga crowns during a trophy-laden decade in Madrid, midfielder Toni Kroos will play his final game for the club at Wembley.\n\nThe 34-year-old - who also won three league titles at Bayern Munich as well as the 2014 World Cup with Germany - is hanging up his boots after a home European Championship this summer.\n\nKroos will want to bow out in style as he aims for more silverware to cap a fine career.\n\nWhile Real will be considered heavy favourites under the Wembley arch, Dortmund will be looking to upset the odds.\n\nHead coach Edin Terzic has filled numerous roles at the club and, in his second stint as manager, could deliver their first Champions League glory since 1997.\n\nAs a scout and coach in the club's academy he answered to former boss Jurgen Klopp but on Saturday he can go one better than the German, who was in charge when Dortmund last reached the final in 2013 - a 2-1 loss to Bayern Munich at Wembley.\n\nMark Hughes is likely to have been rubbing his eyes in disbelief as he watched Joselu score two late goals to down Bayern Munich in the semi-finals.\n\nWelshman Hughes was the Stoke boss who signed the forward in the summer of 2015 but Joselu managed just four goals before being shipped out on loan - eventually returning to England for a similarly unimpactful two-year stay at Newcastle.\n\nHowever, having moved to the Bernabeu on loan from Espanyol this season, the 34-year-old wrote his name into Real folklore with his match-winning brace and now he will be hoping for a chance to repeat the feat at Wembley.", "source": {"uri": "thetelegraphandargus.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Telegraph and Argus"},

A victory against the Spanish giants could further boost the stock's upward trajectory.\n\nOvercoming Real Madrid will be no easy feat for the Dortmund team, as the Spanish club is the all-time leader in the competition with 14 trophies. Borussia has only won the Champions League once, in 1996/97, defeating Juventus of Italy 3-1 in the final.\n\nThey then went on to beat Dida and Bebeto's Cruzeiro 2-0 in the Intercontinental Cup final. In 2012/13, they faced fellow German side Bayern Munich in the final but lost 2-1 to finish as runners-up.\n\nThe team's impressive Champions League run, eliminating giants along the way, has raised expectations not only for a title but also for revenue and profit growth.\n\nDortmund has left behind established clubs in the competition, including Milan (Italy), Newcastle (England), PSV (Netherlands), Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid (Spain), and Paris Saint-Germain (France).\n\nIn the last balance sheet, released on May 10th, the club reported total revenue of \u20ac104 million in the first quarter of 2024, up 1.7% from the previous quarter, but a net loss of \u20ac21 million.\n\nFor the previous season, 2022/23, reported in the middle of last year, total revenue was \u20ac490 million (18% higher than 2021/22) and net profit was \u20ac9.6 million (after a loss of \u20ac32 million in 2021/22).\n\nIn the current season, the club has already achieved a net profit of \u20ac49 million on revenue of \u20ac443 million. For this Champions League, Borussia projects to earn over \u20ac100 million in total - if they win the title, the UEFA prize money is an additional \u20ac20 million.\n\nBullish sentiment surrounding Borussia Dortmund (BVB) stock extends beyond the possibility of winning the European title.\n\nThe club was profitable in the previous season and is expected to remain so in the near future, with projected earnings growth in 2024. Additionally, Dortmund maintains a moderate debt level (Net Debt/Total Capital of 10.9%).\n\nOn the other hand, current liquidity is low (0.6x), with short-term liabilities exceeding liquid assets. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates the stock is overbought (meaning there is a risk of a price decline).\n\nBVB's overall financial health score is 2.69, close to the average (2.75), indicating no cause for concern. The most notable strengths lie in the Price Trend category (score of 3.35), with an excellent return over the past three months (23.3%), and Profitability (score of 2.94), characterized by a Gross Margin of 94.8% and an average ROE of 96.2% over the past two years.\n\nBorussia Dortmund is not the only football club with publicly traded shares. Two other traditional European teams and former Champions League winners also have shares listed on stock exchanges: Manchester United (NYSE:MANU) on the NYSE and Juventus Football Club (BIT:JUVE) on the Borsa Italiana.\n\nManchester United won the FA Cup last Saturday against rivals Manchester City, but their underwhelming Premier League season resulted in an 18% drop in their stock price in 2024. Juventus also underperformed in Serie A, and their stock has declined by 27% this year.\n\n***\n\nIntroducing ProPicks: Our cutting-edge AI analyzes mountains of data to pinpoint high-potential stocks before the market reacts.\n\nFor less than $9 a month, you'll receive a monthly update featuring our AI's curated selection of stocks primed for significant upside.\n\nStop missing out!

Why is Real much better now than in the past? One reason is they are much physically stronger, bringing in players such as Eduardo Camavinga, Valverde and Aur\u00e9lien Tchouam\u00e9ni, who will miss the final with injury.\n\nThey can make the difference in the middle of the pitch and it has been a deliberate policy to recruit these sorts of players in order to compete in Europe with the English and German teams.\n\nKnowing they have this base -- you have Antonio R\u00fcdiger in defence, too -- we have seen Real also recruit youngsters from Brazil at an early age with Endrick being the latest to join.\n\nOne of the reasons Bellingham made such an impact at the start of his Real career is because of the pace, energy and power he possesses. His physicality was one of the reasons he was able to pass opponents and he quickly settled into a positive cycle of playing well, scoring goals, playing well, scoring goals. His timing of when to arrive in the penalty box and which areas to take up is very good. I know because when I was in charge of Celta Vigo, he scored the winner in the third game of the season. It came from a corner which we should have defended better, but still he was there.\n\n* Carlo Ancelotti interview: Secrets of Champions League's mastermind coach\n\nAs the season progressed, it became more difficult and obviously rival teams looked at him more closely.\n\nWhen we talk about quality, we often think of it in terms of a piece of skill but being tough to play against is just as important.\n\nThe Champions League final will be Toni Kroos's last game in club football and he has had an exceptional career.\n\nHe poses a specific problem to Dortmund because when he drops deep to receive the ball then his passing range can cause many, many headaches.\n\nIf he goes into the left pocket to receive possession from the centre back Nacho, for example, will Jadon Sancho be asked to press him? Kroos cannot be left alone, but if Sancho is given that task it allows Ferland Mendy to go forward from left back and support Vinicius Jnr. Suddenly, Julian Ryerson, the Dortmund right back, is facing two vs one as the diagram shows.\n\nOne of the key battles in this game will be Ryerson against Vinicius Jnr. The defender found himself up against Paris Saint-Germain's Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 in the semi-final and, at times, I felt he could have had more help from his team-mates.\n\n* James Gheerbrant: Goodbye Toni Kroos, the man who represents football's purest form\n\nIt might be better if Julian Brandt, the No10, or the striker Niclas Fullkrug decides to pick up Kroos and prevent him from playing the penetrating passes that he is so good at.\n\nWhen you are waiting for another challenge in management, you must study teams and be prepared to learn from everyone. I have been studying Dortmund a lot recently and there is a lot to like about this team. They normally play 4-2-3-1/4-1-4-1, which was the case in the success over PSG. They impressed with the way they tried to keep the ball, playing out from the back and then into the wide areas where Sancho and the pace of Karim Adeyemi meant they were a threat. Centre back Nico Schlotterbeck was very good alongside the experienced Mats Hummels and in Brandt they have someone who can shoot from distance.\n\nThey also have the option of playing long to the target man Fullkrug, asking him to hold the ball up and then pushing numbers forward to support him. The coach, Edin Terzic, is a clever manager. He will have a game plan, plans A and B in fact, and in some respects they have nothing to lose as Real are big favourites.\n\nDortmund are right to stay humble.\n\nReading the Spanish media it is Real Madrid this, Real Madrid that. Dortmund are not saying too much and maybe there will be a surprise. After all, PSG are a top side, they have Mbapp\u00e9, but Dortmund overcame them.\n\nWe have to consider Real's mentality. They were a little fortunate against Bayern Munich in the semi-final and beat Manchester City on penalties, but they are always there. Why? Some players are comfortable to be in the middle of the table. When you aim to qualify for the Champions League you have four opportunities in England, to qualify for Europe it is usually seven and to stay in the Premier League you can finish in 17 different places.\n\nI was in the Real Madrid system as a player and as a coach for nearly 20 years, so I can say with authority that the difference with Real is they always look to finish first in everything they do. That mentality means you always have to perform at the highest level. They are used to having possession, but they can also play on the counter attack. Above all, they want to win. Economically, they are much stronger than the other clubs in Spain, even Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, and there is a risk that in the future it will become too easy for them to dominate La Liga.",

talking points - Can Borussia Dortmund upset Real Madrid?", "body": "Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund clash at Wembley on Saturday as the Champions League final brings down the curtain on the club season.\n\nHere, the PA news agency looks at some of the major talking points ahead of the game.\n\nJude Bellingham has enjoyed a fine first campaign at Real Madrid having joined from Dortmund last summer and will be aiming to top it off with victory over his former club.\n\nThe 20-year-old asked for Zinedine Zidane's old number five shirt when he completed his move and he has certainly started to live up to the lofty expectations that come with such a request.\n\nWith 23 goals and 12 assists over the course of the campaign to date, the England midfielder could be key to Real lifting an unrivalled 15th European Cup.\n\nThe 24-year-old struggled for consistency at Old Trafford and left under a cloud following a falling out with manager Erik ten Hag.\n\nSince then he has started to rebuild his reputation in Germany with some eye-catching performances en route to the Champions League final.\n\nAnd he will look to create a better personal memory at Wembley after missing in the penalty shoot-out defeat to Italy in the Euro 2020 final three years ago.\n\nThe 34-year-old - who also won three league titles at Bayern Munich as well as the 2014 World Cup with Germany - is hanging up his boots after a home European Championship this summer.\n\nKroos will want to bow out in style as he aims for more silverware to cap a fine career.\n\nHead coach Edin Terzic has filled numerous roles at the club and, in his second stint as manager, could deliver their first Champions League glory since 1997.\n\nAs a scout and coach in the club's academy he answered to former boss Jurgen Klopp but on Saturday he can go one better than the German, who was in charge when Dortmund last reached the final in 2013 - a 2-1 loss to Bayern Munich at Wembley.\n\nWelshman Hughes was the Stoke boss who signed the forward in the summer of 2015 but Joselu managed just four goals before being shipped out on loan - eventually returning to England for a similarly unimpactful two-year stay at Newcastle.\n\nHowever, having moved to the Bernabeu on loan from Espanyol this season, the 34-year-old wrote his name into Real folklore with his match-winning brace and now he will be hoping for a chance to repeat the feat at Wembley.", "source": {"uri": "jerseyeveningpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jersey Evening Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Zinedine Zidane had resigned and Florentino Perez, stunned by the rejection of his Super League scheme the previous month, decided he needed a safe pair of hands.\n\nAt the time, many expected Ancelotti to be a placeholder until Perez found somebody more exciting to take over. Since leading Madrid to their 10th Champions League title in 2014, the Italian's career had gone into decline. He had undistinguished spells at Bayern (a Bundesliga title notwithstanding) and Napoli before winding up at Goodison in 2019.\n\nInstead, Ancelotti's second coming has been a sustained coaching masterclass that has established a genuine case for him to be considered the best in the world.\n\nEarlier this month Madrid celebrated their second league title in three years, but the thing they are most proud of is that they are succeeding while rebuilding the team around a new generation of players. The losses of key players like Karim Benzema and Casemiro were hardly noticed.\n\nSuccess has brought an uncharacteristic stability. If Ancelotti stays in the job one more week, he will become Madrid's longest-serving coach since Vicente del Bosque, who left the club in 2003. Another six months will make him the longest-serving coach of the last 50 years, second only to Miguel Mu\u00f1oz.\n\n[ 'The Wall is back': how Thibaut Courtois won the race to Champions League final fitness ]\n\nVictory against Dortmund at Wembley on Saturday would be his seventh Champions League or European Cup title: two as a player with Milan, two as a coach with Milan, and three as a coach with Real Madrid. He would surpass Francisco Gento to become the most successful figure in the history of this competition.\n\nAncelotti's dwindling band of critics have argued that, for a guy who has usually been managing one of the richest teams in the division, he hasn't won enough league titles. He undoubtedly had great social skills, equally adept managing footballers and billionaire owners, but did he have the rigour and the football insight of the very best coaches? In an age when the game had come to be dominated by ideologists like Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp, it was an indictment of Ancelotti that his teams lacked a clear identity.\n\nLately, though, you can feel a growing disillusionment with systems, a weariness with obsessive coaches who think they should be trying to control every detail. Ancelotti's flexible, player-oriented approach has come to feel liberating. Cruising to Champions League finals while radiating sprezzatura, the Italian art of effortless elegance, he is making his rivals look like try-hards.\n\nIf idea-coaches are like the hedgehog who knows one big thing, Ancelotti is the fox who knows many things. In recent times he has talked more and more openly about how his philosophy is not to have a philosophy.\n\nIn his view, the teams that do have one are predictable. After Madrid beat Liverpool in the 2022 final: \"I think it helped that Liverpool were easier to decipher than the others, because they have a very clear identity and we could prepare the way that we did. We knew what strategy to take -- don't give them space behind the defence to run into . . .\"\n\nHe reiterated the value of flexibility before Madrid knocked out Bayern last month: \"I adapt. The fact that my teams don't have a clear identity is a merit not a fault. It's not a limit, it's a quality.\"\n\nAs Jude Bellingham explained after Madrid defeated Manchester City in the quarter-finals: \"Our biggest strength is he finds a way to let a lot of boys play with freedom. We're so off the cuff. As a man he fills you with calmness and confidence. I caught him yawning and he said to go out and excite him.\"\n\nOf course, it's easier to trust your players with freedom when those players are Toni Kroos and Luka Modric and Jude Bellingham and Vinicius Jr. Not many were raving about Ancelotti's non-philosophy philosophy when it was being expressed by Yerry Mina and Michael Keane at Everton.\n\nHis counterpart at Borussia Dortmund, Edin Terzic, took a more roundabout route to the top. A lower-league pro in Germany and then a scout at Dortmund, he got his big break into the coaching game when he wrote an opponent analysis of Giovanni Trapattoni's Ireland for Croatia coach Slaven Bilic ahead of Euro 2012. Croatia thrashed Ireland and Bilic was so impressed with Terzic that he appointed him to his coaching staff at Besiktas and then at West Ham.\n\nIn 2018 Terzic returned to Dortmund to work as assistant to Lucien Favre, and since then he has been head coach, technical director, and then head coach again. His short managerial career has already encompassed one of the most gut-wrenching disappointments in Dortmund's history, when they lost the 2023 title on the last day of the season by failing to beat Mainz at home.\n\nThat failure was worse than painful, it was ridiculous. Recovering from that humiliation to reach a Champions League final 12 months later shows that Terzic knows a thing or two about team spirit.\n\nPhilosophically, he's had his doubters. The 35-year old centre-back Mats Hummels gave an extraordinary interview during the week, claiming that the way Dortmund played in a couple of matches earlier this season made him ashamed to wear the shirt.\n\n\"I was furious because I was of the opinion that Borussia Dortmund shouldn't play like that - against any opponent in the world. So submissive, so inferior in footballing terms . . . barricading with 11 men in the box.\"\n\nDortmund had improved in the second half of the season, Hummels said, largely thanks to coaches Nuri Sahin and Sven Bender joining the staff in December.\n\nTerzic could point out to Hummels that barricading with 11 men in the box got Dortmund through the semi-final second leg against PSG - a night when Hummels himself scored the only goal from a set-piece.\n\nIf they are going to beat Madrid, Dortmund will have to man the barricades again.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florentino_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florentino P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_League_Greece", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super League Greece"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casemiro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Casemiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

And that's even before the tactical duel between two coaches at opposite ends of the experience spectrum, Carlo Ancelotti and Edin Terzic.\n\nIt promises to be a fascinating encounter between the Spanish aristocrats and the working class club from Germany's north west. Here we analyse the key areas of the field and pick out some potential match-winners for you to keep an eye on.\n\nAs always, the middle of the field will be key to the outcome, and it's here where Madrid look to hold a significant superiority.\n\nDortmund have no lack of experience in defensive duo Emre Can and Marcel Sabitzer but there is a chance they could be overrun by the zest and brio of Jude Bellingham, Fede Valverde and Rodrygo.\n\nMadrid boast Toni Kroos, playing his final club game before retirement, and Eduardo Camavinga behind their attacking players in what seems a nice blend of nous and athleticism. And if Dortmund do get hold of the central areas, Madrid can always count on the age-defying brilliance of Luka Modric, who is likely to start on the bench.\n\nPotentially an area that Dortmund can get at Madrid, particularly down the German side's left flank. With Karim Adeyemi ahead of Ian Maatsen, Dortmund possess two players with blistering pace and they will hope to exploit the gaps on Wembley's large pitch. A feature of Dortmund's two-legged triumph over Paris Saint-Germain was the way Maatsen overlapped Adeyemi to add another body to the attack.\n\nOn the other flank is Jaden Sancho, who is enjoying his rehabilitation back in Westphalia following his unhappy spell at Manchester United. The England international possesses the skill and craft to make it an uncomfortable night for Madrid full-back Ferland Mendy.\n\nMadrid play with a narrower style, particularly down their right, but watch out for Vinicius Jnr on the left. The Brazil international is a potential match-winner with his pace and quick feet.\n\nWith Dortmund strong out wide, there's a good chance the likes of Sancho and Adeyemi will be able to supply lone striker Niclas Fullkrug with plenty of ammunition. Fullkrug is a traditional number nine, not quick but his experience and know-how in the box mark him out as a man to keep an eye on.\n\nHe is good in the air and if he can peel on to Nacho he should have the aerial ability to cause danger.\n\nYes, Dortmund should create chances from out wide, and yes Fullkrug is a threat, but Madrid have more options going forward and the better players in midfield.\n\nThe bookmakers have Madrid favourites and 8/13 to win with bet365 looks appealing given their superiority.", "source": {"uri": "101greatgoals.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Standing in the way of their happy-ever-after ending are 14 times winners Real Madrid.\n\nThe Spanish champions go into Saturday's final as overwhelming favourites, but there's a sea of yellow ready to celebrate an almighty upset in Wembley. Telegraph Sport's football experts predict the outcome.\n\nSam Wallace: Both sides have had minority possession in big knockout games. Real had 36 per cent at the Etihad in the quarter-final second leg and Dortmund just 33 per cent in Paris in the semi-final second leg. Real are a brilliant fast counterattacking team who pounce on mistakes. Dortmund will seek to counterattack at Wembley as they did against PSG. That is the natural approach in a final of this nature that is obviously mismatched. The risk for Dortmund is that Real's attack simply overrun them.\n\nMike McGrath: Double up on Vinicius Junior. Yes, that might neglect focusing on Toni Kroos' passing or Jude Bellingham's late runs into the penalty area but Vini Jr is just frightening to defend against and I would take a chance on letting others run off opponents to keep him quiet.\n\nJames Ducker: Defending compactly in a mid-to-low block and seeking to use their pace on the counterattack. Real should see a lot more of the ball than they did in their semi-final against Bayern and Dortmund need to be poised to strike decisively when the opportunity allows. Equally, I could see them having real problems with the quality of Real's attack.\n\nJohn Percy: Dortmund are all about the collective, a team better than the sum of its parts. You have Jadon Sancho and Marcel Sabitzer both jettisoned by Manchester United, Ian Maatsen unwanted at Chelsea, plus Mats Hummels and Niklas Sule dumped by Bayern Munich. If they can be the team, they could - and it is a big could - secure a shock win.\n\nWallace: Two great sides and great players on both, but we all like an upset. A Dortmund win would be good for the Champions League and European football. Like Real, they are a club majority-owned by their fans but unlike Real, their debt is tiny. They do not have access to the kind of long-term sales of future revenue which have funded Real's stadium renovation. In the 1990s, when Dortmund won their only European Cup, nine different clubs from eight different countries - including Real - won the competition. In the past ten years, six clubs from only three nations have won it and none on the relatively modest budget Dortmund work to.\n\nMcGrath: Jadon Sancho enjoying his football and rising to the occasion at Wembley. He looked like he had a point to prove in the semi-finals and it would send a big message to Manchester United if he put in another big performance.\n\nDucker: A season that could not have started much worse for Jadon Sancho after his public and bitter falling out with Erik ten Hag could yet end with the England forward, on loan at Dortmund from Manchester United, with a Champions League winners' medal. It would be some story.\n\nPercy: Carlo Ancelotti's eyebrow in glorious high definition\n\nWallace: Judging by his semi-final performance, Vinicius Junior is the most in-form player in Europe. He should be the star.\n\nDucker: There will inevitably be a huge amount of attention on Jude Bellingham, up against his old club, but Vinicius Jr has proven time and again he is a player who brings his best on the biggest occasions and I expect no different here.\n\nMcGrath: Andriy Lunin could be an unlikely hero, providing he recovers from flu in time. The \u20ac9 million signing from Zorya Luhansk in Ukraine has been loaned out to Leganes, Valladolid and Oviedo in recent seasons but has seized his chance this season after Thibaut Courtois' serious knee injury. Showed against Manchester City in the quarters that he holds his nerve in a penalty shoot-out.\n\nPercy: The focus will inevitably be on Jude Bellingham and Sancho, but this could be a significant night for Mats Hummels. At the age of 35, the old warrior may well be preparing for his last ever showpiece final. Hummels has been so consistent, and indeed arguably underrated, over the years and will be absolutely crucial at Wembley.\n\nDucker: Hard to see beyond a 15th European Cup for Real. 3-1 to Carlo Ancelotti's side.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type":

The music mogul, who is the founder of Roc Nation, will be there to cheer on Real Madrid's star player Vinicius Jr, who is represented by Jay-Z's agency.\n\nReal Madrid is considered the favorite to win the Champions League in London, with Vinicius Jr being an early contender for the Ballon d'Or award. The Brazilian forward has had an impressive season, scoring 23 goals in 38 games across all competitions for Real Madrid. Victory in the Champions League final is crucial for Vinicius Jr's hopes of individual honors, as continental club success is often a prerequisite for winning such awards.\n\nIn addition to the Champions League final, Vinicius Jr will also have the opportunity to showcase his talents in the Copa America later this summer, where Brazil will be competing. Jay-Z's support for Vinicius Jr highlights the close relationship between the music industry and sports, with other Roc Nation stars like Kevin De Bruyne and Gabriel Martinelli also making their mark in football.\n\nReal Madrid, under the guidance of coach Carlo Ancelotti, is aiming for its 15th Champions League title, the most in the history of the competition. Ancelotti, a seasoned manager with two previous Champions League titles to his name, will be looking to secure another triumph for the Spanish giants. On the other hand, Borussia Dortmund, the 1997 Champions League winners, will be looking to upset the odds and claim their second title.\n\nWith Jay-Z's presence adding to the excitement of the Champions League final, all eyes will be on Wembley Stadium this weekend as two European giants battle it out for continental glory.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin\u00edcius_J\u00fanior", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jay-Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roc_Nation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roc Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 22}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9613014", "eventUri": "eng-9613014", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.7019607843137254, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

In short: Real are the clear favourites, but we actually feel very comfortable with this situation.\"\n\nBefore our two games against Paris \"no one was betting a penny on us and we won both, We can't come out of this final as losers anyway, but only as the big, big winners!\"\n\nThe strong Champions League run stands in contrast to a modest fifth-place finish, by their standard, in the Bundesliga, and Watzke told Bild that they would be investing in new players in a way like never before in summer to close the gap.\n\n\"We are not planning a transfer surplus, but rather a deficit. We can't invest a net sum of \u20ac100 million ($108 million), but we will invest significantly more in transfers than we will earn from transfers. And that's new for Borussia Dortmund!\" Watzke said.\n\nBut the CEO ruled out spending \u20ac100 million on one player like Bayern Munich did last year for Harry Kane because Dortmund's annual turnover does't allow it.\n\nLarge Champions League income will help Dortmund invest in their bid to play at the top in all competitions which Watzke named a big aim.\n\n\"Dortmund have ever managed to play at the highest level in both events, like Real and Bayern do. We're probably only really good at one competition at the moment.

Carlo Ancelotti's men are almost exclusive proprietors when it comes to the most coveted silverware in soccer and the Italian tactician himself could win fifth personal UCL title as a head coach and third with Los Blancos after his 2014 and 2022 triumphs.\n\nUp against unexpected finalists BVB, Real are the heavy favorites to succeed and to celebrate another continental crown before the expected announcement of the arrival of French superstar Kylian Mbappe on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain this summer. Jude Bellingham finds himself lining up against his former club and the England international will hope to be the difference in London ahead of UEFA Euro 2024 which could see him starring for the Three Lions as one of the pre-tournament favorites to win that along with Mbappe's France.\n\nToni Kroos is preparing for an emotional final game not only with Real but also at club soccer level with his involvement with Germany on home soil this summer set to end in retirement from the game after what has been a glittering career -- regardless of Saturday's outcome. Vini Jr. has also been here before and has already been a game winner in a Champions League final when the Spanish giants edged Liverpool in Paris which was not a classic encounter for Real's record 14th win.\n\nCattry: \"Real Madrid's latest Champions League triumph was perhaps the most dull of them all, considering they took just three shots and scored off their single attempt at goal. That said, Thibaut Courtois impressed at the Stade de France by making nine saves as Liverpool posted 23 shots, earning Man of the Match honors in the process. It was also a notable night for Vinicius Junior, who scored the game's lone goal and won his first Champions League title in the process.\"Sponsored by Paramount+\ud83d\udd17 Midfield Link Play\ud83d\udc40 BVB hope to upset the odds\n\nReal's opponents on Saturday are not in London to make up the numbers, though, as Borussia Dortmund have dumped out some big names so far this edition including Mbappe's PSG in the semifinals. Although BVB finished fifth in the Bundesliga compared with Real's latest La Liga triumph, many people do forget that the Germans have already won this competition once in 1997 and have a proud history to honor in the Champions League which Edin Terzic and his players will do their very best to uphold.\n\nOne of Dortmund's star performers on this incredible run to the final has been goalkeeper Gregor Kobel and the Switzerland international will be aiming to build on his sensational showing against PSG over two legs which somehow produced two clean sheets. The 26-year-old leads all goalkeepers with 42 saves and six clean sheets as well as an impressive 7.09 prevented goals in UCL play -- something which Real's 2022 hero Thibaut Courtois would be proud of.\n\nCBS Sports Golazo Network caught up with Kobel ahead of this weekend's mega clash and was optimistic about BVB's chances of pulling off another upset.\n\nKobel: \"It looks like we feel comfortable in that situation [as underdogs] but I think it doesn't really matter for us as a team if we're considered the underdog or not. We built up a lot of confidence throughout this Champions League campaign. We beat a lot of good teams and we showed that we can beat every opponent that is in front of us and with this confidence we approach the game Saturday as well.\"\n\nDortmund beating Real here would certainly rank as one of the all-time shock final results but it will require more than just Kobel excelling. Also key has been veteran defender Mats Hummels in some of the best form of his career despite being overlooked for UEFA Euro 2024 by hosts Germany while unconventional attacker Niclas Fullkrug has scored some important goals this campaign including in the first leg against PSG before Hummels finished the job at Parc des Princes and he will need to make a nuisance for Real's Antonio Rudiger who will be an international teammate this summer on home soil along with the retiring Kroos.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Top UCL Stories\n\n\ud83d\udcab Ranking Real's top 10 Galacticos: David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, Jude Bellingham, Luis Figo and Sergio Ramos all feature.\n\n\ud83e\udd29 UCL superlatives: Jude Bellingham, Kylian Mbappe and Manchester United experience mixed fortunes in the 2023-24 edition.\n\n\ud83d\ude31 Ranking the most unlikely UCL winners: Could Chelsea and Liverpool be joined by Dortmund this weekend?\n\n\ud83e\udd14 Could USMNT star Gio Reyna get a UCL medal if Dortmund beat Real?

BVB have found ways to score against opponents but have relied on their back line most in order to advance. Atletico Madrid in the quarterfinals showed that Dortmund can still catch fire, but Real are on an entirely different level. Jude Bellingham scoring against his former club, Real running out winners but Edin Terzic's side getting a consolation goal against Carlo Ancelotti's men sounds about right.\ud83d\udcfa What's on CBS Sports Golazo Network\n\n\u2600\ufe0f Morning Footy (Weekdays 8-10 a.m.): Hosts Susannah Collins, Charlie Davies, Nico Cantor and Alexis Guerreros help fans get their day started on the network's flagship morning show with highlights, interviews and the biggest soccer storylines.

Kick-off time, channel and how to watch Champions League final", "body": "The official end of the season for Europe's elite comes on Saturday with the Uefa Champions League final, contested this year between Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid.\n\nWhile the German giants certainly have pedigree and one European Cup to their name from 1997, it's Los Blancos who are the behemoths, true royalty of the game as far as wins in this tournament go - they are the record holders with 14 titles, 17 finals overall and five wins since Dortmund's last final, which was in 2013.\n\nCoincidentally, that one was at Wembley too - they were beaten by Bayern Munich on that occasion, with Real Madrid in turn knocking out Bayern in this semis this year.\n\nOn these shores, all eyes will be on Jadson Sancho and Jude Bellingham, in the line-up for each side respectively, but the likes of Vinicius Jr, Marco Reus, the retiring Toni Kroos and plenty more players besides mean there will be stars all over the pitch.\n\nHere's everything you need to know ahead of the game.\n\nWhen is the Champions League final?\n\nBorussia Dortmund will face Real Madrid at Wembley on Saturday 1 June 2024, with kick-off set for 8pm BST.\n\nWhere can I watch it?\n\nAs with all Uefa matches this season, the game will be broadcast live on TNT Sports and can be streamed on the discovery+ app.\n\nYou can purchase a TNT Sports subscription via discovery+ here, for only \u00a330.99 per month.\n\nIf you're travelling abroad and want to watch major sporting events, you might need a VPN to unblock your streaming app. Our VPN round-up is here to help and includes deals on VPNs in the market.

This revenue helps to fund journalism across The Independent.\n\nWhat is the team news?\n\nFor Dortmund, there are doubts over striker Sebastien Haller and full-back Mateu Morey, though neither would start anyway. Ramy Benebaini is the only guaranteed absentee. The team is likely to be similar to that from the semis, with Niclas Fullkrug leading the attack and Julian Brandt behind him.\n\nAurelien Tchouameni and David Alaba are both out for Real Madrid, meaning Nacho should start at centre-back as captain. The only real other issue for Carlo Ancelotti is to decide between his goalkeepers; Andriy Lunin has been playing most of the season but was ill in midweek, while regular No1 Thibaut Courtois has missed the campaign with an ACL injury but returned last week - so could get given the nod to start.\n\nPredicted line-ups\n\nBVB - Kobel, Ryerson, Hummels, Schlotterbeck, Maatsen, Can, Sabitzer, Sancho, Brandt, Adeyemi, Fullkrug\n\nRMA - Courtois, Carvajal, Rudiger, Nacho, Mendy, Camavinga, Valverde, Kroos, Bellingham, Rodrygo, Vinicius Jr\n\nBVB need to score first if they hope to cause an upset - but the firepower in the Spanish side's ranks is simply too much to hold at bay. Real Madrid to be celebrating once more.

Liverpool 3-1 Borussia Monchengladbach (1977)\n\nFour years on from the same two clubs meeting in the 1973 UEFA Cup final, Liverpool took on Borussia Monchengladbach in the European Cup equivalent, having also won the UEFA Cup in 1976.\n\nBob Paisley's side were only the third English club to make the European Cup final and just the second to win it, but their victory sparked an era of dominance which saw an English club lift the trophy for each of the next six years - half of which came courtesy of Liverpool themselves.\n\nOf all of those finals during England's spell as kings of Europe, the 1977 edition is the only one which will go down as a classic for the neutrals - the following nine finals produced a grand total of nine goals between them.\n\nTerry McDermott opened the scoring for the Merseyside outfit after a slick team move shortly before the half-hour mark, only for Allan Simonsen, who would go on to win that year's Ballon d'Or, to equalise with a stunning strike early in the second half.\n\nA couple of Liverpool icons sealed the club's maiden European Cup triumph, though, with Tommy Smith marking his 600th appearance for the club in style with a thumping header shortly after the hour mark and Phil Neal wrapping things up from the spot eight minutes from time.\n\n9. Manchester United 2-1 Bayern Munich (1999)\n\nWe can almost hear the complaints and uproar from Manchester United fans - how can one of the most dramatic and iconic moments in Champions League history only be ninth on this list?\n\nWell, in truth, this was on course to be one of the more forgettable finals until the clock ticked into stoppage time. As it was, it ended up being one of the most unforgettable, try as Bayern Munich might to banish it from their memories.\n\nA United side shorn of suspended influential duo Roy Keane and Paul Scholes fell behind to a sixth-minute Mario Basler strike and offered little sign of getting back into the game for the next 84 minutes, whereas Bayern hit the woodwork twice.\n\nWith Ryan Giggs and David Beckham both playing out of position and Jesper Blomqvist on the left, manager Alex Ferguson turned to his bench to make two fateful substitutions, Teddy Sheringham coming on for Blomqvist in the 67th minute and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer replacing Andy Cole in the 81st.\n\nJust as the fourth official signalled three minutes of stoppage time, United won a corner which looked like last-chance saloon, prompting goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel to come up for it in what was his last ever game for the club.\n\nThe corner was not cleared properly and when Giggs fired it back in, Sheringham swept it into the bottom corner to seemingly rescue extra time for United at the death.\n\nThe drama had only just begun, though, and just 30 seconds after the restart United won another corner which Beckham took, Sheringham flicked on and Solskjaer poked into the roof of the net - two goals in less than two minutes which left Bayern desolate, Samuel Kuffour beating the ground with despair and captain Lothar Matthaus in disbelief.\n\nUEFA officials were forced to hastily untie the Bayern-coloured ribbons attached to the trophy and replace them with Manchester United ones as Ferguson's side celebrated their second European Cup triumph and an unprecedented Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League treble.\n\n8. Real Madrid 4-1 Atletico Madrid (2014)\n\nFor the first time in history, two teams from the same city made it to the final of the Champions League as Madrid reigned supreme in Europe.\n\nGeographically less than 10km separated the two teams, but in terms of Champions League pedigree the distance between them was huge; Real had reached a record 13th final and were searching for the fabled 'La Decima', whereas Atletico had only made the final once before, and that was 40 years prior - the longest gap between finals for any club.\n\nEven so, Atletico went into the match having won La Liga for the first time since 1996 and looked as though they would add the Champions League crown to that when Diego Godin's looping header gave them the lead in the 36th minute.\n\nDiego Simeone's side protected that advantage in typically fierce fashion until the third minute of stoppage time, when Real stalwart Sergio Ramos steered a fine header into the bottom corner to force extra time.\n\nHaving been so close to winning, Atletico suddenly looked like a beaten side and goals from Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo in extra time made the final scoreline look far more one-sided than the reality of the game.\n\n7. Manchester United 4-1 Benfica (1968)\n\nManchester United's 1999 success may have been more dramatic, but their performance in winning their first European Cup 31 years earlier was far more impressive and infinitely more emotional.\n\nTen years on from United seeing their previous European Cup contenders devastated by the deadly Munich Air Disaster, the Red Devils became the first English side to reach the final of the competition, which was to be played at Wembley.\n\nMunich survivors Bobby Charlton and Bill Foulkes started the game, led by fellow survivor Matt Busby, and it was Charlton who opened the scoring in the 53rd minute.\n\nA Benfica side including Eusebio levelled things up 11 minutes from the end to force extra time, but much like Real's 2014 win over Atletico, the additional period proved to be a one-sided affair.\n\nThe jewel of United's post-Munich phoenix restored their lead when George Best produced a trademark slalom past the keeper and rolled the ball into the empty net, and just two minutes later Brian Kidd put his side in control with a header on his 19th birthday.\n\nKidd then turned provider as Charlton added the icing on the cake with a third goal in the opening nine minutes of extra time, looping his finish into the far top corner to ensure that United became the first English club to get their hands on the biggest prize in European club football.\n\n6. AC Milan 4-0 Barcelona (1994)\n\nTwo heavyweights of European football faced off in Athens in the 1994 final, with four-time champions AC Milan and 1992 winners Barcelona having lifted the trophy three times between them in the previous five years.\n\nEven so, it was Barcelona that went into the contest as heavy favourites, with the Spanish press and Barca boss Johan Cruyff in supremely confident mood.\n\nOn the face of it, that confidence did not seem entirely misplaced; Milan no longer had the Dutch triumvirate which inspired them to back-to-back titles in 1989 and 1990, with Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard having left and Marco van Basten injured.\n\nWorld-record signing Gianluigi Lentini was also injured, while Alessandro Costacurta and captain Franco Baresi were suspended. On top of that, head coach Fabio Capello was also forced to leave out Jean-Pierre Papin, Brian Laudrup and Florin Raducioiu due to UEFA rules on non-nationals.\n\nIn contrast, Cruyff's Barcelona were in their 'Dream Team' pomp, having just won a fourth successive La Liga title with the likes of Romario, Pep Guardiola, Ronald Koeman and Hristo Stoichkov in their ranks.\n\nWhat followed was one of the greatest performances the competition has ever seen as a Daniele Massaro brace gave Milan a 2-0 lead by half time, which was soon extended by Dejan Savicevic after the restart.\n\nMarcel Desailly then capped off the scoring as he secured his status as the first player to lift the trophy in back-to-back years with different clubs, ensuring that Milan became only the second team after Real Madrid to win the title five times.\n\nBarcelona, by contrast, would not win another major trophy under Cruyff - at that stage their most successful ever manager - with Milan well and truly dismantling the 'Dream Team' era.\n\n5. Barcelona 3-1 Manchester United (2011)\n\nSpeaking of dream teams, Guardiola's Barcelona are widely regarded as one of the greatest club sides of all time and the 2011 Champions League final showcased them at the very peak of their powers.\n\nIt was the second time in three years that these two sides had faced off in the Champions League final, with Barcelona winning the 2009 edition 2-0.\n\nBoth clubs were three-time winners of the competition and had plenty of recent experience in the showpiece event too, with United appearing in the final for a third time in four years and Barca for a third time in six years.\n\nFerguson quickly acknowledged after the game that his side did not have much experience playing against a team as good as that Barcelona, though, declaring Guardiola's men as the best he had ever faced in his long career and admitting that they had given United a \"hiding\".\n\nPredictably, Lionel Messi was the main tormentor and his stunning strike nine minutes into the second half capped off a majestic individual performance while also giving Barcelona the lead back after Wayne Rooney had cancelled out Pedro's opener.\n\nDavid Villa secured the win with a fine curling effort with 21 minutes to go, and in the end United were grateful that the scoreline did not get any worse with Barca ending the game with 12 shots on target to United's one.\n\n4. Real Madrid 4-3 Stade de Reims (1956)\n\nThe first ever European Cup final set the bar high for subsequent editions as Real Madrid began their still-unparalleled run of five successive titles in the competition.\n\nThe entire landscape of European football may well be different today had Reims won the 1956 final, though, and they were not too far away from doing so - particularly after taking a 2-0 lead within 10 minutes at the Parc des Princes in Paris.\n\nMadrid icon Alfredo Di Stefano halved that deficit in the 14th minute, though, and by the half-hour mark the Spanish outfit were all square again courtesy of Hector Rial's strike.\n\nMichel Hidalgo restored Reims' advantage shortly after the hour mark to again put them on course to become the inaugural champions, but this time their lead lasted just five minutes before Marquitos restored parity.\n\nRial then doubled his personal tally with 11 minutes remaining to wrap up a seven-goal thriller and seal the trophy for Madrid, who then went and bought Reims forward Raymond Kopa later that year in a transfer which helped to strengthen a grip on the trophy which would not be released until 1961.\n\n3. Benfica 5-3 Real Madrid (1962)\n\nHaving won each of the first five editions of the trophy, Real Madrid were dethroned by Benfica in 1961 before returning to the showpiece event the following year for a contest which needed no extra hype - the only two previous champions of Europe going head to head.\n\nIf the torch had not already been passed in 1961, Benfica's topsy-turvy 5-3 triumph 12 months later was symbolic - not only for Real Madrid being usurped as European kings but also for Benfica talisman Eusebio succeeding Di Stefano as European football's top man.\n\nOther legendary figures also littered the field - not least Real Madrid duo Francisco Gento and Ferenc Puskas, the latter of whom netted a second European Cup final hat-trick in the space of three years.\n\nThe Hungarian's heroics were not enough, though, despite initially giving Madrid a two-goal lead inside 23 minutes.\n\nBenfica skipper Jose Aguas quickly halved the deficit before Domiciano Cavem levelled things up shortly after the half-hour mark, but Puskas completed his hat-trick to send Madrid into half time with a 3-2 lead following a frenetic opening 45 minutes.\n\nThe second half belonged to Benfica, though; Mario Coluna made it 3-3 five minutes after the interval and then Eusebio took centre stage with a penalty and free kick within five minutes of each other to seal back-to-back European Cup titles for the Portuguese outfit.\n\nThe match proved to be the zenith of Benfica's achievements; manager Bela Guttmann reportedly asked the board for a pay rise in the wake of the triumph and, when turned down, left the club with the foreboding and cursed words: \"Not in a hundred years from now will Benfica ever be European champions.\"\n\nBenfica have reached eight European finals since then, but lost every single one.\n\n2. Real Madrid 7-3 Eintracht Frankfurt (1960)\n\nThe greatest teams of all time usually have one match in particular which they can look back on as the absolute peak of their powers: Pele's Brazil had the 1970 World Cup final, Guardiola's Barcelona had the aforementioned 2011 Champions League final, and Di Stefano's Real Madrid had this match.\n\nStill regarded by many who remember it as the greatest team performance ever, Real Madrid sealed their fifth consecutive European Cup in glorious style as they played out the highest-scoring final in the competition's history with Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nThe match has taken on almost mythical status as a record 127,000 people piled into Glasgow's Hampden Park to watch a feast of football, although the contest was initially in doubt after the West German FA had banned any of their clubs from facing a team containing Puskas after the Hungarian had accused the national side of being on drugs for the 1954 World Cup final.\n\nA written apology from 'the Galloping Major' paved the way for the classic to be played out, although Puskas exacted his own form of revenge by becoming the first - and so far only - player to score four times in a European Cup final.\n\nIndeed, only three players have ever scored hat-tricks on that stage, and another one of those came in the same game as Di Stefano helped himself to three goals too - Madrid's world-class duo tearing Frankfurt apart.\n\nIt was actually Frankfurt that took the lead, although their opening goal only served to anger Miguel Munoz's side, who were 3-1 up by half time and had extended that advantage to 7-1 with 17 minutes still to play.\n\nA quickfire double for Frankfurt - part of a madcap four-minute spell which saw four goals, two at either end of the field - saw the scoreline become marginally more respectable, but they were left to lick their wounds after being mauled by one of football's greatest ever teams.\n\n1. AC Milan 3-3 Liverpool - Liverpool win on penalties (2005)\n\nLiverpool looked as though they might be on course for a similar drubbing at the halfway stage of the 2005 final, when their dream run under Rafael Benitez threatened to turn into a nightmare.\n\nWhat followed will forever be steeped in history as the 'Miracle of Istanbul', but Liverpool had already upset all the odds to make it to Turkey; a memorable comeback against Olympiacos saw them scrape their way into the knockout stages, where they overcame heavy favourites Juventus and Chelsea to reach their first final since 1985 despite only finishing fifth in the Premier League that season.\n\nMilan, by contrast, had lifted the trophy only two years previously, were appearing in their 10th final and had won the competition six times in total - second to only Real Madrid.\n\nThe team selections showcased the gulf in class between the two teams. Milan boasted a starting lineup teeming with legendary figures from back to front: Dida; Cafu, Jaap Stam, Alessandro Nesta, Paolo Maldini; Gennaro Gattuso, Andrea Pirlo, Clarence Seedorf; Kaka; Andriy Shevchenko, Hernan Crespo. Liverpool, meanwhile, had the likes of Djimi Traore and Milan Baros in their starting XI.\n\nSure enough, it looked like being an embarrassing evening on the grandest stage when Milan took the lead through talismanic captain Maldini after only 47 seconds, and two Crespo strikes towards the end of the first half - the second a sumptuous chip after Kaka's scything through-ball - appeared to end the match as a contest.\n\nLegend has it that a strain of Liverpool fans singing 'You'll Never Walk Alone' filtered into the dressing room at half time and inspired the second-half comeback, but just as important was Benitez's decision to bring on Dietmar Hamann, who shackled the influential Kaka and allowed Liverpool's own main man Steven Gerrard more freedom.\n\nGerrard was the man who got the first goal back with a looping header in the 54th minute, and just two minutes after that a low strike from Vladimir Smicer nestled into the bottom corner to well and truly ignite Liverpool's belief.\n\nA surging run from Gerrard on the hour mark was then halted by Gattuso in the box to earn the Reds a penalty, which Xabi Alonso initially saw saved before rifling the rebound into the roof of the net to complete one of the most remarkable comebacks in football history.\n\nLiverpool's job was by no means done, though, and it needed some heroic defending from a cramp-ridden Jamie Carragher in particular to keep wave after wave of Milan attack at bay until extra time and beyond.\n\nMilan's big chance to spare their blushes came with only three minutes of extra time remaining when Shevchenko - at the time arguably the world's deadliest striker - saw a header saved by Jerzy Dudek before meeting the follow-up from less than six yards out, but somehow Dudek managed to deflect that effort over the bar in a scarcely-believable double save which has since been voted as the greatest ever Champions League moment.\n\nDudek was back in the spotlight for the penalty shootout as he channeled his inner Bruce Grobbelaar with spaghetti legs on the line before saving Shevchenko's decisive spot kick to send the Liverpool players and fans into delirium.\n\nIt was Liverpool's fifth success in the competition, meaning that they got to keep the trophy, and it is a match which will never be forgotten in the annals of Champions League history.\n\nNo Data Analysis info", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barney_corkhill@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Barney Corkhill", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Sheringham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Teddy Sheringham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium_(1923)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium (1923)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Its record of 14 titles is twice as many as its closest rival AC Milan.\n\n\"The club has created its history in this competition,\" coach Carlo Ancelotti says.\n\nMadrid's record in the champions league era is even more impressive: Eight wins since the tournament was rebranded in 1992; three in a row from 2016-18 and five in the last 10 years. In the same period, Madrid has won La Liga only four times.\n\nMadrid has also been a semifinalist in 12 of the last 14 seasons.\n\n\"It's something special for the club, for all the madridistas (fans) and for us, who are also madridistas. It's a competition where we're more focused,\" says Ancelotti, who can win a record-extending fifth champions league as a coach.\n\nTeams are not supposed to enjoy such superiority in a competition filled with the biggest and richest clubs in the world. Not even great teams of recent times such as Pep Guardiola's Barcelona or Alex Ferguson's Manchester United - both repeat finalists - could come close to the kind of hold Madrid has had on the champions league. And even in the face of competition from state-backed teams like Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain, the all-time king of Europe refuses to be dethroned.\n\nWhich is why this final is so intriguing.\n\nIt is a clash between the old money and glamor of Madrid and the savvy approach of a Dortmund team that has found an alternative way to compete with Europe's superpowers.\n\nThere is no better illustration of the contrast between the rivals than Jude Bellingham, who swapped Dortmund for Madrid last year in a deal worth up to $139 million.\n\nBellingham could well be the match-winner, having helped fire Madrid to the Spanish title in a spectacular debut season.\n\nYet, in his absence, Dortmund stands on the brink of adding to its lone champions league triumph in 1997 in its third final ever.\n\nSelling the likes of Bellingham is part of the German club's strategy of buying emerging talents and then cashing in.\n\nA year earlier, it was Erling Haaland who was sold to Man City. The roll call of stars who have passed through the club includes Jadon Sancho, Christian Pulisic, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Ousmane Dembele and Robert Lewandowski.\n\nNot that Dortmund represents a fairytale in the strictest of terms. Forbes ranks it as the 12th most valuable soccer team in the world in its most recent rich list. But it represents a different way of competing at the top.\n\nDortmund's willingness to give opportunities to young players before selling them to bigger clubs has made it an appealing option for the likes of Haaland and Bellingham, who were both targets of Manchester United before choosing to develop their careers in Germany.\n\n\"I was at Dortmund for three years, I took a path that's a bit unfamiliar for players in England,\" Bellingham has said. \"But I am grateful for the opportunities I've been given in European football. Maybe they wouldn't be as accessible in England.\"\n\nBellingham's move has paid off for all parties. He is playing beside Vinicius Junior and Eduardo Camavinga, and they are expected to be joined next season by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9.\n\nSuch talent has been the bedrock of Madrid's champions league dominance. Many of the game's greats have worn the white shirt from Zinedine Zidane to Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nDortmund do it a different way. Besides the youngsters, it has squeezed last flings out of aging stars Mats Hummels, Niclas F\u00fcllkrug and Marcel Sabitzer to plot a path to a first final in 11 years.

Stickers on Tube escalators. Scarves tied to lampposts. A BVB-emblazoned padlock on the banks of the Thames at Westminster. Wide-eyed fans milling through the pubs of Soho, wincing at the beer prices. Trying to soak up every last available morsel of enjoyment from the experience before - you know - the actual football starts.\n\nIt's a largely moot point whether Borussia Dortmund are the biggest final outsiders in the modern history of the Champions League. Perhaps Internazionale last season, perhaps Liverpool in 2005. Either way, given the opposition, their fifth-placed finish in the Bundesliga and the charmed passage they have enjoyed to the final, few give them a hope at Wembley on Saturday night.\n\nRelated: Jadon Sancho's redemption arc leads to shot at glory under Wembley arch\n\n\"I believe we have a chance,\" their chief executive, Hans-Joachim Watzke, said at Dortmund airport on Friday morning, which as rousing battle cries go, is towards the milder end of the scale.\n\nAnd if Real Madrid are here for business and business alone, for Dortmund the equation has always been slightly more complex. Since J\u00fcrgen Klopp led them to a league and cup double in 2012, they have finished second in the Bundesliga seven times, lost nine out of 14 cup finals. If Dortmund seem to enjoy the journey more than most other clubs, partly this is because the destination has so rarely been kind to them.\n\nTheir last Champions League final, also at Wembley in 2013, had a similar ambience. Even at the time their narrow 2-1 defeat to Bayern Munich felt like a high water mark, the culmination of the project Klopp had so spectacularly set in motion, and so it proved.\n\nOne by one the jewels of that brilliant team were picked off. Mario G\u00f6tze, Mats Hummels and Robert Lewandowski by Bayern; Ilkay G\u00fcndogan by Manchester City; the rest by time and decline. Klopp himself hung on, until 2015, exhausted and beaten. Bayern were in the early stages of a run that would eventually end on 11 straight Bundesliga titles. And so, in the foothills of their rivals, Dortmund recognised the need to build something new.\n\nOver the second half of the decade, Dortmund assembled a model that would become the envy of the continent. Teenage talents such as Jadon Sancho, Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland and Christian Pulisic were identified, signed and moved on at an eye-watering profit. Dortmund were able to sell themselves to young players as a kind of finishing school: immediate minutes at an elite Champions League standard. It looked great on the balance sheet. Fans got to enjoy thrilling, high-energy football. Everybody won, as long as they were prepared to narrow their definition of \"winning\".\n\nIn the longer term, the Dortmund model had two major flaws. The first was that it essentially reimagined the club as a kind of human clearing house, reimagined the footballer himself as cold asset. Perhaps this was a necessary coping strategy in the shadow of a financially dominant rival. But there is a fine line between adjusting to reality and acquiescing to it, and somewhere amid those seven second places came an internal acceptance that Dortmund had become a club preoccupied with cementing its position rather than challenging it.\n\nThe second issue is that much bigger clubs are now fishing in Dortmund's water. Chelsea's latest owners have tried to sign pretty much every promising young player in Europe. Manchester United's new regime are rumoured to be pivoting hard towards a youth-oriented strategy, with a ban on signing players over 25. \"Clubs that are financially stronger than us are now discovering our path for themselves,\" Dortmund's sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, said in an interview last year.\n\nFew elite clubs, however, have deployed this strategy more successfully than Dortmund's opponents at Wembley. Around 2017, the summer when Paris Saint-Germain transformed the transfer market forever by signing Neymar and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Real Madrid began a concerted strategy of focusing on the next generation. In the subsequent seasons Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Rodrygo, Brahim D\u00edaz, Andriy Lunin, \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o and Eduardo Camavinga - the youthful core of their current squad - all arrived aged 21 or under, all for less than \u00a350m.\n\nNaturally, Dortmund have little chance of competing with the above clubs in terms of wages, fees or blandishments. They can still offer first-team opportunities, and thanks to an elaborate scouring network can still cast their net wider than most - the 16-year-old Ecuadorian midfielder Justin Lerma their latest acquisition. There is still plenty of promise in players such as Julien Duranville (18), Youssoufa Moukoko and Jamie Bynoe-Gittens (both 19). But the likelihood is that when the next Bellingham or Haaland emerges, Dortmund will not have the means to attract them. And so they have been forced to adapt again.\n\nThe squad that has taken them to Wembley is relatively old by Dortmund standards. Hummels and Marco Reus are 35. The centre-forward Niclas F\u00fcllkrug, signed last summer, is 31, Marcel Sabitzer and Emre Can 30, S\u00e9bastien Haller 29. There is currently a concerted effort to sign Stuttgart's prolific striker Serhou Guirassy, who is 28. Meanwhile their two biggest young stars - Sancho and Ian Maatsen - are on loan from the Premier League. They still play high-energy, vertical football. They still value pace on the counterattack. But this is not, by any stretch, the Dortmund of the popular imagination.\n\nThe new managing director, Lars Ricken, has an academy background, and yet in a recent interview outlined Dortmund's transfer priorities in a more competitive market. \"Young, hungry players who have market value potential\" alongside \"a framework of experienced players that young players can lean on\", he explained. \"That has to be our way.\"\n\nPerhaps this is the curse of being a so-called \"model club\": you have to keep innovating, keep shifting, keep striving for new edges. The high-energy pressing style pioneered by Klopp becomes standard practice, and so you find a new way. Your youth-oriented model gets shamelessly copied by bigger rivals, and so you need to move on. Perhaps the next undervalued growth area is the 25-30 range, players such as Sabitzer and Can who have already been through bigger clubs but still have plenty of miles left in the tank.\n\nAnd there is naturally a certain irony in the fact that Dortmund have arrived on the brink of their greatest achievement largely by dismantling the model they spent a decade painstakingly assembling. This is a harder and more malleable team than their predecessors, better able to ride out the tough moments, more comfortable spending long periods of time without the ball, more explicitly oriented towards the result rather than the process.\n\nOf course, none of this may be enough on Saturday night. Madrid's annual revenue is about twice that of Dortmund's, their experience and pedigree unmatchable, their sense of self-destiny unimpeachable. And yet out of this seemingly hopeless scenario springs a golden opportunity. Win this final, and never again will Dortmund be known as the perennial bridesmaids, the eternal seconds, the arch-bottlers. Under the Wembley arch, Dortmund have a chance not just to make history, but to write themselves a new future.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports

Stickers on Tube escalators. Scarves tied to lampposts. A BVB-emblazoned padlock on the banks of the Thames at Westminster. Wide-eyed fans milling through the pubs of Soho, wincing at the beer prices. Trying to soak up every last available morsel of enjoyment from the experience before - you know - the actual football starts.\n\nIt's a largely moot point whether Borussia Dortmund are the biggest final outsiders in the modern history of the Champions League. Perhaps Internazionale last season, perhaps Liverpool in 2005. Either way, given the opposition, their fifth-placed finish in the Bundesliga and the charmed passage they have enjoyed to the final, few give them a hope at Wembley on Saturday night.\n\n\"I believe we have a chance,\" their chief executive, Hans-Joachim Watzke, said at Dortmund airport on Friday morning, which as rousing battle cries go, is towards the milder end of the scale.\n\nAnd if Real Madrid are here for business and business alone, for Dortmund the equation has always been slightly more complex. Since J\u00fcrgen Klopp led them to a league and cup double in 2012, they have finished second in the Bundesliga seven times, lost nine out of 14 cup finals. If Dortmund seem to enjoy the journey more than most other clubs, partly this is because the destination has so rarely been kind to them.\n\nTheir last Champions League final, also at Wembley in 2013, had a similar ambience. Even at the time their narrow 2-1 defeat to Bayern Munich felt like a high water mark, the culmination of the project Klopp had so spectacularly set in motion, and so it proved.\n\nOne by one the jewels of that brilliant team were picked off. Mario G\u00f6tze, Mats Hummels and Robert Lewandowski by Bayern; Ilkay G\u00fcndogan by Manchester City; the rest by time and decline. Klopp himself hung on, until 2015, exhausted and beaten. Bayern were in the early stages of a run that would eventually end on 11 straight Bundesliga titles. And so, in the foothills of their rivals, Dortmund recognised the need to build something new.\n\nOver the second half of the decade, Dortmund assembled a model that would become the envy of the continent. Teenage talents such as Jadon Sancho, Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland and Christian Pulisic were identified, signed and moved on at an eye-watering profit. Dortmund were able to sell themselves to young players as a kind of finishing school: immediate minutes at an elite Champions League standard. It looked great on the balance sheet. Fans got to enjoy thrilling, high-energy football. Everybody won, as long as they were prepared to narrow their definition of \"winning\".\n\nIn the longer term, the Dortmund model had two major flaws. The first was that it essentially reimagined the club as a kind of human clearing house, reimagined the footballer himself as cold asset. Perhaps this was a necessary coping strategy in the shadow of a financially dominant rival. But there is a fine line between adjusting to reality and acquiescing to it, and somewhere amid those seven second places came an internal acceptance that Dortmund had become a club preoccupied with cementing its position rather than challenging it.\n\nThe second issue is that much bigger clubs are now fishing in Dortmund's water. Chelsea's latest owners have tried to sign pretty much every promising young player in Europe. Manchester United's new regime are rumoured to be pivoting hard towards a youth-oriented strategy, with a ban on signing players over 25. \"Clubs that are financially stronger than us are now discovering our path for themselves,\" Dortmund's sporting director, Sebastian Kehl, said in an interview last year.\n\nFew elite clubs, however, have deployed this strategy more successfully than Dortmund's opponents at Wembley. Around 2017, the summer when Paris Saint-Germain transformed the transfer market forever by signing Neymar and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Real Madrid began a concerted strategy of focusing on the next generation. In the subsequent seasons Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, Rodrygo, Brahim D\u00edaz, Andriy Lunin, \u00c9der Milit\u00e3o and Eduardo Camavinga - the youthful core of their current squad - all arrived aged 21 or under, all for less than \u00a350m.\n\nNaturally, Dortmund have little chance of competing with the above clubs in terms of wages, fees or blandishments. They can still offer first-team opportunities, and thanks to an elaborate scouring network can still cast their net wider than most - the 16-year-old Ecuadorian midfielder Justin Lerma their latest acquisition. There is still plenty of promise in players such as Julien Duranville (18), Youssoufa Moukoko and Jamie Bynoe-Gittens (both 19). But the likelihood is that when the next Bellingham or Haaland emerges, Dortmund will not have the means to attract them. And so they have been forced to adapt again.\n\nThe squad that has taken them to Wembley is relatively old by Dortmund standards. Hummels and Marco Reus are 35. The centre-forward Niclas F\u00fcllkrug, signed last summer, is 31, Marcel Sabitzer and Emre Can 30, S\u00e9bastien Haller 29. There is currently a concerted effort to sign Stuttgart's prolific striker Serhou Guirassy, who is 28. Meanwhile their two biggest young stars - Sancho and Ian Maatsen - are on loan from the Premier League. They still play high-energy, vertical football. They still value pace on the counterattack. But this is not, by any stretch, the Dortmund of the popular imagination.\n\nThe new managing director, Lars Ricken, has an academy background, and yet in a recent interview outlined Dortmund's transfer priorities in a more competitive market. \"Young, hungry players who have market value potential\" alongside \"a framework of experienced players that young players can lean on\", he explained. \"That has to be our way.\"\n\nPerhaps this is the curse of being a so-called \"model club\": you have to keep innovating, keep shifting, keep striving for new edges. The high-energy pressing style pioneered by Klopp becomes standard practice, and so you find a new way. Your youth-oriented model gets shamelessly copied by bigger rivals, and so you need to move on. Perhaps the next undervalued growth area is the 25-30 range, players such as Sabitzer and Can who have already been through bigger clubs but still have plenty of miles left in the tank.\n\nAnd there is naturally a certain irony in the fact that Dortmund have arrived on the brink of their greatest achievement largely by dismantling the model they spent a decade painstakingly assembling. This is a harder and more malleable team than their predecessors, better able to ride out the tough moments, more comfortable spending long periods of time without the ball, more explicitly oriented towards the result rather than the process.\n\nOf course, none of this may be enough on Saturday night. Madrid's annual revenue is about twice that of Dortmund's, their experience and pedigree unmatchable, their sense of self-destiny unimpeachable. And yet out of this seemingly hopeless scenario springs a golden opportunity. Win this final, and never again will Dortmund be known as the perennial bridesmaids, the eternal seconds, the arch-bottlers. Under the Wembley arch, Dortmund have a chance not just to make history, but to write themselves a new future.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

Robin Singh explains", "body": "Real Madrid will face off against Borussia Dortmund in the UCL final on June 2\n\nIndia and Sporting Club Bengaluru footballer Robin Singh opines Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti might opt for a calculated approach with his side against Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League final on June 2. Robin explained that Ancelotti's Blancos have already shown this season that they can shift to defensive gears when the situation arises, specifically against Manchester City in the UCL quarter-final. Real Madrid's attack line, which includes Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo Goes and Jude Bellingham, will go against the Dortmund defence consisting of Mats Hummels, Nico Schlotterbeck and Ian Maatsen.\n\nManchester City's deadly attack resulted in Ancelotti's Madrid focusing mainly on their defensive abilities, and they did that effectively to take the game to the tiebreaker shoot-outs and ultimately bag the win. Los Blancos then went on to bag a 4-3 win on aggregate against Bayern Munich, which only came after two late goals from super-sub Joselu. Hence, many have already started speculating whether the record-winners of the competition will boast a similar approach in the big final at the iconic Wembley Stadium, and look for breaks rather than attacking from the get-go.\n\nReal Madrid vs Borussia Dortmund, UCL Final: When and where to watch\n\nSpeaking in an interaction with Sony Sports, Robin explained how a defensive approach might just be on the cards in Real Madrid's game-plan for the final.\n\n\"I think Carlo Ancelotti now knows the he can have a calculative approach. We saw them (Real Madrid) defend for their lives against Manchester City. Let's just be honest. They made sacrifices in terms of - \"we will play in the counter\". That's something that we don't usually see with Real Madrid,\" Robin said.\n\n\"At the same time, we also saw a calculated approach against Bayern as well, where you saw pacey wingers against Madrid's pacey wingers. We saw Vinicius take so much of advantage against (Josshua) Kimmich.

become our heroes!\n\nStood beneath the banner, yellow and black scarf tied around his neck, was the 29-year-old assistant coach of Dortmund's Under-17s, a semi-pro striker by the name of Edin Terzic.\n\nNine years later, at the end of the pandemic-afflicted 2020-21 season, Terzic would lift the German Cup himself as Borussia Dortmund's interim coach.\n\nAnd on Saturday, he will lead his boyhood club out at Wembley in the Champions League final against Real Madrid, hoping to do what it said on that banner in Berlin and become a bona fide Dortmund hero by lifting the ultimate prize.\n\nThey were last here in the 2013 showpiece when Klopp's Dortmund were beaten 2-1 by Bayern Munich through an 89th-minute Arjen Robben strike.\n\n\"Last time, I travelled to London the day before to try and soak up the atmosphere before supporting the team from the stands,\" Terzic told BBC Sport on the final day of the Bundesliga season. \"But those days are over.\"\n\nNow 41, Terzic's journey from season-ticket holder to head coach is as romantic as they come - but it's also been an emotional one with triumphs outweighed by setbacks.\n\nNot least on the final day of last season when, needing only to beat mid-table Mainz at home to seal a first Bundesliga title since 2012, Dortmund spectacularly choked.\n\nAfter drawing 2-2 to hand Bayern Munich an 11th consecutive title, Terzic stood in tears as the massed ranks on the S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne -

It'll be a great challenge to beat Real Madrid, but everyone has been underestimating them.\n\n\"One day if you're lucky, if you put on a good performance, and if you know how to use the quality you've got ... then it can be special. It can be for Dortmund too.\n\n\"There's a nice story about it being Marco Reus' last game, and I've spoken to Mats Hummels about it. Let's see, because sometimes things happen that people don't expect in football.\n\n\"It will be very interesting, and I hope that Dortmund can remember what happened last time at the same stadium. This also means that they have experience, and Wembley is special for sure. They have to be ready.\"\n\nAs for next term, which Lewandowski is set to play under ex-Bayern boss Hansi Flick, with whom he won the treble in 2019/2020 and an eventual sextuple, the veteran said that the Barca squad \"has the feeling that this time we want to prepare well and that we are ready to compete\".\n\n\"We want to start strongly from the first match, because we know what kind of mistakes we made last season. We have a lot of potential, and I know that we can win some titles. We want to show our best performance and win silverware.\"\n\nClaiming the Pichichi in his first La Liga campaign, Lewandowski has now\n\nlost it but is confident that he can net more goals to perhaps claim the top scorer award once again.\n\n\"This season wasn't easy, but sometimes in football you have to ... not accept it, because you should never accept such a thing ... but take what you did wrong and think about what you could do better, and then try and do it,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure that I can score even more goals than last season, because I see that this squad is growing up.\n\n\"In this group the potential is increasing, and I've seen an improvement. There's a lot of young players that started to play with the first team.

Cunningham became the first Brit to sign for the club, for a then club record fee of \u00a3950,000.\n\nHe scored twice on his debut and won the double in his first season but he was rushed back from a long-term injury to play in the European Cup Final against Liverpool in Paris in 1981 and endured a game to forget as the Reds edged a 1-0 win.\n\nCunningham had spells at Marseille and Rayo Vallecano after leaving the Bernabeu and had a short but successful spell with Wimbledon, beating Liverpool to win the 1988 FA Cup, but after returning to Vallecano he died in a car crash in Madrid the following year aged just 33.\n\nThe Scottish striker was sold by Tottenham to the Catalan giants in 1984 and was part of Terry Venables' side which reached the 1986 European Cup Final against Romanians Steaua Bucharest in Seville.\n\nIt was a night, and in truth a final to forget, as the game finished 0-0 after 90 minutes and extra-time with the Romanians winning 2-0 on penalties.\n\nArchibald was subbed in extra-time and had to watch all four Barca penalties saved by Steaua keeper Helmuth Duckadam.\n\nAnother former star which Spurs sold to the continent to raise much-needed cash.\n\nWaddle made the switch to Ligue Un in 1989 for a British record \u00a34.5m and wowed the fans with his wizardry on the wing, one of the first left-footers to operate on the right flank.\n\nHe was a large part of L'OM's march to the 1991 European Cup Final in Bari, Italy, but could not help his side avoid another stalemate in the showpiece after 90 minutes and extra-time.\n\nUnlike in the World Cup semi-final on Italian soil less than 12 months previously, he didn't take a spot-kick, but saw his side beaten 5-3 on penalties nevertheless.\n\nPaul Lambert made nearly 600 appearances in a 20-year playing career - all of those bar 44 came in Scotland.\n\nThose 44 came in the fluorescent shirt of Borussia Dortmund, whom he joined on a Bosman after his contract at Motherwell ended, having impressed on a pre-season trial.\n\nAfter seeing-off Man United in the semi-final, Lambert put in a man of the match display in the final against Juventus in Munich, keeping Zinedine Zidane quiet in midfield and setting up the opening goal for Karl-Heinz Riedle as Dortmund won 3-1.\n\nLambert became the first Brit to win the tournament with an overseas team and the first to win the rebranded Champions League.\n\nThere might be a slight asterisk next to this one. The Canadian-born midfielder with an English dad was just 20 when he helped Munich overcome Valencia on penalties at the San Siro to win the Champions League in 2001.\n\nHe had yet to win an England call-up but his 120-minute display helped cement him as part of Sven Goran Eriksson's plans.\n\nHargreaves went on to play, and score in the shootout, as he won his second title, helping Man United beat Chelsea in Moscow in 2008.\n\nThe first British Galactico, McManaman signed for Madrid on a five-year deal after his Liverpool contract came to an end.\n\nThe tricky wide-man shone as Madrid beat Valencia 3-0 in Paris to win the 2000 title, scoring the second goal and becoming the first, and until Saturday only, English-born player to win the continental cup for a non-UK team.\n\nHe added his second crown two years later, coming off the bench as Madrid beat Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 at Hampden Park in Glasgow.\n\nNo player has ever won six European Cups, but Gareth Bale picked up five during his glorious nine-year stay at Real Madrid - a record which you'd expect Jude Bellingham will be only too aware of.\n\nIn his first final, after Sergio Ramos forced extra-time against city rivals Atletico with an injury-time equaliser in Lisbon in the 2014 final, Bale put Real ahead in extra-time on their way to a 4-1 win.\n\nThe two teams met in Milan two years later and this time needed penalties to separate them after a 1-1 draw, with Bale converting from the spot in a 5-3 win for Real.\n\nThe Welshman then came off the bench as Madrid defended their title with a 4-1 win against Juventus in his home city of Cardiff the following season and did so again in Kyiv in 2018 as Real faced Liverpool.\n\nMadrid had been pegged back by Sadio Mane's goal six minutes before his introduction but it took Bale just two minutes to score one of the most memorable goals in European Cup history, producing an acrobatic overhead kick from Marcelo's cross to put Madrid ahead, and then made the game safe late-on with a swerving long-range shot which deceived Lorius Karius.\n\nBale was an unused sub as Madrid again overcame Liverpool to win the 2022 final 1-0 in Paris, though he still picked up his fifth medal.", "source": {"uri": "101greatgoals.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "101greatgoals.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoad@101greatgoals.com", "name": "Alex Hoad",

It was fertile ground for Man City. Premier League Champions, no Champions League final to worry about, nice and relaxed and ready to go out and play a team that was fractured and not playing well.\n\nI should've known better really.\n\nWhatever vintage it is, Man United (or Liverpool, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona for that matter) manage to compete.\n\nI was genuinely shocked because I thought that they would play within within themselves. I didn't expect them to come out and be like 'okay, we'll have a really good go at this' because I haven't seen enough big characters or enough personalities in the dressing room throughout the season to suggest that this would be the case. Secondly, obviously with it being a derby game, they showed up to that as well.\n\nI'm more than happy to hold my hand up and say that I got it completely wrong and I thought that they did the club proud.\n\nThe performance was a massive positive for Erik ten Hag too so what does that mean for him? He was obviously very bullish and said 'if United don't want me then I'll go and win trophies elsewhere,' but that's a bit rich really because he's only been in Holland before United so he's not exactly won the Champions League.\n\nI think that if you asked me who would do a better job with the youngsters and the seniors at Manchester United, Mauricio Pochettino or Erik ten Hag, I'd go for Pochettino every day of the week and twice on a Sunday.\n\nIt's great that ten Hag managed to get the players to go out and play for the shirts because that's always important for Manchester United fans, but I think that there will be an element of dropping the ball if Sir Jim Ratcliffe, INEOS and Sir Dave Brailsford all of a sudden now thought that one performance meant ten Hag was the right man to lead the charge towards a title tilt.\n\nThere was nothing in Manchester United's league season to suggest that Erik ten Hag had control of the dressing room in the way that he did for 90 minutes in a one-off final.\n\nThe Champions League is Real Madrid's competition and it's theirs to lose. That's nothing against Borussia Dortmund, it's just that Madrid have got more match winners; Bellingham, Vini Jr... the list goes on, and I think Real will win it comfortably 2-0.\n\nIn terms of Jadon Sancho, even if he has a brilliant final, I wouldn't go anywhere near Man United - even if Sir Alex Ferguson had come back. I think that if you go to a club, and you have a bad experience at that football club, then if you go back, it's still a bad experience.\n\nHe's been playing great at Dortmund, it's clear that he feels good and looks at home, so if his agent isn't trying to put to deal together right now with Dortmund then he's crazy. If Sancho honestly thinks that he's got the chutzpah to be able to go back into Manchester United with a new manager, good luck to him.\n\nThe expectation is much greater there, with the greatest respect to Dortmund who are club where you bring your waifs and strays, young and promising players, and they'll turn them into a team that play in this amazing 80,000 capacity arena. Whereas at Manchester United, you have to be the finished product. You've got to produce immediately.\n\nSancho's dug himself out of a hole and is enjoying his football again, and England have got big Nations League games coming up. There's nothing to say that he couldn't get back into an England squad but I'd say to him 'don't walk back into that familiar dressing room at Old Trafford and put that shirt on that drags you down. Move on even if that's to somewhere else.'\n\nEven if United say that they're not going to allow him to be loaned out again and he can only be sold, that's fine. If Dortmund can't afford him, he should go somewhere else in Germany or to Italy - but under no circumstances should he be going back to Manchester United.\n\nEnzo Maresca worked with the Man City development squad before going to Parma and then onto Leicester, and with the greatest respect to Parma and Leicester, it's a very, very, very different beast to Chelsea.\n\nHe knows England - let's not forget as a player he actually started his professional career at West Bromwich Albion - and he's played at Sevilla, Fiorentina, Bologna, Juventus, Malaga, Sampdoria and Olympiacos so he's got a really good CV, but Chelsea is a beast that will eat great managers up.\n\nIt ate Mourinho up twice, Thomas Tuchel, Graham Potter, Frank Lampard...\n\nAlthough there are some seasoned winners in that Chelsea dressing room, it's very much a young squad, and that's what Todd Boehly will be hoping to tap into. That there isn't a John Terry or a Didier Drogba to question things, but a group of young players that will marvel at Maresca's work on the training pitch with all his Pep-type driills.\n\nUnfortunately for him, Chelsea had a poor season in the Premier League and it's a results-based business. He'll need to get wins on the board without, perhaps, some of his senior players because they'll be sold as the club are close to falling foul of FFP despite selling hotels in London and doing all sorts of creative accounting.\n\nThe Blues need to get lots of very good results very early if they want to get into Europe, and by that I mean the Europa League.\n\nI would be absolutely astounded if, when we get to Christmas, there aren't rumblings about Maresca's position already being under threat because it's a young, fickle, rookie group.\n\nFor me, it's an underwhelming appointment, the club should have stuck with Poch, and I get the feeling that come November/December time, we'll be having another conversation about Chelsea changing their manager again.\n\nJulen Lopetegui is a confident man, he's had some of the biggest jobs that it's possible to get, and I think that West Ham are obviously looking for somebody that can take them consistently into Europe over the next three or four years.\n\nIf you're David Sullivan, you're probably looking at clubs like Aston Villa and Newcastle and saying that's where we should be. That's where we want to be. We want to be in the Champions League. So we need a manager that can pretty much get us there.\n\nSo Lopetegui's experience at Real Madrid, at Sevilla, with the Spanish National team, at Porto and with Spanish under age groups... he ticks all the boxes. I'm just not convinced about him as a person.\n\nIf you look at Wolves he was there for a year, if you look at Seville - three years, Real Madrid - he barely walked into the club before he was out again, Spain - a couple of years, Porto - a couple of years... if West Ham are looking to get into the Champions League, it's a three, four or five year project, and he hasn't stayed at a club for anywhere near that.\n\nSo the question is, what's in it for him? A massive payday.\n\nIs he particularly loyal? Wolves fans will say no. If he has a good season and let's say do what Villa did last season, does anybody honestly think that if Barcelona, Real Madrid or Bayern Munich came in for him that he'd still be at West Ham?\n\nI'm 53 and I can't ever see in my lifetime that the Saudi Pro League will be thought of as a top five global league and the reasons are really quite simple. England, Spain, Italy, France, Germany... 100 plus year-old leagues, legacy leagues that really mean something.\n\nSecondly, all those leagues are very rich in their own right. Companies aren't bailing on the Premier League or La Liga to go and sponsor the Saudi League, which will be propped up by Saudi money from Saudi companies.\n\nAnd thirdly, dare I say the culture that you've seen. Muslim players go out there because obviously it's something they know, but you've also seen players that go out there, dip their toe in and are back in no time at all. Likewise, managers. Nuno Espirito Santo, Jordan Henderson.... So for me, I just think it's going to continue being a gimmick.\n\nBoxing will be there for the next 20 years, but people aren't going to go there and watch boxing in the same way that they would if they were at Madison Square Garden or some of the great venues.\n\nThe Saudi's will continue to build it up, but I just think it's all about location and the cultural aspect. They will always get tournaments - like Qatar had the World Cup and Dubai gets the tennis - but people still want to go to Wimbledon, people still want to go to an Olympics in Paris, people still want to go to Wembley Stadium for that footballl experience or to watch Madrid in the Bernabeu.\n\nIt's like the MLS was and like the A League in Australia was for two or three years, and it's a bit of a top up for the pension.\n\nNo disrespect to Cristiano Ronaldo, whose 35 goals is a remarkable achievement even if he was doing that at his age in Sunday league football, but I can't cannot see a time where European footballers head to Saudi Arabia to give the best years of their life.\n\nKylian Mbappe was effectively offered billions to go and he didn't choose it because he knew that he could get paid very handsomely in Europe and be relevant.

To reach the final, both had to overcome an opponent bankrolled by a petrostate. The Spanish champions edged past Abu Dhabi-backed Manchester City in the quarterfinals, while Dortmund saw off Qatar-owned Paris Saint-Germain in the semis.\n\nOn the pitch, it's clear that Europe's old guard can still compete with the best of football's nouveau riche, while governing bodies now acknowledge that checking the might of sovereign wealth is vital for the long-term health of the game.\n\nOf course, Real and Dortmund are hardly paupers. According to Deloitte, the Spanish champions had the highest revenue in world football last year, while the German side ranked 12th.\n\nDespite being member-owned, Real have still been able to bring in capital from outside investors through a partnership with US private equity firm Sixth Street, and have had no trouble in attracting and paying top players such as England's Jude Bellingham, who signed last summer from Dortmund for \u20ac100mn. He is set to be joined imminently by French superstar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, who is quitting PSG in search of the European glory that has eluded the club despite Qatar's billions.\n\nIn home leagues, state-backed clubs remain dominant. Manchester City just notched up a sixth Premier League title in seven years, while Paris Saint-Germain have now added 10 French championships to the trophy cabinet since being bought by Qatar Sports Investment in 2011.\n\nAs ever in football, luck played a vital role in shaping Saturday's contest. Real needed a penalty shootout to beat City in the quarterfinals, while Dortmund withstood a barrage of attacks from PSG in the semis. There was a moment in time when a Qatar vs Abu Dhabi finale looked more likely than not.\n\nBut as football's governing bodies start to put the squeeze on spending, the financial firepower of state-owned clubs should, in theory, lose some of its potency.\n\nIn the Premier League -- where 115 allegations of spending rule breaches still hang over City -- a new financial regime is on the horizon. Next week, clubs will vote on potential reforms, including one to limit spending by top teams depending on income generated by those at the bottom.\n\nThis season saw the introduction of new financial rules by Uefa, European football's governing body, that limit the amount a team can spend on its playing staff to 90 per cent of revenue. The \"squad cost\" rule will be tightened next season to 80 per cent of income, and again the following year to 70 per cent.\n\nSuch rule changes will not make European trophies more accessible to a wider group of clubs. Indeed some of them, such as the squad cost rule that ties spending to revenue, are more likely to cement the status quo by making it harder to break into the elite.\n\nUefa already rewards a club's pedigree. About a third of Champions League prize money is allocated based on performance in the tournament over the previous five years. That's why Saudi-owned Newcastle United's earnings from its appearance in the group stages of the contest this season were significantly lower than those of Champions League regulars.\n\nLax financial regulation left the door open for City and PSG to buy their way into football's elite. A tightening of the rules will test whether new money can still change the sport's balance of power.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [],

Unlike last year's event, neither side is owned by a Gulf state or massive foreign corporation.\n\nInstead we have a Spanish team which boasts nearly 100,000 \"socios\" - fan owners who pay an annual fee which entitles them to vote on who runs the club, and the decisions it makes. And while Real Madrid doesn't trumpet its ownership model quite so much as its Spanish rivals Barcelona, fans continue to play an important role in its governance.\n\nMeanwhile in Germany, the football association's \"50+1\" rule from 1998 ensures that at least 50% plus one share of a club is owned by members' associations. Borussia Dortmund has almost 1,000 officially registered fan clubs, representing some 60,000 fans.\n\nFootball fans of clubs in other countries may envy this kind of involvement and ownership. But in the expensive world of modern football, this apparent showcase for sporting social democracy cannot hide what are rather less idealistic financial and political realities.\n\nReal Madrid's complicated history embraces everything from associations with Franco's fascist government (the club's stadium, Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, is even named after a Franco loyalist) to receiving illegal state aid.\n\nMore recently, the club has become a commercial behemoth drawing revenues from all manner of commercial contracts. Its shirt sponsorship deal with state-owned Dubai airline Emirates has been in place since 2011 and is now estimated to be worth \u20ac70 million (\u00a360 million) per season.\n\nAlongside this sponsorship is another deal supporting tourism to Dubai, which cements increasingly strong links between the club and the Gulf region. This is despite continued and serious human rights concerns about the emirate.\n\nBack in Spain, Real Madrid recently inaugurated its redeveloped Bernab\u00e9u stadium, with Taylor Swift one of the first to perform there. This state-of-the-art, 85,000-seat venue was funded via a series of loans from lenders including JP Morgan, one of the biggest financial institutions in the world.\n\nSo what of Borussia Dortmund, located in the Ruhrgebiet region, with its working-class links to Germany's powerful industrial past?\n\nLess famous and less wealthy than Real Madrid, Borussia is famed for its \"yellow wall\", a name given to the mass of fans who attend home matches at the Signal Iduna Park. Earlier this season, these fans staged protests against the potential sale of Bundesliga television rights to a US private equity company and the ongoing commercialisation of football.\n\nHowever, the fact that Borussia Dortmund's stadium carries the name of a financial services corporation (even if most fans still refer to it as the Westfalenstadion) provides yet further evidence of the heavyweight economic input many European clubs now depend upon.\n\nWhile the German club may appear to many to be a symbol of democracy and equality, among its owners are British, French and Spanish private equity investment funds. These are businesses designed to make money rather than preserve romantic notions of European football.\n\nAlongside these investors is German sports apparel brand Puma, a long-time co-owner and partner of Borussia Dortmund. Although the company recently terminated a deal with the Israel Football Association, for several years it was targeted by pro-Palestinian campaigners.\n\nAnd while the club isn't overtly engaged in pursuing commercial opportunities in the Gulf region, it does count China among its most important overseas markets. Recently it opened an office in Shanghai and an academy in Xiamen.\n\nConcerns about human rights violations in China haven't deterred Borussia Dortmund from this potentially large market - although the rising political temperature between the China and the US, where the club also has strong ties, might start to make things awkward.\n\nBut geopolitical harmony is not the goal here. As with any other team in Europe's top leagues, aside from winning trophies, the mission is to sell replica shirts and football boots and make money wherever it's possible to do so. It's not about pandering to the wishes of fans, however vocal they may be, or how much they value their team.\n\nFor purists, the Champions League final at Wembley stadium on June 1 might seem like a rare opportunity to celebrate European values and fan democracy in football. But this is an idealistic notion, which fails to acknowledge how deeply embedded global financial and geopolitical networks have become in the beautiful game.\n\nSimon Chadwick works with UEFA's

Unlike last year's event, neither side is owned by a Gulf state or massive foreign corporation.\n\nInstead we have a Spanish team which boasts nearly 100,000 \"socios\" - fan owners who pay an annual fee which entitles them to vote on who runs the club, and the decisions it makes. And while Real Madrid doesn't trumpet its ownership model quite so much as its Spanish rivals Barcelona, fans continue to play an important role in its governance.\n\nMeanwhile in Germany, the football association's \"50+1\" rule from 1998 ensures that at least 50% plus one share of a club is owned by members' associations. Borussia Dortmund has almost 1,000 officially registered fan clubs, representing some 60,000 fans.\n\nFootball fans of clubs in other countries may envy this kind of involvement and ownership. But in the expensive world of modern football, this apparent showcase for sporting social democracy cannot hide what are rather less idealistic financial and political realities.\n\nReal Madrid's complicated history embraces everything from associations with Franco's fascist government (the club's stadium, Santiago Bernab\u00e9u, is even named after a Franco loyalist) to receiving illegal state aid.\n\nMore recently, the club has become a commercial behemoth drawing revenues from all manner of commercial contracts. Its shirt sponsorship deal with state-owned Dubai airline Emirates has been in place since 2011 and is now estimated to be worth \u20ac70 million (\u00a360 million) per season.\n\nAlongside this sponsorship is another deal supporting tourism to Dubai, which cements increasingly strong links between the club and the Gulf region. This is despite continued and serious human rights concerns about the emirate.\n\nBack in Spain, Real Madrid recently inaugurated its redeveloped Bernab\u00e9u stadium, with Taylor Swift one of the first to perform there. This state-of-the-art, 85,000-seat venue was funded via a series of loans from lenders including JP Morgan, one of the biggest financial institutions in the world.\n\nFan fair\n\nSo what of Borussia Dortmund, located in the Ruhrgebiet region, with its working-class links to Germany's powerful industrial past?\n\nLess famous and less wealthy than Real Madrid, Borussia is famed for its \"yellow wall\", a name given to the mass of fans who attend home matches at the Signal Iduna Park. Earlier this season, these fans staged protests against the potential sale of Bundesliga television rights to a US private equity company and the ongoing commercialisation of football.\n\nHowever, the fact that Borussia Dortmund's stadium carries the name of a financial services corporation (even if most fans still refer to it as the Westfalenstadion) provides yet further evidence of the heavyweight economic input many European clubs now depend upon.\n\nWhile the German club may appear to many to be a symbol of democracy and equality, among its owners are British, French and Spanish private equity investment funds. These are businesses designed to make money rather than preserve romantic notions of European football.\n\nAlongside these investors is German sports apparel brand Puma, a long-time co-owner and partner of Borussia Dortmund. Although the company recently terminated a deal with the Israel Football Association, for several years it was targeted by pro-Palestinian campaigners.\n\nAnd while the club isn't overtly engaged in pursuing commercial opportunities in the Gulf region, it does count China among its most important overseas markets. Recently it opened an office in Shanghai and an academy in Xiamen.\n\nConcerns about human rights violations in China haven't deterred Borussia Dortmund from this potentially large market - although the rising political temperature between the China and the US, where the club also has strong ties, might start to make things awkward.\n\nBut geopolitical harmony is not the goal here. As with any other team in Europe's top leagues, aside from winning trophies, the mission is to sell replica shirts and football boots and make money wherever it's possible to do so. It's not about pandering to the wishes of fans, however vocal they may be, or how much they value their team.\n\nFor purists, the Champions League final at Wembley stadium on June 1 might seem like a rare opportunity to celebrate European values and fan democracy in football.

Having kept pace with Bayern Munich all campaign, the Bavarians' shock defeat to RB Leipzig meant only mid-table Mainz stood in the way of Dortmund and their first league title in over a decade. But it all went very wrong.\n\nWithin 24 minutes they were 2-0 down, and although second-half strikes from Raphael Guerreiro and Niklas Sule would ultimately earn them a draw, Bayern would end up clinching the Bundesliga trophy on goal difference.\n\n\"You see how tough and hard the sport is that we chose to love. It is hard when you see only one goal is missing.

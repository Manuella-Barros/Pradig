So the Bearcats\u2019 win against South Central in the Class 2A North Judson Sectional championship game on Monday was particularly special for the senior first baseman. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy,\u201d Prskalo said. \u201cI knew we had the potential. But our team would slip up, get out of focus. But we decided to lock in for the championship when it meant the most to us. That meant something to me that they cared as much as they did during the playoffs.\u201d Prskalo also won a sectional title with Wheeler\u2019s bowling team last year. \u201cIt was fun,\u201d Prskalo said. \u201cIt was a good feeling. But it just didn\u2019t feel like the right sport to win a sectional championship in for me.\u201d The Bearcats had most recently won a sectional title in baseball in 2021, which was bittersweet for Prskalo. He was academically ineligible that season and was relegated to the role of spectator. \u201cThat motivated me to get my grades up and be out there with the dudes,\u201d Prskalo said. \u201cMy team, they needed a first baseman, especially after their senior first baseman my freshman year graduated. They needed me to turn it around. \u201cFlunking out, that was stupid of me. But I got into my academics more. I turned it around.\u201d Sean Cunningham, who is in his second season as Wheeler\u2019s coach after spending the previous two years as an assistant, has seen Prskalo\u2019s growth. Prskalo is one of three captains, along with Jackson Smith and Lucas McNamara, and one of the top players for the Bearcats (13-12). \u201cHe works hard for the team,\u201d Cunningham said of Prskalo. \u201cWhen it comes to getting the team riled up and getting them going, he\u2019s that guy. He\u2019s definitely the loudest guy in the dugout. You hear him. You know it\u2019s him. \u201cHe\u2019s changed a lot. He\u2019s a different person.\u201d Prskalo has been an important person to junior Nick Bravo, who is hitting a team-high .435 in his first season after transferring from Valparaiso. \u201cHe was actually the first one who reached out to me when he heard I was transferring over here,\u201d Bravo said of Prskalo. \u201cWe connected well from the beginning. In the beginning, I actually told him, \u2018I want to win a sectional championship,\u2019 and we actually did. It\u2019s exciting. \u201cHe\u2019s in the four-hole for a reason, for sure. Good contact, big barrel, big guy, really.\u201d The 6-foot-2, 225-pound Prskalo is batting .377 with a team-high 30 RBIs this season. He\u2019s also 3-1 with a 2.21 ERA. \u201cHe comes up with big hits,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cPiles of RBIs. He\u2019s just a good hitter.\u201d Prskalo hit .388 with a team-high two homers and 23 RBIs, tied for the team lead, last season. As a sophomore, he debuted by posting a .382 average with a homer and 16 RBIs. \u201cPeople expected a lot out of me, and I did what a sophomore could do,\u201d Prskalo said. \u201cJunior year was a step up year for me. And this year, coach saw that I could be a leader, and I\u2019m trying to prove my point as to why I\u2019m a captain. \u201cMy work ethic has been better. I feel like I\u2019ve put in a lot more work and dedication into baseball this year than I have my entire high school life. All the work is paying off \u2014 fielding, hitting, everything.\u201d Prskalo hopes it continues in regionals on Saturday, when Wheeler will play Greater South Shore Conference foe Illiana Christian (18-9). The Vikings, who have won back-to-back state championships, downed the Bearcats 24-2 on April 8. But Prskalo, who committed to Calumet College last month, believes Wheeler has made significant strides over the last couple of months. In the sectional, the Bearcats beat North Judson 17-0 and South Central 14-12. \u201cIt was the beginning of the season when we weren\u2019t very warm,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can hit the way we\u2019ve been hitting the last half of our season and the playoffs, with our energy, we can shock the world. \u201cI\u2019ve been fairly consistent with my bat and my glove this year. I\u2019d consider myself one of the role models for this team with keeping everyone up and in good spirits and able to make people happy. Doing that makes the team a little bit better.\u201d", "summary": "Prskalo, ineligible as a freshman, has become a dynamic two-way player for sectional champion Wheeler.", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/05/29/2a-baseball-braydon-prskalo-wheeler/", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/PTB-L-BAS-PRSKALO1-053024-01-e1716984029110.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:45:47", "author": "Michael Osipoff", "authors": ["Michael Osipoff"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.176}

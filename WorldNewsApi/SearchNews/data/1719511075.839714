In a second video posted on her Instagram, Minaj spoke from behind the camera to a man in a suit, who told her that officers wanted to reach her luggage again \"because you filmed [the police officer]. .. He doesn't believe you don't have more with you than you said.\" In a series of posts on X on May 25, Minaj wrote that the arrest was an attempt to \"sabotage my tour.\" \"They\u2019re being paid big money to try to sabotage my tour b/c soooooo many ppl are mad that it\u2019s this successful & they can\u2019t eat off me. They got caught stealing money from my travel/jets. Got fired. Got mad. Etc,\" she said.

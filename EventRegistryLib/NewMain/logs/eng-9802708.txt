In Nigeria, where the poverty threshold is 1.90 U.S. dollars a day (about 3000 using the official rate), 133 million of our 200 million people are multidimensionally poor.\n\n\"This means that they not only lack financial resources but also lack access to essential services such as education, healthcare, and clean water. If you are not one of the 133 million, it is likely that your family members, extended or nuclear, are, and if we do not address this now, future generations may face the same plight. Hope and believe is not a strategy, hope and belief must be accompanied by action. This is the essence of our CSP,\" Mamedu said.\n\nAlso, the Minister of Budget and Economic Planning, Senator Atiku Bagudu, said that Nigeria's federal budget of $20bn, is way behind the budgets of other populous countries like Indonesia and Brazil, declaring that the country is not as wealthy as people think.\n\n\"The federal budget of Indonesia is about US $210bn. The federal budget of Brazil is about $700 billion and it has been like that for a while. When I say for a while, for upwards of a decade. The budget of Nigeria, Federal budget, now is about $20bn, and maybe the highest it has been, has been about $35bn.\n\n\"Do we want to be like Brazil? Or do we want to be like Indonesia? Can we hope to achieve what they have achieved with that level of federal spending? Or do we confront this reality? Because when you confront your reality, it's just like gathering the family around and reminding everyone that we are not as rich as we think we are. Maybe new energy will come in to the family, and the sense of entitlement will give way to what can I do, what effort can I contribute?\"\n\nBagudu called for collective action of both citizens and the government to fight decades of under investment in the country.\n\nDelivering the keynote, Dr Otive Igbuzor, Founding Executive Director, African Centre for Leadership, Strategy and Development (Centre LSD), Abuja, who was also a former Country Director of AAN, said that 20 years ago in 2004, the poverty rate in Nigeria was 54.7 percent representing about 74.8 million people. \"Today, the poverty rate is projected to be 40.7 percent representing 93.3 million people. So, in spite of all our best efforts, poverty is increasing.

He called for a movement that unites people against poverty and injustice, stating that the fight cannot be waged by a single entity or through isolated efforts.\n\nActionAid Nigeria's strategy, as outlined in the paper, focuses on empowering citizens, strengthening governance, advancing economic and social justice, and building community resilience.\n\nThe organisation plans to mobilise grassroots movements to drive change, shifting mindsets, policies, and practices to create a Nigeria where justice prevails and every individual has the opportunity to reach their full potential.", "source": {"uri": "businessday.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Businessday NG"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ladi_patrick_okwoli@businessday.ng", "name": "Ladi Patrick-Okwoli", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionAid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ActionAid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Collective action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poverty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_resilience", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate resilience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outline (list)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_knowledge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Traditional knowledge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_equality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender equality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decolonization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_exclusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social exclusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_director", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive director"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Poverty", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Atiku-Bagudu.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802708", "eventUri": "eng-9802708", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1607843137254902, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Still, he said it could only be eradicated through concerted efforts of all levels of government working to include all strata of the society.\n\nHe said, \"The ultimate end of social action is to include all, and local economies can be made to include all. This can only happen when we embrace cooperation, when we become less judgmental when we interrogate and challenge public officials to give more effort and guidance, and when we appreciate that we are not alone. Some of the challenges we are facing are global.\n\n\"But yet we can't take luxury or comfort in that. We have to move quickly.

This is the essence of our CSP,'' he said,\n\nThe country director said that history has shown the transformative power of social movements and these movements had demonstrated that collective action could lead to monumental change.\n\n\"At ActionAid Nigeria, we are committed to harnessing this power through our CSP, focusing on four critical actions: Organise, Act, Shift, and Thrive.\n\n\"Our strategy is not only about addressing immediate needs but also about empowering citizens to drive systemic change.\n\n\" We are dedicated to a human rights-based approach, placing the dignity and rights of every individual at the center of our work. We will engage with communities not merely as beneficiaries but as active partners in their own development,'' Mamedu said.\n\nThe Minister of Budget and Economic Planning, Sen. Atiku Bagudu, commended AAN for working to augment the government's efforts, especially in the development sector.\n\nBagudu said that poverty, inequality and citizen action were an economic and anthropological issue needing collective action to overcome it.\n\nAccording to him, Nigeria's federal budget is 20 billion dollars , which lags behind the budgets of other populous countries such as Indonesia with 210 billion dollars and Brazil with a $700 billion budget.\n\n\"Do we want to be like Brazil? Or do we want to be like Indonesia? Can we hope to achieve what they have with that level of federal spending? Or should we confront this reality?\n\n\"Confronting our reality is akin to gathering the family around and reminding everyone that we are not as wealthy as we think we are.\n\n\"Maybe new energy will come into the family, and the sense of entitlement will give way to 'What can I do? What effort can I contribute?'\" he said.\n\nBagudu called for collective action by citizens and the government at all levels to address what he described as \"decades of under-investment\" in the country, to address the challenges.\n\nThe Keynote Speaker, Dr Otive Igbuzor, in his presentation titled 'Social Movement Organising: The Path to Poverty Eradication and Social Justice', said that AAN's CSP came at a time when Nigeria was faced with huge political, economic, and social challenges.\n\nHe said, \"As we launch ActionAid Nigeria's new Country Strategy Paper today, I urge all stakeholders to join hands in this historic and critical endeavour to change course and change the narratives.\"\n\nIgbuzor said that, although the task ahead was formidable, it was not insurmountable.\n\n\"If we face the challenges with catalytic partnership, collective action, unwavering commitment and social movement organising, we can make significant strides where poverty and injustice are relegated to history.\n\n\" Let us be encouraged that every step and action taken towards poverty eradication, justice and equity, no matter how small, contribute to the larger goal of a just and prosperous society.\n\n\"Another Nigeria is not just a possibility but an imperative, 'he said.

The federal budget of Brazil is about $700 billion and has been at that level for a while -- for upwards of a decade. Nigeria's federal budget is currently about $20 billion, with the highest it has reached being around $35 billion.\n\nBagudu posed critical questions about Nigeria's aspirations, questioning whether the country can realistically hope to achieve development seen in Brazil or Indonesia with such limited federal spending. He urged the nation to confront the reality of its economic situation, likening it to a family coming to terms with its financial limitations.\n\nHe stressed the importance of collective action from both the government and citizens to address what he termed as \"decades of under-investment\" in critical sectors.\n\n\"The situation we face today is not the result of any single leader's actions but rather the outcome of cumulative under-investment over many years. We must all contribute to the solution,\" Bagudu stated.\n\nThe minister noted that the administration of President Bola Tinubu was determined to address these challenges, consistent with practices in other countries, without apportioning blame. According to Bagudu, addressing Nigeria's economic issues requires the involvement of all citizens, not just the government.\n\nActionAid Nigeria's country director, Andrew Mamedu, also spoke at the event, warning that if Nigeria did not take urgent action to tackle poverty, future generations could suffer even more.\n\nHe cited alarming statistics showing that 133 million Nigerians, out of a population of 200 million, are multi-dimensionally poor, lacking not only financial resources but also essential services like education, healthcare, and clean water.\n\nReacting to governors' role in combating the hardship and hunger in the country, the Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, on Thursday, said the World Bank loan received by states is for infrastructural projects and not to cushion the effects of hardship faced by Nigerians.\n\nOver the past nine months, the Federal Government disbursed N573 billion to governors to fight poverty in their domain. Many Nigerians, including human rights lawyer, Femi Falana, had challenged states and the FCT to explain how they spent the money they received.\n\nBut speaking on Channels Television's Politics Today, the governor explained that states received the money in batches with the latest received so far in June. \"The money is tied to certain projects. It is almost like a regimented loan from the World Bank. The money is not for rice, it is not for palliatives, it is not for anything in that line,\" he said.\n\n\"That money came from the World Bank and that was the second disbursement which came in November last year. The account amount was credited to the account of every other state, sometimes around January.\"\n\nThe governor explained that during the second tranche received by states, Nasarawa received N13.6 billion, representing over 10 per cent of the amount.\n\nWhen asked about the per cent given for the repayment, the governor said: \"The World Bank is actually doing it at no interest.\n\n\"The reason is because it was coming to support states because of the pandemic. It started around 2020. The first disbursement was done even before Mr President came in May 2023. The third disbursement was the one done in June that was advertised. Every state has been credited and no state is denying it.\"\n\nIn April 2023, the Federal Government disbursed N77 billion to states and the FCT to fund the NG-CARES programme and contribute to tackling multi-dimensional poverty in the country. A total sum of N112 billion was disbursed by the Muhammadu Buhari administration to states and FCT to fight poverty.\n\nHowever, in 2023, the Federal Government approved the release of N135.4 as reimbursement to States and FCT for the implementation of the Nigeria COVID-19 Action Recovery and Economic Stimulus (NG CARES) Programme.\n\nIn July 2024, the Federal Government released over N438 billion in reimbursement to 34 states and the Federal Capital Territory under the Nigeria Community Action for Resilience and Economic Stimulus programme.\n\nNigeria's food crisis has however deepened in August as governments scramble for solutions amid widespread anger and discontent among the people. Within the month, the food crisis manifested not only in the activities of crop farmers but also in the anguish of poultry owners.\n\nThe continuous increase in the prices of goods and services over the past year has chased some of the farmers out of business, a poultry farmer said, adding that many have already cut down on their production quantity amidst fears that feed producers might have also compromised livestock feed qualities due to skyrocketing prices of feed ingredients.\n\nWITH government's interventions notwithstanding, the media team of ex-Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has chided media handlers of President Bola Tinubu over attempts to hoodwink Nigerians into believing that the president was compassionate.\n\nIt described the use of an old video of President Tinubu appealing to Nigerians; to cover up for his poor outing during his last national broadcast on the #Endbadgovernance protests as evidence of this duplicity.\n\nAtiku's Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, in a statement, in Abuja, yesterday said, \"In the afternoon of Wednesday and on Day 7 of the #EndBadGovernanceInNigeria protest, the official X handle (formerly known as Twitter) of President Tinubu posted a video clip of the President appealing to Nigerians to relax the protest and give his administration more time.\n\n\"The video went viral on social media and it was adjudged to have shown more empathy for the concerns of protesting Nigerians, unlike the shambolic speech by the President on Sunday that will forever be remembered in ignominy.\n\n\"Curiously, much later in the evening of the same day, presidential spokesman, Bayo Onanuga, made a post on his X handle telling the country that the video clip that was posted on the President's handle, \"is not a new video. It's a clip from a broadcast he made last year.\" What a wawu!\n\n\"The scenario says a lot about the character of the Tinubu presidency, the proficiency of his media managers, and the attitude that the presidency accords the current #EndBadGovernanceInNigeria protest.\n\n\"For a start, what the Tinubu presidency did with the old video is to pull the wool over the eyes of Nigerians, to distract them. It's a mannerism that is symptomatic of this presidency. This president and his media managers are a class act in propaganda.\n\n\"It is indeed shameless that in a time where misinformation and disinformation are being blamed for public outrage in many parts of the world, the Nigerian government is caught red-handed in the act, adopting it as a state policy.\"", "source": {"uri": "guardian.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"},

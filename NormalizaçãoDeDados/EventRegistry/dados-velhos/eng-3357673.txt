Robert E. Lee, but it became a gathering point for white supremacists around the country.\n\nThat led to counter-protests from anti-fascist and other leftist groups. Clashes between the two sides took place throughout the morning, and local and state authorities eventually declared a state of emergency.\n\nPolice then declared the rally an \"unlawful assembly\" and shut it down.\n\nI am heartbroken that a life has been lost here.

The crash took place as leftist protesters were making their way through crowded city streets.\n\nVideo shows counter-protesters walking down a crowded street around some cars that are attempting to drive through but are stopped by the crowd. A silver vehicle comes up at a much higher rate of speed and plows into the back of a vehicle, shoving it and another vehicle forward into the crowd.\n\nThe driver then backs his car up at a high rate of speed and flees the area.\n\nVideo from the scene showed blood on the hood and windshield of a vehicle, and people screaming from their injuries. Reports indicated at least 19 other people are being treated for their injuries at a local hospital.\n\nVirginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said the severity of injuries ranged from minor to life-threatening. The silver vehicle that rammed into crowd has been located, Geller said.\n\nReports from Charlottesville indicated the driver has been arrested.\n\nPolice are not, at this point, characterizing the crash as intentional, Geller said.", "time": "18:39:00"}

Joseph Hatter, a commander with the Charlottesville Police Department, is quoted by numerous media outlets as stating officers tried to create separate areas for protesters and counter-protesters to \"reduce the violence.\"\n\n\"It didn't work, did it?\" Hatter said. \"I think there was a plan to have them separated. They didn't want to be separated.\"\n\nSigner, a Democrat, noted the event location was changed, which kept law enforcement changing their plans in the lead-up to the protests.\n\n\"We even went as far as, our city manager made a decision on the Monday before the weekend when the rally was scheduled, to move the permit, the location for the rally, to a larger park, a hundred-acre park within the city borders, which would have provided even more speech, and would have allowed all that assembly, with armed very -- people with very strong opinions for this to occur longer,\" Signer explained.\n\n\"That was struck down by a federal judge, who forced us to have this event in very crowded, dense downtown Charlottesville, on the eve of the event at 9:00. So I regret that happened. We had a very strong security plan in place with a lot of folks to allow people to express their views. Unfortunately they didn't want to do it peaceably. And so that's what happened.\"\n\nSigner also addressed concerns there may be more demonstrations in Charlottesville.\n\n\"I think we have a responsibility as a government sworn to the Constitution to not just allow free speech, but to protect it, as long as it's done peaceably, which is what we attempted to do this weekend,\" Signer explained. \"If you have folks who come in and act unpeacebly, you'll get unlawful assembly declared, which is what happened yesterday.\"", "time": "17:29:00"}

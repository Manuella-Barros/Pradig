They admonished Trump for saying he would pardon those convicted of crimes related to the attack on the Capitol.\n\nGonell, who was a sergeant, said the mob tried to drag him into the crowd. Someone hit him with a flagpole while the American flag was still attached.\n\n\"We were assaulted and beaten by a mob who believed Donald Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen,\" said Gonell, an Army veteran who sustained injuries to his hands, left shoulder, left calf and right foot.\n\nHe said he had two surgeries since the riot. His injuries were part of the reason he resigned from the Capitol Police in 2022.\n\nDunn, hard to miss at 6-foot-7, served 15 years in the Capitol Police force. He said Trump's actions encouraging the riot mean the former president no longer deserves the benefit of the doubt. Dunn predicted that Trump will try to subvert democracy again if put back in the White House.\n\nDunn, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for Congress this year, urged voters to support Biden to keep Trump out of office. He called Trump a \"threat to democracy.\"\n\nThe pair of former cops, both of whom testified before Congress about their experiences, were flanked by about 15 Biden supporters, including Pittsburgh City Controller Rachael Heisler.\n\n\"This is about democracy versus dictatorship,\" Dunn said. \"The choice could not be more clear.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome police unions, including the International Union of Police Associations, endorsed Trump for president this year.\n\nThe tour will make stops later in Philadelphia, Harrisburg, Erie, and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area. Dunn said he and Gonell will also be traveling to other battleground states to campaign.\n\nThe Pittsburgh stop came less than a week after Trump was convicted in a New York court on 34 counts of falsifying business records at his company in connection with a scheme to cover up an alleged tryst with a porn star by hiding the potentially embarrassing story during his 2016 presidential election campaign.\n\nBoth Dunn and Gonell addressed the conviction but said it was not the reason they wanted to see Trump defeated. Dunn said Trump should never have run again after his role in the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nTrump was impeached and then acquitted for inciting the attack on the Capitol.\n\nDunn said he was more interested in Trump's charges in federal court.\n\nThe former president and Republican Party standard-bearer is accused in a Washington, D.C. court of conspiring to defraud the U.S. by illegally subverting the results of the 2020 presidential election and the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nDunn said he is hopeful the federal case will lead to another conviction for the president, but said voters shouldn't rely on that.\n\n\"We cannot depend on our (legal) institutions to save us from Donald Trump,\" he said. \"We have to defeat him at the ballot box.\"\n\nThe two officers encouraged Republicans, conservatives, and others to join their cause.\n\nThey were joined by one former Republican who said Trump's behavior in office and his first impeachment led her to join the Democratic Party.\n\nLindsey Scott, an Iraq War veteran from Crawford County, said she used to see herself as a Republican in line with former Arizona Sen. John McCain but left the GOP because of what she called Trump's poor leadership.\n\nScott cited Trump's vow to pardon people convicted of Jan. 6 crimes as a step too far.\n\n\"Trump would absolutely destroy our democracy if it meant holding on to personal power,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_deto@triblive.com",

Aquilino Gonell, who were among four members of the U.S. Capitol Police to testify in front of the now-defunct U.S. House Select Committee to Investigate Jan. 6, campaigned this week on behalf of President Joe Biden in Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Scranton, Philadelphia and Erie.\n\nBut their message was much less about Biden than it was Trump, who they say is responsible for the U.S. Capitol riots that left them emotionally and physically scarred and should be held accountable both at the ballot box and in court.\n\n\"Before Jan. 6, our politics were just to defend anybody who was at the Capitol,\" said Gonell, who served 17 years as a Capitol Police officer before retiring in 2023 from injuries he suffered during the riot. \"It didn't matter to us which party was in a position of power or not. We did our jobs.\n\n\"We tried to be neutral when we first came forward,\" Gonell continued. \"Unfortunately, the Republican Party has chosen to side with the former president and condone, excuse, support what the former president had done and that's why we've come forward to support Joe Biden, because Joe Biden is not dangling pardons in front of the same people who attacked us. We want accountability and justice.\"\n\nAdded Dunn, \"This is about a democracy over a dictatorship, and the choice couldn't be more clear.\"\n\nMore: Report IDs 202 election deniers in 7 key states. 87 are from the Pa. General Assembly.\n\nTrump and \"his subordinates in Congress,\" said Dunn, have tried to \"downplay, whitewash or deny that (Jan. 6) happened at all.\" The former president faces charges of conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, which include his speech to supporters the before the riot.\n\nTrump is the \"biggest threat to democracy,\" Dunn said, and should be kept as far away from the White House as possible.\n\nTrump has said he'll pardon the more than 1,200 people who have been charged with crimes related to the events of Jan. 6. Dunn and Gonell also point to a comment Trump made in which he said he would be a \"dictator\" his first day in office and other comments hinting at political violence if he does not win back the presidency.\n\n\"He's told us what he'll do,\" Dunn said. \"He's going to fire all the generals and appoint his loyalists. He said he'll be a dictator on day one. He constantly talks about going after his political opponents. He's told us what type of president he'll be. He cozies up with dictators. If he wins, it could be the possibility that this could be our last free and fair election.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to specific questions about Dunn and Gonell's remarks. Instead, the campaign issued a statement attacking Biden saying Biden and Democrats have turned \"great American cities into cesspools of bloodshed and crime\" and that his immigration policies have allowed \"(10) million illegal criminals to invade our country.\"\n\n\"Exactly one candidate supports law and order and will empower local law enforcement, and that's President Donald J. Trump,\" Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. \"On day one, President Trump will secure the border and empower local law enforcement to arrest criminals and deport illegal aliens.\"\n\nDunn and Gonell refuted similar claims made by Trump and Republicans about their record on crime during their interview in Erie, saying that he's used police officers from across the country for \"photo ops\" and praised those who have taken a political stand he favors.\n\nGonell said that not once has Trump or many of his allies sought to be photographed with the Capitol Police who risked their lives on Jan. 6. They've been \"indifferent\" to those officers and have even allowed their supporters to continue calling those officers \"traitors,\" among other things.\n\n\"It's very disingenuous of those people,\" Gonell said.\n\nGonell emigrated from the Dominican Republic with his mother when he was 12. He not only became a naturalized U.S. citizen, but also joined the U.S. Army Reserves, serving in Iraq. In 2006, he became a U.S. Capitol Police officer.\n\nOn Jan. 6, 2021, Gonell was protecting the West Terrance of the U.S. Capitol Building as angry Trump supporters marched from the Ellipse, where Trump had addressed them. Gonell suffered injuries to his hands, left shoulder, left calf and right foot while protecting the Capitol. He also endured threats from rioters who said he should be executed and called him a traitor. He required two surgeries to recover from his injuries.\n\nHe still suffers from the trauma of that day.\n\n\"I had a career as a law enforcement officer,\" he said. \"I passed the sergeant's test back in 2018. I was lined up for another promotion as a lieutenant, and I did not fulfill that because of the injuries that pretty much forced me to separate (from service) from that day. I had two surgeries on my body. I have a metal plate on my right foot. My left shoulder is still messed up. I have limitations, but the mental health (issues are) still there, the moral injury, because at the end of the day, we did what we were supposed to do. We kept our oath, we protected the members of Congress so they could come back and fulfill their duties.\"\n\nDunn was initially outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, but was called inside once it had been breached by rioters. He had to protect a stairwell and an area near then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's office. His hands were bloodied from fighting with rioters.\n\n\"It's hard to have a flashback of something that's never really left,\" Dunn said. \"It's not as bad as it was, my mental health. I've gotten tremendously better because I've tried to turn my anger into action.\"\n\nDunn ran for the House seat vacated by U.S. Rep. John Sarbanes of Maryland at the end of 2023, but came up short May 14 in a crowded Democratic primary.\n\nMatthew Rink can be reached at mrink@timesnews.com or on X at @ETNRink.", "source": {"uri":

He calls the people who attacked our capital 'patriots.' He called the men and women who died serving our country 'suckers and losers.'\"\n\nDunn, who made an unsuccessful bid for Congress in Maryland this year, clashed with Jan. 6 rioters as he helped guard former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's office that day.\n\n\"This is about democracy versus dictatorship,\" Dunn said of the 2024 election. \"The choice could not be more clear.\"\n\nSgt. Aquilino Gonell, an Army veteran, described the injuries he received on January 6, including being beaten with a flagpole, which he said required two surgeries. Gonell resigned from the Capitol Police in 2022.\n\nHe criticized Trump for referring to the people who participated in the attack on the Capitol as \"hostages\" and \"political prisoners,\" noting that Trump \"plays footage of that awful day at his rallies now.\"\n\n\"We were assaulted and beaten by a mob who believed Donald Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen,\" Gonell said.\n\nThe officers' appearance in Pittsburgh comes a few days after Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts at his hush-money trial in New York. Trump is scheduled to be sentenced July 11, just a few days before the Republican National Convention begins. He has said he plans to appeal the verdict.\n\nTrump found guilty on 34 felony counts in NY hush money trial\n\nTrump has called the people who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 \"patriots\" at his campaign rallies, and argues they have been treated unfairly. He has said he plans to pardon them if he wins another term in office.\n\nIn February, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals denied Trump's request to throw out federal charges accusing him of lying to and encouraging his supporters ahead of the Jan. 6 attack. Trump and his attorneys had argued the case should be dismissed because Trump was acting in his official capacity as president and therefore had immunity. The U.S. Supreme Court is considering Trump's appeal in the case.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Tuesday.\n\nGonell and Dunn also had harsh words for the members of Congress, many of whom were helped to safety by Capitol Police on Jan, 6, for supporting the rioters in the months and years since. \"The day that we testified [before the Jan. 6 committee], they were outside the D.C. jail protesting that those guys be released,\" Dunn said.\n\n\"The only reason they're able to make those statements is because they were able to escape, with the time and effort we put in that day,\" Gonell said, adding the lack of support for the officers was \"disappointing.\"\n\nThe two officers were introduced at Tuesday's press conference by Lindsey Scott, an Iraq War veteran who described herself as a former \"John McCain Republican,\" but said she switched her registration to the Democratic Party out of disgust after Jan. 6. \"The threat that Trump poses to our democracy is far from gone,\" Scott said. \"Trump has pledged to be a dictator on day one. Has a dictator ever willingly given up power?\"\n\nTuesday's appearance was the first of several campaign events that Dunn and Gonell are planning across Pennsylvania this week. The two have stumped for Biden in other battleground states, and appeared outside the courtroom in New York City ahead of the guilty verdict in Trump's hush money trial.", "source": {"uri":

Aquilino Gonell will visit Pittsburgh on Tuesday as part of an event with President Joe Biden's campaign. The officers will highlight Trump's alleged role and will \"raise the alarm about the threat\" Trump poses to American democracy and about the ongoing threat of political violence, according a news release.\n\nDunn served 15 years for the U.S. Capitol Police and suffered minor injuries in the incident. He advocated for the creation of the Jan. 6 committee to investigate the attack. He ran as a Democrat for a congressional seat in Maryland this year but lost in the primary.\n\n\"The future of democracy is at stake in this election,\" Dunn said in a statement.\n\nGonell is a former Capitol officer and an Army veteran.

His injuries were part of the reason he resigned from the Capitol Police in 2022.\n\nThe officers are set to meet with elected officials and community leaders, advocates against political violence and community members. After the Pittsburgh stop, the officers plan to travel to Philadelphia, Harrisburg, Erie and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre area.\n\nThe Pittsburgh stop comes less than a week after Trump was convicted in a New York court on 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection with a scheme to hide potentially embarrassing stories during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump has said the trial was \"rigged\" and politically motivated. He has vowed to appeal the conviction.\n\nThe former president also has been charged in federal court, accused of conspiring to defraud the U.S. by illegally subverting the results of the 2020 presidential election and the peaceful transfer of power. A trial has not been set, and the U.S. Supreme Court is considering Trump's appeal to those charges.\n\nAt political rallies, Trump has said people arrested for storming the Capitol have been treated unfairly, and he has called them \"patriots.\"\n\nMore than 1,300 people have been charged with federal crimes in the attack on the Capitol, ranging from misdemeanor offenses such as trespassing to felonies like assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.\n\nSince Trump's conviction, polls have moved slightly in Biden's direction. An ABC News/Ipsos poll found that 49% of Americans think Trump should end his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nPennsylvania political experts are mixed on what the impact of Trump's conviction could be

Both officers testified before the January 6th Select Committee in the U.S. House and have since resigned from the Capitol police force. They attended a news conference at the state Capitol on Wednesday.\n\n\"I'm here for those who put their lives on the line to protect our capital on January 6, 2021,\" Gonell said. \"Those of us in uniform were assaulted and beaten by the mob who believed Donald Trump's lies that the 2020 election were stolen.\"\n\nAquilino and Gonell are part of the Biden campaign's effort to make preserving American democracy a key narrative ahead of the election this fall. Special Counsel Jack Smith with the Department of Justice indicted Trump on four federal charges for his attempt to remain in office despite losing the 2020 election. It is unlikely the case will go to trial before voters cast their ballots.\n\n\"Donald Trump is the greatest threat to our democracy and the safety of communities across the country today. He has encouraged and continues to encourage political violence,\" Dunn said.\n\nSteven Levitsky, a government and Latin American studies professor at Harvard University, said the officers' assessments line up with historical studies about democratic backsliding and turns toward authoritarianism.\n\n\"Politicians who refuse to accept election results or who in any way condone or encourage political violence are threats to democracy. And Donald Trump has done both,\" Levitsky said.\n\nPresident Biden has never challenged fairly decided election results and has repeatedly condemned political violence, including the riots in which Gonell and Dunn were attacked and which were an attempt to keep the duly elected Biden out of office.\n\nGonell and Dunn quoted Trump throughout their speeches, focusing on his rhetoric and support for the people who stormed the Capitol rather than on any Biden policies.\n\n\"Although most of my physical injuries had healed, the scar of that day remains seared in my mind. My PTSD and moral injuries remain,\" Gonell, who immigrated to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic when he was a child, said. \"Donald Trump calls the people who injure me and attack our Capitol 'hostages, patriots, and political prisoners.'\"\n\nConservative politicians have a long history of using militarized language dating back to the height of anti-communist rhetoric but until recently that had not spilled over into violence, according to University of Alabama communications professor A.J. Bauer. Right wing violence associated with white supremacy also has a long history, but those movements were fringe.\n\n\"Until more recently, you haven't necessarily seen what we could call mainstream politicians, right, elected officials who are in high positions of power, calling on conservative grassroots to engage in violent forms of protest,\" Bauer said. \"I think that is one thing that helps contribute to the fact that we saw a January 6th occur the way that it did.\"\n\nWhen political elites uniformly condemn political violence, it can reaffirm support for democratic institutions, Levitsky said, pointing to the attempted 1981 coup in Spain. The almost 1,400 arrests of people who participated in the Jan. 6 riots -- including at least 101 people from Pennsylvania -- have likely helped curb political violence since 2021, Levitsky said.\n\nBut in the U.S. today, condemnation of anti-democratic political violence is split along party lines.", "source": {"uri": "witf.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WITF"}, "authors": [],

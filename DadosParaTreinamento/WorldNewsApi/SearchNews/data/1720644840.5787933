{"id": 231279872, "title": "Here&#39;s What Mars in Taurus Means for You, Based on Your Zodiac Sign", "text": "It's time for a planetary transit! Mars is making its way through the fields of Taurus beginning on June 9 until July 20, 2024. PEOPLE's resident astrologer Kyle Thomas says \"we will feel more cautious in our approach to decisions\" during this time. In addition, Thomas says \"we will collectively feel more determined, stubborn and focused on longevity and long-lasting results.\" He emphasizes financial matters, particularly noting its an \"excellent time\" to \"harness this fiery strength\" to get money matters in order. Mars, the red planet of passion and drive, is \"very unique\" when it resides in Taurus, \"because this zodiac sign is known to be its detriment where it is weakened,\" Thomas explains. \"The planet's energy loves to race headfirst into everything \u2014 but in Taurus, Mars takes on a new mask.\" Thomas says we must \"balance and negotiate\" this energetic shift by \"working steadily forward rather than following our primal enthusiasm.\" This transit makes us \"more determined and concentrated\" \u2014 so if we take action precisely, he says \"we can build strong structures personally and professionally in the long term.\" Taurus is one of the \"most lusty zodiac signs,\" the bull. Thomas says this will \"enflame everyone\u2019s insatiable sexual appetite, as well as a hedonistic desire for food, pleasure and indulgence.\" However, he warns people \"may become more stubborn and defensive.\" This is because Taurus is a \"fixed Earth sign.\" He explains, \"We will be set in our ways and could butt heads with people who oppose us. We will want to follow our tried and true methods and will resist change at all costs.\" Read on for how Mars in Taurus could affect your zodiac sign, per Kyle Thomas' predictions! Aries (March 21-April 19) Money matters now, Aries! Your planetary ruler, Mars, is firing up your money sector. \"You may have incredible focus and drive to make more money,\" says Thomas. \"So get moving along!\" At the same time, he says to \"be aware this could intensely increase your expenses.\" Therefore, he advises \"to focus on your budget.\" Harness this energy now! Taurus (April 20-May 20) You\u2019re on fire, Taurus! You have more energy than you\u2019ve had in two years \u2014 and lucky for you, Thomas says \"you are setting up another two-year cycle during this time.\" Mars will unleash \"immense strength, courage and firepower\" within you, he predicts, meaning \"you can dominate anyone or anything in your path.\" Be bold and build toward all of your most important personal or professional projects. Thomas says \"you'll also be more magnetic, sexy and irresistible because of this energy.\" Take the lead in every possible way, Taurus! Gemini (May 21-June 20) Put your head down and concentrate, Gemini. Mars is energizing your sector of privacy and the subconscious. Thomas says this means you\u2019re likely to be \"busy brainstorming big plans you\u2019d like to set in motion later this year.\" You could also be hustling on projects behind-the-scenes, too! Elsewhere in his prediction, Thomas suggests that if you\u2019re feeling anxious, attacked from nowhere or in need of closure, \"now would be a great time to tackle your mental health.\" Cancer (June 21-July 22) The spotlight is on you, Cancer! Mars is bringing you a period of fun, socializing and bliss! \"Everyone will want to get a piece of you,\" says Thomas, so \"expect a ton of social activity as you connect with friends, acquaintances, followers and fans.\" Community engagement will be \"deeply fulfilling\" now and in the weeks ahead. Thomas says \"you could also be very active pursuing long-term goals, aspirations and projects.\" On a different note, Thomas predicts you may find your love life \"has an uptick.\" Perhaps you'll meet that special someone through an app \u2014 or even turn a friend into a romantic partner! Leo (July 23-Aug. 22) Let's get down to business, Leo! \"You\u2019re fired up for professional growth,\" says Thomas, who notes that \"now is a great period to chase your ambitions and climb up the ladder with Mars highlighting your career sector.\" \"This could bring awards, promotions, new job offers or favorable press if you seize the day,\" he puts forth. \"Fight to rise higher and you\u2019ll make significant progress now.\" Virgo (Aug. 23- Sept. 22) Prepare to soar high, Virgo! \"Mars is sizzling through your expansion zone,\" says Thomas. You\u2019re in a period where you can \"step outside of your comfort zone\" and \u201cshake it up\u201d physically, mentally, spiritually or academically. Maybe, it's by \"expressing yourself differently.\" This period could also \"show you're hard at work\" on a particular project. Perhaps, he says it's one that's related to \"academics, spirituality, international business, legalities or the media.\" Libra (Sept. 23-Oct. 22) Mars is firing up your sector of intimacy, Libra! \"Your urge to merge and embrace sex and sensuality is through the roof,\" says Thomas. \"You will be deeply focused on the give and take in your relationships,\" he notes. Tension, however, \"could be apparent now\" if you\u2019re not on the same page. Elsewhere in his prediction, Thomas says this planetary transit may instead be \"drawing your attention to settlements, investments, assets or large-money matters.\" He adds, \"You could be spending on big-ticket items as a result.\" Scorpio (Oct. 23-Nov. 21) Mars is sizzling across the sky before you in your partnership zone, Scorpio. Thomas says \"you can make tremendous progress working alongside someone in love, business or collaboration\" as a result of this positioning. \"Healthy relationships will see increased passion, attraction and excitement,\" he predicts. \"Couples could be making long-term plans and promises.\" If you and your partner are not on the same page, however, he says \"you'll notice conflict.\" Single and ready to mingle? Thomas says to \"use this energy\" to put yourself out there and find someone with \"longterm potential.\" Sagittarius (Nov. 21-Dec. 21) Thomas predicts you're going to be \"juggling a million projects, plans and responsibilities,\" Sagittarius! Mars is \"roaring through\" your sector of daily affairs, employment and routines. \"You\u2019ll likely be busier than ever tackling everything,\" he puts forth. If out of work or looking to take more on, Thomas says you\u2019re in luck! He advises you \"hustle now to find more job offers, clients or projects.\" Lastly, Thomas says this energy \"turns attention to physical health and is a great period to focus on your exercise, diet and fitness routines too.\" Capricorn (Dec. 22-Jan. 19) Mars is reigniting your sector of passion, Capricorn! \"You\u2019re in the mood for fun, pleasure, fertility, creativity and romance,\" says Thomas. \"Pay attention because this is one of the most important periods of the year for singles to meet a soulmate or line up new romantic options,\" he continues. \"Couples can spice up their chemistry!\" If you\u2019re a creative, Thomas says \"you will be inspired\" around this transit. If you have children or wish to, he says \"this will also bring a great deal of activity around them.\" Hobbies, recreation, sports and socializing \"will also be enjoyable.\" Aquarius (Jan. 20-Feb. 18) Home is where the heart is, Aquarius! \"You may have a focus to redecorate, renovate or move,\" says Thomas. \"Real estate matters will also see a big spotlight,\" he adds. \"Lastly, you may notice tension around family or your kindred or instead be required to step in to help one of them.\" Pisces (Feb. 19-March 20) A change of pace is here, Pisces! \"You\u2019re also going to notice that your mind is filled with wondrous ideas,\" notes Thomas. As Mars energizes your communication and travel sector, he says \"you\u2019ll find that you\u2019re focused on growth and movement.\" You could be \"very invested\" in an advertising, writing, speaking or marketing project. You could also be just as focused on traveling more, \"even if you\u2019re spicing up your routine and visiting nearby destinations or having a staycation in your town,\" says Thomas. \"Note that learning and opening up your perspective are top priorities, too.\" Kyle Thomas \u2014 who's known for his cosmic guidance for celebrities, business executives and prominent influencers \u2014 is a celebrity astrologer who writes PEOPLE's weekly horoscopes.

These are on top of the EU's standard 10% duty on car imports.\n\nCompanies deemed to have cooperated with the anti-subsidy investigation, including western carmakers Tesla and BMW, will be subject to 20.8% tariffs and those that did not cooperate a rate of 37.6%.\n\nHIGHER PRICES\n\nChinese EV makers will have to decide whether to absorb the tariffs or raise their prices to cover the billions of dollars in new costs at European borders.\n\n\"Chinese automakers are desperate to expand their sales outside of China since the domestic price war is taking its toll,\" said Tu Le, founder of consultancy Sino Auto Insights.\n\nIncreased EV costs for European consumers would undermine the EU's goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, opponents of the tariffs say.\n\nChinese brands MG and Nio suggested on Thursday they might raise prices in Europe later this year. Tesla said last month it planned to increase the prices of its Model 3.\n\nThe prospect of duties may spur Chinese automakers to invest in factories in Europe, although labour and manufacturing costs are higher than in China.\n\nOn Thursday, Xpeng became the latest EV maker to consider setting up manufacturing in the region to avoid the tariffs.\n\nEurope's biggest carmaker Volkswagen was swift to criticise Thursday's announcement.\n\n\"The negative effects of this decision outweigh any benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry,\" a Volkswagen spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nAuto industry executives have warned against the tariffs, fearful of counter-measures that could affect the competitiveness of their cars in China where they are already struggling to keep up with a growing number of domestic competitors.\n\nGerman carmakers made a third of their sales last year in China.\n\nThe Commission has estimated Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8% from below 1% in 2019 and could reach 15% in 2025. It says prices are typically 20% below those of EU-made models.\n\nWAVERING EU SUPPORT\n\nEuropean policymakers are keen to avoid a repeat of what happened with solar panels a decade ago, when the EU took limited action to curb Chinese imports and many European manufacturers collapsed. The EU launched its anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs last October.\n\nThe issue will be put to EU members in an advisory vote in the coming weeks, the first official test of support in the Commission's case, which is the first trade case of this kind.\n\nAlthough the Commission initiated its investigation without an industry complaint, members are wavering over whether to back the additional tariffs, highlighting Brussels' challenge in getting support for the case.\n\nThe Chinese Passenger Car Association has said the tariffs will have a modest impact on the majority of Chinese firms.\n\nThe rates are far lower than the 100% tariff Washington plans to apply to Chinese EV imports from August.", "source": {"uri": "dealstreetasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The executive made slight adjustments after companies identified minor calculation errors in the initial disclosure.\n\nBeijing said then it would take \"all necessary measures\" to safeguard China's interests.\n\nThese could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of products such as cognac or pork.\n\nEU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said there is no basis for China to retaliate.\n\n\"Our aim is to ... ensure fair competition and level playing field,\" he said in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\nThe EU anti-subsidy investigation has nearly four more months to run.\n\nAt the end of it, the Commission, the EU's executive arm, could propose \"definite duties\", typically applying for five years, on which EU members would vote.\n\n\"Those talks with China are ongoing and indeed should a mutually beneficial solution emerge, we can also find ways not to apply at the end of the day the tariffs,\" Dombrovskis said.\n\n\"But it is very clear this solution (would) need to solve that market distortion that we are currently having ... and it needs to be market compliant.\"\n\nChina's commerce ministry said on Thursday both sides have so far held several rounds of technical talks over tariffs on the issue.\n\n\"We hope that the European and Chinese sides will move in the same direction, show sincerity, and push forward with the consultation process as soon as possible,\" He Yadong, a ministry spokesperson, said.\n\nBYD will face duties of 17.4%, Geely 19.9% and SAIC 37.6%, the EU said on Thursday.

38%", "body": "Brussels, Belgium -- The European Union on Thursday slapped extra provisional duties of up to 38 percent on Chinese electric car imports because of \"unfair\" state subsidies, despite Beijing's warnings the move would unleash a trade war.\n\nA European Commission probe launched last year concluded that state subsidies for Chinese EV manufacturers were unfairly undercutting European rivals -- which Brussels wants to shield as they make the transition from thermal to electric power.\n\nThe Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the EU slammed the tariffs, coming on top of current import duties of 10 percent, as \"politically-motivated\" and \"protectionist\", while voicing hope the dispute could yet be resolved through dialogue.\n\nREAD: China warns EU tariffs on EVs would 'harm' Europe's interests\n\nEuropeans themselves are split on the move, with Germany and its homegrown auto champions, who do significant trade with China, fearing it will do more harm than good if it leads to a clampdown on EU exports as Beijing has already threatened.\n\nGerman auto giant Volkswagen slammed the move as \"detrimental\" while the head of BMW said the tariff battle \"leads to a dead end\".\n\nFrance and Italy have pushed for tariffs on Chinese EVs -- whose market share in the EU has skyrocketed -- but Sweden like Germany has expressed reservations, while Hungary is outright opposed.\n\nThe provisional tariffs will kick in from Friday, with definitive duties to take effect in November for a period of five years, pending a vote by the EU's 27 member states.\n\n\"Our investigation... concluded that the battery electric vehicles produced in China benefit from unfair subsidization, which is causing a threat of economic injury to the EU's own electric car makers,\" the EU's trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said.\n\nREAD: China premier calls to 'oppose decoupling' at economic forum\n\nIn response, the commission imposed provisional duties on major Chinese manufacturers including 17.4 percent for market major BYD, 19.9 percent for Geely and 37.6 percent for SAIC.\n\nOther producers in China that cooperated with the EU will face a tariff of 20.8 percent, while those that did not cooperate would be subject to the maximum 37.6 percent duty.\n\nUS tech billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla -- which manufactures in China -- is the only electric automaker that has asked Brussels for its own duty rate, to be calculated based on evidence it has submitted.\n\n'Intensive' talks with China\n\nThe move comes despite the opening of talks between Chinese and EU trade officials, but Brussels will continue \"to engage intensively with China on a mutually acceptable solution\", trade chief Dombrovskis said.\n\nChina's electric car maker Nio said it still hoped for a resolution with the EU, while fellow EV maker XPeng said it would \"find ways to minimise the impact on consumers\" without changing its international strategy.\n\nEU officials have indicated that, should a negotiated solution emerge, they may not ultimately need to levy the tariffs.\n\nREAD: Chinese firms eye Morocco to cash in on US electric vehicle subsidies\n\nBut Dombrovskis cautioned that \"any negotiated outcome to our investigation must clearly and fully address EU concerns and be in respect of WTO rules.\"\n\nBeijing has already signalled its readiness to retaliate by launching an anti-dumping probe last month into pork imports, threatening Spanish exports, and Chinese media suggest further probes could be in the works.\n\nChinese officials have also railed against EU investigations targeting state subsidies in the green tech sector, including wind turbines and solar panels.\n\nExpected cut to imports\n\nThe United States has already hiked customs duties on Chinese electric cars to 100 percent, while Canada is considering similar action.\n\nBut Brussels faces a delicate balancing act as it seeks to defend Europe's auto industry -- the jewel in its industrial crown -- while both avoiding a damaging showdown with China and meeting its targets for slashing carbon emissions.\n\nThe EU aims for Europeans to switch massively to electric vehicles as it plans to outlaw the sale of new fossil fuel-powered cars from 2035.\n\nChinese-made EVs' market share in the EU climbed from around three percent to more than 20 percent in the past three years, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.\n\nChinese brands account for around eight percent of that share, it said.\n\nGerman displeasure\n\nGermany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy, alongside Austrian institutes, predicted the provisional higher taxes would reduce vehicle imports from China by 42 percent. They added that electric car prices could rise by an average of 0.3 to 0.9 percent in the EU.\n\nGerman auto manufacturers fear any retaliation could hurt their activities in China, and Germany's Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck visited Beijing last month on an 11th hour mission to avert a damaging trade war.\n\nDuties were \"generally not suitable for strengthening the competitiveness of the European automotive industry in the long term -- we reject them\", Volkswagen said in a statement.

They added that electric car prices could rise by an average of 0.3 to 0.9 percent in the EU.\n\nGerman auto manufacturers fear any retaliation could hurt their activities in China, and Germany's Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck visited Beijing last month on an 11th-hour mission to avert a damaging trade war.\n\nDuties were \"generally not suitable for strengthening the competitiveness of the European automotive industry in the long term -- we reject them\", Volkswagen said in a statement.

The decision could escalate trade tensions with China, which may respond with retaliatory tariffs. Technical talks are ongoing to resolve the issue.\n\nThe European Union will impose tariffs of up to 37.6% from Friday on imports of electric vehicles made in China, EU officials said on Thursday, ratcheting up trade tension with Beijing. There is however a four-month window during which the tariffs are only provisional and intensive talks are expected to continue between the two sides.\n\nThe European Commission's provisional duties of between 17.4% and 37.6% without backdating are designed to prevent what its president Ursula von der Leyen has said is a threatened flood of cheap EVs built state subsidies. The rates are almost exactly the same as those announced by the Commission on June 12. The executive made slight adjustments after companies identified minor calculation errors in the initial disclosure.\n\nBeijing said then it would take \"all necessary measures\" to safeguard China's interests. These could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of products such as cognac or pork.\n\nThe EU anti-subsidy investigation has nearly four more months to run. At the end of it, the Commission, the EU's executive arm, could propose \"definite duties\", typically applying for five years, on which EU members would vote.\n\nChina's commerce ministry said on Thursday both sides have so far held several rounds of technical talks over tariffs on the issue. \"There is still a four-month window before arbitration, and we hope that the European and Chinese sides will move in the same direction, show sincerity, and push forward with the consultation process as soon as possible,\" He Yadong, a ministry spokesperson, said.\n\nBYD will face duties of 17.4%, Geely 19.9% and SAIC 37.6%, the EU said on Thursday. These are on top of the EU's standard 10% duty on car imports. Companies deemed by the EU to have cooperated with the anti-subsidy investigation, including western carmakers Tesla and BMW, will be subject to 20.8% tariffs and those that did not cooperate a rate of 37.6%. The Commission has estimated Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8% from below 1% in 2019 and could reach 15% in 2025. It says prices are typically 20% below those of EU-made models.\n\nEuropean policymakers are keen to avoid a repeat of what happened with solar panels a decade ago, when the EU took only limited action to curb Chinese imports and many European manufacturers collapsed. The EU launched its anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese EVs last October. The Chinese Passenger Car Association has said the tariffs will have only a modest impact on the majority of Chinese firms.\n\nThe rates are far lower than the 100% tariff Washington plans to apply to Chinese EV imports from August.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@devdiscourse.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sino-Soviet split"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ursula von der Leyen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BYD Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SAIC Motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geely", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Economic Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import and Export", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/03_07_2024_13_59_14_0144224.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 955, "textEnd": 962}], "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The executive made slight adjustments after companies identified minor calculation errors in the initial disclosure.\n\nBeijing said then it would take \"all necessary measures\" to safeguard China's interests.\n\nThese could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of products such as cognac or pork.\n\nThe EU anti-subsidy investigation has nearly four more months to run.\n\nAt the end of it, the Commission, the EU's executive arm, could propose \"definite duties\", typically applying for five years, on which EU members would vote.\n\nChina's commerce ministry said today that both sides have so far held several rounds of technical talks over tariffs on the issue.\n\n\"There is still a four-month window before arbitration, and we hope that the European and Chinese sides will move in the same direction, show sincerity, and push forward with the consultation process as soon as possible,\" He Yadong, a ministry spokesperson, said.\n\nBYD will face duties of 17.4%, Geely 19.9% and SAIC 37.6%, the EU said today.

"EU adopts additional tariffs of up to 38% on Chinese electric vehicles", "body": "The European Union on Thursday announced the provisional adoption of additional countervailing duties of up to 38% on Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers, saying they benefit from \"unfair\" subsidies.\n\nThese subsidies represent a \"threat of economic injury to European producers\", the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, said in a statement.\n\nThe new tariffs will apply from 5 July.\n\nThe EU intends to adopt a final measure in November, but until then it will hold talks with China in search of a solution, although the Chinese authorities have already warned that they will apply retaliatory measures.\n\nThe Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the EU (CCCEU) denounced Thursday's decision as a \"protectionist measure\".\n\nThe body, which represents more than 1,000 Chinese companies in the EU, said it was \"deeply disappointed and dissatisfied\" with the decision announced on Thursday.\n\nChinese electric car company NIO, which produces high-end models, said in a note that it hopes the Asian giant and the EU \"reach a solution\" to the trade dispute.\n\nMeanwhile, XPeng told AFP that it \"will not change its strategy of exploring foreign markets\" and that it hopes to find \"ways to minimise the impact on consumers\".\n\nIn its statement, the European Commission pointed out that the adoption of these provisional and additional tariffs is the result of a nine-month investigation.\n\nThat investigation concluded that China's electric car value chain \"benefits from unfair subsidies, which is causing a threat of economic injury to EU producers\".\n\nIt therefore announced the provisional adoption of tariffs of 17.4% for BYD and 19.9% for Geely, as well as customs duties of 37.6% for SAIC.\n\nOther electric car producers in China that cooperated in the investigation are subject to average tariffs of 20.8%, while for non-cooperating companies this amounts to 37.6%.\n\nIn May, the European Commission had already threatened to increase tariffs to 38%, on top of the current import duties of 10%.\n\nThe move comes despite trade talks between China and the EU on 22 June.\n\nAccording to EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU will continue to \"work intensively with China on a mutually acceptable solution\".\n\n\"Any negotiated outcome of our investigation must clearly and fully address the EU's concerns and respect World Trade Organisation rules,\" the official said in a note.\n\nLast month, China opened an investigation into pork imports, threatening Spanish exports.\n\nChinese officials have also criticised investigations targeting state subsidies in the green technology sector, including wind turbines and solar panels.\n\nThe EU is seeking to make electric vehicles more widespread, as the bloc will ban the sale of new cars powered by fossil fuel engines from 2035.\n\nAt the same time, it aims to protect its car industry.\n\nHowever, Germany, an automotive powerhouse and a major trading partner of the Asian giant, fears that the high tariffs will generate retaliatory tariffs that will hit its activities in the Chinese market.\n\nOn Thursday, German car giant Volkswagen rejected the high tariffs announced by the EU as \"harmful\".\n\n\"The negative effects of this decision outweigh the potential benefits for the European automotive industry and in particular for Germany,\" the group said.\n\nElectric vehicles from China account for almost 22% of the European market, up from 3% just three years ago, according to automotive industry estimates.", "source": {"uri": "atalayar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Atalayar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

EU officials fear that without action a vital European industry that employs 2.5 million people and 10.3 million in the wider supply chain could be seriously hurt, just as the EU saw its solar-panel companies lose out to subsidised Chinese competitors.\n\nRelated: Are electric cars too heavy for roads, bridges and car parks?\n\nFrom Friday, importers of Chinese vehicles into the EU will be required to give bank guarantees to customs officers to pay the duties. Money will only be collected if the commission concludes in the autumn that the car industry would have been harmed without these duties.\n\nA final decision on definitive duties - which would be in force for five years - will only be taken in the autumn, pending a vote by the EU's 27 member states.\n\nUnder the provisional measures, China's BYD, which vies with Tesla for the spot of the world's largest producer of electric vehicles, faces a tariff of 17.4%; Geely will pay 19.9% and SAIC 37.6%.\n\nThe rates - calculated according to total subsides and company turnover - have been modestly adjusted downwards in most cases since the required pre-disclosure of tariffs last month, after technical talks with the companies.\n\nThe tariffs enter into force despite staunch opposition from Germany, Europe's largest exporter to China. The Germany government has called for an \"amicable solution\", but also said \"serious movement is needed on the Chinese side\".\n\nGerman officials do not expect to reverse the measures, which can only be overturned by a weighted majority of 15 EU member states representing 65% of the union's population.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

However, any solution must address the current market distortions and be compliant with market regulations. China's commerce ministry confirmed that several rounds of technical talks have already taken place, expressing hope for sincere and expedited progress in consultations.\n\nThe announced tariffs will affect major Chinese automakers: BYD faces duties of 17.4%, Geely 19.9%, and SAIC 37.6%. These duties are in addition to the EU's standard 10% import duty on cars. Western carmakers like Tesla and BMW, which cooperated with the investigation, will be subject to 20.8% tariffs, while non-cooperative companies face the maximum rate of 37.6%.\n\nVolkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, quickly criticized the decision, stating that the negative impacts outweigh any potential benefits for the European and particularly the German automotive industry. Industry executives have expressed concerns about counter-tariffs and other retaliatory measures that could affect their competitiveness in China, where they are already struggling against a growing number of domestic competitors in the EV market. Notably, German carmakers generated a third of their sales in China last year.\n\nThe European Commission estimates that Chinese brands' share of the EU market has increased from below 1% in 2019 to 8%, and could reach 15% by 2025, with prices typically 20% lower than EU-made models.

Here's what to know", "body": "Europe is slapping tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles -- for now. Here's what to know\n\nDAVID McHUGH and KEN MORITSUGU\n\nJuly 4, 2024 at 4:26 PM\n\nFRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Union is imposing sharply higher customs duties on electric vehicles imported from China. EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe higher duties go into effect on Friday, pending a final decision in four month's time.\n\nHere are some basic facts about the EU's planned customs duties:\n\nWhat did the European Union do?\n\nAfter an eight-month investigation, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, found that companies making electric cars in China benefit from massive government help that means they can undercut rivals in the EU on prices, take a big market share and threaten European jobs.\n\nIt announced the higher duties on June 12 and they go into effect from Friday. The duties are provisional, meaning they will be totaled up but won't need to be paid until they're confirmed by a vote of EU governments before Nov. 2. The EU will only collect the duties if there's a further finding that the European auto industry would have suffered material harm without them.\n\nThat gives the EU and the Chinese government time to negotiate. Talks have been held between Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner for the economy, and Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao, as well as at the level of technical experts.\n\nThe higher duties are not a goal in themselves but \"a means to correct an imbalance,\" commission spokesman Eric Mamer said Thursday. \"We certainly hope we can come to a solution which would allow us not to have to move forward on this path.\"\n\nThe rates, if applied, would be: 17.4% on cars from BYD, 19.9% on those from Geely and 37.6% for vehicles exported by China's state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden's Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain's MG, one of Europe's bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China including Western companies such as Volkswagen, BMW and Tesla would be subject to duties of at least 20.8%. The commission mentioned that Tesla might get an \"individually calculated\" rate if duties are definitively imposed.\n\nUnder EU rules it's possible -- though at present it seems unlikely -- that the higher duties could be blocked ahead of the Nov. 2 effective date by vote of what the EU calls a \"qualified majority\" of countries. That means at least 15 of the 27 EU member governments representing at least 65% of the bloc's population.\n\nWhy did the commission take action?\n\nChinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, the commission said, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices.\n\nThe commission says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies all along the chain of production, from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and below-interest financing from state-controlled banks.\n\nThe rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU's ability to produce its own green technology needed to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million workers at risk in the auto industry and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production.\n\nSubsidized solar panels from China have wiped out European producers -- an experience that European governments don't want to see repeated with their auto industry.\n\nUnusually, the commission acted on its own, without a complaint from the European auto industry. Industry leaders and Germany, home to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have been skeptics about the subsidy investigation. That's because many of the cars that will be hit with tariffs are made by European companies, and because China could retaliate against the auto industry or in other areas.\n\nHow do the EU tariffs compare to ones announced by the U.S.?\n\nThe Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25%. At that level, the U.S. tariffs block virtually all Chinese EV imports.\n\nThat's not what Europe is trying to do.\n\nEU officials want affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve their goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 -- but without the subsidies EU leaders see as unfair competition\n\nThe planned tariffs are aimed at leveling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese carmakers.\n\nEuropean countries subsidize electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all carmakers or distort the market in favor of one side.\n\nJust how cheap are Chinese EVs?\n\nChinese carmakers have learned to make electric vehicles cheaply amid ferocious price competition at home in the world's largest car market.\n\nBYD's Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of 21,769 euros ($23,370) in China but 41,990 euros ($45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium Group figures. The base model of BYD's compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for the equivalent of around $10,000 in China.\n\nWhat does this mean for European drivers and carmakers?\n\nIt's not clear what impact the duties will have on car prices. Chinese carmakers are able to make some cars so cheaply that they could absorb the duties in the form of lower profits instead of raising their prices.\n\nWhile consumers might benefit from cheaper Chinese cars in the short term, allowing unfair practices could eventually mean less competition and higher prices in the long term, the commission argues.\n\nCurrently, Chinese carmakers often sell their vehicles in Europe at much higher prices than the same cars fetch in China, meaning they are favoring profits over market share, even given their recent market gains. Five of BYD's six models would still earn a profit in Europe even at a 30% tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations.\n\nThe fear is Europe is that Chinese competitors will turn to lowering their prices closer to the ones they are charging in China. and gain an even bigger chunk of the market.\n\nHow is China likely to react?\n\nBeijing was sharply critical of the higher duties when they were announced, calling them \"a naked act of protectionism.\"\n\nOn Thursday, He Yadong, a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said that the two sides had held several rounds of technical consultations and noted that a final EU ruling won't be made for four months.\n\n\"It is hoped that the European side and the Chinese side will move in the same direction, show sincerity, expedite the consultation process and reach a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible on the basis of facts and rules,\" he said at a weekly media briefing in Beijing.\n\nHe also said that China hopes the EU will seriously listen to the voices of the European automakers and governments that have come out against the tariffs and avoid anti-subsidy measures that would harm cooperation between the Chinese and European auto industries.\n\nIt's not clear what agreement might look like. One move could be to agree on minimum prices for Chinese cars.\n\nChina could retaliate against European products such as pork or brandy imports, or against European luxury car imports.\n\nOver the longer term, Chinese carmakers could avoid tariffs by making cars in Europe. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, while Chery has a joint venture to build cars in Spain's Catalonia region.\n\n___\n\nMoritsugu reported from Beijing.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType":

Germany, whose carmakers made a third of their sales last year in China, wants to stop the tariffs, according to a government source, while France has been among the firmest backers. But a majority of countries are still weighing the pros and cons of the escalating trade spat, according to an informal poll by Reuters of EU governments.\n\nThe issue will be put to members in an advisory vote in the coming weeks, the first official test of support in a landmark case for the Commission. The EU initiated the probe without an industry complaint, the first such trade case of this kind. The bloc is set to confirm on Thursday provisional duties of up to 37.6 percent on Chinese brands such as BYD and SAIC, as well as on China-made models of Tesla and other western automakers. Carmakers are bracing for billions of dollars in new costs as a result, which analysts say could slow their European expansion. EU members will also vote in October if the Commission proposes multi-year tariffs at the end of its investigation. These would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" of at least 15 countries representing 65 percent of the EU population votes against them.\n\nFrance, Italy and Spain, with 40 percent of the EU population, have indicated they would back tariffs.\n\n\"Europe must defend itself if our companies are harmed and do not compete on equal terms,\" Spain's economy ministry said. However, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland and Poland were still debating the issue, official and government sources said, while Belgium has a caretaker government and the Dutch only got a government this week. Germany has stressed the need for a negotiated solution with Beijing. Its automakers have said tariffs are the wrong approach, with the negative effects outweighing any benefits. In a last-ditch effort to influence negotiation, its auto association on Wednesday urged Brussels to drop the tariffs.\n\nIncreasing the cost of EVs for consumers undermines the EU's goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, opponents say. Tesla has said it will hike prices. Beijing's retaliation could bring extra tariffs on EU exports of cognac, pork or luxury cars. The Commission says duties are needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies and the goal is a level playing field, not shutting Chinese car makers out, as the United States' planned 100 percent tariff is likely to do.\n\nTariffs could also give the EU leverage in negotiations with Beijing and push producers to make cars in the EU. Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of think-tank the European Centre for International Political Economy, said clear majorities either way could embolden tariff opponents or supporters. He added final positions at the end of the investigation will depend on what Beijing offers in negotiations.\n\n\"If we go to a vote then, it means negotiations have failed,\" he said. The EV investigation could just be the start for the EU as it toughens its stance on Beijing, as its green and tech companies trail global rivals, interviews with half a dozen trade experts show.\n\nThey point to a 712-page updated report on Chinese state interference and subsidies released in April as the strongest sign yet that Brussels means business. The document is by far the most extensive undertaken by the Commission, showing it has learned a lesson from an investigation into Chinese solar panels a decade ago, when it did not impose tariffs and the EU's own industry collapsed.\n\nIt offers evidence to back its assertions that China does not play by the same rules and includes research into a wider range of industries, beyond traditional ones such as steel, including semiconductors, telecom equipment and renewable energy. That leaves the door open to future cases. \"This is a report to set the scene and show how and why Europe is changing its policies,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, a senior fellow at Brussels-based economic think-tank Bruegel. -- Reuters", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kuwait Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@kuwaittimes.com", "name": "https", "type":

The EU initiated the probe without an industry complaint, the first such trade case of this kind.\n\nThe bloc is set to confirm on Thursday provisional duties of up to 37.6 percent on Chinese brands such as BYD, Geely and SAIC, as well as on China-made models of Tesla, BMW and other western automakers.\n\nEU members will also vote in October if the Commission proposes multi-year tariffs at the end of its investigation. These would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" if at least 15 countries representing 65 percent of the EU population votes against them.\n\nFrance, Italy and Spain, with 40 percent of the EU population, have indicated they would back tariffs.\n\n\"Europe must defend itself if our companies are harmed and do not compete on equal terms,\" Spain's economy ministry said.\n\nHowever, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland and Poland were still debating the issue, official and government sources said, while Belgium has a caretaker government and the Dutch only got a government this week.\n\nGermany has stressed the need for a negotiated solution with Beijing. Its automakers have said tariffs are the wrong approach, with the negative effects outweighing any benefits.\n\nIncreasing the cost of EVs for consumers undermines the EU's goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, opponents say. Tesla has said it will hike prices.\n\nBeijing's retaliation could bring extra tariffs on EU exports of cognac, pork or luxury cars.\n\nThe Commission says duties are needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies and the goal is a level playing field, not shutting Chinese car makers out, as the United States' planned 100 percent tariff is likely to do.\n\nTariffs could also give the EU leverage in negotiations with Beijing and push producers to make cars in the EU.\n\nHosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of thinktank the European Centre for International Political Economy, said clear majorities either way could embolden tariff opponents or supporters. He added final positions at the end of the investigation will depend on what Beijing offers in negotiations.\n\n\"If we go to a vote then, it means negotiations have failed,\" he said.\n\nThe EV investigation could just be the start for the EU as it toughens its stance on Beijing, as its green and tech companies trail global rivals, interviews with half a dozen trade experts show.\n\nThey point to a 712-page updated report on Chinese state interference and subsidies released in April as the strongest sign yet that Brussels means business.\n\nThe document is by far the most extensive undertaken by the Commission, showing it has learned a lesson from an investigation into Chinese solar panels a decade ago, when it did not impose tariffs and the EU's own industry collapsed.\n\nIt offers proof to back its assertions that China does not play by the same rules and includes research into a wider range of industries, beyond traditional ones such as steel, including semiconductors, telecom equipment and renewable energy.\n\nThat leaves the door open to future cases.\n\n\"This is a report to set the scene and show how and why Europe is changing its policies,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, a senior fellow at Brussels-based economic thinktank Bruegel. \"To be frank, it's also a message especially for the German chancellery.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType":

The executive made slight adjustments after companies identified minor calculation errors in the initial disclosure.\n\nBeijing said then it would take \"all necessary measures\" to safeguard China's interests.\n\nThese could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of products such as cognac or pork.\n\nThe EU anti-subsidy investigation has nearly four more months to run.\n\nAt the end of it, the Commission, the EU's executive arm, could propose \"definite duties\", typically applying for five years, on which EU members would vote.\n\nChina's commerce ministry said on Thursday both sides have so far held several rounds of technical talks over tariffs on the issue.\n\n\"There is still a four-month window before arbitration, and we hope that the European and Chinese sides will move in the same direction, show sincerity, and push forward with the consultation process as soon as possible,\" He Yadong, a ministry spokesperson, said.\n\nBYD will face duties of 17.4 per cent, Geely 19.9 per cent and SAIC 37.6 per cent, the EU said on Thursday. These are on top of the EU's standard 10 per cent duty on car imports.\n\nCompanies deemed by the EU to have cooperated with the anti-subsidy investigation, including western carmakers Tesla and BMW, will be subject to 20.8 per cent tariffs and those that did not cooperate a rate of 37.6 per cent. The Commission has estimated Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8 per cent from below 1 per cent in 2019 and could reach 15 per cent in 2025. It says prices are typically 20 per cent below those of EU-made models.\n\nEuropean policymakers are keen to avoid a repeat of what happened with solar panels a decade ago, when the EU took only limited action to curb Chinese imports and many European manufacturers collapsed.

The EU is the largest overseas market for China's EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy.\n\nEU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by \"unfair subsidisation\", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc.\n\nChina has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports.\n\nThe new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues.\n\nSo who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute?\n\nIt is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels.\n\nBy imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU's decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU.\n\nThe number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E).\n\nPatryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: \"I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46.\"\n\nT&E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG, could reach a market share of 20% by 2027.\n\nBut not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs.\n\nThey were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely.\n\nSAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of 37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4.\n\n\"The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe,\" says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm.\n\nFor Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: \"I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty.\"\n\nFor China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU.\n\nThat is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will \"give the automaker an advantage in the European market\".\n\nLu\u00eds Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car.\n\nBut, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because \"other brands would also be affected\".\n\nGeely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%.\n\nAccording to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will \"still export to the EU profitably\" but \"its profits will be significantly reduced.\"\n\nOther firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU.\n\nThose deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%.\n\nUS-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation.\n\nStill, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs.\n\nLast year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y.\n\nMr Koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the car's high-tech features, such as the large touch screen.\n\n\"Price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium German brands,\" Mr Koopmann says.\n\n\"If the tariffs had been in place, they would have always affected my decision.\"\n\nWhile some China-based exporters will be better off than others, it is clear from the European Commission's plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to Europe.\n\nThe hardest hit \"will be SAIC brands like MG... as well as joint ventures between foreign and Chinese firms in China, which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to Europe,\" Rhodium says.\n\n\"The biggest beneficiaries of the duties are European-based producers with limited China exposure, such as Renault.\"\n\nIn other words, the duties are likely to do as the EU hopes they would - cut the number of Chinese-made EVs coming into the region, easing pressure on local manufacturers.\n\nThere is also another result of the move - some big Chinese EV firms are planning to build production capacity in the EU, which could help shield them from the new duties.\n\nWork on BYD's first European factory is well under way in Hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year.\n\nChinese car maker, Chery, has recently signed a joint-venture deal with a Spanish firm that will see the two companies making EVs and other types of cars in Barcelona.\n\nAnd, SAIC is looking to secure a site for its first factory in Europe.\n\n\"It's a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China,\" said Bill Russo, from Shanghai-based consulting group Automobility.\n\n\"The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU.\"\n\nThe Chinese government placed its bet on EVs early on.\n\nAccording to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, between 2009 and 2023 more than $230bn (\u00a3181bn) of state support was pumped into the industry.\n\nAs a result its EV industry has become world leading.\n\nThe International Energy Agency says China accounted for more than 60% of the world's new electric car sales last year.\n\nWhile the vast majority of EVs produced in China are sold domestically, overseas markets, and particularly Europe, have become increasingly important.\n\n\"Exports are the profitable segment,\" said Rhodium's senior analyst, Gregor Sebastian.\n\n\"The EU tariffs will hurt China's EV industry because these exports help recover losses from China's domestic price war.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the world's second largest economy is struggling to shake off an economic slowdown in the wake of the pandemic and an ongoing property crisis.\n\nFaced with lower domestic consumption and investment levels, China is trying to \"export its way out\" of the slump, says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at investment bank Natixis.\n\nAnd Beijing is placing yet another large bet on EVs by making the industry one of its \"New Three\" growth drivers - a government blueprint for reviving the economy that also relies on exports of batteries and renewable energy.\n\nHowever, with major markets like the US, the EU and

The European Union initiated the probe without an industry complaint, the first such trade case of this kind.\n\nThe bloc is set to confirm on Thursday provisional duties of up to 37.6% on Chinese brands such as BYD, Geely and SAIC, as well as on China-made models of Tesla, BMW and other Western automakers.\n\nEU members will also vote in October if the commission proposes multiyear tariffs at the end of its investigation. These would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" of at least 15 countries representing 65% of the EU population votes against them.\n\nFrance, Italy and Spain, with 40% of the EU population, have indicated they would support tariffs.\n\n\"Europe must defend itself if our companies are harmed and do not compete on equal terms,\" Spain's economy ministry said.\n\nHowever, Czechia, Greece, Ireland and Poland were still debating the issue, official and government sources said, while Belgium has a caretaker government and the Dutch only got a government this week.\n\nGermany has stressed the need for a negotiated solution with Beijing. Its automakers have said tariffs are the wrong approach, with the negative effects outweighing any benefits.\n\nIncreasing the cost of EVs for consumers undermines the EU's goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, opponents say. Tesla has said it will hike prices.\n\nBeijing's retaliation could bring extra tariffs on EU exports of cognac, pork or luxury cars.\n\nThe commission says duties are needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies, and the goal is a level playing field, not shutting Chinese carmakers out, as the U.S.' planned 100% tariff is likely to do.\n\nTariffs could also give the EU leverage in negotiations with Beijing and push producers to make cars in the EU.\n\nHosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the thinktank, the European Center for International Political Economy, said clear majorities either way could embolden tariff opponents or supporters. He added final positions at the end of the investigation will depend on what Beijing offers in negotiations.\n\n\"If we go to a vote, then it means negotiations have failed,\" he said.\n\nThe EV investigation could be the start for the EU as it toughens its stance on Beijing, as its green and tech companies trail global rivals, interviews with half a dozen trade experts show.\n\nThey point to a 712-page updated report on Chinese state interference and subsidies released in April as the strongest sign yet that Brussels means business.\n\nThe document is by far the most extensive undertaken by the commission, showing it has learned a lesson from an investigation into Chinese solar panels a decade ago when it did not impose tariffs and the EU's own industry collapsed.\n\nIt offers proof to back its assertions that China does not play by the same rules and includes research into a wider range of industries beyond traditional ones such as steel, including semiconductors, telecom equipment and renewable energy.\n\nThat leaves the door open to future cases.\n\n\"This is a report to set the scene and show how and why Europe is changing its policies,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, a senior fellow at Brussels-based economic thinktank Bruegel. \"To be frank, it's also a message, especially for the German Chancellery.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news",

Here's what to know", "body": "The European Union is imposing sharply higher customs duties on electric vehicles imported from China. EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc. The higher duties go into effect on Friday, pending a final decision in four month's time.\n\nHere are some basic facts about the EU's planned customs duties:\n\nWhat did the European Union do?\n\nAfter an eight-month investigation, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, found that companies making electric cars in China benefit from massive government help that means they can undercut rivals in the EU on prices, take a big market share and threaten European jobs.\n\nIt announced the higher duties on June 12 and they go into effect from Friday. The duties are provisional, meaning they will be totaled up but won't need to be paid until they're confirmed by a vote of EU governments before November 2.\n\nThe EU will only collect the duties if there's a further finding that the European auto industry would have suffered material harm without them.\n\nThat gives the EU and the Chinese government time to negotiate. Talks have been held between Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner for the economy, and Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao, as well as at the level of technical experts.\n\nThe higher duties are not a goal in themselves but \"a means to correct an imbalance,\" commission spokesman Eric Mamer said Thursday. \"We certainly hope we can come to a solution which would allow us not to have to move forward on this path.\"\n\nThe rates, if applied, would be: 17.4 per cent on cars from BYD, 19.9 per cent on those from Geely and 37.6 per cent for vehicles exported by China's state-owned SAIC.\n\nGeely has brands including Polestar and Sweden's Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain's MG, one of Europe's bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China including Western companies such as Volkswagen, BMW and Tesla would be subject to duties of at least 20.8 per cent.\n\nThe commission mentioned that Tesla might get an \"individually calculated\" rate if duties are definitively imposed.\n\nUnder EU rules it's possible - though at present it seems unlikely - that the higher duties could be blocked ahead of the November 2 effective date by vote of what the EU calls a \"qualified majority\" of countries. That means at least 15 of the 27 EU member governments representing at least 65 per cent of the bloc's population.\n\nWhy did the commission take action?\n\nChinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9 per cent of the EV market in 2020 to 25 per cent by September 2023, the commission said, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices.\n\nThe commission says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies all along the chain of production, from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and below-interest financing from state-controlled banks.\n\nThe rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU's ability to produce its own green technology needed to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million workers at risk in the auto industry and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production.\n\nSubsidized solar panels from China have wiped out European producers - an experience that European governments don't want to see repeated with their auto industry.\n\nUnusually, the commission acted on its own, without a complaint from the European auto industry. Industry leaders and Germany, home to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have been skeptics about the subsidy investigation. That's because many of the cars that will be hit with tariffs are made by European companies, and because China could retaliate against the auto industry or in other areas.\n\nHow do the EU tariffs compare to ones announced by the US?\n\nThe Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100 per cent from the current 25 per cent. At that level, the US tariffs block virtually all Chinese EV imports.\n\nThat's not what Europe is trying to do.\n\nEU officials want affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve their goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55 per cent by 2030 - but without the subsidies EU leaders see as unfair competition\n\nThe planned tariffs are aimed at leveling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese carmakers.\n\nEuropean countries subsidize electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all carmakers or distort the market in favor of one side.\n\nJust how cheap are Chinese EVs?\n\nChinese carmakers have learned to make electric vehicles cheaply amid ferocious price competition at home in the world's largest car market.\n\nBYD's Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of 21,769 Euros (USD 23,370) in China but 41,990 Euros (SUD 45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium Group figures.\n\nThe base model of BYD's compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for the equivalent of around USD 10,000 in China.\n\nWhat does this mean for European drivers and carmakers?\n\nIt's not clear what impact the duties will have on car prices. Chinese carmakers are able to make some cars so cheaply that they could absorb the duties in the form of lower profits instead of raising their prices.\n\nWhile consumers might benefit from cheaper Chinese cars in the short term, allowing unfair practices could eventually mean less competition and higher prices in the long term, the commission argues.\n\nCurrently, Chinese carmakers often sell their vehicles in Europe at much higher prices than the same cars fetch in China, meaning they are favoring profits over market share, even given their recent market gains.\n\nFive of BYD's six models would still earn a profit in Europe even at a 30 per cent tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations.\n\nThe fear is Europe is that Chinese competitors will turn to lowering their prices closer to the ones they are charging in China. and gain an even bigger chunk of the market.\n\nHow is China likely to react?\n\nBeijing was sharply critical of the higher duties when they were announced, calling them \"a naked act of protectionism.\"\n\nOn Thursday, He Yadong, a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said that the two sides had held several rounds of technical consultations and noted that a final EU ruling won't be made for four months.\n\n\"It is hoped that the European side and the Chinese side will move in the same direction, show sincerity, expedite the consultation process and reach a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible on the basis of facts and rules,\" he said at a weekly media briefing in Beijing.\n\nHe also said that China hopes the EU will seriously listen to the voices of the European automakers and governments that have come out against the tariffs and avoid anti-subsidy measures that would harm cooperation between the Chinese and European auto industries.\n\nIt's not clear what agreement might look like. One move could be to agree on minimum prices for Chinese cars.\n\nChina could retaliate against European products such as pork or brandy imports, or against European luxury car imports.\n\nOver the longer term, Chinese carmakers could avoid tariffs by making cars in Europe. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, while Chery has a joint venture to build cars in Spain's Catalonia region.

Here's What to Know", "body": "FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Union is imposing sharply higher customs duties on electric vehicles imported from China. EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe higher duties go into effect on Friday, pending a final decision in four month's time.\n\nHere are some basic facts about the EU's planned customs duties:\n\nWhat did the European Union do?\n\nAfter an eight-month investigation, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, found that companies making electric cars in China benefit from massive government help that means they can undercut rivals in the EU on prices, take a big market share and threaten European jobs.\n\nIt announced the higher duties on June 12 and they go into effect from Friday. The duties are provisional, meaning they will be totaled up but won't need to be paid until they're confirmed by a vote of EU governments before Nov. 2. The EU will only collect the duties if there's a further finding that the European auto industry would have suffered material harm without them.\n\nThat gives the EU and the Chinese government time to negotiate. Talks have been held between Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner for the economy, and Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao, as well as at the level of technical experts.\n\nThe higher duties are not a goal in themselves but \"a means to correct an imbalance,\" commission spokesman Eric Mamer said Thursday. \"We certainly hope we can come to a solution which would allow us not to have to move forward on this path.\"\n\nThe rates, if applied, would be: 17.4% on cars from BYD, 19.9% on those from Geely and 37.6% for vehicles exported by China's state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden's Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain's MG, one of Europe's bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China including Western companies such as Volkswagen, BMW and Tesla would be subject to duties of at least 20.8%. The commission mentioned that Tesla might get an \"individually calculated\" rate if duties are definitively imposed.\n\nUnder EU rules it's possible -- though at present it seems unlikely -- that the higher duties could be blocked ahead of the Nov. 2 effective date by vote of what the EU calls a \"qualified majority\" of countries. That means at least 15 of the 27 EU member governments representing at least 65% of the bloc's population.\n\nWhy did the commission take action?\n\nChinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, the commission said, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices.\n\nThe commission says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies all along the chain of production, from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and below-interest financing from state-controlled banks.\n\nThe rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU's ability to produce its own green technology needed to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million workers at risk in the auto industry and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production.\n\nSubsidized solar panels from China have wiped out European producers -- an experience that European governments don't want to see repeated with their auto industry.\n\nUnusually, the commission acted on its own, without a complaint from the European auto industry. Industry leaders and Germany, home to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have been skeptics about the subsidy investigation. That's because many of the cars that will be hit with tariffs are made by European companies, and because China could retaliate against the auto industry or in other areas.\n\nHow do the EU tariffs compare to ones announced by the U.S.?\n\nThe Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25%. At that level, the U.S. tariffs block virtually all Chinese EV imports.\n\nThat's not what Europe is trying to do.\n\nEU officials want affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve their goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 -- but without the subsidies EU leaders see as unfair competition\n\nThe planned tariffs are aimed at leveling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese carmakers.\n\nEuropean countries subsidize electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all carmakers or distort the market in favor of one side.\n\nJust how cheap are Chinese EVs?\n\nChinese carmakers have learned to make electric vehicles cheaply amid ferocious price competition at home in the world's largest car market.\n\nBYD's Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of 21,769 euros ($23,370) in China but 41,990 euros ($45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium Group figures. The base model of BYD's compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for the equivalent of around $10,000 in China.\n\nWhat does this mean for European drivers and carmakers?\n\nIt's not clear what impact the duties will have on car prices. Chinese carmakers are able to make some cars so cheaply that they could absorb the duties in the form of lower profits instead of raising their prices.\n\nWhile consumers might benefit from cheaper Chinese cars in the short term, allowing unfair practices could eventually mean less competition and higher prices in the long term, the commission argues.\n\nCurrently, Chinese carmakers often sell their vehicles in Europe at much higher prices than the same cars fetch in China, meaning they are favoring profits over market share, even given their recent market gains. Five of BYD's six models would still earn a profit in Europe even at a 30% tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations.\n\nThe fear is Europe is that Chinese competitors will turn to lowering their prices closer to the ones they are charging in China. and gain an even bigger chunk of the market.\n\nHow is China likely to react?\n\nBeijing was sharply critical of the higher duties when they were announced, calling them \"a naked act of protectionism.\"\n\nOn Thursday, He Yadong, a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said that the two sides had held several rounds of technical consultations and noted that a final EU ruling won't be made for four months.\n\n\"It is hoped that the European side and the Chinese side will move in the same direction, show sincerity, expedite the consultation process and reach a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible on the basis of facts and rules,\" he said at a weekly media briefing in Beijing.\n\nHe also said that China hopes the EU will seriously listen to the voices of the European automakers and governments that have come out against the tariffs and avoid anti-subsidy measures that would harm cooperation between the Chinese and European auto industries.\n\nIt's not clear what agreement might look like. One move could be to agree on minimum prices for Chinese cars.\n\nChina could retaliate against European products such as pork or brandy imports, or against European luxury car imports.\n\nOver the longer term, Chinese carmakers could avoid tariffs by making cars in Europe. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, while Chery has a joint venture to build cars in Spain's Catalonia region.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The EU initiated the probe without an industry complaint, the first such trade case of this kind.\n\nThe bloc is set to confirm on Thursday provisional duties of up to 37.6% on Chinese brands such as BYD (002594.SZ), Geely (GEELY.UL) and SAIC (600104.SS), as well as on China-made models of Tesla (TSLA.O), BMW (BMWG.DE), and other western automakers.\n\nCarmakers are bracing for billions of dollars in new costs as a result, which analysts say could slow their European expansion.\n\nEU members will also vote in October if the Commission proposes multi-year tariffs at the end of its investigation. These would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" of at least 15 countries representing 65% of the EU population votes against them.\n\nFrance, Italy and Spain, with 40% of the EU population, have indicated they would back tariffs.\n\n\"Europe must defend itself if our companies are harmed and do not compete on equal terms,\" Spain's economy ministry said.\n\nHowever, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland and Poland were still debating the issue, official and government sources said, while Belgium has a caretaker government and the Dutch only got a government this week.\n\nNEGATIVE EFFECTS\n\nGermany has stressed the need for a negotiated solution with Beijing. Its automakers have said tariffs are the wrong approach, with the negative effects outweighing any benefits.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to influence negotiation, its auto association on Wednesday urged Brussels to drop the tariffs.\n\nIncreasing the cost of EVs for consumers undermines the EU's goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, opponents say. Tesla has said it will hike prices. Beijing's retaliation could bring extra tariffs on EU exports of cognac, pork or luxury cars.\n\nThe Commission says duties are needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies and the goal is a level playing field, not shutting Chinese car makers out, as the United States' planned 100% tariff is likely to do.\n\nTariffs could also give the EU leverage in negotiations with Beijing and push producers to make cars in the EU.\n\nHosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of thinktank the European Centre for International Political Economy, said clear majorities either way could embolden tariff opponents or supporters. He added final positions at the end of the investigation will depend on what Beijing offers in negotiations.\n\n\"If we go to a vote then, it means negotiations have failed,\" he said.\n\nThe EV investigation could just be the start for the EU as it toughens its stance on Beijing, as its green and tech companies trail global rivals, interviews with half a dozen trade experts show.\n\nThey point to a 712-page updated report on Chinese state interference and subsidies released in April as the strongest sign yet that Brussels means business.\n\nThe document is by far the most extensive undertaken by the Commission, showing it has learned a lesson from an investigation into Chinese solar panels a decade ago, when it did not impose tariffs and the EU's own industry collapsed.\n\nIt offers evidence to back its assertions that China does not play by the same rules and includes research into a wider range of industries, beyond traditional ones such as steel, including semiconductors, telecom equipment and renewable energy.\n\nThat leaves the door open to future cases.\n\n\"This is a report to set the scene and show how and why Europe is changing its policies,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, a senior fellow at Brussels-based economic thinktank Bruegel. \"To be frank, it's also a message especially for the German chancellery.\"", "source": {"uri": "kitco.com",

The European Commission plans to impose tariffs up to 37.6% due to concerns over state subsidies. The dispute has caused tension, with China urging EU to consider mutual benefits and avoid further trade measures.\n\nChina and Europe held several rounds of technical talks over tariffs on Chinese electric cars that the European Commission is set to confirm on Thursday, China's commerce ministry said at a regular news conference.\n\n\"To date, a number of consultations have been held at the technical level between China and the European Union,\" He Yadong, a ministry spokesperson, said. \"There is still a four-month window before arbitration, and we hope that the European and Chinese sides will move in the same direction, show sincerity, and push forward with the consultation process as soon as possible,\" he added.\n\nThe Commission is set to confirm provisional import tariffs of up to 37.6% on Chinese-manufactured electric vehicles (EVs), after the bloc accused the world's No.2 economy of providing its firms with heavy state subsidies. EU trade policy has turned increasingly protective over concerns that China's production-focused development model could flood Europe with cheap goods as Chinese firms seek to step up exports amid weak domestic demand.\n\nBeijing rejects accusations that Chinese EVs are unfairly subsidised. \"The governments of some EU member states and some major automobile companies have repeatedly, explicitly opposed the EU's anti-subsidy measures,\" He Yadong said.\n\n\"China hopes the EU will heed the call from within the EU, conduct consultations with China in a rational and pragmatic manner, and avoid countervailing measures hurting the mutually beneficial cooperation and common development of the China-EU auto industry,\" he added. EU countries are wavering over whether to back additional tariffs on Chinese-built EVs, highlighting Brussels' challenge in building support for its largest trade case yet as Beijing threatens wide-ranging retaliation.\n\nThe issue will be put to the 27-strong bloc in an advisory vote in the coming weeks. Germany, whose carmakers made a third of their sales last year in China, reportedly wants to stop the tariffs, while France has been among the firmest backers.\n\nChina is undertaking an anti-dumping inquiry into European brandy imports. Almost all EU brandy exports to China came from France last year, Chinese customs data shows. Beijing has also opened an anti-dumping investigation into imports of European pork and its by-products, which analysts say is aimed at pressuring Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark to break with the Commission over the curbs.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pragmatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dumping (pricing policy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/22_06_2024_04_42_50_8432673.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

The EU initiated the probe without an industry complaint, the first such trade case of this kind.\n\nThe bloc is set to confirm on Thursday provisional duties of up to 37.6% on Chinese brands such as BYD, Geely and SAIC, as well as on China-made models of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), BMW (ETR:BMWG) and other western automakers.\n\nEU members will also vote in October if the Commission proposes multi-year tariffs at the end of its investigation. These would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" if at least 15 countries representing 65% of the EU population votes against them.\n\nFrance, Italy and Spain, with 40% of the EU population, have indicated they would back tariffs.\n\n\"Europe must defend itself if our companies are harmed and do not compete on equal terms,\" Spain's economy ministry said.\n\nHowever, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland and Poland were still debating the issue, official and government sources said, while Belgium has a caretaker government and the Dutch only got a government this week.\n\nNEGATIVE EFFECTS\n\nGermany has stressed the need for a negotiated solution with Beijing. Its automakers have said tariffs are the wrong approach, with the negative effects outweighing any benefits.\n\nIncreasing the cost of EVs for consumers undermines the EU's goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, opponents say. Tesla has said it will hike prices.\n\nBeijing's retaliation could bring extra tariffs on EU exports of cognac, pork or luxury cars.\n\nThe Commission says duties are needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies and the goal is a level playing field, not shutting Chinese car makers out, as the United States' planned 100% tariff is likely to do.\n\nTariffs could also give the EU leverage in negotiations with Beijing and push producers to make cars in the EU.\n\nHosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of thinktank the European Centre for International Political Economy, said clear majorities either way could embolden tariff opponents or supporters. He added final positions at the end of the investigation will depend on what Beijing offers in negotiations.\n\n\"If we go to a vote then, it means negotiations have failed,\" he said.\n\nThe EV investigation could just be the start for the EU as it toughens its stance on Beijing, as its green and tech companies trail global rivals, interviews with half a dozen trade experts show.\n\nThey point to a 712-page updated report on Chinese state interference and subsidies released in April as the strongest sign yet that Brussels means business.\n\nThe document is by far the most extensive undertaken by the Commission, showing it has learned a lesson from an investigation into Chinese solar panels a decade ago, when it did not impose tariffs and the EU's own industry collapsed.\n\nIt offers proof to back its assertions that China does not play by the same rules and includes research into a wider range of industries, beyond traditional ones such as steel, including semiconductors, telecom equipment and renewable energy.\n\nThat leaves the door open to future cases.\n\n\"This is a report to set the scene and show how and why Europe is changing its policies,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, a senior fellow at Brussels-based economic thinktank Bruegel. \"To be frank, it's also a message especially for the German chancellery.\"", "source": {"uri": "za.investing.com", "dataType":

Geely, which owns Volvo, Polestar, and Lotus, faces duties of 19.9%. SAIC, a Chinese state-owned carmaker, will receive the maximum 37.6%.\n\nOther companies will be subject to new tariffs of 20.8%, the weighted average.\n\nThese fees will come on top of a 10% duty that was already in place. As a result, prices of EVs in Europe could increase. Beijing may also impose retaliatory measures.\n\nNonetheless, the EU argues that the intervention is essential.\n\nThe tariffs are an attempt to protect the EU auto industry. Beijing has been accused of creating unfair competition through \"illegal subsidisation\" of Chinese EV makers.\n\nLast October, the EU opened an investigation into the matter.\n\n\"The electric vehicle sector holds huge potential for Europe's future competitiveness and green industrial leadership,\" Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said at the probe's launch.\n\n\"EU car manufacturers and related sectors are already investing and innovating to fully develop this potential. Wherever we find evidence that their efforts are being impeded by market distortions and unfair competition, we will act decisively.\"\n\nThe EU has now concluded that the subsidies are indeed unfair. With access to this state supports, Chinese EV makers stand accused of artificially lowering prices.\n\nAccording to Brussels, this threatens \"economic injury\" to the bloc's carmakers. But not everyone in the EU supports the new tariffs.\n\nGovernment officials and carmakers have raised several objections to the tariffs.\n\nSweden's prime minister fears the duties will escalate \"a wider trade war.\" Germany's chancellor warned the measures will also harm EU companies that import EVs from China.\n\nHungary, which has forged a strong trade partnership with Beijing, has provided sterner rebukes. \"We disagree with the brutal European punishment of Chinese electric car manufacturers with punitive tariffs,\" the country's economic ministry said last month. \"Protectionism is not the solution.\"\n\nGerman car giant Volkswagen has also slammed the charges. \"The negative effects of this decision outweigh any benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry,\" a company spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nIndustry analysts have also questioned the EU's plans. James Edmondson, an EV expert at market intelligence firm IDTechEx, fears that the plan will backfire.\n\n\"The long term impact of restricting trade with China more generally could be detrimental to EU manufacturers and adoption of EVs especially when the EU is still so reliant on China for components like EV batteries,\" he told TNW last month.\n\nInevitably, the EU has downplayed these concerns. The bloc's trade chief, Valdis Dombrovskis, said discussions with Beijing could still create a mutually beneficial resolution.", "source": {"uri": "thenextweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Next Web"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_macaulay@thenextweb.com", "name": "Thomas Macaulay", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BYD Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SAIC Motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geely", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volvo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shenzhen", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shenzhen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ursula von der Leyen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013United_States_trade_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China\u2013United States trade war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdis_Dombrovskis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valdis Dombrovskis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protectionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancellor_of_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chancellor of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw-blurple?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2022%2F02%2FUntitled-design-48-1.jpg&signature=4188c35bddea595c827516e81ec32866", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

When adopted, this decision would make the duties definitive for a period of five years.\u201d\n\nTariffs of 17.4 per cent, 19.9 per cent and 37.6 per cent would be applied to Chinese carmakers BYD, Geely and SAIC, respectively, said the statement.\n\nOther BEV producers in China which cooperated in the investigation would be subject to a 20.8 per cent weighted average duty, while the commission set the duty for other non-cooperating companies at 37.6 per cent.We hope that the EU can show its sincerity to progress the communication in the coming four monthsHe Yadong, Ministry of Commerce\n\n\u201cBefore the last result comes out, I believe that both sides still have the space to discuss,\u201d said Liang Ming, director of the foreign trade institute under the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, which is a think tank within China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce.\n\nThe EU Commission statement confirmed consultations with the Chinese government had intensified in recent weeks, and that contact would continue at a technical level with a view to reaching a solution which addresses the concerns raised by the European Union.\n\n\u201c[The tariffs are] not a decisive battle, but one of the phases along the lengthy bilateral trade disputes,\u201d said Shanghai-based international relations scholar Shen Dingli.\n\n\u201cBoth sides will continue to contest each other, but they will try to avoid the worst result through negotiation.\u201d\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Ministry of Commerce spokesman He Yadong said that China had expressed its opposition \u201cmany times\u201d towards the EU\u2019s anti-subsidy investigation.\n\n\u201cBoth sides have already held many rounds of negotiations up to now,\u201d he said at a regular press conference in Beijing.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the EU can show its sincerity to progress the dialogue in the coming four months, so that we can find resolutions both sides accept according to facts and rules.\u201d\n\nIn response to the EU\u2019s allegations of subsidies and overcapacity within its electric vehicle (EV) sector, China announced an anti-dumping investigation into certain pork products imported from the EU in June.\n\nChina\u2019s Ministry of Commerce is also reviewing complaints from machinery industry representatives against \u201cbiased practices\u201d from the EU.\n\nFrank Tsai, founder of the Shanghai-based China Crossroads consultancy, described the tariffs on Chinese EVs as \u201can inflection point\u201d in the bilateral relationship.\n\nBeijing would also experience such moves as \u201ca setback to its efforts in the US-EU-China strategic triangle\u201d, added Tsai, who is also an adjunct professor at Emlyon Business School in Shanghai.\n\nBut Tsai also noted that the continuous disengagement of the US towards China would leave the EU the \u201conly one major partner in the advanced West\u201d, meaning Beijing \u201chas thus engaged in a charm offensive to stabilise the EU-China relationship\u201d.\n\nThe tariffs on Chinese EVs represent the first time that the EU Commission has executed its ex officio power to proceed unilaterally without a complaint from the industry.The tariffs are actually hitting their benefits hardRolf Langhammer, Kiel Institute for the World Economy\n\n\u201cThe EU measures announced are carefully tailored and leave plenty of scope to find a compromise \u2026 there is much time until November to find ways out of a serious trade war,\u201d said Rolf Langhammer, a professor with the Germany-based Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\n\nLanghammer noted that the EU Commission was \u201cserious\u201d about its mandate as the only institution lawfully deciding on trade policy issues, even with member states including Germany having different views, as it sees China\u2019s EV subsidies as a \u201cthreat\u201d.\n\nGerman carmakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes and BMW have opposed the trade barriers proposed by the EU amid fears of a tit-for-tat crackdown on accessing the huge Chinese market, while some other member states, including France, have backed the moves.\n\n\u201cMore than one-third of the exported EVs from China to the EU are produced by the German carmakers,\u201d said Wang Yiwei, a professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.\n\n\u201cSo the tariffs are actually hitting their benefits hard.\u201d\n\nChinese carmakers are also making moves to mitigate the impact of the tariffs, with BYD planning to build its first passenger car facility in Europe in southern Hungary.\n\nChery Automobile also confirmed in April it had also sealed a deal to build its first European factory in Spain in a joint venture with Ebro-EV Motors.\n\nIn 2013, the EU threatened to impose provisional anti-dumping tariffs on Chinese solar panels, but the dispute was resolved after an agreement to set a minimum price after six weeks of talks.\n\n\u201cChina and the EU will still communicate to ensure smooth bilateral trade and investment \u2026 but the issue won\u2019t stop at tariffs,\u201d Wang added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the entire process of producing EVs that includes digitalisation, software, privacy and other standards.\u201d\n\nHe Weiwen, a senior fellow with the Beijing-based think tank Centre for China and Globalisation, pointed out the interdependence between both sides.\n\nHe cited the fact that EU law would require all new cars entering the market as of 2035 to have zero carbon dioxide emissions, and \u201cthey can\u2019t attain the goal only by

Here's what to know", "body": "Our mission is to deliver unbiased, fact-based reporting that holds power to account and exposes the truth.\n\nWhether $5 or $50, every contribution counts.\n\nSupport us to deliver journalism without an agenda.\n\nThe European Union is imposing sharply higher customs duties on electric vehicles imported from China. EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe higher duties go into effect on Friday, pending a final decision in four month's time.\n\nHere are some basic facts about the EU's planned customs duties:\n\nWhat did the European Union do?\n\nAfter an eight-month investigation, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, found that companies making electric cars in China benefit from massive government help that means they can undercut rivals in the EU on prices, take a big market share and threaten European jobs.\n\nIt announced the higher duties on June 12 and they go into effect from Friday. The duties are provisional, meaning they will be totaled up but won't need to be paid until they're confirmed by a vote of EU governments before Nov. 2. The EU will only collect the duties if there's a further finding that the European auto industry would have suffered material harm without them.\n\nThat gives the EU and the Chinese government time to negotiate. Talks have been held between Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner for the economy, and Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao, as well as at the level of technical experts.\n\nThe higher duties are not a goal in themselves but \"a means to correct an imbalance,\" commission spokesman Eric Mamer said Thursday. \"We certainly hope we can come to a solution which would allow us not to have to move forward on this path.\"\n\nThe rates, if applied, would be: 17.4% on cars from BYD, 19.9% on those from Geely and 37.6% for vehicles exported by China's state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden's Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain's MG, one of Europe's bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China including Western companies such as Volkswagen, BMW and Tesla would be subject to duties of at least 20.8%. The commission mentioned that Tesla might get an \"individually calculated\" rate if duties are definitively imposed.\n\nUnder EU rules it's possible -- though at present it seems unlikely -- that the higher duties could be blocked ahead of the Nov. 2 effective date by vote of what the EU calls a \"qualified majority\" of countries. That means at least 15 of the 27 EU member governments representing at least 65% of the bloc's population.\n\nWhy did the commission take action?\n\nChinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, the commission said, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices.\n\nThe commission says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies all along the chain of production, from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and below-interest financing from state-controlled banks.\n\nThe rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU's ability to produce its own green technology needed to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million workers at risk in the auto industry and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production.\n\nSubsidized solar panels from China have wiped out European producers -- an experience that European governments don't want to see repeated with their auto industry.\n\nUnusually, the commission acted on its own, without a complaint from the European auto industry. Industry leaders and Germany, home to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have been skeptics about the subsidy investigation. That's because many of the cars that will be hit with tariffs are made by European companies, and because China could retaliate against the auto industry or in other areas.\n\nHow do the EU tariffs compare to ones announced by the U.S.?\n\nThe Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25%. At that level, the U.S. tariffs block virtually all Chinese EV imports.\n\nThat's not what Europe is trying to do.\n\nEU officials want affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve their goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 -- but without the subsidies EU leaders see as unfair competition\n\nThe planned tariffs are aimed at leveling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese carmakers.\n\nEuropean countries subsidize electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all carmakers or distort the market in favor of one side.\n\nJust how cheap are Chinese EVs?\n\nChinese carmakers have learned to make electric vehicles cheaply amid ferocious price competition at home in the world's largest car market.\n\nBYD's Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of 21,769 euros ($23,370) in China but 41,990 euros ($45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium Group figures. The base model of BYD's compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for the equivalent of around $10,000 in China.\n\nWhat does this mean for European drivers and carmakers?\n\nIt's not clear what impact the duties will have on car prices. Chinese carmakers are able to make some cars so cheaply that they could absorb the duties in the form of lower profits instead of raising their prices.\n\nWhile consumers might benefit from cheaper Chinese cars in the short term, allowing unfair practices could eventually mean less competition and higher prices in the long term, the commission argues.\n\nCurrently, Chinese carmakers often sell their vehicles in Europe at much higher prices than the same cars fetch in China, meaning they are favoring profits over market share, even given their recent market gains. Five of BYD's six models would still earn a profit in Europe even at a 30% tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations.\n\nThe fear is Europe is that Chinese competitors will turn to lowering their prices closer to the ones they are charging in China. and gain an even bigger chunk of the market.\n\nHow is China likely to react?\n\nBeijing was sharply critical of the higher duties when they were announced, calling them \"a naked act of protectionism.\"\n\nOn Thursday, He Yadong, a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said that the two sides had held several rounds of technical consultations and noted that a final EU ruling won't be made for four months.\n\n\"It is hoped that the European side and the Chinese side will move in the same direction, show sincerity, expedite the consultation process and reach a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible on the basis of facts and rules,\" he said at a weekly media briefing in Beijing.\n\nHe also said that China hopes the EU will seriously listen to the voices of the European automakers and governments that have come out against the tariffs and avoid anti-subsidy measures that would harm cooperation between the Chinese and European auto industries.\n\nIt's not clear what agreement might look like. One move could be to agree on minimum prices for Chinese cars.\n\nChina could retaliate against European products such as pork or brandy imports, or against European luxury car imports.\n\nOver the longer term, Chinese carmakers could avoid tariffs by making cars in Europe.

Here's what to know", "body": "FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The European Union is imposing sharply higher customs duties on electric vehicles imported from China. EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe higher duties go into effect on Friday, pending a final decision in four month's time.\n\nHere are some basic facts about the EU's planned customs duties:\n\nAfter an eight-month investigation, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, found that companies making electric cars in China benefit from massive government help that means they can undercut rivals in the EU on prices, take a big market share and threaten European jobs.\n\nIt announced the higher duties on June 12 and they go into effect from Friday. The duties are provisional, meaning they will be totaled up but won't need to be paid until they're confirmed by a vote of EU governments before Nov. 2. The EU will only collect the duties if there's a further finding that the European auto industry would have suffered material harm without them.\n\nThat gives the EU and the Chinese government time to negotiate. Talks have been held between Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner for the economy, and Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao, as well as at the level of technical experts.\n\nThe higher duties are not a goal in themselves but \"a means to correct an imbalance,\" commission spokesman Eric Mamer said Thursday. \"We certainly hope we can come to a solution which would allow us not to have to move forward on this path.\"\n\nThe rates, if applied, would be: 17.4% on cars from BYD, 19.9% on those from Geely and 37.6% for vehicles exported by China's state-owned SAIC. Geely has brands including Polestar and Sweden's Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain's MG, one of Europe's bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China including Western companies such as Volkswagen, BMW and Tesla would be subject to duties of at least 20.8%. The commission mentioned that Tesla might get an \"individually calculated\" rate if duties are definitively imposed.\n\nUnder EU rules it's possible -- though at present it seems unlikely -- that the higher duties could be blocked ahead of the Nov. 2 effective date by vote of what the EU calls a \"qualified majority\" of countries. That means at least 15 of the 27 EU member governments representing at least 65% of the bloc's population.\n\nChinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9% of the EV market in 2020 to 25% by September 2023, the commission said, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices.\n\nThe commission says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies all along the chain of production, from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and below-interest financing from state-controlled banks.\n\nThe rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU's ability to produce its own green technology needed to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million workers at risk in the auto industry and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production.\n\nSubsidized solar panels from China have wiped out European producers -- an experience that European governments don't want to see repeated with their auto industry.\n\nUnusually, the commission acted on its own, without a complaint from the European auto industry. Industry leaders and Germany, home to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have been skeptics about the subsidy investigation. That's because many of the cars that will be hit with tariffs are made by European companies, and because China could retaliate against the auto industry or in other areas.\n\nThe Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100% from the current 25%. At that level, the U.S. tariffs block virtually all Chinese EV imports.\n\nThat's not what Europe is trying to do.\n\nEU officials want affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve their goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 -- but without the subsidies EU leaders see as unfair competition\n\nThe planned tariffs are aimed at leveling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese carmakers.\n\nEuropean countries subsidize electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all carmakers or distort the market in favor of one side.\n\nChinese carmakers have learned to make electric vehicles cheaply amid ferocious price competition at home in the world's largest car market.\n\nBYD's Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of 21,769 euros ($23,370) in China but 41,990 euros ($45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium Group figures. The base model of BYD's compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for the equivalent of around $10,000 in China.\n\nIt's not clear what impact the duties will have on car prices. Chinese carmakers are able to make some cars so cheaply that they could absorb the duties in the form of lower profits instead of raising their prices.\n\nWhile consumers might benefit from cheaper Chinese cars in the short term, allowing unfair practices could eventually mean less competition and higher prices in the long term, the commission argues.\n\nCurrently, Chinese carmakers often sell their vehicles in Europe at much higher prices than the same cars fetch in China, meaning they are favoring profits over market share, even given their recent market gains. Five of BYD's six models would still earn a profit in Europe even at a 30% tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations.\n\nThe fear is Europe is that Chinese competitors will turn to lowering their prices closer to the ones they are charging in China. and gain an even bigger chunk of the market.\n\nBeijing was sharply critical of the higher duties when they were announced, calling them \"a naked act of protectionism.\"\n\nOn Thursday, He Yadong, a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said that the two sides had held several rounds of technical consultations and noted that a final EU ruling won't be made for four months.\n\n\"It is hoped that the European side and the Chinese side will move in the same direction, show sincerity, expedite the consultation process and reach a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible on the basis of facts and rules,\" he said at a weekly media briefing in Beijing.\n\nHe also said that China hopes the EU will seriously listen to the voices of the European automakers and governments that have come out against the tariffs and avoid anti-subsidy measures that would harm cooperation between the Chinese and European auto industries.\n\nIt's not clear what agreement might look like. One move could be to agree on minimum prices for Chinese cars.\n\nChina could retaliate against European products such as pork or brandy imports, or against European luxury car imports.\n\nOver the longer term, Chinese carmakers could avoid tariffs by making cars in Europe.

Its automakers have said tariffs are the wrong approach, with the negative effects outweighing any benefits.\n\nIncreasing the cost of EVs for consumers undermines the EU's goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, opponents say. Tesla has said it will hike prices.\n\nBeijing's retaliation could bring extra tariffs on EU exports of cognac, pork or luxury cars.\n\nThe Commission says duties are needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies and the goal is a level playing field, not shutting Chinese automakers out, as the U.S.'s planned 100 percent tariff is likely to do.\n\nTariffs could also give the EU leverage in negotiations with Beijing and push producers to make cars in the EU.\n\nHosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of thinktank the European Centre for International Political Economy, said clear majorities either way could embolden tariff opponents or supporters. He added final positions at the end of the investigation will depend on what Beijing offers in negotiations.\n\n\"If we go to a vote then, it means negotiations have failed,\" he said.\n\nThe EV investigation could just be the start for the EU as it toughens its stance on Beijing, as its green and tech companies trail global rivals, interviews with half a dozen trade experts show.\n\nCHINA NEWSLETTER: Sign up for commentary by journalist Yang Jian and highlights from top manufacturer and supplier news from China, delivered on Thursdays.\n\nEmail Address\n\nThey point to a 712-page updated report on Chinese state interference and subsidies released in April as the strongest sign yet that Brussels means business.\n\nThe document is by far the most extensive undertaken by the Commission, showing it has learned a lesson from an investigation into Chinese solar panels a decade ago, when it did not impose tariffs and the EU's own industry collapsed.\n\nIt offers proof to back its assertions that China does not play by the same rules and includes research into a wider range of industries, beyond traditional ones such as steel, including semiconductors, telecom equipment and renewable energy.\n\nThat leaves the door open to future cases.\n\n\"This is a report to set the scene and show how and why Europe is changing its policies,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, a senior fellow at Brussels-based economic thinktank Bruegel. \"To be frank, it's also a message especially for the German chancellery.\"", "source": {"uri": "autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Here's What to Know | LatestLY", "body": "Frankfurt, Jul 4 (AP) The European Union is imposing sharply higher customs duties on electric vehicles imported from China. EVs are the latest flash point in a broader trade dispute over Chinese government subsidies and Beijing's burgeoning exports of green technology to the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe higher duties go into effect on Friday, pending a final decision in four month's time.\n\nAlso Read | Australia-India Strategic Research Fund: 5 Indian Institutions Receive Grants for Their Projects Including for AI, Machines Learning, Biotech and More Under AISRF.\n\nHere are some basic facts about the EU's planned customs duties:\n\nAlso Read | UKG Layoffs: US-Based Software Firm Announces Massive Layoff Round, Cuts Over 2,200 Jobs as Part of Organisational Changes To Focus on Growth Areas.\n\nWhat did the European Union do?\n\nAfter an eight-month investigation, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, found that companies making electric cars in China benefit from massive government help that means they can undercut rivals in the EU on prices, take a big market share and threaten European jobs.\n\nIt announced the higher duties on June 12 and they go into effect from Friday. The duties are provisional, meaning they will be totaled up but won't need to be paid until they're confirmed by a vote of EU governments before November 2.\n\nThe EU will only collect the duties if there's a further finding that the European auto industry would have suffered material harm without them.\n\nThat gives the EU and the Chinese government time to negotiate. Talks have been held between Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU commissioner for the economy, and Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao, as well as at the level of technical experts.\n\nThe higher duties are not a goal in themselves but \"a means to correct an imbalance,\" commission spokesman Eric Mamer said Thursday. \"We certainly hope we can come to a solution which would allow us not to have to move forward on this path.\"\n\nThe rates, if applied, would be: 17.4 per cent on cars from BYD, 19.9 per cent on those from Geely and 37.6 per cent for vehicles exported by China's state-owned SAIC.\n\nGeely has brands including Polestar and Sweden's Volvo, while SAIC owns Britain's MG, one of Europe's bestselling EV brands. Other EV manufacturers in China including Western companies such as Volkswagen, BMW and Tesla would be subject to duties of at least 20.8 per cent.\n\nThe commission mentioned that Tesla might get an \"individually calculated\" rate if duties are definitively imposed.\n\nUnder EU rules it's possible -- though at present it seems unlikely -- that the higher duties could be blocked ahead of the November 2 effective date by vote of what the EU calls a \"qualified majority\" of countries. That means at least 15 of the 27 EU member governments representing at least 65 per cent of the bloc's population.\n\nWhy did the commission take action?\n\nChinese-built electric cars jumped from 3.9 per cent of the EV market in 2020 to 25 per cent by September 2023, the commission said, in part by unfairly undercutting EU industry prices.\n\nThe commission says companies in China accomplished that with the help of subsidies all along the chain of production, from cheap land for factories from local governments to below-market supplies of lithium and batteries from state-owned enterprises to tax breaks and below-interest financing from state-controlled banks.\n\nThe rapid growth in market share has sparked fears that Chinese cars will eventually threaten the EU's ability to produce its own green technology needed to combat climate change, as well as the jobs of 2.5 million workers at risk in the auto industry and 10.3 million more people whose jobs depend indirectly on EV production.\n\nSubsidized solar panels from China have wiped out European producers -- an experience that European governments don't want to see repeated with their auto industry.\n\nUnusually, the commission acted on its own, without a complaint from the European auto industry. Industry leaders and Germany, home to BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, have been skeptics about the subsidy investigation. That's because many of the cars that will be hit with tariffs are made by European companies, and because China could retaliate against the auto industry or in other areas.\n\nHow do the EU tariffs compare to ones announced by the US?\n\nThe Biden administration is raising tariffs on Chinese EVs to 100 per cent from the current 25 per cent. At that level, the US tariffs block virtually all Chinese EV imports.\n\nThat's not what Europe is trying to do.\n\nEU officials want affordable electric cars from abroad to achieve their goals of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 55 per cent by 2030 -- but without the subsidies EU leaders see as unfair competition\n\nThe planned tariffs are aimed at leveling the playing field by approximating the size of the excess or unfair subsidies available to Chinese carmakers.\n\nEuropean countries subsidize electric cars, too. The question in trade disputes is whether subsidies are fair and available to all carmakers or distort the market in favor of one side.\n\nJust how cheap are Chinese EVs?\n\nChinese carmakers have learned to make electric vehicles cheaply amid ferocious price competition at home in the world's largest car market.\n\nBYD's Seal U Comfort model sells for the equivalent of 21,769 Euros (USD 23,370) in China but 41,990 Euros (SUD 45,078) in Europe, according to Rhodium Group figures.\n\nThe base model of BYD's compact Seagull, due to arrive in Europe next year, sells for the equivalent of around USD 10,000 in China.\n\nWhat does this mean for European drivers and carmakers?\n\nIt's not clear what impact the duties will have on car prices. Chinese carmakers are able to make some cars so cheaply that they could absorb the duties in the form of lower profits instead of raising their prices.\n\nWhile consumers might benefit from cheaper Chinese cars in the short term, allowing unfair practices could eventually mean less competition and higher prices in the long term, the commission argues.\n\nCurrently, Chinese carmakers often sell their vehicles in Europe at much higher prices than the same cars fetch in China, meaning they are favoring profits over market share, even given their recent market gains.\n\nFive of BYD's six models would still earn a profit in Europe even at a 30 per cent tariff, according to Rhodium Group calculations.\n\nThe fear is Europe is that Chinese competitors will turn to lowering their prices closer to the ones they are charging in China. and gain an even bigger chunk of the market.\n\nHow is China likely to react?\n\nBeijing was sharply critical of the higher duties when they were announced, calling them \"a naked act of protectionism.\"\n\nOn Thursday, He Yadong, a spokesperson for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said that the two sides had held several rounds of technical consultations and noted that a final EU ruling won't be made for four months.\n\n\"It is hoped that the European side and the Chinese side will move in the same direction, show sincerity, expedite the consultation process and reach a mutually acceptable solution as soon as possible on the basis of facts and rules,\" he said at a weekly media briefing in Beijing.\n\nHe also said that China hopes the EU will seriously listen to the voices of the European automakers and governments that have come out against the tariffs and avoid anti-subsidy measures that would harm cooperation between the Chinese and European auto industries.\n\nIt's not clear what agreement might look like. One move could be to agree on minimum prices for Chinese cars.\n\nChina could retaliate against European products such as pork or brandy imports, or against European luxury car imports.\n\nOver the longer term, Chinese carmakers could avoid tariffs by making cars in Europe. BYD is building a plant in Hungary, while Chery has a joint venture to build cars in Spain's Catalonia region.

MG maker SAIC faces a 37.6 per cent tariff on top of the existing 10 per cent rate, while Volvo owner Geely and BYD will be hit with additional charges of 19.9 per cent and 17.4 per cent, respectively.\n\nOther EV producers in China that co-operated with the investigation but have not been sampled will be subject to a weighted average duty of 20.8 per cent, while firms that didn't co-operate will face an additional 37.6 per cent levy.\n\nThe provisional duties will apply as of Friday, and definitive duties would kick in by November unless the two sides come to some kind of alternative solution or a qualified majority of EU member states block the final move. Tesla may receive an individually calculated duty rate at that definitive stage following a request to be sampled.\n\nThe EU, which said that talks with China have intensified in recent weeks, said the probe concluded that China subsidises its EV industry to a degree that causes economic harm to the bloc's carmakers.\n\n\"Those talks with China are ongoing,\" Valdis Dombrovskis, an executive vice-president of the European Commission, said in an interview. \"Should a mutually beneficial solution emerge, we can also find ways then not to apply at the end of the day the definitive tariffs. but it's very clear that this solution needs to resolve this market distortion we're currently having.\"\n\nChina has threatened to retaliate and has already launched a targeted anti-dumping probe on pork imports. The findings of an investigation into EU spirits are due early next year but could come anytime, based on what's happened before. Beijing has warned it could hit European agricultural goods, aviation and cars with large engines. China could also decide to challenge the EU's probe at the World Trade Organization.\n\n\"We are not seeing the basis for retaliation as what we are conducting is indeed in line with WTO rules,\" Dombrovskis said.\n\nThe EU and China have been consulting on a way forward and the two sides plan to continue conversations over the next four months.\n\nFor Brussels, any solution has to be grounded in WTO rules and address the underlying harmful subsidies the probe has identified. Beijing has looked to transform the investigation into a negotiation and has been trying to divide member states by pressuring them bilaterally, Bloomberg previously reported. Some member states, including Germany, have been pushing for a negotiated compromise.\n\nIn talks between the two sides, China had asked the EU not to introduce the provisional measures at all - or to consider lower rates based on fewer criteria and then increase them in November if a solution couldn't be found before definitive tariffs are due, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBeijing has also asked whether the rates can be adjusted between now and November if the situation changes as the two sides continue to talk, the people said. Though rates can be tweaked during the process, the EU's preference is to first establish a common understanding of the facts before exploring a mutually agreed solution that adheres to WTO rules, they added.\n\nTechnical talks between the two sides will resume in the coming days, the people added.\n\nThe provisional duties are being introduced by a guarantee, and would be collected only if and when definitive duties are imposed, the EU said in a statement last month. The EU is expected to issue guidance on the form the guarantees will take.\n\nGeely and BYD declined to comment on the provisional tariffs going into effect. SAIC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe tariffs will likely cut imports from China by a quarter, amounting to a value of roughly $4 billion, according to an estimate by Moritz Schularick, president of Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\n\nMany European carmakers have made clear they're opposed to higher tariffs, with companies like Mercedes-Benz Group and Volkswagen warning against them. China is the biggest market for Mercedes, VW and BMW.\n\nBMW CEO Oliver Zipse said the tariffs are a \"dead end\" and won't strengthen European carmakers.\n\n\"On the contrary: It not only harms the business model of globally active companies, it also limits the supply of electric cars to European customers and can therefore even slow down decarbonisation in the transport sector,\" he said in a statement. -

Geely, which owns Volvo, Polestar, and Lotus, faces duties of 19.9%. SAIC, a Chinese state-owned carmaker, will receive the maximum 37.6%.\n\nOther companies will be subject to new tariffs of 20.8%, the weighted average.\n\nThese fees will come on top of a 10% duty that was already in place. As a result, prices of EVs in Europe could increase. Beijing may also impose retaliatory measures.\n\nNonetheless, the EU argues that the intervention is essential.\n\nThe charges are an attempt to protect the EU auto industry. Beijing has been accused of creating unfair competition through \"illegal subsidisation\" of Chinese EV makers.\n\nLast October, the EU opened an investigation into the matter.\n\n\"The electric vehicle sector holds huge potential for Europe's future competitiveness and green industrial leadership,\" Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said at the probe's launch.\n\n\"EU car manufacturers and related sectors are already investing and innovating to fully develop this potential. Wherever we find evidence that their efforts are being impeded by market distortions and unfair competition, we will act decisively.\"\n\nThe EU has now concluded that the subsidies are indeed unfair. With access to this state support, Chinese EV makers stand accused of artificially lowering prices.\n\nAccording to Brussels, this threatens \"economic injury\" to the bloc's carmakers. Still, not everyone in the EU supports the charges.\n\nGovernment officials and carmakers have raised several objections to the tariffs.\n\nSweden's prime minister fears the duties will escalate \"a wider trade war.\" Germany's chancellor warned the measures will also harm EU companies that import EVs from China.\n\nHungary, which has forged a strong trade partnership with Beijing, has provided sterner rebukes. \"We disagree with the brutal European punishment of Chinese electric car manufacturers with punitive tariffs,\" the country's economic ministry said last month. \"Protectionism is not the solution.\"\n\nAnother critic is German car giant Volkswagen. \"The negative effects of this decision outweigh any benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry,\" a company spokesperson said today.\n\nIndustry analysts have also questioned the EU's plans. James Edmondson, an EV expert at market intelligence firm IDTechEx, fears the plan will backfire.\n\n\"The long term impact of restricting trade with China more generally could be detrimental to EU manufacturers and adoption of EVs especially when the EU is still so reliant on China for components like EV batteries,\" he told TNW last month.\n\nInevitably, the EU has downplayed the concerns. The bloc's trade chief, Valdis Dombrovskis, said discussions with Beijing could still create a mutually beneficial outcome.\n\n\"Our aim is to... ensure fair competition and level playing field,\" Dombrovskis told Bloomberg News today. \"Therefore, once again, we do not see any basis for retaliation.\n\n\"Those talks with China are ongoing and indeed should a mutually beneficial solution emerge, we can also find ways not to apply at the end of the day the tariffs.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenextweb.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Next Web"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Chinese media suggest Beijing will trigger further probes.\n\nChinese officials have also railed against probes targeting state subsidies in the green tech sector including wind turbines and solar panels.\n\n\"It is plain for all to see who is escalating trade frictions and instigating a 'trade war',\" a spokesperson for the Chinese commerce ministry said on June 21.\n\nThe United States has already hiked customs duties on Chinese electric cars to 100 percent, while Canada is considering similar action.\n\nBut Brussels faces a delicate balancing act as it seeks to defend Europe's auto industry -- the jewel in its industrial crown with iconic brands such as Mercedes -- while avoiding a showdown with China and meeting its targets for slashing carbon emissions.\n\nThe EU aims to get more Europeans driving electric vehicles as it plans to outlaw the sale of new fossil fuel-powered cars from 2035.\n\nChinese-made vehicles' market share in EU electric car sales climbed from around three percent to more than 20 percent in the past three years, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.\n\nChinese brands account for around eight percent of that share, it said.\n\nGermany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy, alongside Austrian institutes, predicted the provisional higher taxes would reduce vehicle imports from China by 42 percent. They added that electric car prices could rise by an average of 0.3 to 0.9 percent in the EU.\n\nGerman displeasure\n\nGermany, a significant trade partner to China, is unhappy about the EU's move. German auto manufacturers fear any retaliation could hurt their activities in China.\n\nGermany's Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck visited Beijing last month on an 11th hour mission to find a way out of a damaging trade war.\n\nBut Germany's moves to appease China, like reportedly offering a compromise to lower tariffs to 15 percent, were described by some in the automotive industry as a stunt.\n\nIn contrast, French auto makers have welcomed the tariffs to level the playing field.\n\nElectric automaker Tesla, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is the only company that has asked Brussels for its own duty rate calculated based on evidence it has submitted.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The EU initiated the probe without an industry complaint, the first such trade case of this kind.\n\nThe bloc is set to confirm on Thursday provisional duties of up to 37.6% on Chinese brands such as BYD, Geely and SAIC, as well as on China-made models of Tesla, BMW and other western automakers.\n\nCarmakers are bracing for billions of dollars in new costs as a result, which analysts say could slow their European expansion.\n\nEU members will also vote in October if the Commission proposes multi-year tariffs at the end of its investigation. These would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" of at least 15 countries representing 65% of the EU population votes against them.\n\nFrance, Italy and Spain, with 40% of the EU population, have indicated they would back tariffs.\n\n\"Europe must defend itself if our companies are harmed and do not compete on equal terms,\" Spain's economy ministry said.\n\nHowever, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland and Poland were still debating the issue, official and government sources said, while Belgium has a caretaker government and the Dutch only got a government this week.\n\nNEGATIVE EFFECTS\n\nGermany has stressed the need for a negotiated solution with Beijing. Its automakers have said tariffs are the wrong approach, with the negative effects outweighing any benefits.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to influence negotiation, its auto association on Wednesday urged Brussels to drop the tariffs.\n\nIncreasing the cost of EVs for consumers undermines the EU's goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, opponents say. Tesla has said it will hike prices.\n\nBeijing's retaliation could bring extra tariffs on EU exports of cognac, pork or luxury cars.\n\nThe Commission says duties are needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies and the goal is a level playing field, not shutting Chinese car makers out, as the United States' planned 100% tariff is likely to do.\n\nTariffs could also give the EU leverage in negotiations with Beijing and push producers to make cars in the EU.\n\nHosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of thinktank the European Centre for International Political Economy, said clear majorities either way could embolden tariff opponents or supporters. He added final positions at the end of the investigation will depend on what Beijing offers in negotiations.\n\n\"If we go to a vote then, it means negotiations have failed,\" he said.\n\nThe EV investigation could just be the start for the EU as it toughens its stance on Beijing, as its green and tech companies trail global rivals, interviews with half a dozen trade experts show.\n\nThey point to a 712-page updated report on Chinese state interference and subsidies released in April as the strongest sign yet that Brussels means business.\n\nThe document is by far the most extensive undertaken by the Commission, showing it has learned a lesson from an investigation into Chinese solar panels a decade ago, when it did not impose tariffs and the EU's own industry collapsed.\n\nIt offers evidence to back its assertions that China does not play by the same rules and includes research into a wider range of industries, beyond traditional ones such as steel, including semiconductors, telecom equipment and renewable energy.\n\nThat leaves the door open to future cases.\n\n\"This is a report to set the scene and show how and why Europe is changing its policies,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, a senior fellow at Brussels-based economic thinktank Bruegel. \"To be frank, it's also a message especially for the German chancellery.\"\n\n(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop

The EU is the largest overseas market for China's EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy.\n\nEU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by \"unfair subsidisation\", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc.\n\nChina has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports.\n\nThe new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues. They are not likely to be imposed until later this year.\n\nSo who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute?\n\nIt is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels.\n\nBy imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU's decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU.\n\nThe number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E).\n\nPatryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: \"I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap. It is a really fast car and it's a rear-wheel drive like my previous car which was BMW E46.\"\n\nT&E projects firms like BYD and Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), the Chinese owner of the formerly British brand MG, could reach a market share of 20% by 2027.\n\nBut not all Chinese-made EVs will be hit equally by the new tariffs.\n\nThey were calculated based on estimates of how much state aid each firm received, while companies that cooperated with the probe saw the duties they were hit with cut. Based on these criteria, the European Commission has set individual duties on three Chinese EV brands - SAIC, BYD and Geely.\n\nSAIC has been hit with the highest new tariff of 37.6%. State-owned SAIC is the Chinese partner of Volkswagen and General Motors. It also owns MG, which produces one of the top-selling EVs in Europe, the MG4.\n\n\"The price for not cooperating is a severe blow to SAIC, which gets 15.4% of its global revenues from EV sales in Europe,\" says Rhodium Group, an independent research firm.\n\nFor Mr Krupcala, who bought his MG4 before the tariffs hit, the EU's move does not matter much: \"I don't really care about the tariffs. I have a nice car with a seven-year warranty.\"\n\nFor China's largest EV maker, BYD, it is a different story, as it faces an extra duty of 17.4% on the vehicles it ships from China to the EU.\n\nThat is the lowest increase and one that, according to research by Dutch bank ING will \"give the automaker an advantage in the European market\".\n\nLu\u00eds Filipe Costa, an insurance industry executive from Portugal, who has just bought a BYD Seal, says price was one of the deciding factors when he chose his new car.\n\nBut, he added that even if the European Commission's new tariffs had already been in place he would still have gone with BYD because \"other brands would also be affected\".\n\nPortuguese executive Lu\u00eds Filipe Costa chose a BYD Seal over Western brands\n\nGeely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, will see an additional tariff of 19.9%.\n\nAccording to Spanish bank BBVA, the company will \"still export to the EU profitably\" but \"its profits will be significantly reduced.\"\n\nOther firms, including European car makers operating factories in China or through joint ventures, will also have to pay more to bring electric cars into the EU.\n\nThose deemed to have cooperated with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while those EU investigators see as non-cooperative will pay the higher tariff of 37.6%.\n\nUS-based Tesla, which is the biggest exporter of electric vehicles from China to Europe, has asked for an individually calculated rate which EU officials have said will be determined at the end of the investigation.\n\nStill, the firm has posted a notice on some of its European websites, that prices for its Shanghai-made Model 3 could increase due to the new tariffs.\n\nLast year, businessman Lars Koopmann, who lives in the motor industry powerhouse that is Germany, bought a China-made Tesla Model Y.\n\nMr Koopmann says he particularly enjoyed the car's high-tech features, such as the large touch screen.\n\n\"Price was also a big factor that set it apart from premium German brands,\" Mr Koopmann says.\n\n\"If the tariffs had been in place, they would have always affected my decision.\"\n\nWhile some China-based exporters will be better off than others, it is clear from the European Commission's plans that all of them will be facing higher costs when shipping to Europe.\n\nThe hardest hit \"will be SAIC brands like MG... as well as joint ventures between foreign and Chinese firms in China, which often have narrower profit margins on the cars they export to Europe,\" Rhodium says.\n\n\"The biggest beneficiaries of the duties are European-based producers with limited China exposure, such as Renault.\"\n\nIn other words, the duties are likely to do as the EU hopes they would - cut the number of Chinese-made EVs coming into the region, easing pressure on local manufacturers.\n\nThere is also another result of the move - some big Chinese EV firms are planning to build production capacity in the EU, which could help shield them from the new duties.\n\nWork on BYD's first European factory is well under way in Hungary and production is expected to begin there by the end of next year.\n\nChinese car maker, Chery, has recently signed a joint-venture deal with a Spanish firm that will see the two companies making EVs and other types of cars in Barcelona.\n\nAnd, SAIC is looking to secure a site for its first factory in Europe.\n\n\"It's a well architected plan to encourage companies to shift their investments to the EU, instead of relying on exporting from China,\" said Bill Russo, from Shanghai-based consulting group Automobility.\n\n\"The fact that some companies are taxed higher than others is a signal that they will make the penalty higher or lower based on the degree the company is committed to investing in the EU.\"\n\nThe Chinese government placed its bet on EVs early on.\n\nAccording to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, between 2009 and 2023 more than $230bn (\u00a3181bn) of state support was pumped into the industry.\n\nAs a result its EV industry has become world leading.\n\nThe International Energy Agency says China accounted for more than 60% of the world's new electric car sales last year.\n\nWhile the vast majority of EVs produced in China are sold domestically, overseas markets, and particularly Europe, have become increasingly important.\n\n\"Exports are the profitable segment,\" said Rhodium's senior analyst, Gregor Sebastian.\n\n\"The EU tariffs will hurt China's EV industry because these exports help recover losses from China's domestic price war.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the world's second largest economy is struggling to shake off an economic slowdown in the wake of the pandemic and an ongoing property crisis.\n\nFaced with lower domestic consumption and investment levels, China is trying to \"export its way out\" of the slump, says Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for the Asia Pacific region at investment bank Natixis.\n\nAnd Beijing is placing yet another large bet on EVs by making the industry one of its \"New Three\" growth drivers - a government blueprint for reviving the economy that also relies on exports of batteries and renewable energy.\n\nHowever, with major markets like the US, the EU and others imposing tariffs and other barriers, it looks like China's latest gamble could deepen trade tensions with some of its largest trading partners.\n\nIf you have any stories or news that you would like to share with the global online community, please feel free to share it with us by contacting

It is offered with gasoline and full-electric drivetrains.\n\nThe European Union moved ahead with plans to impose provisional tariffs on the imports of electric vehicles made in China that would raise rates to as high as 48 percent, a step likely to escalate trade tensions with Beijing.\n\nThe EU confirmed in a news release on July 4 that under its anti-subsidy investigation, it would apply provisional duties on three Chinese manufacturers that were sampled for the investigation.\n\nMG maker SAIC Motor faces a 37.6 percent tariff on top of the existing 10 percent rate, while Geely and BYD will be hit with additional charges of 19.9 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively.\n\nOther EV producers in China that cooperated with the investigation but have not been sampled will be subject to a weighted average duty of 20.8 percent, while companies that did not cooperate will face an additional 37.6 percent levy.\n\nThe provisional duties will apply as of Friday, and definitive duties would kick in by November unless the two sides come to some kind of alternative solution or a qualified majority of EU member states block the final move.\n\nTesla may receive an individually calculated duty rate at that definitive stage following a request to be sampled.\n\nThe EU, which said that talks with China have intensified in recent weeks, said the probe concluded that China subsidizes its EV industry to a degree that causes economic harm to the bloc's automakers.\n\n\"We are continuing to engage intensively with China on a mutually acceptable solution,\" Valdis Dombrovskis, an executive vice president of the European Commission, said in a statement. \"Any negotiated outcome to our investigation must clearly and fully address EU concerns and be in respect of WTO rules.\"\n\nChina has threatened to retaliate and has already launched a targeted anti-dumping probe on pork imports. The findings of an investigation into EU spirits are due early next year but could come anytime, based on what has happened before.\n\nBeijing has warned it could hit European agricultural goods, aviation and cars with large engines. China could also decide to challenge the EU's probe at the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe EU and China have been consulting on a way forward and the two sides plan to continue conversations over the next four months.\n\nFor Brussels, any solution has to be grounded in WTO rules and address the underlying harmful subsidies the probe has identified.\n\nBeijing has looked to transform the investigation into a negotiation and has been trying to divide member states by pressuring them bilaterally, Bloomberg previously reported. Some member states, including Germany, have been pushing for a negotiated compromise.\n\nIn talks between the two sides, China had asked the EU not to introduce the provisional measures at all -- or to consider lower rates based on fewer criteria and then increase them in November if a solution could not be found before definitive tariffs are due, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBeijing has also asked whether the rates can be adjusted between now and November if the situation changes as the two sides continue to talk, the people said. Though rates can be tweaked during the process, the EU's preference is to first establish a common understanding of the facts before exploring a mutually agreed solution that adheres to WTO rules, they added.\n\nTechnical talks between the two sides will resume in the coming days, the people added.\n\nThe provisional duties are being introduced by a guarantee, and would be collected only if and when definitive duties are imposed, the EU said in a statement last month. The EU is expected to issue guidance on the form the guarantees will take.\n\nGeely and BYD declined to comment on July 4 on the provisional tariffs going into effect. SAIC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe tariffs will likely cut imports from China by a quarter, amounting to a value of roughly $4 billion, according to an estimate by Moritz Schularick, president of Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\n\nMany European automakers have made clear they are opposed to higher tariffs, with companies such as Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen Group warning against them.\n\nChina is the biggest market for Mercedes, VW and BMW.", "source": {"uri": "autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Automotive News"}, "authors": [],

The announced anti-subsidy tariffs are even higher for European companies than for Chinese companies.\n\nThe association also noted that no excessive market penetration of Chinese battery-electric vehicles is expected in the medium to long term, citing analyses suggesting that the market share of Chinese manufacturers in the overall passenger car market in Europe will likely settle in the range of 5 percent to 10 percent.\n\n\"The EU should refrain from imposing the announced anti-subsidy tariffs and find a negotiated solution with China,\" the association said.\n\nHildegard Muller, the association's president, stressed the \"imperative\" need for an open and constructive dialogue between China and the European Commission to find a resolution. \"We wholeheartedly endorse this approach and urge both sides to successfully conclude negotiations,\" she said.\n\nThe European Commission noted that consultations with the Chinese government have intensified recently, and contacts continue at a technical level to reach a WTO-compatible solution.\n\nThe provisional duties, slightly adjusted from earlier pre-disclosed rates, will apply for a maximum of four months. A final decision on definitive duties will be voted on by EU member states. If adopted, the duties would be in place for five years.\n\nOn Thursday, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said that China hopes that the EU will work with it in the same direction and show sincerity in advancing the consultation concerning the EU's anti-subsidy probe into Chinese electric vehicles.\n\nThe consultation should be based on facts and rules and should result in a solution that is acceptable for both sides as soon as possible, MOC spokesperson He Yadong said at a press briefing. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BYD Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SAIC Motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protectionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geely", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinhua_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xinhua News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Zipse", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oliver Zipse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verband_der_Automobilindustrie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Verband der Automobilindustrie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 10, "textEnd": 16}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The EU initiated the probe without an industry complaint, the first such trade case of this kind.\n\nThe bloc is set to confirm on Thursday provisional duties of up to 37.6% on Chinese brands such as BYD, Geely and SAIC, as well as on China-made models of Tesla, BMW and other western automakers.\n\nEU members will also vote in October if the Commission proposes multi-year tariffs at the end of its investigation. These would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" if at least 15 countries representing 65% of the EU population votes against them.\n\nFrance, Italy and Spain, with 40% of the EU population, have indicated they would back tariffs.\n\n\"Europe must defend itself if our companies are harmed and do not compete on equal terms,\" Spain's economy ministry said.\n\nHowever, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland and Poland were still debating the issue, official and government sources said, while Belgium has a caretaker government and the Dutch only got a government this week.\n\nNEGATIVE EFFECTS\n\nGermany has stressed the need for a negotiated solution with Beijing. Its automakers have said tariffs are the wrong approach, with the negative effects outweighing any benefits.\n\nIncreasing the cost of EVs for consumers undermines the EU's goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, opponents say. Tesla has said it will hike prices.\n\nBeijing's retaliation could bring extra tariffs on EU exports of cognac, pork or luxury cars.\n\nThe Commission says duties are needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies and the goal is a level playing field, not shutting Chinese car makers out, as the United States' planned 100% tariff is likely to do.\n\nTariffs could also give the EU leverage in negotiations with Beijing and push producers to make cars in the EU.\n\nHosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of thinktank the European Centre for International Political Economy, said clear majorities either way could embolden tariff opponents or supporters. He added final positions at the end of the investigation will depend on what Beijing offers in negotiations.\n\n\"If we go to a vote then, it means negotiations have failed,\" he said.\n\nThe EV investigation could just be the start for the EU as it toughens its stance on Beijing, as its green and tech companies trail global rivals, interviews with half a dozen trade experts show.\n\nThey point to a 712-page updated report on Chinese state interference and subsidies released in April as the strongest sign yet that Brussels means business.\n\nThe document is by far the most extensive undertaken by the Commission, showing it has learned a lesson from an investigation into Chinese solar panels a decade ago, when it did not impose tariffs and the EU's own industry collapsed.\n\nIt offers proof to back its assertions that China does not play by the same rules and includes research into a wider range of industries, beyond traditional ones such as steel, including semiconductors, telecom equipment and renewable energy.\n\nThat leaves the door open to future cases.\n\n\"This is a report to set the scene and show how and why Europe is changing its policies,\" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, a senior fellow at Brussels-based economic thinktank Bruegel. \"To be frank, it's also a message especially for the German chancellery.\"\n\n(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop and Nick Carey;

MG maker SAIC Motor Corp. faces a 37.6% tariff on top of the existing 10% rate, while Volvo Car AB owner Geely and BYD Co. will be hit with additional charges of 19.9% and 17.4%, respectively.\n\nOther EV producers in China that cooperated with the investigation but have not been sampled will be subject to a weighted average duty of 20.8%, while firms that didn't cooperate will face an additional 37.6% levy.\n\nThe provisional duties will apply as of Friday, and definitive duties would kick in by November unless the two sides come to some kind of alternative solution or a qualified majority of EU member states block the final move. Tesla Inc. may receive an individually calculated duty rate at that definitive stage following a request to be sampled.\n\nThe EU, which said that talks with China have intensified in recent weeks, said the probe concluded that China subsidizes its EV industry to a degree that causes economic harm to the bloc's carmakers.\n\n\"Those talks with China are ongoing,\" Valdis Dombrovskis, an executive vice president of the European Commission, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television with Francine Lacqua. \"Should a mutually beneficial solution emerge, we can also find ways then not to apply at the end of the day the definitive tariffs. but it's very clear that this solution needs to resolve this market distortion we're currently having.\"\n\nChina has threatened to retaliate and has already launched a targeted anti-dumping probe on pork imports. The findings of an investigation into EU spirits are due early next year but could come anytime, based on what's happened before. Beijing has warned it could hit European agricultural goods, aviation and cars with large engines. China could also decide to challenge the EU's probe at the World Trade Organization.\n\n\"We are not seeing the basis for retaliation as what we are conducting is indeed in line with WTO rules,\" Dombrovskis said.\n\nThe EU and China have been consulting on a way forward and the two sides plan to continue conversations over the next four months.\n\nFor Brussels, any solution has to be grounded in WTO rules and address the underlying harmful subsidies the probe has identified. Beijing has looked to transform the investigation into a negotiation and has been trying to divide member states by pressuring them bilaterally, Bloomberg previously reported. Some member states, including Germany, have been pushing for a negotiated compromise.\n\nIn talks between the two sides, China had asked the EU not to introduce the provisional measures at all -- or to consider lower rates based on fewer criteria and then increase them in November if a solution couldn't be found before definitive tariffs are due, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBeijing has also asked whether the rates can be adjusted between now and November if the situation changes as the two sides continue to talk, the people said. Though rates can be tweaked during the process, the EU's preference is to first establish a common understanding of the facts before exploring a mutually agreed solution that adheres to WTO rules, they added.\n\nTechnical talks between the two sides will resume in the coming days, the people added.\n\nThe provisional duties are being introduced by a guarantee, and would be collected only if and when definitive duties are imposed, the EU said in a statement last month. The EU is expected to issue guidance on the form the guarantees will take.\n\nZhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. and BYD declined to comment Thursday on the provisional tariffs going into effect. SAIC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe tariffs will likely cut imports from China by a quarter, amounting to a value of roughly $4 billion, according to an estimate by Moritz Schularick, president of Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\n\nMany European carmakers have made clear they're opposed to higher tariffs, with companies like Mercedes-Benz Group AG and Volkswagen AG warning against them. China is the biggest market for Mercedes, VW and BMW AG.\n\nBMW CEO Oliver Zipse said the tariffs are a \"dead end\" and won't strengthen European carmaklers.\n\n\"On the contrary: It not only harms the business model of globally active companies, it also limits the supply of electric cars to European customers and can therefore even slow down decarbonization in the transport sector,\" he said in a statement.\n\n--With assistance from James Mayger, Lyubov Pronina and Wilfried Eckl-Dorna.\n\n(Updates with Dombrovskis interview, BMW reaction starting in sixth paragraph)", "source": {"uri":

Chinese media suggest Beijing will trigger further probes.\n\nChinese officials have also railed against probes targeting state subsidies in the green tech sector including wind turbines and solar panels.\n\n\"It is plain for all to see who is escalating trade frictions and instigating a 'trade war',\" a spokesperson for the Chinese commerce ministry said on June 21.\n\nThe United States has already hiked customs duties on Chinese electric cars to 100 per cent, while Canada is considering similar action.\n\nBut Brussels faces a delicate balancing act as it seeks to defend Europe's auto industry -- the jewel in its industrial crown with iconic brands such as Mercedes -- while avoiding a showdown with China and meeting its targets for slashing carbon emissions.\n\nThe EU aims to get more Europeans driving electric vehicles as it plans to outlaw the sale of new fossil fuel-powered cars from 2035.\n\nChinese-made vehicles' market share in EU electric car sales climbed from around three per cent to more than 20 per cent in the past three years, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.\n\nChinese brands account for around eight per cent of that share, it said.\n\nGermany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy, alongside Austrian institutes, predicted the provisional higher taxes would reduce vehicle imports from China by 42 per cent. They added that electric car prices could rise by an average of 0.3 to 0.9 per cent in the EU.\n\nGerman displeasure\n\nGermany, a significant trade partner to China, is unhappy about the EU's move. German auto manufacturers fear any retaliation could hurt their activities in China.\n\nGermany's Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck visited Beijing last month on an 11th hour mission to find a way out of a damaging trade war.\n\nBut Germany's moves to appease China, like reportedly offering a compromise to lower tariffs to 15 per cent, were described by some in the automotive industry as a stunt.\n\nIn contrast, French auto makers have welcomed the tariffs to level the playing field.\n\nElectric automaker Tesla, owned by tech billionaire Elon Musk, is the only company that has asked Brussels for its own duty rate calculated based on evidence it has submitted. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Brussels is seeking to stem a flood of low-priced EVs from the Asian economic superpower to protect its own manufacturers.\n\nThe provisional extra duties of up to 38% will apply from July 5 for a maximum duration of four months, according to a press release issued by the European Commission on Thursday.\n\nCar maker BYD will be subject to a 17.4% tariff, while Geely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, is facing a 19.9% tariff. Other car makers that cooperated with the investigation will face an average duty of 20.8%. The duty for other non-cooperating companies will be 37.6%, the release states.\n\nThe measures are in addition to the current 10% tariff levied on all electric cars imported from China.\n\nThe decision comes nine months after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced an investigation into a flood of cheap Chinese cars entering the bloc. Based on the results of the probe, the Commission concluded that the battery electric vehicles (BEV) \"value chain\" in China benefits from \"unfair subsidization,\" which is causing a \"threat of economic injury\" to EU car makers.\n\nA definitive decision on the tariffs is due by November, while talks will continue between Brussels and Beijing in a bid to resolve the issue.\n\nWhen the plans for new EV duties were announced last month, China's commerce ministry warned that the EU could trigger a \"trade war\" if it continues to escalate tensions. Beijing also accused the bloc of unfair practices during its anti-subsidy probe, and responded by launching an anti-dumping investigation in relation to certain pork products from the EU.\n\nThe EU is the largest overseas market for Chinese EV makers. While Chinese imports into Europe have largely been dominated by Tesla, Dacia and BMW cars produced there, Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E) has projected that Chinese brands could reach 11% of the European EV market in 2024, and 20% in 2027.\n\nREAD MORE: Musk blasts US tariffs on China\n\nChinese automakers have actively penetrated foreign markets in recent years and are steadily closing the gap with Western rivals, particularly in terms of electric cars.\n\nThe EU's move comes after the US raised its tariff on Chinese EVs from 25% to 100% in May.", "source": {"uri": "europesun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "europesun.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BYD Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geely", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_von_der_Leyen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ursula von der Leyen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volvo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013United_States_trade_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China\u2013United States trade war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dumping (pricing policy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines_and_E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Magazines and E-zines", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Classifieds/Automotive", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric_Vehicles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Electric Vehicles", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit_Cars_and_Replicas", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Kit Cars and Replicas", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image_Galleries", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos/Image Galleries", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/YjNmNjBhYTAtYzg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 388, "textEnd": 394}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The final tariff levels will be set by November.\n\nWhile China has opposed the decision, it has expressed willingness to smooth things over.\n\n\"If the EU is sincere in sitting down at the negotiating table, China is also willing to accommodate each other's reasonable concerns through dialogue and consultation,\" China's Ministry of Commerce said in a Facebook post.\n\nThe country is keen to \"avoid the expansion and escalation of trade frictions in a rational and professional manner\", it said.\n\nHowever, Beijing has made clear its \"strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition\" to the EU's move, pointing out that the probe employed \"inappropriate practices\" that breached WTO rules, and that the \"disproportionately high tariffs\" are aimed at \"suppressing the development of Chinese enterprises\".\n\nSo far, China has threatened only \"necessary actions\", which include filing a lawsuit with the WTO, but any retaliation would not be a surprise.\n\n\"China may retaliate by increasing tariffs on European goods, such as luxury cars and other high-value items, potentially escalating trade tensions,\" Mr Pavel said.\n\nAny Chinese retaliation would bring back shades of its trade war with the US under the administration of former president Donald Trump. That's what Germany, through its Transport Minister Volker Wissing, has expressed.\n\n\"Vehicles must become cheaper through more competition, open markets and significantly better location conditions in the EU, not through trade wars and market isolation,\" he said on a translated post on X.\n\nHungary's Minister for National Economy, Marton Nagy, called the EU's tariffs \"brutal\", arguing that \"excessive protectionism is not the solution\".\n\nEven the European car industry has opposed the duties. Stellantis, Europe's second-largest car manufacturer and the owner of the Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Maserati and Peugeot brands, said it would not support actions that \"contribute to the world fragmentation\" of trade.\n\nVolkswagen Group, Europe's biggest car maker, which has a partnership with Shanghai-based Saic, said in a statement that \"the timing of the EU Commission's decision is detrimental to the current weak demand for BEV vehicles in Germany and Europe\".\n\n\"The Volkswagen Group confidently accepts the growing international competition, including from China, and sees this as an opportunity. This also benefits our customers.\"\n\nWith the levies, prices of imported Chinese EVs in Europe are expected to rise, meaning consumers will bear the brunt of higher costs - in addition to limiting adoption rates and choices.\n\nThose who oppose the tariffs also \"fear it could harm existing commercial ties with China\", Mr Pavel said.\n\nHowever, the impact on Chinese EV makers could be only for the short term and limited in the long run, as they primarily serve the domestic market, Mr Pavel said.\n\nIn terms of financial impact, the affected Chinese EV companies are unlikely to be too worried about the EU's tariffs, given their good performance so far, said Chris Weston, head of research at broker Pepperstone.\n\n\"If the EU is about to impose tariffs of 38 per cent on Chinese EVs, then either it's in the price, or shareholders aren't overly nervous about a sizeable hit to earnings,\" he told The National.\n\nHe pointed out that while BYD has been off its recent highs, it still had good returns throughout June and most investors expect its profit margins to remain healthy, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the situation could also present an opportunity for Chinese car makers to establish bases in other countries - those in Europe included - to soften the blow of any tariffs, Mr Dahrieh said.\n\nThey are \"likely to intensify efforts to diversify into other markets such as the Middle East and Latin America, accelerate plans to relocate production to the EU and establish partnerships with European firms to mitigate the effects of the tariffs in the long run\", he said.\n\nAlso, there is no substantial evidence to suggest that Chinese EVs are of lesser quality, said Mark Greeven, a professor of innovation and strategy at the International Institute for Management Development.\n\n\"Generally, even according to auto executives from other countries, output from Chinese factories is far from low-quality,\" he wrote in a report last month on the IMD's website.\n\n\"In reality, they are innovative; [China has] high-end vehicles that often outperform German, Japanese and US competitors, barring Tesla, at least from the consumer's and technology's point of view.\"\n\nThe US in May announced that it would be imposing 100 per cent tariffs on imported Chinese EVs and 25 per cent on EV batteries, part of a series of measures aimed at protecting manufacturers in the world's biggest economy. Even Canada on June 24 said it was considering such measures.\n\nExports of Chinese EVs, which typically sell for 20 per cent less than their European counterparts, have quadrupled since 2021, reaching $34 billion last year, data from Statista shows.\n\nWhile the US has been largely unaffected by this surge - it imported less than $400 million worth of EVs from China last year - the tariff increase can be seen as a \"pre-emptive strike to protect US car makers from new, potentially unfair competition from abroad\", said Felix Richter, a senior editor at the German data intelligence firm.\n\nThere is also no evidence that the EU's decision is being influenced by the US: Washington's move is seen as more symbolic as there are currently hardly any EVs that are shipped into the US from China, analysts at Dutch financial group ING said.\n\nThe EU's move is driven by a real economic threat rather than merely playing catch-up with the US, agreed Mr Pavel.\n\n\"The EU's tariffs ... aim to level the playing field without triggering a full-scale trade war. Despite internal opposition within the EU, the tariffs reflect a strategic effort to protect its economic interests against the competitive threat posed by subsidised Chinese EVs,\" he said.\n\nIf the EU decides against imposing the tariffs - or at least bringing it down to levels more acceptable to Beijing - it could diffuse tensions, prevent another trade war and, notably, avoid internal conflict within the bloc.\n\nSuch a move could improve trade relations with China, maintain Chinese EV manufacturers' competitive advantage in Europe and stimulate broader adoption of EVs among European consumers, Mr Dahrieh said.\n\nMr Pavel added: \"Overall, removing the tariffs could lead to a more stable and co-operative trade environment, fostering economic integration between the EU and China, while also maintaining a more cohesive internal EU stance on trade policies.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri":

vehicles", "body": "Volkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, warns extra duties will not strengthen Europe's auto industry.\n\nThe European Union has imposed extra duties of up to 37.6 percent on imports of electric vehicles (EVs) made in China, the bloc announced, despite Beijing's warnings the move would unleash a trade war.\n\nThe European Commission said on Thursday that the tariffs were put in place because of \"unfair\" state subsidies and will kick off on Friday.\n\nThere is, however, a four-month window during which the tariffs are only provisional and talks are expected to continue between the two sides.\n\nThe Commission, the EU's executive, launched an investigation last year into Chinese EV manufacturers on whether state subsidies were unfairly undercutting European carmakers.\n\nAfter four months, when the probe concludes, the Commission could propose \"definite duties\" that would apply for five years and on which the 27-member bloc would vote.\n\nThe move raises duties from the current level of 10 percent as trade spats widen between the EU and China, especially focusing on green technologies.\n\nThe provisional duties of between 17.4 percent and 37.6 percent, without backdating, are designed to prevent what Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said is a threatened flood of cheap EVs built by state subsidies.\n\nThe Chinese government has previously said it would take \"all necessary measures\" to safeguard the country's interests, which could include retaliatory tariffs on exports to China of products such as cognac or pork.\n\nThe United States has already hiked customs duties on Chinese EVs to 100 percent, while Canada is considering similar action.\n\n\"There is still a four-month window before arbitration, and we hope that the European and Chinese sides will move in the same direction, show sincerity, and push forward with the consultation process as soon as possible,\" said He Yadong, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Commerce.\n\nThe duties on Chinese manufacturers include 17.4 percent for BYD, 19.9 percent for Geely and 37.6 percent for SAIC, the EU said.\n\nCompanies deemed by the EU to have cooperated with the antisubsidy investigation, including western carmakers Tesla and BMW, will be subject to 20.8 percent tariffs and those that did not cooperate a rate of 37.6 percent.\n\nThe Commission has estimated Chinese brands' share of the EU market has risen to 8 percent from below 1 percent in 2019 and could reach 15 percent in 2025.\n\nIt said prices are about 20 percent below those of EU-made models.\n\nVolkswagen, Europe's biggest carmaker, slammed the proposed tariffs and warned they would not strengthen Europe's car industry in the long term.\n\n\"The negative effects

EU imposes duties on Chinese EVs", "body": "The European Union has imposed additional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles (EVs), ranging from 17.4% to 37.6% for individual manufacturers. This is over and above the existing 10% duty on all EVs imported from China, potentially escalating the cost of EVs across the EU. The move is also seen as a significant blow to Beijing, which is already embroiled in a trade war with US. The new charges are provisional, and are likely to come into effect later this year.\n\nThe EU is the largest overseas market for China's EV industry, which relies heavily on high-tech products to boost its struggling economy. The EU officials attribute the surge in imports to \"unfair subsidization,\" enabling Chinese-made EVs to be sold at significantly lower prices. This decision also impacts Western firms manufacturing cars in China, as EU aims to rectify what it perceives as a distorted market.\n\nAccording to Brussels-based Transport and Environment (T&E), the total number of EVs sold by Chinese brands in the EU rose from 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to nearly 8% last year. The new tariffs were calculated as per estimates of state aid each firm received, with companies cooperating with the probe seeing reduced duties. The European Commission has set duties on three major Chinese EV brands: SAIC, BYD, and Geely.\n\nSAIC, a state-owned company that partners with Volkswagen and General Motors, faces the highest new tariff of 37.6%. BYD, China's largest EV maker, will see an additional duty of 17.4% on vehicles it ships to the EU. Geely, owner of Sweden's Volvo Cars, will be subjected to an extra tariff of 19.9%. These tariffs are expected to give certain automakers an advantage in the European market according to research by Dutch bank ING.\n\nEuropean car makers operating factories in China or via joint ventures will also face increased costs to import EVs into the EU. Those deemed cooperative with the probe will face an extra duty of 20.8%, while non-cooperative ones will pay a higher tariff of 37.6%. US-based Tesla, the largest exporter of EVs from China to Europe, has requested an individually calculated rate which EU officials said would be determined at the investigation's end.\n\nIn response to the new tariffs, some major Chinese EV firms are planning to establish production capacity in the EU to potentially shield themselves from new duties. BYD's first European factory is already under construction in Hungary, with production expected to start by next year's end. Similarly, Chinese car maker Chery has recently signed a joint-venture with a Spanish firm for manufacturing EVs and other cars in Barcelona. SAIC is also seeking a site for its first European factory.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013United_States_trade_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China\u2013United States trade war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BYD Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SAIC Motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Motors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geely", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chery", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volvo", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volvo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sweden"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l10720240704165954.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Brussels is seeking to stem a flood of low-priced EVs from the Asian economic superpower to protect its own manufacturers.\n\nThe provisional extra duties of up to 38% will apply from July 5 for a maximum duration of four months, according to a press release issued by the European Commission on Thursday.\n\nCar maker BYD will be subject to a 17.4% tariff, while Geely, which owns Sweden's Volvo, is facing a 19.9% tariff.

Based on the results of the probe, the Commission concluded that the battery electric vehicles (BEV) \"value chain\" in China benefits from \"unfair subsidization,\" which is causing a \"threat of economic injury\" to EU car makers.\n\nA definitive decision on the tariffs is due by November, while talks will continue between Brussels and Beijing in a bid to resolve the issue.\n\nWhen the plans for new EV duties were announced last month, China's commerce ministry warned that the EU could trigger a \"trade war\" if it continues to escalate tensions. Beijing also accused the bloc of unfair practices during its anti-subsidy probe, and responded by launching an anti-dumping investigation in relation to certain pork products from the EU.\n\nThe EU is the largest overseas market for Chinese EV makers.

This means that from Thursday, when the EU starts imposing provisional tariffs -- until the final tariff rates are determined -- China has about four months to engage in talks with the EU and relevant member states.\n\nNoting that there are different voices within the EU, Hu Zinan, a researcher at the German Studies Center of Tongji University in Shanghai, believes that such talks will be challenging, as the discussions will encompass more than just tariff levels on Chinese EVs exported to Europe.\n\nSharing similar views, Ding Rijia, a professor specializing in industrial economy at the China University of Mining and Technology in Beijing, said that if China retaliates with reciprocal tariffs, such as higher duties on large-displacement gasoline vehicle imports from Europe or restricted exports of critical materials like rare earths and lithium, it would severely drive up costs.\n\nChina-EU trade declined 1.3 percent year-on-year to 2.23 trillion yuan ($307 billion) in the first five months, statistics from the General Administration of Customs showed.\n\nMatthias Loebich, partner and leader for international business at BearingPoint, a European management and technology consultancy with more than 10,000 employees across 70 countries and regions, said that China's fast-growing EV sector will continue to lead the world's green transition and create enormous growth opportunities for upstream and downstream industries in both domestic and global markets in the years ahead.\n\n\"This is evident in our doubling of Chinese automotive clients seeking consulting support over the past two years,\" said Loebich, noting that Chinese automakers are enhancing their internal capabilities in management, digital transformation and overseas strategies, learning from advanced markets to elevate their global presence.\n\nThat sentiment is in line with the latest trend. China's new energy vehicles are becoming popular in overseas markets thanks to their quality, driving range as well as multiple functionality.\n\nA total of 519,000 EVs and plugin hybrids were shipped overseas from China between January and May, up 13.7 percent year-on-year, said the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_International_Business_and_Economics_(Beijing)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of International Business and Economics (Beijing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Open_(snooker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China Open (snooker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yue_Chinese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yue Chinese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongji_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tongji University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_University_of_Mining_and_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China University of Mining and Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Administration_of_Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Administration of Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_element", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rare-earth element"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lithium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-02", "textStart": 1543, "textEnd": 1548}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The executive made adjustments after companies identified minor calculation errors in the initial disclosure.\n\nThese are on top of the EU's standard 10% tariff for car imports.\n\nWHAT ARE PROVISIONAL MEASURES?\n\nProvisional duties can be imposed for a maximum of nine months after the start of an EU anti-subsidy investigation if the Commission concludes it needs to prevent injury to EU industry.\n\nThey can be applied for up to four months, by which point the Commission will decide whether to apply final duties, known as definitive duties. In the EV case, the deadline for this is Nov. 2.\n\nProvisional duties are only collected if definitive duties are imposed at the end of the investigation. If definitive duties are lower or not applied, then provisional duties are adjusted down accordingly. Until then, customs authorities normally just require a bank guarantee from importers.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nThe European Commission has held technical talks with Chinese officials and said that any negotiated outcome must effectively address the injurious subsidies.\n\nAfter the announcement of provisional duties in the EU official journal, detailing the ongoing investigation and its findings, interested parties such as China and EV producers have until July 18 to comment. They can also request a hearing.\n\nThe Commission already visited more than 100 sites of automakers in China and Europe and done the bulk of its investigation.\n\nIts final report generally reads as a confirmation of its provisional findings, with possible adjustments following comments received.\n\nDefinitive duties are often a little lower than the provisional rates, reflecting an acceptance of some of these arguments.\n\nAlso Read | EU and China set for talks on planned electric vehicle tariffs\n\nOne new element will be Tesla's request the Commission calculate a separate duty rate for it.\n\nThe largest EV exporter from China to Europe will want to have a lower rate than the 20.8% for companies that have cooperated with the investigation, a group it is in.\n\nAs an alternative to duties, exporters can commit to selling their products at or above a minimum price. Chinese exporters agreed such an undertaking in the case of solar panels a decade ago. However, cars are not commodities, so it is hard to see how a minimum price could be applied.\n\nWHO DECIDES?\n\nAt the provisional stage, the Commission has full power to impose duties, although it consults EU members and is supposed to take their positions into account. They are to submit their positions by July 15.\n\nEU members wavering over whether to back additional tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles, highlighting Brussels' challenge in building support for its largest trade case yet as Beijing threatens wide-ranging retaliation.\n\nAt the end of the investigation, the Commission can propose definitive duties, normally applying for five years.\n\nIts proposal could be blocked if a qualified majority of the European Union's 27 members is opposed. A qualified majority means 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU population. In most cases, there is no blocking majority.\n\nAlso Read | Why electric vehicles are at the heart of trade frictions between China and Europe\n\nWHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE INVESTIGATION?\n\nAny company not in the sample group of BYD, Geely and SAIC that wishes to have its own individual duty can ask for an \"accelerated review\" just after the imposition of definitive measures. Such a review should last a maximum of nine months.\n\nThe Commission can also carry out an \"interim review\" after a year has elapsed if the measures are no longer necessary or if they are not sufficient to counteract subsidies.\n\nThe Commission itself often looks into whether producers are evading duties via exports of parts for assembly elsewhere. For the EU, such circumvention exists if 60% or more of the value of parts are imported from the country subject to duties and if the value added in the assembly is no more than 25%.\n\nCompanies can challenge the measures at the European Court of Justice. China can take the European Union to the World Trade Organization. Both legal paths can take well over a year.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@indianexpress.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BYD Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_panel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solar panel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geely", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/International_Business_and_Trade/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/International Business and Trade/Import and Export", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Import and Export", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/07/Untitled-design-78.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-02", "textStart": 1094, "textEnd": 1100}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-18", "textStart": 1765, "textEnd": 1772}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-15", "textStart": 3045, "textEnd": 3052}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The figure is 0.5% below the initial published figure following negotiations.\n\nBYD must pay an additional 17.4% tariff and Geely (owner of Lotus, Polestar and Volvo) an extra 19.9%, according to a European Commission statement.\n\nOther Chinese firms are hit with either a 20.8% additional tariff if they co-operated or 37.6% if they didn't.\n\nThose that did include eGT New Energy Automotive, which builds the Dacia Spring, and BMW Brilliance Automotive Ltd, which makes the BMW iX3.\n\nThose that didn't include Spotlight Automotive, a joint venture between BMW and Great Wall Motor that makes the electric Mini Cooper.\n\nCheaper Chinese EVs \"cause a threat of economic injury to EU BEV producers\", the European Commission said in statement. It applied extra tariffs after concluding that the BEV value chain in China \"benefits from unfair subsidisation\".\n\nGerman car makers have been vocal in their opposition in the tariffs. Mercedes-Benz, BMW and the Volkswagen Group sell more cars in China than any other market, and the imposition of tariffs risk a retaliation from China that might threaten their high-profit export of high-end ICE cars to China.\n\nChina has been targeting Germany specifically to pressure the European Commission into dropping the extra tariffs.\n\nThe provisional tariffs will last for four months, after which 'permanent' tariffs will be applied, lasting for five years.\n\nNegotiations with China are ongoing to reach \"a WTO-compatible solution\", the European Commission said, in reference to the World Trade Organisation.\n\nThe EU is the biggest export destination for Chinese EVs, representing 33% of the total in 2023, the European Commission noted.\n\nIn a report explaining its decision, it said: \"Prices of BEVs on the [EU] market are significantly higher than prices of BEVs on the Chinese market and therefore provide to the Chinese exporting producers the opportunity to realize higher profits.\"\n\nThe EU market is also attractive due to legislative push to increase EV sales and so reduce average CO2 levels.", "source": {"uri": "autocar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

A negotiated solution in which China makes binding commitments to reduce state subsidies would be the best way forward.\"\n\nHowever, G\u00f6nner also warned against \"national solo efforts\", saying they would \"not only weaken the position of the EU Commission in the ongoing proceedings but also jeopardise the use of trade policy safeguards\".\n\n\"The BDI appeals to the EU Commission and member states to demonstrate unity to the outside world,\" she said.\n\n\"The Commission's negotiating line should reflect the diversity of interests in the EU,\" she said, adding the bloc should strike a new balance between \"the right approach to industrial policy and open markets.\"\n\nOn Wednesday (3 July), the German car industry association VDA urged the Commission to withdraw the tariffs, citing figures showing \"German manufacturers sold around 10 times as many electric cars in China as Chinese brands in Germany, and around 100 times as many cars in total.\"\n\nAsked about the plea on Wednesday, German Economy Minister Robert Habeck (Greens) - who has proactively pressed for a conciliatory agreement with China - did not want to share the VDA's appeal but said he hoped for a \"negotiated solution\".\n\nHabeck said there was \"room for diplomacy\". \"If you say: look, we're on a good path to an agreement now, we'll push the date a little further - I wouldn't object to that.\"\n\nKiel economists map out tariff consequences, suggest ditching existing duties\n\nMeanwhile, analysts from the influential economic policy think tank Kiel Institute said in a note on Thursday the newly imposed tariffs are set to curb Chinese car imports by a huge 42% in the long term - but should be largely offset by increased European sales and imports from third countries.\n\nThe German-based research centre, alongside the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) and the Supply Chain Intelligence Institute Austria, also forecast that the duties \"will have a negligible long-term impact on vehicle prices,\" which \"might rise by an average of 0.3 to 0.9% \" in the EU.\n\nEV prices in China, meanwhile, could decrease, they added. Overall, \"short-term effects could be more pronounced,\" the analysts said.\n\nIn terms of value added, the new tariffs are expected to add 0.4% across the European car industry, while the Chinese sector is projected to lose about 0.6%.\n\nHowever, the group of economists suggested the EU should focus on an alternative scenario, based on eliminating the existing 10% import duties the bloc applies \"on cars from World Trade Organisation member countries without a free trade agreement.\"\n\nIf only countervailing tariffs were applied - i.e. those Europe imposes on EVs to offset the effect of Chinese state subsidies on market prices - imports from China would \"only decrease by about 20%, while imports from third countries would increase by over 1%\". Meanwhile, EV prices in Europe would drop by up to 0.8%.\n\nThis scenario, the analysts argued, \"would enhance EU welfare more than the pure countervailing duty scenario, and the green transformation would benefit from more 'fair trade' \".\n\n\"This approach could demonstrate what the new trade policy doctrine, which aims for trade policy to be 'open, sustainable, and assertive,' means in practice,\" said WIFO's Director Gabriel Felbermayr.", "source": {"uri": "euractiv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurActiv.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It said talks with China have intensified in recent weeks.\n\n\"Those talks with China are ongoing,\" Valdis Dombrovskis, an executive vice president of the European Commission, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.\n\n\"Should a mutually beneficial solution emerge, we can also find ways then not to apply ... the definitive tariffs. But it's very clear that this solution needs to resolve this market distortion we're currently having.\"\n\nBeijing has warned the move could affect imports of European agricultural goods, aviation and cars with large engines. China could also decide to challenge the EU's probe at the World Trade Organisation.\n\n\"We are not seeing the basis for retaliation as what we are conducting is indeed in line with WTO rules,\" Mr Dombrovskis said.\n\nThe EU and China have been consulting on a way forward and the two sides plan to continue conversations over the next four months.\n\nFor Brussels, any solution has to be grounded in WTO rules and address the underlying harmful subsidies the probe has identified.\n\nBeijing has looked to transform the investigation into a negotiation and has been trying to divide member states by pressuring them bilaterally, Bloomberg previously reported.\n\nSome member states, including Germany, have been pushing for a negotiated compromise.\n\nIn talks between the two sides, China had asked the EU not to introduce the provisional measures at all or to consider lower rates based on fewer criteria and then increase them in November if a solution could not be found before definitive tariffs are due, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nBeijing has also asked whether the rates can be adjusted between now and November if the situation changes as the two sides continue to talk, the sources said.\n\nThough rates can be tweaked during the process, the EU's preference is to first establish a common understanding of the facts before exploring a mutually agreed solution that adheres to WTO rules, they added.\n\nTechnical talks between the two sides will resume in the coming days, they added.\n\nThe provisional duties are being introduced by a guarantee, and would be collected only if and when definitive duties are imposed, the EU said in a statement last month. The EU is expected to issue guidance on the form the guarantees will take.\n\nZhejiang Geely Holding Group and BYD declined to comment on Thursday. Saic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe tariffs will probably cut imports from China by a quarter, amounting to roughly $4 billion, according to an estimate by Moritz Schularick, president of Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy.\n\nMany European car makers have said they are opposed to higher tariffs, with companies such as Mercedes-Benz Group and Volkswagen warning against them. China is the biggest market for Mercedes, VW and BMW.\n\nBMW chief executive Oliver Zipse said the tariffs are a \"dead end\" and will not strengthen European car makers.\n\n\"On the contrary: it not only harms the business model of globally active companies, it also limits the supply of electric cars to European customers and can therefore even slow down decarbonisation in the transport sector,\"

China, for its part, appears to be preparing for a food fight.\n\nOver the last six months, China has launched anti-dumping investigations into European pork and brandy, while Chinese state media reports have hinted that dairy products and other items might also be on the table. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce has made no explicit connection between the investigations and Europe's EV restrictions, but trade experts say these are among the products China might target if it chooses to retaliate with its own tariffs in the coming months.\n\nThe impending showdown is the latest front in a growing worldwide confrontation with China over its export of cheap clean energy products. The tide of exports, from solar panels to electric vehicles, has allowed countries to lower emissions at a discount, but at the same time, it has threatened domestic manufacturing from the United States to Germany and beyond.\n\nHow China responds to the EU's tariffs in the coming months will be an important indicator in its efforts to head off this wider barrage of trade challenges. China is trying to keep the EU, its second-largest trading partner, and other countries from following the protectionist path paved by the United States.\n\nChina likely saw the United States as a \"lost cause\" when it came to responding to EV tariffs imposed by the Biden administration in May, said Gregor Sebastian, a senior analyst at Rhodium Group based in Berlin. But the EU has taken a more moderate approach, with the preliminary tariffs capped at 48 percent rather than the 100 percent set by the United States. China is still hopeful that it can maintain some market access in the EU, and it now has until November, when the tariffs are set to be finalized, to negotiate.\n\n\"It's not just about the EU itself; China wants to use this as a model, to show how these issues can be resolved through negotiation,\" said Zhao Yongsheng, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.\n\nChina and the EU are now entering the first phase of that negotiation process. The two sides agreed to begin talks on June 22, with China hoping to broker a last-minute deal to head off the preliminary tariffs. With a deal unlikely to come through, the tariffs will go into effect as scheduled on July 4, and China most certainly will take retaliatory action. \"China urges the EU to immediately correct its wrong practices,\" said a Ministry of Commerce spokesperson in a press statement on June 12, adding that it \"will resolutely take all necessary measures to firmly defend the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.\"\n\nChina's basket of potential retaliatory measures reflects its balancing act -- at once trying to demonstrate its leverage without further alienating the EU. European and Chinese trade experts told Foreign Policy that China will likely target products that meet several conditions: The product should be valuable to the EU as an export but not so critical as to be overly escalatory; it shouldn't fall within China's core interests; it should come from a country with significant leverage in the EU; and it should activate a core political group in that country to lobby against the tariffs.\n\n\"The idea is to sow discord among EU member states and dilute a collective response,\" said Janka Oertel, director of the Asia program at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \"The strategy has worked in the past.\"\n\nBrandy may seem like a niche product to target, but it meets Beijing's criteria. Perhaps most critically, 99 percent of China's brandy comes from France, which supported the charge to protect the EU EV industry. China imported $1.73 billion in brandy from France last year, according to Chinese customs data -- about a tenth of the value of its EV exports to the EU but not insignificant.\n\nChina put the industry on alert back in January when its Ministry of Commerce launched an investigation into the European industry's dumping practices. When Chinese President Xi Jinping visited France in May, the brandy industry lobbied hard to drop the investigation, saying tariffs would be \"extremely damaging,\" and French President Emmanuel Macron claimed that Xi committed to avoid implementing tariffs on the industry. However, China's final decision is expected to be released by August, when state media has reported that China will conclude its investigation.\n\nBeyond brandy, China is also eyeing other agricultural targets that could trigger a political response from farmers and industry associations. After the EU announced its decision in early June to impose the preliminary EV tariffs, the Ministry of Commerce initiated a similar probe into EU pork imports, which mainly come from Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, and France. Spain alone exported $865 million of pork to China in 2023, and European nations have been increasingly looking to China as a destination for their pork products.\n\nChinese state media accounts have also referenced a m\u00e9lange of other possible items that could be on the chopping block, including dairy products, aerospace products, and large-engine vehicles.\n\nIf no agreement is reached in the near term, China may escalate beyond agricultural products by limiting its orders from European aviation giant Airbus, Zhao said. However, that comes with risks. \"I don't think the aerospace threats are really believable, because I don't really think China wants to target products where they're so dependent,\" Sebastian said.\n\nAs for large-engine vehicles -- those used in large sedans and SUVs -- in an interview with the Global Times in May, a leading Chinese auto industry expert called for tariffs to be raised as high as 25 percent. Those tariffs would hit Germany the hardest -- it accounts for 36 percent of China's imports of large gas-engine cars, according to the Rhodium Group. German automakers Porsche and BMW would be among the most affected. However, China is unlikely to play this card, at least in the near term, Zhao said. The German government has already been lobbying against the EU tariffs due to its automakers' large manufacturing presence in China, so it may not need a further push.\n\nWhich items China chooses off its retaliatory menu will be revealed in the coming weeks and months; however, its threats alone appear to have had an effect by bringing the EU to the negotiating table. Yet experts say it is unlikely that China can use economic coercion to get enough EU nations together to oppose the European Commission's decision, as a majority of EU nations did 10 years ago when the EU tried to implement tariffs on Chinese solar panels.\n\nShort of that, experts see a wide range of possible scenarios. \"The likely outcome is that the countervailing duties will come into effect in a form similar to the one we have seen initially announced,\" Oertel said. Other experts said a deal might be possible involving some combination of the EU lowering the tariffs, China imposing a quota on its own exports, and China increasing investment in European factories.\n\nChina's carrots may end up being more pivotal in forging a deal than its sticks, argued Ilaria Mazzocco, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"I do think what's actually, probably more effective is this argument they're making that [the tariffs] are bad for climate and that, look, Chinese companies are so willing to invest domestically in the European Union.\"\n\nWith the United States closed off to Chinese EVs and countries from Brazil to Turkey imposing similar restrictions, China is treading carefully, fearing more crackdowns on its clean-tech exports to come. \"There's a wider worry that China won't be able to leverage its strength in these technologies in the European market,\" where decarbonization is high on the agenda, Sebastian said. \"If you take Europe away, what are you left with?\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignpolicy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Foreign Policy"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The EU initiated the probe without an industry complaint, the first such trade case of this kind.\n\nSPONSORED CONTENT Shell awards Sabah LiveWIRE winners Kota Kinabalu: Shell has awarded five enterprises as the state winners of Shell LiveWIRE Malaysia 2024, following the Sabah state finals held at Plaza Shell in Kota Kinabalu. .

These would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" if at least 15 countries representing 65% of the EU population votes against them.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrance, Italy and Spain, with 40% of the EU population, have indicated they would back tariffs.\n\n\"Europe must defend itself if our companies are harmed and do not compete on equal terms,\" Spain's economy ministry said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland and Poland were still debating the issue, official and government sources said, while Belgium has a caretaker government and the Dutch only got a government this week.\n\nNegative effects\n\nGermany has stressed the need for a negotiated solution with Beijing. Its automakers have said tariffs are the wrong approach, with the negative effects outweighing any benefits.\n\nIncreasing the cost of EVs for consumers undermines the EU's goal of being carbon-neutral by 2050, opponents say. Tesla has said it will hike prices.\n\nBeijing's retaliation could bring extra tariffs on EU exports of cognac, pork or luxury cars.\n\nThe Commission says duties are needed to counter cheap loans, land and raw materials and other subsidies and the goal is a level playing field, not shutting Chinese car makers out, as the United States' planned 100% tariff is likely to do.\n\nTariffs could also give the EU leverage in negotiations with Beijing and push producers to make cars in the EU.\n\nHosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of thinktank the European Centre for International Political Economy, said clear majorities either way could embolden tariff opponents or supporters.

This means that from Thursday, when the EU starts imposing provisional tariffs -- until the final tariff rates are determined -- China has about four months to engage in talks with the EU and relevant member states.\n\nNoting that there are different voices within the EU, Hu Zinan, a researcher at the German Studies Center of Tongji University in Shanghai, believes that such talks will be challenging, as the discussions will encompass more than just tariff levels on Chinese EVs exported to Europe.\n\nSharing similar views, Ding Rijia, a professor specializing in industrial economy at the China University of Mining and Technology in Beijing, said that if China retaliates with reciprocal tariffs, such as higher duties on large-displacement gasoline vehicle imports from Europe or restricted exports of critical materials like rare earths and lithium, it would severely drive up costs.\n\nChina-EU trade declined 1.3 percent year-on-year to 2.23 trillion yuan ($307 billion) in the first five months, statistics from the General Administration of Customs showed.\n\nMatthias Loebich, partner and leader for international business at BearingPoint, a European management and technology consultancy with more than 10,000 employees across 70 countries and regions, said that China's fast-growing EV sector will continue to lead the world's green transition and create enormous growth opportunities for upstream and downstream industries in both domestic and global markets in the years ahead.\n\n\"This is evident in our doubling of Chinese automotive clients seeking consulting support over the past two years,\" said Loebich, noting that Chinese automakers are enhancing their internal capabilities in management, digital transformation and overseas strategies, learning from advanced markets to elevate their global presence.\n\nThat sentiment is in line with the latest trend. China's new energy vehicles are becoming popular in overseas markets thanks to their quality, driving range as well as multiple functionality.\n\nA total of 519,000 EVs and plugin hybrids were shipped overseas from China between January and May, up 13.7 percent year-on-year, said the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.", "source": {"uri": "chinadaily.com.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "China Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_International_Business_and_Economics_(Beijing)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of International Business and Economics (Beijing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Open_(snooker)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China Open (snooker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yue_Chinese", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yue Chinese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongji_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tongji University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_University_of_Mining_and_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China University of Mining and Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Administration_of_Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Administration of Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare-earth_element", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rare-earth element"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_business", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renminbi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renminbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lithium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202407/03/6684a0ada31095c551b476f2.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-02", "textStart": 1621, "textEnd": 1626}], "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The EU is the largest overseas market for China's EV industry and the country is counting on high-tech products to help revive its flagging economy.\n\nEU officials say this rise in imports was boosted by \"unfair subsidisation\", which allowed China-made EVs to be sold at much lower prices than ones produced in the bloc.\n\nChina has denied this repeated allegation from the US and the EU: Beijing is subsidising excess production to flood western markets with cheap imports.\n\nThe new charges come into effect on Friday but are currently provisional while the investigation into Chinese state support for the country's EV makers continues.\n\nSo who are the potential winners and losers in this trade dispute?\n\nIt is not just Chinese brands that are affected by the move. Western firms that make cars in China have also come under scrutiny by Brussels.\n\nBy imposing tariffs, Brussels says it is attempting to correct what it sees as a distorted market. The EU's decision may seem tame compared to a recent US move to raise its total tariffs to 100%, but it could be far more consequential. Chinese EVs are a relatively rare sight on US roads but much more common in the EU.\n\nThe number of EVs sold by Chinese brands across the EU rose from just 0.4% of the total EV market in 2019 to almost 8% last year, according to figures from the influential Brussels-based green group Transport and Environment (T&E).\n\nPatryk Krupcala, an architect from Poland, who expects to take delivery of a brand new China-made MG4 in two weeks told the BBC: \"I have chosen an MG4 because it is quite cheap.

A qualified majority means 15 EU members representing 65 per cent of the EU population. In most cases, there is no blocking majority.\n\nAny company not in the sample group of BYD, Geely and SAIC that wishes to have its own individual duty can ask for an \"accelerated review\" just after the imposition of definitive measures. Such a review should last a maximum of nine months.\n\nThe Commission can also carry out an \"interim review\" after a year has elapsed if the measures are no longer necessary or if they are not sufficient to counteract subsidies.\n\nThe Commission itself often looks into whether producers are evading duties via exports of parts for assembly elsewhere. For the EU, such circumvention exists if 60 per cent or more of the value of parts are imported from the country subject to duties and if the value added in the assembly is no more than 25 per cent.\n\nCompanies can challenge the measures at the European Court of Justice.

In the EV case, the deadline for this is Nov. 2.\n\nProvisional duties are only collected if definitive duties are imposed at the end of the investigation. If definitive duties are lower or not applied, then provisional duties are adjusted down accordingly. Until then, customs authorities normally just require a bank guarantee from importers.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\n\nThe European Commission has held technical talks with Chinese officials and said that any negotiated outcome must effectively address the injurious subsidies.\n\nAfter the announcement of provisional duties in the EU official journal, detailing the ongoing investigation and its findings, interested parties such as China and EV producers have until July 18 to comment. They can also request a hearing.\n\nThe Commission already visited more than 100 sites of automakers in China and Europe and done the bulk of its investigation.\n\nIts final report generally reads as a confirmation of its provisional findings, with possible adjustments following comments received.\n\nDefinitive duties are often a little lower than the provisional rates, reflecting an acceptance of some of these arguments.\n\nOne new element will be Tesla's request the Commission calculate a separate duty rate for it.\n\nThe largest EV exporter from China to Europe will want to have a lower rate than the 20.8% for companies that have cooperated with the investigation, a group it is in.\n\nAs an alternative to duties, exporters can commit to selling their products at or above a minimum price. Chinese exporters agreed such an undertaking in the case of solar panels a decade ago. However, cars are not commodities, so it is hard to see how a minimum price could be applied.\n\nWHO DECIDES?\n\nAt the provisional stage, the Commission has full power to impose duties, although it consults EU members and is supposed to take their positions into account. They are to submit their positions by July 15.\n\nEU members wavering over whether to back additional tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles, highlighting Brussels' challenge in building support for its largest trade case yet as Beijing threatens wide-ranging retaliation.\n\nAt the end of the investigation, the Commission can propose definitive duties, normally applying for five years.\n\nIts proposal could be blocked if a qualified majority of the European Union's 27 members is opposed. A qualified majority means 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU population. In most cases, there is no blocking majority.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE INVESTIGATION?\n\nAny company not in the sample group of BYD, Geely and SAIC that wishes to have its own individual duty can ask for an \"accelerated review\" just after the imposition of definitive measures. Such a review should last a maximum of nine months.\n\nThe Commission can also carry out an \"interim review\" after a year has elapsed if the measures are no longer necessary or if they are not sufficient to counteract subsidies.\n\nThe Commission itself often looks into whether producers are evading duties via exports of parts for assembly elsewhere. For the EU, such circumvention exists if 60% or more of the value of parts are imported from the country subject to duties and if the value added in the assembly is no more than 25%.\n\nCompanies can challenge the measures at the European Court of Justice. China can take the European Union to the World Trade Organization. Both legal paths can take well over a year.\n\n(Reporting by Philip Blenkinsop; Editing by Jan Harvey, Anne Marie Roantree and Barbara Lewis)", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

These measures can be applied for up to four months, during which the Commission will decide on final, or definitive, duties. In the case of EVs, this decision is expected by November 3. If definitive duties are lower or not imposed, provisional duties are adjusted accordingly, and customs authorities typically require a bank guarantee from importers during this period. The duties can also be applied retroactively for up to 90 days from early April, pending the investigation's conclusion.\n\nThe EU's decision to impose tariffs on Chinese EVs has sparked significant debate. Critics argue that while these measures aim to protect the EU's automotive sector, they may have unintended consequences. Firstly, the imposition of high tariffs could lead to increased costs for consumers, potentially slowing the adoption of EVs in Europe and undermining the EU's climate goals. Additionally, the tariffs could provoke retaliatory measures from China, leading to a trade war that would harm both economies.\n\nGermany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck has indicated that there will be concrete negotiations on the tariffs with China. \"What I suggested to my Chinese partners today is that the doors are open for discussions and I hope that this message was heard,\" Habeck said in Shanghai after meetings with Chinese officials in Beijing. While this diplomatic approach may lead to a resolution, it highlights the underlying tensions between protecting domestic industries and fostering international trade relations.\n\nMoreover, the effectiveness of such tariffs is questionable. Provisional duties are only collected if definitive duties are imposed at the investigation's end. This uncertainty can create instability for both European and Chinese automakers, complicating their business operations. Tesla, the largest EV exporter from China to Europe, has requested a separate duty rate, hoping for a lower rate than the 21% imposed on cooperating companies. This request underscores the complexity of the situation and the challenges in creating a fair and effective tariff policy.\n\nTo address these challenges, a more balanced and strategic approach is required. Instead of relying solely on tariffs, the EU could consider a combination of measures to protect its automotive industry while promoting fair competition and international cooperation.\n\nFirstly, the EU could enhance its support for domestic EV manufacturers through subsidies, research and development grants, and incentives for consumers to purchase European-made EVs. This approach would help level the playing field without resorting to protectionist measures that could provoke trade conflicts.\n\nSecondly, the EU and China could establish a bilateral framework for resolving trade disputes related to EVs. This framework could include regular consultations, joint research initiatives, and mechanisms for addressing concerns about subsidies and market access. By fostering dialogue and cooperation, both parties could work towards mutually beneficial solutions that support the growth of the global EV market.\n\nAdditionally, the EU could advocate for international standards and regulations for EVs, ensuring that all players adhere to fair practices. This would involve working with international organizations and other major EV markets to create a level playing field and prevent any single country from gaining an unfair advantage through subsidies or other means.\n\nFinally, the EU should consider the environmental implications of its trade policies. Promoting the adoption of EVs is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. Therefore, any measures taken should align with the EU's broader environmental goals. This might include incentivizing the import of EVs that meet stringent environmental standards or investing in green infrastructure to support the transition to electric mobility.\n\nIn conclusion, while the EU's proposed tariffs on Chinese EVs aim to protect the domestic industry, a more nuanced and collaborative approach is needed to address the underlying issues. By combining support for local manufacturers with international cooperation and environmental considerations, the EU can promote a fair and sustainable EV market that benefits all stakeholders.", "source": {"uri": "theowp.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Organization for World Peace"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unintended consequences"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China\u2013United_States_trade_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "China\u2013United States trade war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Habeck", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Habeck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas_emissions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greenhouse gas emissions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_infrastructure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green infrastructure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protectionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Global", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://theowp.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Meeting_with_Xi_Jinping_2023-scaled.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-03", "textStart": 354, "textEnd": 364}], "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Almost all EU brandy exports to China came from France last year, Chinese customs data shows.\n\nBeijing has also opened an anti-dumping investigation into imports of European pork and its by-products, which analysts say is aimed at pressuring Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark to break with the Commission over the curbs.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Costa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Costa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xi Jinping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trade war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_European_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of the European Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dumping (pricing policy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/29_06_2024_23_57_57_6943477.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

EU officials emphasize the need for fair competition, while European carmakers like Volkswagen express concerns about potential negative effects. Dialogue between the EU and China continues as industry stakeholders react.\n\nThe European Union will impose provisional tariffs of up to 37.6% on imports of electric vehicles made in China from Friday, ratcheting up tensions with Beijing in the EU's largest trade case yet. Here are some reactions to the news:\n\nEU TRADE CHIEF VALDIS DOMBROVSKIS \"Obviously we are in consultation with member states now, also prior to imposition of those provisional duties and it's clear that member states are also interested to protect their automotive industries from unfair competition.\n\n\"Our aim is to ... ensure fair competition and a level playing field. Therefore, once again, we do not see any basis for retaliation. \"Those talks with China are ongoing and indeed should a mutually beneficial solution emerge, we can also find ways not to apply at the end of the day the tariffs.\n\n\"But it is very clear this solution (would) need to solve that market distortion that we are currently having ... and it needs to be market compliant.\" EUROPEAN COMMISSION SPOKESPERSON\n\n\"What is clear is that what the EU wishes for is a solution. (...) The introduction of tariffs (...) is a means to correct an imbalance and unfair competitive situation to the detriment of producers of electric vehicles in the EU, compared to those who are producing vehicles in China.\" EUROPE'S BIGGEST CARMAKER VOLKSWAGEN\n\n\"The timing of the EU Commission's decision is detrimental to the current weak demand for BEV vehicles in Germany and Europe. \"The negative effects of this decision outweigh any benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry. The Volkswagen Group is confidently accepting growing international competition, including from China, and sees this as an opportunity - this also benefits our customers.\"\n\nGERMAN AUTO ASSOCIATION VDA \"Both China and the EU Commission must make every effort to find a solution through open and constructive dialogue. A potential global trade conflict must be averted.\n\n\"It is also a fact that global problems can only be solved with China. \"China plays a decisive role in a successful transformation towards electromobility and digitalisation - a trade conflict would also jeopardise this transformation.\n\n\"What is needed is an approach that promotes the strengths of our industrial nation, develops the location to be internationally competitive, opens up new markets, focuses on innovation and thus secures our prosperity and growth.\" CHINESE EV MAKER NIO\n\n\"At this stage, NIO maintains the pricing of their current models in its European markets. However, it cannot be ruled out that prices may be adjusted at a later stage as a result of these tariffs being imposed. \"Despite these developments, NIO is fully committed to the European market: we believe in fostering competition and consumer interest, and we hope to reach a resolution with the EU before definitive measures are enforced in November.\"\n\nCHINESE EV STARTUP XPENG \"All current consumers awaiting delivery and future customers placing orders before new tariffs take effect will be protected from any price increases.\n\n\"We are committed to proactively maintaining market competitiveness while minimising any potential impact on our current and future customers.\" MG MAKER SAIC'S COUNTRY MANAGER FOR ITALY ANDREA BARTOLOMEO\n\n\"For the moment we will not change prices of cars in our line-up\" in Italy.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdis_Dombrovskis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valdis Dombrovskis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nio_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nio Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry in Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SAIC Motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/28_06_2024_04_51_01_8689581.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Beijing rejects accusations that Chinese EVs are unfairly subsidised.\n\nBYD, the world's largest EV maker, faces the lowest tariff hike of 17.4% on top of the current 10% tariff. State-owned SAIC's MG Motors, the most popular Chinese-branded EV in Europe, faces the highest hike.\n\n\"For someone like BYD, 17.4%, they can absorb it,\" Xing said. \"It's a slight bump on the road. But for MG -- for SAIC Motor -- it's a major bump.\"\n\nEU countries are wavering over whether to back additional tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles, highlighting the bloc's challenge in building support for its largest trade case yet as Beijing threatens wide-ranging retaliation.\n\nThe tariffs, which are set to be finalised in November, would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" of at least 15 countries representing 65% of the EU population votes against them.\n\nIndustry insiders say both Europe and China have reasons to push for a deal to avoid the addition of billions of dollars in new costs for Chinese EV makers.\n\n\"I think the incentive right now that Europe is inviting to occur is for Chinese companies to consider avoiding the tariff by locating some of their productive capacities closer to the European region,\" said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of consultancy Automobility.\n\n\"The immediate impact is it will force companies that are using made-in-China exports as their business model to reconsider that strategy and to localise more or to push some of that capacity outside China in the direction of the markets that they're serving.\"\n\nChinese carmakers, which command a 30% or more cost edge over European rivals, took 19% of Europe's EV market last year, up from 16% in 2022, according to research firm Rhodium Group.\n\nSome are already shifting manufacturing to Europe. Chery Auto, China's largest carmaker by export volume, has signed a joint venture with Spain's EV Motors to open its first European manufacturing site in Catalonia. BYD, the biggest rival to Tesla, is building its first European EV production base in Hungary.\n\nHowever, there may not be a strong business case for some Chinese manufacturers to set up production in Europe, given their cheaper, more efficient supply chains back home and sales volumes too low to justify the cost of a factory.\n\nThe simplest response for Chinese carmakers is to increase the European price for their EVs, said Yale Zhang, founder of Shanghai-based Automotive Foresight. \"If you don't raise the price, I'm afraid the profit will be negative,\" Zhang said, referring to producers that are set to be hit with the highest tariff. \"You have to reposition the pricing, and that will definitely impact sales,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BYD Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SAIC Motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chery", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_venture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joint venture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yale University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalonia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Catalonia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/3_9ZHW4u6ApW13tkE9i-xDNm8rEt4v9thHsc_KkibtBGHoGq8-GvGUL7psY_QOZ3dOtMMB01OZakGs3mnpSA_PplNuBciVmlsmWBPpVgOjCp8A=s1000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

China has repeatedly called on the EU to cancel the proposed tariffs, and hinted that retaliatory tariffs beyond the automotive sector could follow.\n\nAside from a decrease in automotive shipments from China to Europe, tariffs could also prove the catalyst for more Chinese car manufacturers to set up shop in Europe, like BYD in Hungary.", "source": {"uri": "heavyliftpfi.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy Lift & Project Forwarding International"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_dunn@heavyliftpfi.com", "name": "Jason Dunn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-on/roll-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "roll-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hungary"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://d3i5hb7w7uz115.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1120xAny/8/5/8/13858_eutoimposesteeptariffsonchineseevs_813942.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

On a number of occasions I have asserted that the European Union is run by lobbyists acting on behalf of French farmers and the German car industry. It seems I was wrong - or perhaps that I have become wrong as the politics of global trade has shifted. A more accurate way of putting it would be to say that the EU is run by people who think they are acting in the interests of French farmers and the German car industry, but who are not quite plugged in to what those industries really want.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, we had the farmers' protests, when farmers complained that EU regulation - much of which was drawn up supposedly to help them - was driving them out of business. Now it is the turn of German carmakers - only metaphorically so far - to march on Brussels.\n\nFrom tomorrow, Chinese cars imported to the EU will be liable to additional import duties on top of the 10 per cent tariff that is already applied. Vehicles produced by one manufacturer - SAIC - will be charged an extra 37 per cent, with Geely products charged 20 per cent. The EU claims that the tariffs are necessary to defend European producers. It tries to justify them by saying that the Chinese carmakers are in receipt of state subsidies - but given the subsidies awarded to European carmakers over the years, this doesn't seem the most watertight of arguments.\n\nIt is a typical case of EU protectionism. However, this time, there is a twist. The trade body for the German automotive industry, VDA, has made it clear that it doesn't want to be protected with higher tariffs. Punitive levies on imports, it says, are in the interests of neither European consumers nor carmakers. Moreover, it adds that it won't exactly help the EU's avowed aim of decarbonising road transport.\n\nThe Chinese car industry, never previously a big player in European markets, is succeeding thanks to its ability to sell electric cars at far more affordable prices than European manufacturers are managing to do. This is partly because Chinese carmakers made an early start on building electric cars, partly because they backed a cheaper form of battery technology, based on lithium iron phosphate rather than nickel, manganese and cobalt, and partly because of Chinese domination of the supply chain for electric car batteries.\n\nIf the EU really wants to decarbonise road transport it should be welcoming Chinese-made electric cars with open arms. After all, European motorists are not showing a great deal of interest in expensive, European-produced electric cars. True, Chinese competition isn't exactly making life easier for European manufacturers, but then they have worked out that punitive tariffs on imports are not going to act in their favour for long. The car industry is very much a global industry nowadays. If European carmakers are going to succeed, they are not going to do so by constructing a fortress in Europe; they are going to do so by competing internationally. European carmakers are already beginning to source batteries from China at a much lower prices than they could from the European 'gigafactories' which the EU wants to promote. They are also beginning to shift some manufacturing to China - BMW will soon be building the electric version of the Mini there.\n\nThis globalisation of production will inevitably be harmed by tariffs on car imports to the EU. Moreover, in the short term it will inevitably mean retaliatory tariffs on imports of EU-made cars to China - a market in which the German car industry is deeply embedded. The EU may profess to champion free trade but its ruling mentality has always been protectionist. For once, the European industries in whose interests it thinks it is acting are fighting back.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ross_clark@spectator.us", "name": "Ross Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "German language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SAIC Motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Road transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protectionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geely", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium_iron_phosphate_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lithium iron phosphate battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manganese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-carbon_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low-carbon economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cobalt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Globalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Globalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BMW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nickel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Autos", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1180954684.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Talks with the Chinese government are still ongoing. There have also been slight changes to the tariff rates for individual manufacturers.\n\nWith the provisional special duties that have now been imposed, the actual duty rates differ slightly from those announced by the EU Commission in mid-June. According to the latest announcement from Brussels, 19.9 per cent special duty will be imposed on imports of electric Geely models, whereas 20.0 per cent had been announced. SAIC's rate remains the highest but has been reduced by 0.5 percentage points to 37.6 per cent. There is no change at BYD with 17.4 per cent.\n\nElectric cars from other Chinese manufacturers that cooperated with the EU in the investigation will be subject to a special duty of 20.8 per cent. For companies that have not cooperated, the rate will be corrected to 37.6 per cent, similar to SAIC. The special duties - whether manufacturer-specific or in one of the two groups - are calculated in addition to the ten per cent import duty that applies anyway. The actual customs duty is therefore ten percentage points higher and thus amounts to a maximum of 47.6 per cent.\n\n'Provisional' in the context of the special duties means that the duties are calculated but not yet collected for the time being. The provisional special duties will apply from 5 July for a maximum of four months until 5 November. By then at the latest, the EU member states must have adopted a decision on the definitive duties. If this decision is adopted, the special duties will apply for five years. And the amounts calculated since 5 July will then be collected retroactively. However, security deposits for the provisional duties must be lodged immediately.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether this will happen. On the one hand, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz recently intervened in the proceedings with his own proposal, while on the other, negotiations between Brussels and Beijing are once again underway. \"Consultations with the Chinese government have intensified in recent weeks, following an exchange of views between Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis and Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao. Contacts continue at technical level with a view to reaching a WTO-compatible solution, which adequately addresses the concerns raised by the European Union,\" the Commission announced. It also reiterates its own position: \"Any negotiated outcome to the investigation must be effective in addressing the injurious forms of subsidisation identified.\"\n\nThe EU Commission presented the plans for the special tariffs in mid-June following a month-long anti-subsidy investigation. The investigation is said to have revealed that Chinese electric car manufacturers have unacceptable competitive advantages thanks to high subsidies from the government in Beijing and can therefore offer their electric cars in Europe more cheaply than domestic manufacturers. For this reason, the special duties were not levied across the board, but rather on a manufacturer-specific basis according to the subsidies identified in the investigation.\n\nThis includes not only Chinese brands but pertains to all electric cars built in China.

On the first point, the European People's Party wants to change the rules that have been applied until now. On the second point, a government source quoted by Reuters, but who has remained anonymous, says that Germany, whose carmakers will make a third of their sales in China in 2023, wants to put an end to customs duties.\n\nFrance has been one of the strongest supporters of China's tariffs, but now faces an election. However, while the game is still open, a swift decision will have to be taken. Today, 4 July, provisional duties on electric vehicles produced in China will come into force. Beijing has called for a rethink, but dialogue between the two sides is not easy.\n\nMeanwhile, while Europe is calming down with elections in several countries, the threat of countermeasures from the Chinese government is getting closer and closer.\n\nFor the Commission, the tariffs are necessary to counter the cheap loans and other subsidies that the Chinese government has allegedly granted to its carmakers in order to keep vehicle costs down, the ultimate aim being to create a level playing field.\n\nGermany is reportedly keen to negotiate with China because its carmakers argue that the rising cost of electric vehicles to consumers undermines the EU's goal of being carbon neutral by 2050 and, more importantly, because Beijing's retaliation could lead to additional tariffs on EU luxury car exports (as well as other products including cognac and pork), which would be bad for the market.\n\nReuters polled EU governments and found that most countries are still weighing up the pros and cons of escalating the trade dispute. France, Italy and Spain, which account for 40% of the EU's population, have said they would support tariffs. \"Europe must defend itself if our companies are harmed and cannot compete on equal terms\", the Spanish economy ministry told Reuters.\n\nAccording to other official and government sources, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland and Poland are still discussing the issue, while Belgium and the Netherlands are waiting with bated breath as they face new internal elections.\n\nThe issue will be put to the members in a consultative vote in the coming weeks, and this will be the first official test of support in a landmark case for the Commission. As the press agency points out, EU members will also vote in October on whether the Commission, following the current investigation, will propose multiannual customs duties.\n\nWhatever the outcome of this case, it is clear that it will be decisive for future relations between Europe and China. \"To be honest, this is also a message aimed particularly at the German Chancellery\", said Alicia Garcia Herrero, senior researcher at the Brussels-based economic think-tank Bruegel.

Beijing rejects accusations that Chinese EVs are unfairly subsidised.\n\nBYD, the world's largest EV maker, faces the lowest tariff hike of 17.4% on top of the current 10% tariff. State-owned SAIC's MG Motors, the most popular Chinese-branded EV in Europe, faces the highest hike.\n\n\"For someone like BYD, 17.4%, they can absorb it,\" Xing said. \"It's a slight bump on the road. But for MG - for SAIC Motor - it's a major bump.\"\n\nEU countries are wavering over whether to back additional tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles, highlighting the bloc's challenge in building support for its largest trade case yet as Beijing threatens wide-ranging retaliation.\n\nThe tariffs, set to be finalized in November, would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" of at least 15 countries representing 65% of the EU population votes against them.\n\nIndustry insiders say both Europe and China have reasons to push for a deal to avoid the addition of billions of dollars in new costs for Chinese EV makers.\n\n\"I think the incentive right now that Europe is inviting to occur is for Chinese companies to consider avoiding the tariff by locating some of their productive capacities closer to the European region,\" said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of consultancy Automobility Ltd.\n\n\"The immediate impact is it will force companies that are using made-in-China exports as their business model to reconsider that strategy and to localize more or to push some of that capacity outside of China in the direction of the markets that they're serving.\"\n\nChinese carmakers, which command a 30% or more cost edge over European rivals, took 19% of Europe's EV market last year, up from 16% in 2022, according to research firm Rhodium Group.\n\nSome are already shifting manufacturing to Europe. Chery Auto, China's largest automaker by export volume, has signed a joint venture with Spain's EV Motors to open its first European manufacturing site in Catalonia.\n\nBYD, the biggest rival to Tesla, is also building its first European EV production base in Hungary.\n\nHowever, there may not be a strong business case for some Chinese EV makers to set up production in Europe, given their cheaper, more efficient supply chains back home and sales volumes too low to justify the cost of a factory.\n\nThe simplest response for Chinese automakers is to increase the European sticker price for their EVs, said Yale Zhang, founder of Shanghai-based Automotive Foresight.\n\n\"If you don't raise the price, I'm afraid the profit will be negative,\" Zhang said, referring to companies that produce EVs set to be hit with the highest tariff.\n\n\"You have to reposition the pricing, and that will definitely impact sales,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting By Nicoco Chan in Shanghai and Sarah Wu in

Beijing rejects accusations that Chinese EVs are unfairly subsidised.\n\nBYD, the world's largest EV maker, faces the lowest tariff hike of 17.4% on top of the current 10% tariff. State-owned SAIC's MG Motors, the most popular Chinese-branded EV in Europe, faces the highest hike.\n\n\"For someone like BYD, 17.4%, they can absorb it,\" Xing said. \"It's a slight bump on the road. But for MG - for SAIC Motor - it's a major bump.\"\n\nEU countries are wavering over whether to back additional tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles, highlighting the bloc's challenge in building support for its largest trade case yet as Beijing threatens wide-ranging retaliation.\n\nThe tariffs, set to be finalized in November, would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" of at least 15 countries representing 65% of the EU population votes against them.\n\nIndustry insiders say both Europe and China have reasons to push for a deal to avoid the addition of billions of dollars in new costs for Chinese EV makers.\n\n\"I think the incentive right now that Europe is inviting to occur is for Chinese companies to consider avoiding the tariff by locating some of their productive capacities closer to the European region,\" said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of consultancy Automobility Ltd.\n\n\"The immediate impact is it will force companies that are using made-in-China exports as their business model to reconsider that strategy and to localize more or to push some of that capacity outside of China in the direction of the markets that they're serving.\"\n\nChinese carmakers, which command a 30% or more cost edge over European rivals, took 19% of Europe's EV market last year, up from 16% in 2022, according to research firm Rhodium Group.\n\nSome are already shifting manufacturing to Europe. Chery Auto, China's largest automaker by export volume, has signed a joint venture with Spain's EV Motors to open its first European manufacturing site in Catalonia.\n\nBYD, the biggest rival to Tesla, is also building its first European EV production base in Hungary.\n\nHowever, there may not be a strong business case for some Chinese EV makers to set up production in Europe, given their cheaper, more efficient supply chains back home and sales volumes too low to justify the cost of a factory.\n\nThe simplest response for Chinese automakers is to increase the European sticker price for their EVs, said Yale Zhang, founder of Shanghai-based Automotive Foresight.\n\n\"If you don't raise the price, I'm afraid the profit will be negative,\" Zhang said, referring to companies that produce EVs set to be hit with the highest tariff.\n\n\"You have to reposition the pricing, and that will definitely impact sales,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting By Nicoco Chan in Shanghai and Sarah Wu in Beijing, Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Miral Fahmy)", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

EU officials aim to ensure fair competition.\n\nThe European Union will impose tariffs of up to 37.6% from Friday on imports of electric vehicles made in China, EU officials said on Thursday, ratcheting up tensions with Beijing in Brussels' largest trade case yet. Here are some reactions to the news:\n\nEUROPE'S BIGGEST CARMAKER VOLKSWAGEN: \"The timing of the EU Commission's decision is detrimental to the current weak demand for BEV vehicles in Germany and Europe.\n\n\"The negative effects of this decision outweigh any benefits for the European and especially the German automotive industry. The Volkswagen Group is confidently accepting growing international competition, including from China, and sees this as an opportunity - this also benefits our customers.\" CHINESE EV MAKER NIO:\n\n\"At this stage, NIO maintains the pricing of their current models in its European markets. However, it cannot be ruled out that prices may be adjusted at a later stage as a result of these tariffs being imposed. \"Despite these developments, NIO is fully committed to the European market: we believe in fostering competition and consumer interest, and we hope to reach a resolution with the EU before definitive measures are enforced in November 2024.\"\n\nSAIC'S COUNTRY MANAGER FOR ITALY ANDREA BARTOLOMEO: \"For the moment we will not change prices of cars in our line-up\" in Italy.\n\nEU TRADE CHIEF VALDIS DOMBROVSKIS: \"Obviously we are in consultation with member states now, also prior to imposition of those provisional duties and it's clear that member states are also interested to protect their automotive industries from unfair competition.\n\n\"Our aim is to ... ensure fair competition and level playing field. Therefore, once again, we do not see any basis for retaliation. \"Those talks with China are ongoing and indeed should a mutually beneficial solution emerge, we can also find ways not to apply at the end of the day the tariffs.\n\n\"But it is very clear this solution (would) need to solve that market distortion that we are currently having ... and it needs to be market compliant.\" EUROPEAN COMMISSION SPOKESPERSON:\n\n\"What is clear is that what the EU wishes for is a solution. (...) The introduction of tariffs (...) is a means to correct an imbalance and unfair competitive situation to the detriment of producers of electric vehicles in the EU, compared to those who are producing vehicles in China.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brussels"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry_in_Germany", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry in Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdis_Dombrovskis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valdis Dombrovskis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SAIC Motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/24_06_2024_15_16_35_447339.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

These are on top of the EU's standard 10% duty on car imports.\n\nCompanies deemed by the EU to have cooperated with the investigation, including western carmakers Tesla and BMW, will be subject to 20.8% tariffs and those that did not cooperate a rate of 37.6%.\n\nTINPLATE STEEL\n\nThe Commission opened on May 16 an anti-dumping investigation into flat-rolled products of iron or steel plated or coated with Chinese tin.\n\nThe EU's official journal said the investigation follows a complaint from European steel association Eurofer.\n\nThe investigation is to be concluded within 14 months, with the possible imposition of provisional duties in seven to eight months.\n\nWOOD FLOORING IMPORTS\n\nThe European Commission initiated an anti-dumping investigation into wood flooring imports on May 16, following a complaint by the European Parquet Federation.\n\nUnder investigation are assembled multilayered wood flooring panels. Panels of bamboo, or with at least the top layer of bamboo, are excluded as are panels for mosaic floors.\n\nMEDICAL DEVICES\n\nThe European Commission launched a probe into Chinese public procurement of medical devices, the EU's official journal said on April 24.\n\nThe investigation is the first under the EU International Procurement Instrument, which aims to prevent countries from unfairly favouring domestic suppliers.\n\nIf the Commission finds that European suppliers don't have fair access to the Chinese market, it could place restrictions on Chinese medical device companies bidding in EU public tenders.\n\nThe investigation is to be concluded within nine months, although the Commission can extend this period by a further five months.\n\nWIND TURBINES\n\nThe EU is investigating subsidies received by Chinese suppliers of wind turbines destined for Europe, the bloc's anti-trust commissioner Margrethe Vestager said on April 9.\n\nIt will look into wind park development in Spain, Greece, France, Romania and Bulgaria, Vestager said without naming specific companies.\n\nChina said the probe was \"discriminatory\" against Chinese enterprises and endorsed protectionism.\n\nSOLAR PANELS\n\nThe European Commission will close its investigation into Chinese bidders in a public tender for a solar park in Romania after the companies withdrew from the process, European Industry Commission Thierry Breton said on May 13.\n\nIt launched two investigations on April 3 into whether the Chinese participants benefited excessively from subsidies in bidding for a contract.\n\nIt first investigated a consortium comprising Romania's ENEVO Group and a subsidiary of China's LONGi Green Energy Technology Co. The second consortium investigated comprised subsidiaries of Chinese state-owned Shanghai Electric Group Co..\n\nBreton said that the Commission took note of the withdrawal of LONGi Solar and Shanghai Electric from bidding and would therefore close its investigation.

The bloc is set to confirm on Thursday extra duties of up to 37.6% aimed to prevent a flood of subsidised China-built EVs into the European market, despite last-ditch efforts to strike a deal.\n\n\"The Chinese EV brands' march into Europe will continue on,\" said Lei Xing, founder of consultancy AutoXing.\n\n\"It's like going from 80 km/h to 60 km/h or even slower, but it's not going to stop.\"\n\nChina and the European Commission have been in negotiations since last week over the curbs that Beijing and some European automakers want scrapped. Beijing rejects accusations that Chinese EVs are unfairly subsidised.\n\nBYD, the world's largest EV maker, faces the lowest tariff hike of 17.4% on top of the current 10% tariff. State-owned SAIC's MG Motors, the most popular Chinese-branded EV in Europe, faces the highest hike.\n\n\"For someone like BYD, 17.4%, they can absorb it,\" Xing said. \"It's a slight bump on the road. But for MG - for SAIC Motor - it's a major bump.\"\n\nEU countries are wavering over whether to back additional tariffs on Chinese-built electric vehicles, highlighting the bloc's challenge in building support for its largest trade case yet as Beijing threatens wide-ranging retaliation.\n\nThe tariffs, set to be finalized in November, would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" of at least 15 countries representing 65% of the EU population votes against them.\n\nIndustry insiders say both Europe and China have reasons to push for a deal to avoid the addition of billions of dollars in new costs for Chinese EV makers.\n\n\"I think the incentive right now that Europe is inviting to occur is for Chinese companies to consider avoiding the tariff by locating some of their productive capacities closer to the European region,\" said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of consultancy Automobility Ltd.\n\n\"The immediate impact is it will force companies that are using made-in-China exports as their business model to reconsider that strategy and to localize more or to push some of that capacity outside of China in the direction of the markets that they're serving.\"\n\nChinese carmakers, which command a 30% or more cost edge over European rivals, took 19% of Europe's EV market last year, up from 16% in 2022, according to research firm Rhodium Group.\n\nSome are already shifting manufacturing to Europe. Chery Auto, China's largest automaker by export volume, has signed a joint venture with Spain's EV Motors to open its first European manufacturing site in Catalonia.\n\nBYD, the biggest rival to Tesla, is also building its first European EV production base in Hungary.\n\nHowever, there may not be a strong business case for some Chinese EV makers to set up production in Europe, given their cheaper, more efficient supply chains back home and sales volumes too low to justify the cost of a factory.\n\nThe simplest response for Chinese automakers is to increase the European sticker price for their EVs, said Yale Zhang, founder of Shanghai-based Automotive Foresight.\n\n\"If you don't raise the price, I'm afraid the profit will be negative,\" Zhang said, referring to companies that produce EVs set to be hit with the highest tariff.\n\n\"You have to reposition the pricing, and that will definitely impact sales,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType":

Instead, it was an ex officio anti-subsidy investigation initiated by the commission grounded on the threat of damage. This is very rare in EU's trade remedies,\" the CCCME said.\n\nThe CCCME criticized the extensive and stringent information requested by the commission, saying that it was unprecedented and indicative of the EU's inclination to reach a predetermined conclusion.\n\nThe China Chamber of Commerce to the EU also expressed deep concern over what it perceived as political manipulation and unilateral protectionism in the investigation.\n\nThe commission has gone beyond the scope of its countervailing duty investigation, made unreasonable demands on enterprises, and failed to leave sufficient time for enterprises and stakeholders to respond and provide evidence, the CCCEU said.\n\nDuring hearings held in Brussels, Chinese companies and other relevant parties raised their questions regarding problems arising from the investigation, but the commission did not make any response or correct its wrongdoing, according to the CCCEU.\n\nMeanwhile, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade decried the EU move as \"typical double standards\", saying the EU itself has provided substantial subsidies for its own EV and battery industries.\n\nAvoidable consequences\n\nExperts have cautioned that additional tariffs could spark unwanted consequences, diminishing the profitability of corporations and thereby affecting the EU's economic growth.\n\nZheng Chunrong, director of the German Studies Center of Tongji University, underscored that German companies will undoubtedly bear the brunt of trade conflicts, as China still accounts for the largest share of the global market for German carmakers.\n\nAbout 50 percent of the EU's EV imports from China are from Western brands that produce vehicles in China, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\n\"Should the EU implement tariffs, it would inflict considerable harm on Europe itself,\" Zheng noted.\n\nAccording to a simulation study conducted by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, imposing a 20 percent tariff would result in a 25 percent decline in EV imports from China, impacting Western automakers with operations in China.\n\nIn the wake of the EC's announcement, prominent European carmakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW expressed strong objections, as such protectionist measures may force them to lose part of the Chinese market, one of their key profit centers.\n\nIn Europe, the looming additional tariffs are set to ignite soaring prices for EVs, an impediment in the EU's drive to fulfill the ambitious European Green Deal.\n\nThe initiative, launched in 2019 and slated to phase out cars and vans with internal combustion engines except e-fuel ones from registering by 2035, now faces a potential stumbling block.", "source": {"uri":

Beijing rejects accusations that Chinese EVs are unfairly subsidised.\n\nBYD - the world's largest EV maker - faces the lowest tariff hike of 17.4 per cent on top of the current 10 per cent tariff. State-owned SAIC's MG Motors, the most popular Chinese-branded EV in Europe, faces the highest hike.\n\n\"For someone like BYD, 17.4 per cent, they can absorb it,\" Xing said. \"It's a slight bump on the road. But for MG - for SAIC Motor - it's a major bump.\"\n\nThe European Union countries are wavering over whether to back additional tariffs on Chinese-built EVs, highlighting the bloc's challenge in gathering support for its largest trade case yet as Beijing threatens wide-ranging retaliation.\n\nThe tariffs, set to be finalised in November, would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" of at least 15 countries representing 65 per cent of the EU population votes against them.\n\nIndustry insiders say both Europe and China have reasons to push for a deal to avoid the addition of billions of dollars in new costs for Chinese EV makers.\n\n\"I think the incentive right now that Europe is inviting to occur is for Chinese companies to consider avoiding the tariff by locating some of their productive capacities closer to the European region,\" said Bill Russo, founder and chief executive officer of consultancy Automobility.\n\n\"The immediate impact is it will force companies that are using made-in-China exports as their business model to reconsider that strategy and to localise more or to push some of that capacity outside of China in the direction of the markets that they're serving,\" Russo noted.\n\nResearch frim Rhodium Group reported that Chinese carmakers - which command a 30 per cent or more cost edge over European rivals - took 19 per cent of Europe's EV market last year, up from 16 per cent in 2022.\n\nSome are already shifting manufacturing to Europe. Chery Auto, China's largest automaker by export volume, has signed a joint venture with Spain's EV Motors to open its first European manufacturing site in Catalonia.\n\nBYD, the biggest rival to Tesla, is also building its first European EV production base in Hungary.\n\nHowever, there may not be a strong business case for some Chinese EV makers to set up production in Europe, given their cheaper, more efficient supply chains back home and sales volumes too low to justify the cost of a factory.\n\nThe simplest response for Chinese automakers is to increase the European sticker price for their EVs, said Yale Zhang, founder of Shanghai-based Automotive Foresight.\n\n\"If you don't raise the price, I'm afraid the profit will be negative,\" Zhang said, referring to companies that produce EVs set to be hit with the highest tariff.\n\n\"You have to reposition the pricing, and that will definitely impact sales,\" he added.

Volkswagen had delivered approximately 40 million vehicles in the Chinese market by the end of 2022. BMW Brilliance Automotive, a China-Germany joint venture, rolled its 6 millionth vehicle off the production line in May. For both Volkswagen and BMW, sales in China account for over 30 percent of their global total.\n\nWhile bringing advanced technologies, management experience, and production techniques to China, European automakers have also reaped substantial profits in the competitive Chinese market.\n\nEven in the field of new energy vehicles, China and Europe are not engaged in a zero-sum game. Companies like Volkswagen and BMW have established research centers in China or collaborated directly with Chinese firms to drive technological innovation. This has helped European automakers better understand and adapt to the Chinese market, positioning them advantageously in electric and intelligent vehicles.\n\nIn recent years, Chinese EVs have progressed significantly, which surprised many in Europe. Yet their market share in Europe remains low. Still, some politicians are trying to exploit the situation for political purposes.\n\nIn fact, over the past 40 years, European carmakers have undoubtedly benefited from cooperation with China, as evidenced by their opposition to the EU's anti-subsidy investigation of China-made EVs. Major car companies such as Volkswagen, BMW and Mercedes-Benz have voiced their objections to these protectionist measures, regarding them as neither reasonable nor justified.\n\nThe German Association of the Automotive Industry said on Wednesday in a statement that the planned tariffs against China-made EVs would be counterproductive for Europe's climate goals and harmful to its industry and consumers. Western car manufacturers in China would also be affected, in some cases even worse than Chinese companies, it noted.\n\n\"Competitiveness is fostered through competition,\" the association said.\n\nIS CHINESE \"OVERCAPACITY\" OR EU UNDERCAPACITY THE PROBLEM?\n\nProbably the latter.\n\nAs observed by the Swiss newspaper Neue Zurcher Zeitung, if a country only produced for its domestic market, there would be no international trade. The automotive industry inherently operates on global production and global sales. In 2023, around 80 percent of cars produced in Germany and 50 percent of those made in Japan were exported, while only about 12.7 percent of China's EVs were sold to the international market. Accusations of China's \"overcapacity\" are therefore groundless.\n\nAccording to research by the International Energy Agency, to achieve carbon neutrality, global sales of EVs need to reach about 45 million by 2030, more than three times the figure in 2023 and far exceeding current global production capacity.\n\nTake the EU as an example. Its transportation sector accounts for nearly a quarter of total greenhouse gas emissions. To meet the net-zero emission target by 2050, the EU needs at least 30 million zero-emission vehicles on the road by 2030. From a supply and demand perspective, the electric vehicle sector is not experiencing overcapacity but rather facing a capacity shortage.\n\nIn essence, the EU's allegations of China's \"overcapacity\" in EVs and concerns about \"supply chain security\" are just excuses to prevent China from participating in normal international trade and undermine the development of China's EVs.\n\nThe so-called \"dumping\" of Chinese EVs in Europe is also exaggerated. Most EVs exported from China to Europe are Western brands made in China.\n\nAccording to data from the European Federation for Transport and Environment, in 2023, 19.5 percent of EVs sold in Europe were produced in China, and only 7.9 percent of those were Chinese brands. U.S. carmaker Tesla's Shanghai factory exported around 340,000 vehicles in 2023, nearly half of which were sold to Europe. Thus, Chinese EV brands hold a relatively small market share in Europe, far from being the main players.\n\nChina's success in the EV sector stems from technological innovation, a robust supply chain and a competitive market, rather than from subsidies.\n\nA report by the U.S.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies has noted the importance of recognizing the tremendous advancements made by Chinese EV manufacturers and battery producers. Recent years have seen substantial improvements in the energy density, range, and reliability of Chinese EV batteries, as well as better designs, infotainment systems, and autonomy capabilities.\n\nThe EU's claim that China's affordable EVs are heavily subsidized and therefore disrupt the market is baseless. In reality, it is the EU's protectionist measures that are causing market disruption.\n\nSubsidy policies originated in Europe and the United States and are widely practiced globally. China does not implement any subsidies that are prohibited under WTO rules.\n\nIn contrast, Europe and the United States have significantly intensified their subsidies for EVs in recent years, with a range of exclusive and discriminatory practices. This has created barriers for Chinese EVs and is in clear violation of WTO regulations.\n\nIndustry insiders believe that the EU's investigation seeks to prevent Chinese EV companies from investing and expanding in Europe and to diminish the competitiveness of emerging Chinese industries, so as to protect local traditional industries. Timed before the just-concluded EU elections, this protectionist move is politically and geopolitically motivated.\n\nThe EU has always portrayed itself as a staunch defender of free trade, and it claims that its investigation is meant to determine whether China is excessively subsidizing its EV industry and will set tariffs based on the findings. However, in fact, the investigation was initiated without requests from member states or the auto industry.\n\nMoreover, the investigation process was characterized by non-compliant sampling standards and a lack of transparency, seriously breaching WTO rules.\n\nFor example, the EU excluded high-sales producers from member states during the sampling process, demonstrating a clear discriminatory approach aimed at Chinese EV companies.\n\nVisionary voices from Europe's political, business, and academic circles have urged that, instead of keeping Chinese EVs out, the EU should collaborate with China to leverage technological and supply chain advantages to enhance Europe's industrial landscape, meet emission reduction commitments, cater to consumers and achieve mutual benefits. Putting up barriers is nothing but a short-sighted move. \u25a0", "source": {"uri": "english.news.cn", "dataType": "news", "title": "english.news.cn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Beijing rejects accusations that Chinese EVs are unfairly subsidized.\n\nBYD, the world's largest EV maker, faces the lowest tariff hike of 17.4 percent on top of the current 10 percent tariff.\n\nState-owned SAIC's MG Motors, the most popular Chinese-branded EV in Europe, faces the highest hike.\n\n\"For someone like BYD, 17.4 percent, they can absorb it,\" Xing said. \"It's a slight bump on the road. But for MG - for SAIC Motor - it's a major bump.\"\n\nEU countries are wavering over whether to back additional tariffs on Chinese-built EVs, highlighting the bloc's challenge in building support for its largest trade case yet as Beijing threatens wide-ranging retaliation.\n\nThe tariffs, set to be finalized in November, would be blocked if a \"qualified majority\" of at least 15 countries representing 65 percent of the EU population votes against them.\n\nIndustry insiders say both Europe and China have reasons to push for a deal to avoid the addition of billions of dollars in new costs for Chinese EV makers.\n\n\"I think the incentive right now that Europe is inviting to occur is for Chinese companies to consider avoiding the tariff by locating some of their productive capacities closer to the European region,\" said Bill Russo, founder and CEO of consultancy Automobility.\n\n\"The immediate impact is it will force companies that are using made-in-China exports as their business model to reconsider that strategy and to localize more or to push some of that capacity outside of China in the direction of the markets that they are serving.\"\n\nChinese automakers, which command a 30 percent or more cost edge over European rivals, took 19 percent of Europe's EV market last year, up from 16 percent in 2022, according to research firm Rhodium Group.\n\nSome are already shifting manufacturing to Europe. Chery, China's largest automaker by export volume, has signed a joint venture with Spain's EV Motors to open its first European manufacturing site in Catalonia.\n\nBYD, the biggest rival to Tesla, is also building its first European EV production base in Hungary.\n\nHowever, there may not be a strong business case for some Chinese EV makers to set up production in Europe, given their cheaper, more efficient supply chains back home and sales volumes too low to justify the cost of a factory.\n\nThe simplest response for Chinese automakers is to increase the European sticker price for their EVs, said Yale Zhang, founder of Shanghai-based Automotive Foresight.\n\n\"If you don't raise the price, I'm afraid the profit will be negative,\" Zhang said, referring to companies that produce EVs set to be hit with the highest tariff.\n\n\"You have to reposition the pricing, and that will definitely impact sales,\" he said.\n\nCHINA NEWSLETTER: Sign up for commentary by journalist Yang Jian and

Chery Auto, China's largest automaker by export volume, has signed a joint venture with Spain's EV Motors to open its first European manufacturing site in Catalonia.\n\nBYD, the biggest rival to Tesla, is also building its first European EV production base in Hungary.\n\nHowever, there may not be a strong business case for some Chinese EV makers to set up production in Europe, given their cheaper, more efficient supply chains back home and sales volumes too low to justify the cost of a factory.\n\nThe simplest response for Chinese automakers is to increase the European sticker price for their EVs, said Yale Zhang, founder of Shanghai-based Automotive Foresight.\n\n\"If you don't raise the price, I'm afraid the profit will be negative,\" Zhang said, referring to companies that produce EVs set to be hit with the highest tariff.\n\n\"You have to reposition the pricing, and that will definitely impact sales,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting By Nicoco Chan in Shanghai and Sarah Wu in

The EU confirmed in a news release on July 4 that it would apply provisional duties on three Chinese manufacturers that were sampled for the investigation.\n\nMG maker SAIC Motor faces a 37.6 percent tariff on top of the existing 10 percent rate, while Geely and BYD will be hit with additional charges of 19.9 percent and 17.4 percent, respectively.\n\nThe EV shift in Europe has recently slowed, with sales in May declining 11 percent -- they now make up just 14 percent of the region's passenger-car market.\n\nYet battery-powered cars remain on course to take over as the EU phases out sales of fuel-burning vehicles by the middle of the next decade.\n\nThat is where Chinese automakers see an opening to conquer a lucrative export market: lower-cost battery technology and generous government support give them an advantage over automakers such as Volkswagen Group, Stellantis and Renault.\n\nState aid for Chinese manufacturers has brought Beijing to the brink of a trade war with the EU, with China threatening to retaliate.\n\nThe tariffs also target Chinese-made models including BMW's iX3 SUV, Renault's Dacia Spring and Tesla's Model 3.\n\nIn all, nearly two in five battery-electric cars sold across Europe were made in China, according to automotive consultants JATO Dynamics.\n\nWhile they have maintained market share, Chinese brands have not avoided the slump in European EV demand. MG's sales in the region slid 34 percent in May from the year-ago period, based on data from JATO.\n\n\"Concerns around the upcoming measures taken by the EU, and more focus on ICE cars explain this negative result for the brand,\" said Felipe Munoz, senior analyst at JATO, referring to models powered by internal combustion engines.\n\n\"However, BYD did quite well, thanks to the Atto 3 SUV and the introduction of the Seal, Dolphin and Seal U.\"\n\nMore broadly, the removal or scaling back of EV buying subsidies continues to hurt demand. Sales in Germany slid 31 percent in May from a year earlier, after Europe's biggest automotive market pulled incentives for battery-electric cars late last year.\n\nWhile talks with the EU could yet avert a trade war, China has threatened to retaliate with levies on cars with large engines that would hit German luxury manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz Group, BMW and Porsche.\n\nChinese officials have also taken aim at French brandy and Spanish ham in a bid to deter the new EV tariffs.", "source": {"uri": "autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Automotive News"}, "authors": [],

The site is not big enough for the carmaker's medium- and long-term plans in Europe, Zhang added, saying the company was looking for a possible second site.\n\nPOLESTAR After posting a first-quarter operating loss, the Swedish carmaker, owned by China's Geely, said it would need to take \"mitigating measures\" to offset tariffs and pressure on car prices.\n\nSuch steps could include cost reductions across its supply chain, but not further job cuts, a company spokesperson added. SAIC\n\nSimilar to BYD, the Chinese carmaker's subsidiary MG hasn't decided yet whether or not to hike prices on EVs sold in the EU, sources close to the company told Reuters. MG faces tariffs of 38.1%, on top of the current 10% tariff. TESLA INC\n\nThe carmaker plans to increase the price of its Model 3 to compensate for the higher cost at European borders as a result of the tariffs.

The investigation concluded that China's BEV sector benefits from unfair subsidies, posing a threat to EU producers.\n\nUnfair Subsidies Impact\n\nValdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President, discussed these issues with Chinese Trade Minister Wang Wentao. He stated, \"We aim for a solution that addresses the EU's concerns effectively and is compliant with WTO rules.\"\n\nDuties Breakdown\n\nThese provisional duties are effective from July 5, 2024, for up to four months. A final decision on definitive duties will be made by EU Member States within this period.\n\nAligning with U.S. Measures\n\nThis move aligns with recent U.S. actions, where President Joe Biden announced significant tariff increases on Chinese imports, including EV batteries, on May 14, 2024. The U.S. tariffs, affecting $18 billion worth of goods, aim to address trade imbalances and protect domestic industries. Biden emphasized, \"American workers can out-work and out-compete anyone as long as the competition is fair.\" The U.S. quadrupled EV duties to over 100%, similar to the EU's approach of imposing substantial duties on Chinese BEVs.\n\nTrade Relations and Future Implications\n\nChina has vowed to retaliate against these measures. Its commerce ministry declared opposition to the U.S. tariff hikes and promised to take steps to defend its interests. This escalation marks a significant development in the ongoing trade tensions between the economic giants. Both the EU and U.S. are addressing unfair trade practices, reflecting a shared commitment to fair competition and economic protection.\n\nProcedure and Next Steps\n\nThe ordinary trade defense procedure includes Member States voting on provisional measures within 14 days of publication in the Official Journal. Interested parties can request hearings and provide comments within 15 days from the entry into force of provisional measures. After considering these comments, the Commission will disclose its proposal for definitive measures, if any, allowing adequate time for further comments.\n\nThe Commission will present the final determination to Member States, who will vote pursuant to the examination procedure under comitology rules. This vote will have a binding effect.

Based on the investigation, the Commission has concluded that the BEV value chain in China benefits from unfair subsidisation, which is causing a threat of economic injury to EU BEV producers.

Within that timeframe, a final decision must be taken on definitive duties, through a vote by EU Member States. When adopted, this decision would make the duties definitive for a period of five years.\n\nProcedure and next steps\n\nOn 4 October 2023, the Commission formally initiated an ex-officio anti-subsidy investigation on imports of battery electric vehicles for passengers originating in China. Such an investigation must be concluded within maximum 13 months of initiation. Definitive measures must be imposed no later than 4 months after imposition of provisional duties. Provisional countervailing duties are secured by a guarantee (in the form to be decided by customs in each Member State), and may be collected under certain circumstances only when a decision has been made to impose definitive duties.\n\nFollowing the ordinary trade defence procedure, Member States will now vote on provisional measures, by written procedure and by simple majority, no later than 14 days after publication of the provisional measures in the Official Journal. This vote will follow the so-called advisory procedure, under comitology rules (no legally binding effect).\n\nInterested parties also have the possibility to request hearings with the Commission services within 5 days from entry into force of provisional measures, and to provide comments within 15 days from entry into force. After that, having taken into account the comments by interested parties, the Commission will disclose its proposal for definitive measures, if any, and allow adequate time (10 days) for interested parties to comment.\n\nThe Commission will then present the final determination to Member States, which will vote pursuant to the examination procedure under comitology rules (Commission proposal adopted unless there is qualified majority against it). This vote will have binding effect. Any potential measures will be in force for 5 years, extendable upon substantiated request and subsequent review.\n\nFollowing a substantiated request, one BEV producer in China - Tesla - may receive an individually calculated duty rate at the definitive stage. Any other company producing in China not selected in the final sample that wishes to have its particular situation investigated can ask for an accelerated review, in line with the basic anti-subsidy Regulation, just after imposition of definitive measures. The deadline for concluding such a review is 9 months since its request.\n\nBackground\n\nThe investigation was announced by Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, on 13 September 2023 during her State of the European Union (SOTEU) speech. This decision was based on growing evidence-based concerns about the recent and rapid rise in low-priced exports of electric vehicles coming from China to the EU.

Total deliveries fell 12% to 13,390 vehicles, a drop that marginally outweighed the let-up in demand for all-electric models across the region.\n\nSince 2019, Chinese carmakers led by SAIC Motor Corp. -- which turned Britain's defunct MG brand into an EV dynamo -- have captured a growing slice of a market vital to Europe's industrial stability and future jobs. Their growing success prompted the European Union last year to probe government aid to the sector. Findings to be formalized this week are set to trigger higher import tariffs of as much as 48%, up from a current 10%.\n\nThe EV shift in Europe has recently slowed, with all-electric sales in May declining 11% -- they now make up just 14% of the region's passenger-car market. Yet battery-powered cars remain on course to take over as the EU phases out sales of fuel-burning vehicles by the middle of the next decade.\n\nThat's where Chinese carmakers see an opening to conquer a lucrative export market: lower-cost battery technology and generous government support give them an advantage over the likes of Volkswagen, Stellantis and Renault. State aid for Chinese manufacturers has brought Beijing to the brink of a trade war with the EU, with China threatening to retaliate.\n\nThe tariffs also target Chinese-made models including BMW's iX3 SUV, Renault's Dacia Spring and Tesla's Model 3. In all, nearly two in five battery-electric cars sold across Europe were made in China, according to automotive consultants Jato Dynamics.\n\nWhile they've maintained market share, Chinese brands haven't avoided the slump in European EV demand. MG's sales in the region slid 34% in May from the year-ago period, based on data from Jato.\n\n\"Concerns around the upcoming measures taken by the EU, and more focus on ICE cars explain this negative result for the brand,\" said Felipe Munoz, senior analyst at Jato, referring to models powered by internal combustion engines. \"However, BYD did quite well, thanks to the Atto 3 SUV and the introduction of the Seal, Dolphin and Seal U.\"\n\nMore broadly, the removal or scaling back of EV buying subsidies continues to hurt demand. Sales in Germany slid 31% in May from a year earlier, after Europe's biggest automotive market pulled incentives for battery-electric cars late last year.\n\nWhile talks with the EU could yet avert a trade war, China has threatened to retaliate with levies on cars with large engines that would hit German luxury manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz Group, BMW and Porsche. Chinese officials have also taken aim at French brandy and Spanish ham in a bid to deter the new EV tariffs.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [],

The International Energy Agency (IEA) reported that China accounted for nearly 60 percent of new electric car registrations globally in 2023, followed by Europe at 25 percent, the United States at 10 percent and the rest of the world accounting for the remaining 5 percent.\n\nWhile Chinese automakers have entrenched their position in their homegrown market for many years, they have started to spur expansion to other regions. As a result, China experienced a significant surge in the export value of its battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which quadrupled from US$8.59 billion in 2021 to $34.13 billion by 2023.\n\nChinese EV manufacturers, such as BYD, SAIC Motor Corp-owned MG, Nio, GAC Motor, Li Auto, Geely and Chery, among others, collectively took up 53 percent of the global market share for EVs in 2023. In the same year, Chinese automaker BYD surpassed Tesla as the world's best-selling EV brand.\n\nFierce competition in the EV market has prompted governments in several jurisdictions, particularly the United States and the European Union, to enact measures to curb Chinese dominance and protect their domestic industries.\n\nOn May 14, Washington unveiled tariff hikes on some goods imported from China, including a quadrupling of import duties on Chinese EVs to 100 percent. The Biden administration stated that the new measures aimed to protect American manufacturers and their workers.\n\nThe recent Washington regulations will add to a long list of protectionist actions, further escalating tensions between the two economic superpowers. In response, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated that the country \"firmly opposes\" the tariff hike and will take measures to safeguard its own rights and interests.\n\nOn June 12, the European Union subsequently planned to implement a similar measure by imposing tariffs ranging from 17 percent to 38 percent for Chinese EVs following the bloc's investigation of an anti-subsidy probe last year.", "source": {"uri": "thejakartapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jakarta Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Auto", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BYD Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nio_Inc.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nio Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Auto", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Li Auto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesla,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tesla, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAC_Group", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GAC Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chery", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAIC_Motor", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SAIC Motor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geely", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geely"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Protectionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superpower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Import and Export", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://img.jakpost.net/c/2024/06/20/2024_06_20_151669_1718890380._large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1277, "textEnd": 1283}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 1862, "textEnd": 1869}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

This decision follows an investigation that found evidence of WTO-incompatible subsidies for Chinese BEVs. The EU is now the last major market to establish new trade barriers against Chinese BEVs. While imports of Chinese vehicles may significantly decrease, the long-term impact on electric vehicle prices is expected to be minimal. It could be particularly advantageous for the EU to now adjust its tariff policies towards other WTO members as well.\n\nUsing simulations from a trade model (the KITE model) encompassing many countries and sectors, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW Kiel), the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), and the Supply Chain Intelligence Institute Austria (ASCII) project that the provisional countervailing duties effective July 4, 2024, will reduce vehicle imports from China by 42 percent. This reduction will be largely offset by higher sales from European producers within the EU and increased imports from third countries. The duties will have a negligible long-term impact on vehicle prices. Electric vehicle prices in the EU might rise by an average of 0.3 to 0.9 percent, while prices in China might decrease. Short-term effects could be more pronounced.\n\n\"The value added in the EU auto industry is expected to rise by 0.4 percent, while it will decrease by 0.6 percent in China,\" says Julian Hinz, Research Director of Trade Policy at the Kiel Institute and co-author of the newly released Kiel Policy Brief \"Time to be Open, Sustainable, and Assertive: Tariffs on Chinese BEVs and retaliatory measures.\" (https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/time-to-be-open-sustainable-and-assertive-t...) The anticipated increase in prosperity in most EU countries will be minimal, less than 0.01 percentage points.\n\nAbolishing existing import duties?\n\nApart from the newly decided countervailing duties, the EU currently imposes a 10 percent import duty on cars from WTO member countries without a free trade agreement. Reducing these duties on battery electric vehicles to zero could lower prices in the EU by up to 0.8 percent. Simultaneously, imports from China would only decrease by about 20 percent, while imports from third countries would increase by over 1 percent. \"This scenario would enhance EU welfare more than the pure countervailing duty scenario, and the green transformation would benefit from more 'fair' trade,\" states Julian Hinz.\n\n\"This approach could demonstrate what the new trade policy doctrine, which aims for trade policy to be 'open, sustainable, and assertive,' means in practice,\" says Gabriel Felbermayr, Director of the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) and co-author of the Kiel Policy Brief. \"With the countervailing duties, the EU supports the multilateral trading system and fair competition. Conversely, by reducing existing import duties, the EU could show that it also pursues the affordability of electric vehicles and the green transformation.\"\n\nDuties on pork with minimal effects\n\n\"In principle, the EU is right in responding to China's trade-distorting practices with countervailing duties,\" says Gabriel Felbermayr. \"At the same time, the EU should strive to achieve a negotiated outcome and avoid escalation. There is time until early November 2024, when the definitive duties would be imposed. By then, the Commission must also address doubts about its methodology that exist in some member states and adjust the countervailing duties if necessary.\"\n\nIn response, China has announced it will investigate the application of 50 percent anti-dumping duties on pork imports from the EU. This would be particularly challenging for pig farmers in Denmark, Spain, and Germany. However, given that exports have been declining for several years, this measure would likely have minimal impact on EU welfare. Felbermayr comments, \"Counter-measures by China, whether legitimate or not, were anticipated. The fact that China has not resorted to harsher measures so far indicates a willingness to negotiate.\"\n\nRead Kiel Policy Brief now (https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/time-to-be-open-sustainable-and-assertive-t...)\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nElisabeth Radke\n\nHead of Outreach\n\nT +49 431 8814-598\n\nelisabeth.radke@ifw-kiel.de\n\nKiel Institute for the World Economy\n\nKiellinie 66 | 24105 Kiel | Germany\n\nChausseestra\u00dfe 111 | 10115 Berlin | Germany\n\nT +49 431 8814-1\n\nE info@ifw-kiel.de\n\nwww.ifw-kiel.de", "source": {"uri": "idw-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "Informationdienst Wissenschaft e.V. - idw"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countervailing_duties", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Countervailing duties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Battery electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kiel"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kiel"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Institute_of_Economic_Research", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austrian Institute of Economic Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_barrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade barrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiel_Institute_for_the_World_Economy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kiel Institute for the World Economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_trade_agreement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free trade agreement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Felbermayr", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gabriel Felbermayr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilateralism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multilateralism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dumping (pricing policy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "http://www.idw-online.de/de/institutionlogo33472", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9702114", "eventUri": "eng-9702114", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

We strongly support this approach and appeal to both sides to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion,\" she said in a July 4 statement.\n\nShe reiterated that BEV import duties were not suitable for strengthening the competitiveness of the European automotive industry, adding that the German industry was committed to free and fair trade.\n\n\"Any protectionist measure, including additional tariffs as well as unjustified and market-distorting subsidies, restricts free trade and carries the risk of trade conflicts that ultimately work to the detriment of all sides,\" Muller said.\n\n\"There is no doubt that the results of the anti-subsidy investigation show that the extent and nature of government support in China is a challenge,\" she added. \"But the potential damage that the countervailing duties now provisionally imposed could cause is likely to be greater than the possible benefit of increasing market isolation.\"\n\nMuller pointed out that a trade conflict would endanger the transformation towards electromobility and digitalization, as China played a crucial role.\n\nShe said the duties would quickly have a negative impact in the event of a trade conflict, rather than solving the challenges facing the European automotive industry.\n\n\"Instead, the focus must finally be on Europe as an industrial location. Locational attractiveness and competitiveness are the best prerequisites for a successful transformation and for a leading position in international competition,\" Muller said, calling for an active industrial strategy, including an active trade policy.\n\n\"What is needed is an approach that promotes the strengths of our industrial nation, develops the location to be internationally competitive, opens up new markets, focuses on innovation and thus secures prosperity and growth as well as a confident role on the world stage,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "spglobal.com", "dataType": "news",

This decision follows an investigation that found evidence of WTO-incompatible subsidies for Chinese BEVs. The EU is now the last major market to establish new trade barriers against Chinese BEVs. While imports of Chinese vehicles may significantly decrease, the long-term impact on electric vehicle prices is expected to be minimal. It could be particularly advantageous for the EU to now adjust its tariff policies towards other WTO members as well.\n\nUsing simulations from a trade model (the KITE model) encompassing many countries and sectors, the Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW Kiel), the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO), and the Supply Chain Intelligence Institute Austria (ASCII) project that the provisional countervailing duties effective July 4, 2024, will reduce vehicle imports from China by 42 percent. This reduction will be largely offset by higher sales from European producers within the EU and increased imports from third countries. The duties will have a negligible long-term impact on vehicle prices. Electric vehicle prices in the EU might rise by an average of 0.3 to 0.9 percent, while prices in China might decrease. Short-term effects could be more pronounced.\n\n\"The value added in the EU auto industry is expected to rise by 0.4 percent, while it will decrease by 0.6 percent in China,\" says Julian Hinz, Research Director of Trade Policy at the Kiel Institute and co-author of the newly released Kiel Policy Brief \"Time to be Open, Sustainable, and Assertive: Tariffs on Chinese BEVs and retaliatory measures.\" (https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/time-to-be-open-sustainable-and-assertive-t...) The anticipated increase in prosperity in most EU countries will be minimal, less than 0.01 percentage points.\n\nAbolishing existing import duties?\n\nApart from the newly decided countervailing duties, the EU currently imposes a 10 percent import duty on cars from WTO member countries without a free trade agreement. Reducing these duties on battery electric vehicles to zero could lower prices in the EU by up to 0.8 percent. Simultaneously, imports from China would only decrease by about 20 percent, while imports from third countries would increase by over 1 percent. \"This scenario would enhance EU welfare more than the pure countervailing duty scenario, and the green transformation would benefit from more 'fair' trade,\" states Julian Hinz.\n\n\"This approach could demonstrate what the new trade policy doctrine, which aims for trade policy to be 'open, sustainable, and assertive,' means in practice,\" says Gabriel Felbermayr, Director of the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) and co-author of the Kiel Policy Brief. \"With the countervailing duties, the EU supports the multilateral trading system and fair competition. Conversely, by reducing existing import duties, the EU could show that it also pursues the affordability of electric vehicles and the green transformation.\"\n\nDuties on pork with minimal effects\n\n\"In principle, the EU is right in responding to China's trade-distorting practices with countervailing duties,\" says Gabriel Felbermayr. \"At the same time, the EU should strive to achieve a negotiated outcome and avoid escalation. There is time until early November 2024, when the definitive duties would be imposed. By then, the Commission must also address doubts about its methodology that exist in some member states and adjust the countervailing duties if necessary.\"\n\nIn response, China has announced it will investigate the application of 50 percent anti-dumping duties on pork imports from the EU. This would be particularly challenging for pig farmers in Denmark, Spain, and Germany. However, given that exports have been declining for several years, this measure would likely have minimal impact on EU welfare. Felbermayr comments, \"Counter-measures by China, whether legitimate or not, were anticipated. The fact that China has not resorted to harsher measures so far indicates a willingness to negotiate.\"\n\nRead Kiel Policy Brief now (https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/time-to-be-open-sustainable-and-assertive-t...)\n\nMedia Contact:\n\nElisabeth Radke\n\nHead of Outreach\n\nT +49 431 8814-598\n\nelisabeth.radke@ifw-kiel.de\n\nKiel Institute for the World Economy\n\nKiellinie 66 | 24105 Kiel | Germany\n\nChausseestra\u00dfe 111 | 10115 Berlin | Germany\n\nT +49 431 8814-1\n\nE info@ifw-kiel.de\n\nwww.ifw-kiel.de\n\nCriteria of this press release:\n\nBusiness and commerce, Journalists, Scientists and scholars\n\nEconomics / business administration, Politics, Social studies\n\ntransregional, national\n\nTransfer of Science or Research\n\nEnglish", "source": {"uri": "idw-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "Informationdienst Wissenschaft e.V. -

Total deliveries fell 12 per cent to 13,390 vehicles, a drop that marginally outweighed the let-up in demand for all-electric models across the region.\n\nSince 2019, Chinese carmakers led by Saic Motor - which turned Britain's defunct MG brand into an EV dynamo - have captured a growing slice of a market vital to Europe's industrial stability and future jobs. Their growing success prompted the European Union last year to probe government aid to the sector. Findings to be formalised this week are set to trigger higher import tariffs of as much as 48 per cent, up from a current 10 per cent.\n\nThe EV shift in Europe has recently slowed, with all-electric sales in May declining 11 per cent - they now make up just 14 per cent of the region's passenger-car market. Yet battery-powered cars remain on course to take over as the EU phases out sales of fuel-burning vehicles by the middle of the next decade.\n\nThat's where Chinese carmakers see an opening to conquer a lucrative export market: lower-cost battery technology and generous government support give them an advantage over the likes of Volkswagen, Stellantis and Renault. State aid for Chinese manufacturers has brought Beijing to the brink of a trade war with the EU, with China threatening to retaliate.\n\nThe tariffs also target Chinese-made models including BMW's iX3 SUV, Renault's Dacia Spring and Tesla's Model 3. In all, nearly two in five battery-electric cars sold across Europe were made in China, according to automotive consultants Jato Dynamics.\n\nWhile they have maintained market share, Chinese brands have not avoided the slump in European EV demand. MG's sales in the region slid 34 per cent in May from the year-ago period, based on data from Jato.\n\n\"Concerns around the upcoming measures taken by the EU, and more focus on ICE cars explain this negative result for the brand,\" said Felipe Munoz, senior analyst at Jato, referring to models powered by internal combustion engines. \"However, BYD did quite well, thanks to the Atto 3 SUV and the introduction of the Seal, Dolphin and Seal U.\"\n\nMore broadly, the removal or scaling back of EV buying subsidies continues to hurt demand. Sales in Germany slid 31 per cent in May from a year earlier, after Europe's biggest automotive market pulled incentives for battery-electric cars late last year.\n\nWhile talks with the EU could yet avert a trade war, China has threatened to retaliate with levies on cars with large engines that would hit German luxury manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz Group, BMW and Porsche. Chinese officials have also taken aim at French brandy and Spanish ham in a bid to deter the new EV tariffs.

It said that a final decision must be taken on definitive duties within four months through a vote by EU member states.\n\nPrior to this announcement, China's Ministry of Commerce on the same day said that China hopes the EU will work with it and show sincerity in advancing talks on the EU's anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EVs. It also called for rationality and pragmatism as talks continue.\n\nThe European Commission said its consultations with the Chinese government have intensified in recent weeks, and that contact continues at a technical level with a view to reaching a WTO-compatible solution.\n\nChina has emphasized the importance of dialogue and consultation in addressing economic and trade frictions, and there has been growing recognition of China-EU interdependence in the global auto industry. Scholars and stakeholders have elaborated on the indispensable role of Chinese EV makers, given their scale advantages and leading technologies capable of catering to diversified consumer needs, and, broadly speaking, the world's need to go green.\n\nCHINESE EVS ARE INDISPENSABLE\n\nThere has been growing consensus that the world will require significantly accelerated development in the field of green energy to push forward decarbonization, and that China's affordable clean tech products will only make positive contributions to that end.\n\nJeremy Jurgens, managing director of the World Economic Forum, told Xinhua in a recent interview that China is clearly already leading in new energy technology, represented by EVs. He noted that the country's EV sector has strong advantages spanning battery technology, software development and a large domestic market.\n\nThe 1.4 billion people in China mean varied individual tastes in different regions and cities, he said. And as the car moves from a mechanical device to a software device, the ability to adapt software to different interests becomes an important competitive advantage. \"So the extent that China can adapt that software in the vehicle to different market preferences and needs will actually be a strong competitive advantage in the future.\"\n\nDouglas Johnson-Poensgen, CEO of Circulor, a solutions provider that can trace the auto industry's complex supply chains, told Xinhua that the world needs more renewable energy and a faster energy transition.\n\n\"We're all humans on the same planet. We need to build renewable energy infrastructure at the pace if we have any chance of getting towards net-zero carbon emissions in a sensible time frame,\" Johnson-Poensgen said.\n\nHe added that China clearly has economic leadership when it comes to producing green products and driving down the prices of EVs and solar panels to make them more affordable, which will ultimately be good for the world.\n\n\"It's pretty clear that the future will be in electrical vehicles,\" Jurgens said, acknowledging the disruption that the rapid advancement of EVs has brought to traditional manufacturers that have not yet transitioned from internal combustion engines to EVs.\n\n\"It is understandable that some countries may want to delay that transition to be able to allow their domestic producers more time to make the transition. But overall, I think we still need to have far more production of electric vehicles to further electrify the economy,\" Jurgens said. The advancement and dissemination of these technologies will allow consumers to start shifting their energy consumption patterns, he added.\n\n\"As China looks for sustainable, affordable and secure energy sources, China not only improves its own position, it actually makes a contribution to global sustainability and can help the world achieve decarbonization targets,\" he said.\n\nIn its latest Global Automotive Outlook, global consulting firm AlixPartners predicts Chinese brands will continue to increase their share of the European light vehicle market, with that share forecast to rise from 6 percent in 2024 to 12 percent by 2030.\n\n\"Any short-term slowdown of Chinese electric vehicle sales into Europe is likely to contribute to many countries across Europe undershooting on their Green Deal targets,\" said Andrew Bergbaum, global co-head of the automotive and industrial practice at AlixPartners.\n\nCHINESE EVS SPICE UP COMPETITION, BENEFITING CONSUMERS\n\nAccusations have arisen that Chinese EVs are being dumped in global markets at low prices, but consumers doubt the logic of such rhetoric as not everyone can easily afford an expensive EV.\n\nA recent report from the Canada-based Toronto Star interpreted this vividly, arguing that car drivers must be considered in tariff responses because people are the ones who buy cars, and not all consumers can afford a Tesla or a Polestar. \"We must not penalize consumers and slow our climate efforts in the meantime.\"\n\nIt said an \"inelegant\" trade move could result in even fewer models and higher prices for consumers.\n\nDanny Quah, dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said that dumping is when an exporter sells a product in a foreign country at a price lower than it does in its own, hence running losses. He said that many Chinese products -- especially batteries and EVs -- are cheaper in China than in the Western market, including the EU.\n\nHe said that China's exports of EVs are only about 14 percent of its total production -- a smaller fraction than that of cars exported from Japan and South Korea. \"China subsidizes in the EV industry, yes, but for consumers to purchase EVs, not for producers to make them. Those subsidies can purchase Teslas just as easily as BYDs.\"\n\n\"While rightly looking out for their own industries and businesses, everyone needs to think a little also about the good of our planet. The world needs clean energy. Emerging economies still need massive sustained bursts of energy to develop, and they cannot afford costly technologies to replace fossil fuels,\" he added.\n\nJurgens said that most of the EV supply is in fact for Chinese consumption, and that the rate of growth of EV utilization in China is very high and probably growing at the fastest pace in the world. \"If you look at the actual market dynamics here, this is one of the most competitive markets in the world.\"\n\nBergbaum said the world has come to a point in time when cars need to be engineered differently. \"Vehicles often need to be able to receive live data over the air, offer advanced drive assist systems and customizable features, and in some instances, incorporate real-time data computing.\"\n\nThere is much to be learnt from the rapid product gestation, integrated supply chains, consumer-centric sales, aggressive expansion and competitive pricing, which are reshaping market dynamics in China and set to underpin the future of the global automotive industry, according to him.

Quoting the EC statement, the Euro News report stated that the taxes will be imposed on top of the existing 10 percent tax rates for EVs in the EU.\n\nThe EU imposed these taxes based on the parent company, annual turnover, and suspected amount of subsidies received by China.\n\nAccording to the EC report quoted by Euro News, the EU has imposed a 17.4 per cent duty on vehicles by BYD, 19.9 per cent on vehicles by Geely, and 37.6 per cent on vehicles made by SAIC.\n\nThe EC report further mentioned that other BEV producers in China, which cooperated in the investigation but have not been sampled, would be subject to a weighted average duty of 21 per cent. All other BEV producers in China which did not cooperate in the investigation would be subject to a residual duty of 38.1 per cent.

[Reuters/Leonhard Simon]\n\nThe European Commission on Thursday published the findings of its nine-month investigation into China's electric vehicle market, giving insight into how it calculated tariffs and the evidence it collected to support its highest profile trade case.\n\nThe report details reluctance by the Chinese government and state-owned automaker SAIC to cooperate with the Commission's investigation into whether Chinese EV makers benefit from unfair state support.\n\nThat justified imposing the top tariff rate of 37.6% on SAIC, while fellow Chinese automakers BYD and Geely face lower tariffs of 17.4% and 19.9% respectively to reflect their cooperation.\n\nThe document accompanied the announcement of provisional tariffs for Chinese-made electric vehicles of up to 37.6% which come into effect on Friday, ratcheting up tensions with Beijing which has threatened to retaliate.\n\nIt will likely form part of the Commission's defence if the Chinese government complains to the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe Chinese government's tight control over its automakers prevents them \"from acting as rational market operators seeking to maximise profits, and in fact forces them to act as an arm of the government,\" the report says.\n\nThus, it concludes, the \"threat of material injury\" to Europe's automakers \"is clearly foreseeable and imminent\".\n\nThe report covers similar ground to a longer one the Commission released in April on the Chinese government's interference in its economy and strategic industries that analysts say lays the foundations for future trade cases as Brussels toughens its stance on Beijing.\n\nSubsidies given to Chinese automakers, the Commission found, took the form of cheap loans, inexpensive land and direct incentives for selling EVs.\n\nThey also received help with the cost of batteries, the single most expensive part of an EV.\n\nSAIC and Geely have access to batteries for \"less than adequate remuneration,\" and while BYD makes its own batteries, it has access to subsidised battery materials, above all lithium.\n\nRevealing Breakdown\n\nAmong the most revealing sections is a breakdown of the core types of government subsidies by company, which added together form the basis of each company's duty.\n\nTake SAIC: the EU estimates its subsidies total 34.4%.\n\nThat breaks down into 1.38% for loans from state-owned banks, 8.27% for other forms of financing, 8.56% in the form of grants, 2.28% in EV sales incentives, 0.67% for cheap land and 13.24% for under-priced batteries.\n\nSubsidies in the same categories total 15.1% for BYD and 19.72% for Geely.\n\nThe Chinese government has complained that the Commission sought an unprecedented amount of detailed information on Chinese automakers' supply chains during its subsidy investigation.\n\nBut the Commission catalogues lengthy back-and-forth arguments in a number of areas where Beijing either declined to cooperate or failed to provide more basic information, including the number of EVs registered in China, or registrations by brand, model and location.\n\n\"It is highly unlikely that the GOC (government of China) does not have information on the number of BEVs (battery electric vehicles) registered in China during a given period,\" the report said.\n\nIt also details evasion by SAIC, which said it could not provide the information requested.\n\nChinese financial institutions that lend money to SAIC, BYD and Geely \"did not provide any creditworthiness assessment,\" so the Commission did its own investigation, the report said.\n\nThe three automakers all have top-notch 'AAA' credit ratings received from Chinese state-owned rating agencies - higher ratings bring lower interest rates.\n\nBut because of problem areas such as their high debt-to-equity ratios and use of loans to pay down debt, the Commission found that their overall financial rating corresponded to a 'B' rating.

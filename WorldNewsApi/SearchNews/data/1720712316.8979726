{"id": 231989514, "title": "Trump hides the worst scandal in American history in plain sight", "text": "It\u2019s been nearly two weeks since Donald Trump echoed his 2016 public request for Vladimir Putin\u2019s help in winning a presidential election, and the press remains determined to ignore it. The convicted felon, presumptive GOP nominee and wannabe dictator instructed the dictator of Russia to continue holding Wall St. Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich hostage until the election. This treachery echoes the successful effort by the Reagan campaign to \u201ctorpedo\u201d the release of the American hostages held in Iran before the 1980 election while burying Trump\u2019s failure to attempt to arrange for the release of Paul Whelan, an American imprisoned in Russia when Trump was in power. This media\u2019s abdication of any attempt to tell the story of how the Russia attack on the 2016 election has helped bring America to the brink of fascism is one of the main reasons I\u2019m helping Marcy Wheeler put together her Ball of Thread podcast. The concerted effort to ignore Trump's begging for Putin's help in this specific instance goes along with the media\u2019s general surrender on the connections between Trump and Russia. It was almost absent in the debate about supporting Ukraine and in the more than half-year delay in that aid that has given Russia an advantage in that war that Putin never would have had otherwise. This media\u2019s abdication of any attempt to tell the story of how the Russia attack on the 2016 election has helped bring America to the brink of fascism is one of the main reasons I\u2019m helping Marcy Wheeler put together her Ball of Thread podcast. You can watch the first episode below. Given the stakes of November's election, it\u2019s the kind of journalism any serious publication should be doing. But you don\u2019t have to be CSI: Moscow to connect the dots of what\u2019s going on here. The GOP is signaling its support for Putin over Ukraine and NATO. And Putin is responding by demonstrating his impunity at home, in Ukraine and against America\u2019s NATO ally Finland. Putin trollingly suggested in mid-February that he would prefer Biden to Trump. But only because Trump\u2019s anti-NATO statements had gotten so apparent that they might get in the way of Russia\u2019s more subtle efforts to help him. Instead, the press obsessed over far more critical issues, like Joe Biden being one summer Olympics older than Donald Trump. When there was a scandal of this magnitude in the last century, the press became obsessed with questions like the one Brian Beutler keeps asking: \u201cWhat did Republicans know, and when did they know it?\u201d But there are several reasons the press refuses to ask these questions now: Trump paralyzed the press with a single word\u201cDonald Trump and his MAGA legions have spent years shock-training reporters not to bring up anything else about Russian disinformation programs aimed at helping Donald Trump,\u201d Talking Point Memo\u2019s Josh Marshall explained. Most of this training has come from one word \u2013 \u201choax.\u201d Since 2017, Trump has used that word and the mocking phrase \u201cRussia, Russia, Russia\u201d to mock any suggestion of a conspiracy between him and Putin. No one should believe the \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracy theory that there\u2019s anything to him begging Russia to hack Hillary Clinton (which it did), his son seeking dirt on Hillary Clinton from a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower, and Trump himself siding with Putin over American intelligence in Helsinki. All you have to do is repeat the magic H-word. That and a constant torrent of death threats seem to have successfully trained the press not to get too wise about Trump and Russia.Democrats don\u2019t see advantage in focusing on RussiaEvidence suggests that Special Counsel Robert Mueller expected his report to be taken as a referral for an impeachment. Instead, Trump\u2019s pick to cover up the Russia scandal, Attorney General Bill Barr, showed the power of framing with a memo that gutted the overwhelming betrayal, illegality and obstruction Mueller\u2019s team discovered. With the media battle lost before it began, Democrats essentially moved on. They\u2019d decide their midterm wins over health care and opposing hugely unpopular things like Trump\u2019s corporate tax cuts were far safer bets. Because as obvious as Trump\u2019s alignment with Putin was, the details remain murky. And almost as soon as the Russian investigations retreated, Trump began the high crimes that led to his first impeachment, which coincidentally involved the president\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, dealing with three Ukrainians now indicted for treason over their connections to Russia. And the press utterly failed to connect those crimes with the Russia attack, something we will make clear in Ball of Thread.Putin's propaganda has infected our body politicYou probably have never heard about Russia's connection to Trump's first impeachment. And I don\u2019t blame you if you haven\u2019t! Almost no one has the time or mental RAM to keep track of all the entanglements and obfuscations that cloud the obviousness of Trump and the GOP\u2019s growing alliance with Putin. Marcy has documented nearly every step of this story, as it happens, telling her readers what most of the public won\u2019t know until historians have time to suss through the details if we still have historians in the future. She, almost solely, has documented the \u201ccorrupt and complex machinations\u201d of Barr to not only spoil all the Russia investigations he inherited, which were finally killed off by pardons, but also defend Trump from his first impeachment by making the Department of Justice a willing recipient of the Russian lies being trafficked through Giuliani. Marcy spends much of her day raging at the people who have gotten the details of this abstruse Ball of Thread wrong, including me. Because if she doesn\u2019t, literally no one else will. The way that the Republican Party led by Donald Trump has embraced Vladimir Putin, one of the worst people alive and possibly the greatest thief of his people\u2019s wealth ever to live, is a scandal so catastrophic that it almost sounds ridiculous when you describe it accurately. And nearly everyone who has the power to convey the essential details of this ominous and growing threat has given up on their responsibility. The reasons for this range from cowardice to excessive \u201csavviness\u201d and outright complicity. But it\u2019s important to discuss it anywhere else we can, not just because we are patriots disgusted by this betrayal of our country and decency itself, but also because it shows the power of framing and repetition\u2014 two skills that Trump is better at than almost any American politician. Like Putin, his greatest strength is capitalizing on our weaknesses and capturing the brains of people who should know better.", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/donald-trump-and-vladimir-putin-afp.jpg?id=25263692&width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C17%2C0%2C17\"/><br/><br/><p>It\u2019s been nearly two weeks since Donald Trump echoed his 2016 public request for Vladimir Putin\u2019s help in winning a presidential election, and the press remains determined to ignore it.</p><p>The convicted felon, presumptive GOP nominee and wannabe dictator instructed the dictator of Russia to continue <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-claims-elected-vladimir-putin-will-release-jailed-us-reporter-ev-rcna153747?ref=i-know-how-much-you-care.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">holding <em>Wall St. Journal</em> reporter Evan Gershkovich</a> hostage until the election.</p><p>This treachery echoes the successful effort by the Reagan campaign to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/18/us/politics/jimmy-carter-october-surprise-iran-hostages.html?ref=i-know-how-much-you-care.ghost.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferr", "url": "https://www.rawstory.com/raw-investigates/trump-putin-scandal/", "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/donald-trump-and-vladimir-putin-afp.jpg?id=25263692&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C70%2C0%2C70", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 13:49:47", "author": "Alternet,Jason Sattler", "authors": ["Alternet", "Jason Sattler"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.16}

Laureano Oubi\u00f1a, from Galicia in northwest Spain, was furious with the portrayal of him as a brutish crime lord in the TV series Cocaine Coast (Fari\u00f1a). The 78-year-old was particularly enraged by the depiction of him having sex with his wife and decided to sue Netflix for \u20ac1.5 million, claiming the show 'caused him moral damage'. Now a judge has ordered the company to cut an 'explicit sex scene' in the opening episode when a police raid catches Oubi\u00f1a in the act, The Times has reported. Netflix has also been told to pay the drug smuggler - who was convicted for trafficking marijuana and money laundering - \u20ac15,000 for violating his privacy. The court concluded that the sex scene - which only showed the backs of the actors playing Oubi\u00f1a and his wife - was not justified by 'the undeniable creative freedom of the creators and producers of the series'. It was also heard that the scene was included only to 'hook the viewer into the plot' and was therefore unnecessary. Oubi\u00f1a's lawyer Jorge Paladino, argued the life of his client had 'worsened considerably' since the broadcasting of the series. He said this was because it portrayed Oubi\u00f1a as a person 'capable of taking the life of another' and as a 'violent, sexist cocaine trafficker' who was 'unfaithful' and an 'abuser of women'. The 78-year-old was previously convicted of trafficking marijuana and money laundering but was released from prison in 2017. The sex scene in question takes place n the Pazo de Baion mansion - which was seized by police and later sold by the state for \u20ac15 million in 2008. Although Netflix was ordered to remove the sex scene, Oubi\u00f1a's other complaints were not upheld by the court. The judge concluded the TV series was 'inspired by reality' and that the image of Oubi\u00f1a portrayed in the drama was not 'very different' from the one that he himself had projected for years. Cocaine Coast is a fictionalised dramatisation of the rise of Galicia's drug-clans in the 1980s and 1990s. What started as the smuggling of everyday items such as soap and sugar from Portugal in the 1940s, later morphed into the trafficking of marijuana from Morocco and cocaine from Columbia. Cocaine Coast was viewed by 2.5million Spanish households when it was first released in 2018. The legal action taken by Oubi\u00f1a comes after Fiona Harvey, who says she is the person the character Martha is based on in Baby Reindeer, also threatened legal action against Netflix. She is claiming defamation, negligence and privacy violations.

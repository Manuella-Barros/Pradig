{"id": 225001690, "title": "'Eric' review: Netflix series piles on the misery of Benedict Cumberbatch's bitter puppeteer", "text": "The performances by the versatile Benedict Cumberbatch and the ensemble cast in the Netflix limited series crime drama \u201cEric\u201d are something to behold. The camerawork and production design are strikingly evocative of the 1980s New York setting, in particular some of the darkest and grubbiest and most forbidding and crime-riddled pockets of the city. The plot, with the disappearance of a child at the heart of the story, has echoes of gripping films such as \u201cRansom\u201d and \u201cGone Baby Gone,\u201d and draws you in from the start. And yet. Despite those elements of prestige TV, \u201cEric\u201d becomes an increasingly difficult and tiresome slog over the course of six episodes, in large part because of the manner in which it piles on the darkness and the ugliness, to the point where it\u2019s overkill. It doesn\u2019t help that Cumberbatch\u2019s Vincent is such an odious and irredeemable character \u2014 the kind of person who by walking into a room makes you want to walk OUT of the room \u2014 that it\u2019s a real task to feel empathy for his plight. Created by the gifted Abi Morgan (\u201cSuffragette\u201d) and filmed in New York City as well as Budapest (!), \u201cEric\u201d is set against the backdrop of a New York on the verge of collapsing under the weight of rising crime rates, police corruption, the AIDS epidemic, homelessness and endemic racism. Cumberbatch\u2019s Vincent Anderson is a tightly wound, hard-drinking, verbally abusive and thoroughly unpleasant man who is a master puppeteer and the creator of a \u201cSesame Street\u201d-esque children\u2019s TV show called \u201cGood Day Sunshine,\u201d and it\u2019s a stretch to believe this guy has ever had a good day or enjoyed the sunshine, but therein lies the dichotomy of it all, one supposes. (We learn Vincent has mental health issues and had a miserable childhood with his wealthy and cold-hearted parents; it goes to reason that he created this fantasy-world, hap-hap-happy TV show to fill some gaping hole in his heart.) Vincent and his wife Cassie (Gaby Hoffman) are in the late stages of a dying marriage that is growing increasingly vituperative, with their 9-year-old son Edgar (Ivan Howe) caught in the crossfire. Edgar is clearly frightened by his intense father, who hears about an idea Edgar has for a new puppet and makes his son pitch it to him as if they\u2019re colleagues, with Vincent barking at Edgar, \u201cKeep looking at me. ... You gotta pitch this thing. ... Horns or no horns \u2014 you gotta be SPECIFIC. ... Buzz! It\u2019s just nosedived.\u201d Some guy, that Vincent. After Edgar goes missing on the short walk from his apartment to school, the story branches out in a myriad of directions and takes us into the lives of a number of characters whose lives are impacted by Edgar\u2019s disappearance. McKinley Belcher III gives a screen-commanding performance as Detective Michael Ledroit, who heads up the case even as he cares for his longtime partner, William (Mark Gillis), who is dying of AIDS. The wonderful veteran actor Clarke Peters is George, the superintendent of the apartment building where Edgar lives, and whose own apartment contains some disturbing secrets. Wade Allain-Marcus is Gator, who runs a seedy nightclub and was once involved with Ledroit. Adepero Orere plays the mother of a 14-year-old Black boy named Marlon (Bence Orere), whose disappearance didn\u2019t garner nearly the media and police attention as Edgar\u2019s. Bamar Kane is Yussuf, a graffiti tagger and hustler who lives with hundreds if not thousands of other unhoused individuals in the tunnels underneath the streets. With visuals bathed in tones cold and dark, \u201cEric\u201d follows Vincent as he spirals deeper into alcoholism and addiction, even as he desperately tries to bring to \u201clife\u201d Eric, the Yeti-like puppet Edgar had drawn, and get him on the show, in the hopes Eric the puppet will be the beacon that brings Edgar home. Oh, and an imaginary version of Eric also begins to accompany Vincent, alternately encouraging him and berating him, and we sure hope they don\u2019t run into that imaginary furry guy from \u201cIF\u201d on the streets of New York. We understand Vincent has been dealt a rough hand and isn\u2019t well, but still, watching this guy wallow in his self-centered misery even when his son is missing leaves us repelled. \u201cEric\u201d piles on with the dark views of humanity as seen in several other characters, including Vincent\u2019s parents, Ledroit\u2019s precinct captain and William\u2019s sister, who are awful human beings. There\u2019s even a late reveal about a seemingly likable supporting player that seems unnecessarily, arbitrarily nasty. \u201cEric\u201d is painted in harsh and broad strokes, and the cynicism and ugliness is relentless without being particularly insightful.", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2024/05/29/eric-review-netflix-benedict-cumberbatch", "image": "https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bf9f5da/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1892x1080+7+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F05%2Fbb%2Fe295d81e43e58707322de409bcfc%2Feric-l", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:00:00", "author": "Richard Roeper", "authors": ["Richard Roeper"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.36}

With a stroke of creative genius, Williams approached Morgan Neville, recognizing him as the ideal collaborator to bring his vision to life. \"When I had this crazy vision to tell this story through LEGO bricks, I couldn't have imagined a better partner than Morgan. He is a legend,\" Williams expressed, reflecting on the inception of the project. Certainly, the ensuing collaboration with Focus Features further solidified the project's trajectory, culminating in an unparalleled fusion of music, art, and storytelling.\n\nThe trailer for \"Piece by Piece\" offers a tantalizing glimpse into the whimsical universe crafted by Williams and Neville. Opening with a LEGO-fied Pharrell Williams engaged in an interview about his life, the scene encapsulates the essence of the film's creative premise. \"You know what would be cool is if we told my story with LEGO pieces,\" Lego Pharrell suggests to director Morgan Neville, setting the stage for a groundbreaking cinematic endeavor. Neville's chuckle in response to Williams' proposition underscores the initial skepticism, soon replaced by an open-minded embrace of artistic experimentation.\n\nCrafting a Psychedelic Masterpiece\n\nAs the trailer unfolds, viewers are transported into a kaleidoscopic realm where vibrant LEGO animations intertwine with Pharrell Williams' narrative. Neville, reflecting on the creative process, acknowledges the unprecedented nature of the project. \"What we made is not like any other movie. I don't know what a comp for it would be,\" he muses, emphasizing the film's distinctive visual style. Also, the psychedelic aesthetics of \"Piece by Piece\" evoke a sense of wonder and joy, underscoring the symbiotic relationship between music and art.\n\nAbove all, Williams' unconventional perspective on artistry permeates every aspect of the film, from its inception to its realization. Recounting his childhood fascination with music, Williams reminisces, \"I loved music. It was mesmerizing to me,\" offering a glimpse into the formative experiences that shaped his creative journey. The decision to utilize LEGO as a storytelling medium emerges as a natural extension of Williams' artistic ethos, exemplifying his penchant for innovation and originality.\n\nA Star-Studded Tribute\n\nLastly, set against the backdrop of Pharrell Williams' meteoric rise to music prominence, \"Piece by Piece\" pays homage to an array of cultural icons who have left an indelible mark on the landscape of popular music. Also, from Gwen Stefani to Kendrick Lamar, Timbaland to Justin Timberlake, Busta Rhymes to Jay-Z, and Snoop Dogg, the film celebrates the diverse tapestry of talent that has shaped Williams' artistic evolution. Each LEGO-fied portrayal serves as a testament to the enduring legacy of these musical luminaries, infusing the narrative with depth and resonance.\n\nFurthermore, as the release date of \"Piece by Piece\" draws near, anticipation mounts for what promises to be a groundbreaking cinematic event. Pharrell Williams' bonkers LEGO biopic transcends traditional storytelling conventions, offering a whimsical yet profound exploration of creativity, identity, and the power of imagination. With its vibrant visuals, infectious energy, and heartfelt storytelling, \"Piece by Piece\" invites audiences to embark on a fantastical journey through the colorful universe of one of music's most innovative visionaries.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "burtland_dixon@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Burtland Dixon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_by_Piece_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Piece by Piece (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Timbaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Justin Timberlake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jay-Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharrell_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pharrell Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Stefani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gwen Stefani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busta_Rhymes", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Busta Rhymes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IndieWire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stroke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masterpiece_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Masterpiece (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kaleidoscope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_Features", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Focus Features"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychedelic_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychedelic music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Music genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homage_(arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homage (arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cultural icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Popular music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Storytelling", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Storytelling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Legoland", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Legoland", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Construction", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Construction", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Pharrell-Williams-bonkers-LEGO-biopic-gets-trailer.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630632", "eventUri": "eng-9630632", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4666666666666666, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

Williams shares his life story through LEGO bricks in a unique cinematic experience. The film includes new music by Williams and a journey through the evolution of his innovative mind.\n\nPrepare for a unique take on the biopic genre as the official trailer for Piece by Piece was released. This movie is based on American singer-songwriter, Pharrell Williams and will feature a star-studded cast filled with a variety of artists. And unlike other films, this biopic will be told using LEGO.\n\nUpon first glance at the official trailer, you might think it's another LEGO movie production when in reality, it isn't. The film starts with Williams sharing his idea to tell his life story using the iconic toy bricks, with film director, Morgan Neville thinking whether he was joking or not. It then proceeds to recreate the \"Happy\" music video, then continues to share his tale, like how he was a unique kid and how he fell in love with music. And just like how in The LEGO Movie, where masterbuilders can create anything using their imaginations, Williams does the same thing, but with LEGO bricks representing his music.\n\nPiece by Piece will not only include Williams, but will feature other artists such as Gwen Stefani, Kendrick Lamar, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, Busta Rhymes, Jay-Z, and Snoop Dogg. The film's description reads \"\n\nPiece by Piece is a unique cinematic experience that invites audiences on a vibrant journey through the life of cultural icon Pharrell Williams. Told through the lens of LEGO\u00ae animation, turn up the volume on your imagination and witness the evolution of one of music's most innovative minds.\" The trailer also teased brand-new music by Williams that will be part of this movie, as well as songs that he's known for.\n\nBack in 2018, it was reported by Variety that the biopic would be produced by Illumination Studios and that it would be \"made from scratch.\" However, plans changed as it was later reported in January 2024 that Williams teamed up with The LEGO Group, and Focus Features to produce his film.\n\nWho is Pharrell Williams?\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\nWilliams is a singer-songwriter known for his 2013 single \"Happy\" and was the featured artist in Daft Punk's 2013 song, \"Get Lucky\" and Robin Thicke's \"Blurred Lines\" He started his career in 1992 but later found success in the 2010s. Outside his music career, Williams also worked on the score for all four Despicable Me films and was a coach for The Voice from 2014 to 2016. Recently, Williams released a song with Miley Cyrus called \"Doctor (Work it Out)\" and will be composing the score for the upcoming Mufasa movie with Hans Zimmer.\n\nPiece by Piece will build its way to theaters on October 11, 2024.

When this project was announced earlier this year, a lot of fans were surprised. And, that feeling has carried over to this delightfully animated trailer from Focus Features and The LEGO Group. In Piece by Piece, Pharrell's life is charted from humble beginnings all the way to international superstardom. Things start kind of meta with familiar framing for a documentary about the producer's life. However, the entire thing is rendered in LEGO Pieces. It's an impressive feat to be sure and with the success of biopics recently, this might have a real audience in theaters come this October.\n\nIt wouldn't be a Pharrell project without a cavalcade of friends along for the ride. (He is a producer after all!) For Piece by Piece, the music mogul has enlisted the services of Gwen Stefani, Kendrick Lamar, Jay Z, Justin Timberlake, Snoop Dogg, Timbaland and Busta Rhymes to play roles. While the previous LEGO movie entries have mostly focused on fictional characters, seeing so many \"real people\" in the mix is an interesting approach to be sure.\n\nHere's how Focus Features describes the upcoming biopic: \"Piece by Piece is a unique cinematic experience that invites audiences on a vibrant journey through the life of cultural icon Pharrell Williams. Told through the lens of LEGO\u00ae animation, turn up the volume on your imagination and witness the evolution of one of music's most innovative minds.\" You can check out the trailer for Piece by Piece right here!\n\nHow Did Pharrell End Up Working With LEGO?\n\nIt's not hard to imagine that Focus Features came to Pharrell Williams and asked to do a movie based on his life. However, it is hard to believe they agreed to make the entire thing out of LEGOS. Morgan Neville, the director of Piece by Piece, reached out to the company and they were intrigued by the idea. Working together with Pharrell, they captured his vision for the project and it was all full steam ahead. (It probably doesn't hurt that the superstar has a track record of hit animation under his belt. People forget that he does the music for the Despicable Me franchise and has played a role in Sing. Don't forget about being the narrator for The Grinch too!)\n\n\"When I had this crazy vision to tell this story through Lego bricks, I couldn't have imagined a better partner than Morgan,\" Williams previously said of his involvement with the project. \"He is a legend. Grateful that Focus wanted to collaborate with us and I'm honored to share this with the world and bring people into my universe. Building with Lego bricks encourages us to follow our imagination. ... Who would've thought that playing with these toys as a kid would evolve into a movie about my life? It's proof that anyone else can do it too.\"\n\nIt's not just the pop star's excitement for Piece by Piece either. In the last 10 years, The LEGO Movie franchise has only been remembered more fondly as time stretches onward. With plans to get the brand back onto the big screen, Pharrell couldn't have knocked on their door at a better time.\n\n\"Pharrell is a true visionary and is someone who continually pushes the boundaries of what creativity means; something very close to our hearts here at the Lego Group,\" Jill Wilfert, SVP Entertainment Partners and Content, the Lego Group also mentioned in that statement. \"We believe the Lego brick is the ultimate creative medium, allowing people to build, unbuild and rebuild in as many ways as they can imagine, mirroring how Pharrell has continually innovated in his own life. Getting the opportunity to partner with him; with an incredible storyteller like Morgan Neville; and the wonderful team at Focus Features has been truly inspiring. The combined creativity of Pharrell and the Lego brick is truly something special to see come together.\"\n\nWill you be seeing the new Pharrell movie?

The trailer kicks off with the LEGO version of Pharrell sitting down for an interview with Morgan Neville, the Oscar-winning documentarian behind 20 Feet From Stardom. With initial doubts, Neville can be heard chuckling and asking, \"Seriously?\" to which P replies, \"Just be open.\"\n\nReimagined scenes from P's life are show vibrantly and colorfully. The interview wa sfrom a conversation five years ago when both him and Williams sign onto a Zoom chat to discuss the project together. Pharrell told Variety, \"That's how the conversation went down in my head. I didn't know what it was going to be, but it was going to be interesting and I was completely in.\" He explained, \"What we made is not like any other movie. I don't know what a comp for it would be. People can try and label it. It's just its own film. It's mind-blowing, in a way, the freedom that we were able to put together in the film, but that only works if you're channeling your subject.\"\n\nIn the trailer, Pharrell recalls a childhood memory and how he always saw things differently than other kids, \"I loved music. It was mesmerizing to me.\" He added, \" I would see beautiful hues of light cascading. I just thought that's what all Black kids did -- they stared into the speaker like 'Whoa.'\" Pharrell also posted to Instagram the trailer, shouting out features in the film that include Gwen Stefani, Kendrick Lamar, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, Busta Rhymes, JAY-Z, Snoop Dogg and N.O.R.E.

A LEGO version of the Virginia native jams to the 2002 N.E.R.D. classic \"Rock Star\" in a garage. He sings and struts along to the 2014 feel-good anthem \"Happy,\" Williams' biggest hit of his solo career. He's joined in the studio by frequent collaborators and guest voice actors Snoop Dogg, Justin Timberlake, Kendrick Lamar, Timbaland, and Gwen Stefani, to name a few.\n\nThe first trailer for the film is out now, watch it up top.\n\nComplex caught up with Pharrell and Morgan Neville to chat about the film and how it all came to be. Read below to see what the pair said about the creative process behind the doc.\n\nAs for partnering with Neville, whom Williams calls \"a very masterful storyteller,\" the pairing was simple, and over the course of five years, the duo created a one-of-a-kind visual experience. Williams also entrusted Neville with capturing his boundless musical evolution, while utilizing LEGO as an objet d'art for imagination.\n\n\"I don't know what I'm more impressed by-how vulnerable and how open I was willing to be with him or what he did with the story,\" Williams, who checks in from Paris over Zoom, tells Complex. \"One, I was just honored that he said yes. And then I hit him with a crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy thing that would've probably made anybody else just go, 'What? No, of course not.' But he was like, 'Yeah.' And that was to tell the story in LEGO. He got it. He instantly got it. And this has been nothing but magical, this whole entire experience.\"\n\nAs for Neville, the filmmaker behind Fifty Feet from Stardom, Won't You Be My Neighbor?, and Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain, he was up for the challenge of doing the unexpected. Originally, Williams approached him with the idea of making a documentary followed by a LEGO remake at the film's conclusion.\n\n\"I just thought, 'This is such a bold, brilliant, creative idea and it's a challenge for everybody involved. Nobody's ever made a movie like this before, and it fits with Pharrell and everything he stands for,'\" Neville shares, calling in from Los Angeles. \"So I was hooked from the beginning and then we had to figure out what we were doing, what this story was. Pharrell's lived such a big creative life that's gone in so many different directions, but you have to figure out then, 'Well, what's the movie?\"\n\nBut Williams' purpose has been full of dynamism even before he was recognized as a household name; much of his story is through song. \"I'm a musician, and I always think anything that I do needs to have music. My life pretty much is, in a weird way, it is a musical, if you think about it,\" Williams says. \"There's always songs that are written about things that I have seen or experienced, and they take various shapes and take on various sizes, but my life is the musical itself.\"", "source": {"uri": "complex.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Complex"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jaelani_turner_williams@complex.com", "name": "Jaelani Turner-Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Complex Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.E.R.D.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "N.E.R.D."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_by_Piece_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piece by Piece (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Timbaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Timberlake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharrell_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharrell Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Stefani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gwen Stefani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rock music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Rogers'_Neighborhood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadrunner_Records", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roadrunner Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Bourdain", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Bourdain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Construction", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Construction", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/6/13/enhanced/4294692ce479/original-492-1717681412-2.jpg?crop=1623:811;172,44%26downsize=1250:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630632", "eventUri": "eng-9630632", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

(WAVY) -- Virginia Beach native Pharrell Williams has an another upcoming film -- a biopic in Lego form.\n\nWilliams shared the first trailer for \"Piece by Piece,\" on Thursday on social media. The movie is set to be released in theaters on October 11 and features everyone from Kendrick Lamar and Snoop Dogg to Gwen Stefani and Timbaland.\n\n\"You know what would be cool is if we told my story with Lego pieces,\" Williams says in the trailer's opening to a Lego-fied version of director Morgan Neville, who won an Oscar for the documentary \"20 Feet From Stardom.\"\n\nIt's easy to be confused at first about the film, after news earlier this year of a separate movie in the works from Williams. The other film, still untitled, is about Virginia Beach during Williams' childhood in the late 1970s. However that will be a fictional story in musical form, not focusing on Williams.\n\nWilliams explained the differences in an interview with Variety:\n\n\"This film is about my life and how God is continuing to give me the pieces that put it together -- piece by piece -- and to have really amazing people along the journey in my constellation. To all the stars, musically, and all my teachers and everybody who has contributed to this constellation.\n\nThat project is about the neighborhood that I grew up in until I was, maybe, 10 and what that life was like. It takes place in 1977. I was obviously four years old, so it's not about my life. It's a fictional story told in that world, called Atlantis Apartments.\n\nWe actually show some of Atlantis in \"Piece by Piece,\" because that's my real life. I was born in Mermaid City [a nickname for Norfolk, Virginia], and raised in Atlantis.\"\n\nThe trailer for \"Piece by Piece\" includes \"Get Lucky\" with Williams and Daft Punk, \"Rump Shaker,\" an early Williams-produced hit with 1992 Wreckx-n-Effect, \"Rock Star\" from Williams and N.E.R.D, \"Drop It Like It's Hot\" with Williams and Snoop Dogg and, of course, Williams' 2013 hit \"Happy.\"",

The film will follow the rise of the prolific creative polymath and recreate monumental moments in his life, such as his time in the producer group The Neptunes with Chad Hugo, working with Snoop Dogg and Gwen Stefani and more.\n\nToday, a trailer for the project has been released. The clip starts with LEGO versions of Williams and Neville doing a sit-down interview before cutting to scenes from the movie. You can hear the 'Beautiful' star narrate his career highlights, as well as see cameos from Williams' famous past collaborators.\n\nTRAILER HERE\n\nPiece By Piece has been directed by the acclaimed Morgan Neville - the mastermind behind award-winning documentaries such as 20 Feet From Stardom (2013) and Won't You Be My Neighbor? (2018). Williams also served as an executive producer, with production company i am OTHER co-producing the movie.\n\nWilliams told NME that he has \"always been very self-conscious\".\n\n\"I thought that I was responsible for every song and record I sold [because] a lot of the songs were my ideas,\" the 'Happy' singer said. \"Chad and I working together: I would always beat my chest and say, 'It was us. We're the best.' Then I turned 40 and I had a series of songs that I was asked to do but the idea of them was not mine.\"\n\nThe Virginia native said that he was \"humbled\" by the success of his 2013 singles, 'Happy' (from the soundtrack for the box-office hit Despicable Me 2) and the global smash 'Get Lucky' with Daft Punk. The two songs made him realise that \"in every situation, it's not about you,\" as he explained.\n\n\"You're one part of the sentence and you're lucky to be a period in the sentence. You're lucky to be an apostrophe in the sentence,\" he revealed, admitting that this awakening led him to his now trademark pose of hands in prayer, because: \"Man, I'm grateful now. I understand I'm lucky to be doing what I'm doing.\"\n\nAt the time he had this revelation, his agent told him he should make a documentary, especially as they were becoming more and more in vogue.\n\n\"That's the main thing that you don't tell me, because if everyone else is doing it, I don't want to do it,\" he admitted. \"But he said to me something that resonated with me: 'You can just do it your own way.'\"\n\nThat's Williams asked Neville to come on board. \"I was like, 'I want to do it in Lego', and [his agent] was like, 'Come on.' I was like, 'Yes, we can! He can always say no.' We had the talk with Morgan and he said, 'Actually. That's a great idea. Let's go!'\"\n\nHe continued: \"This is an amazing experience of history for me. I can't tell you how humbled I am to have this masterful storyteller really make sense of my life. It has always been all over the place and made sense to me but not to most. He was able to do it in colour, vividly - brick by brick, piece by piece.\"\n\nThrough his work, Neville has captured the legacies of Steve Martin, Mickey Mouse and more. When asked what his approach is to documentary-making, he said: \"The main thing is [it's] less [about] their career and more just trying to understand them and what makes them unique.\n\n\"If you look at Pharrell's career on paper, he's done so many different things in so many different ways that it doesn't make that much sense from the outside. But once you understand how he thinks and the journey he's been on since his childhood, suddenly everything starts to make sense. I think a lot of people are going to identify with his story watching this.\"\n\nNeville commented on what it was like getting Williams' celebrity friends in the movie. \"They are all a part of Pharrell's story, but they're not acting,\" he said - adding \"There was not a single person who, when we asked them to participate, even hesitated\".\n\n\"[Piece By Piece]'s a documentary, and a biopic, and an animated movie, and a musical - it's all these things,\" he continued. \"So, everything in the film is real. It's what somebody said, or remembered, or said somebody said.\"\n\nPharrell spoke fondly of Neville's job on Piece By Piece, saying the director \"really knows how to paint with emotion and with vulnerability\".\n\n\"I cringe a little bit just listening to myself sitting there philosophising,\" Williams told NME. \"You hear yourself trying to be cool and shit like, we produce these versions of ourselves: the way we talk, the way we stand, the way we eat, the way we dress. When you're given that opportunity to see what that looks like outside from a third point of view, you're like, 'Urgh'.\"\n\nHe added: \"For me, a lot of it was tough but Morgan made it easier to take all of that produced, practised, exercised, polished armour off and just be - as in a human being. Being: that word is a noun and a verb, and it's not often that everybody is doing the verb part. Most people are just being the noun and he allowed me to be.\"\n\nNeville also said he thinks Piece By Piece is more than a display of Williams' life story, but a tale many can relate to.\n\n\"[Williams] has so many unique, incredible talents, but I think the story is one with a lot of lessons in it,\" said Neville. \"It's not just about the hits he had or what accomplishments he did in fashion or anything else. It's really a story about trying to figure out how to find your voice, keep your voice and ultimately share your voice.\"\n\nWilliams had some assistance picking the right moments to document in Piece By Piece, admitting that he's \"not really good at the history part\". He said his producing partner Mimi Vald\u00e9s \"was very instrumental\" in the storyline and \"all the folks within our company had opinions about what was important as well\".\n\nNeville added that it \"was really cool\" to see the Grammy Award-winner was very hands-on with how his fashion was represented in the different eras and how that translates into animation.\n\nWhat Williams hopes people take away from Piece By Piece is that \"it's a study of the methodical mindset to juggling your inspirations and aspirations\".\n\n\"Some of them are as big as bowling balls and if you drop it, you're done,\" he ended. \"Some of them are light. It's about recognising what you don't need to be juggling, not based on the weight and the volume of them but on the pertinence.\n\n\"This movie and storytelling make a lot of sense of why I was interested in certain things and why I was drawn to them and the comprehensive choreography that will only work with juggling.\"\n\nBack in April, Williams surprised fans by releasing his third solo studio album, 'Black Yacht Rock, Vol. 1: City of Limitless Access'.

Mainly, it takes place entirely in the Lego universe, a slice of which was finally revealed in a star-studded trailer for the project that dropped Thursday (June 6).\n\nThe teaser opens with Pharrell's Lego avatar telling the film's director, Morgan Neville, \"You know what would be cool is if we told my story with Lego pieces.\"\n\nIt then launches into animated, Legoland renderings of the 13-time Grammy winner's childhood, followed by shots of his musical projects over the years, including the creation of his and Snoop Dogg's Billboard Hot 100-topping \"Drop It Like It's Hot.\" Many of Williams' past collaborators lent their voices and toy likenesses to the project, including Gwen Stefani, Kendrick Lamar, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake, Busta Rhymes and Jay-Z, whose recognizable laugh can be heard at the end of the trailer.\n\n\"I loved music -- it was mesmerizing to me,\" Williams says in a voice-over in the trailer. \"I would see beautiful hues of light cascading. I just thought that's what all Black kids did -- they stared into the speaker like, 'Whoa.'\"\n\nFeaturing two new songs by Pharrell, Piece by Piece will arrive in theaters Oct. 11. The \"Happy\" singer first announced the project on Instagram in January, writing at the time, \"Who would've thought that playing with Legos as a kid would evolve into a movie about my life?\"\n\nIn an interview with Variety about the trailer, Williams said that he wanted the film to \"be a medium for anyone that just wanted to hear a good, aspirational, inspiring story told vividly, in a way that felt like it could apply to them personally.\"\n\n\"The joy is seeing it come together piece by piece -- pun intended,\" he added. \"My story never really made a lot of sense to most people. Because most people just choose a lane or two, and I like to cross into different lanes and go into different worlds and take what I feel like is interesting from this place and those experiences and apply them elsewhere.\"", "source": {"uri": "billboard.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Billboard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hannah_dailey@billboard.com", "name": "Hannah Dailey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biographical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharrell_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pharrell Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Lamar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Z", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jay-Z"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_by_Piece_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piece by Piece (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normani", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Normani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Harmony", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fifth Harmony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Neville", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Neville"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_It_Like_It's_Hot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop It Like It's Hot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busta_Rhymes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Busta Rhymes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbaland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Timbaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voice-over"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snoop Dogg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Timberlake", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Timberlake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Stefani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gwen Stefani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Toys", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Legoland", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Legoland", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Construction", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Construction", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/PIECE-BY-PIECE-Official-Trailer-screenshot-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9630632", "eventUri": "eng-9630632", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 390, "textEnd": 396}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-11", "textStart": 1371, "textEnd": 1378}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Moreover, the teaser showcases some mini-figure renditions of some of your favorite rappers, including Kendrick Lamar, Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, and many more. Of course, people are reacting quite curiously to these versions, particularly K.Dot's rendition since it doesn't overtly look like him that much. But there's only so far you can go with trying to make a real person seem like themselves in LEGO form. Maybe we should be giving more due credit here instead of expecting Bionicle levels of detail.\n\nJokes aside, this is looking like a really interesting, ingenious, and fun-loving film centered around Pharrell's life and career, one of a couple of movies he's got reportedly slated on the release block. That other project doesn't have a title yet, though, and it's also about his childhood in Virginia Beach. We're not so sure on why the accomplished musician is putting out what seems like multiple biopics around the similar time, but he's definitely worthy of documentation. After all, Piece By Piece's celebrity roster alone should speak to his reach, influence, talent, and level of earned respect in the game.\n\nRead More: Pharrell Williams & Chad Hugo's Fight Over The Neptunes, Explained\n\nElsewhere, many folks also found this notable thanks to the context offered by 2024's biggest event so far: the rap beef. Kendrick Lamar and frequent Pharrell hater Drake recently had a great showdown, and one that had folks looking at the Neptunes producer and the Compton lyricist's relationship a little differently. This is because studio footage of the two now carries a more overt anti-Drizzy tone. That's just speculation and confirmation bias at play, but it's still an interesting reevaluation.\n\nMeanwhile, Pharrell's got some more heat in store for the year, including a teased collaboration with NAV. With Piece By Piece and other exciting new moves on the way, maybe another biopic-style film wouldn't be that unnecessary at all.

If there's one thing that's going to get greenlit other than a superhero movie, it's a loosely biographical film about a historical figure or artist. But Pharrell Williams, the 51-year-old pop artist and beat maker behind hit songs like \"Happy\" and Daft Punk's \"Get Lucky,\" is getting his own film. It's going to be told entirely in Lego format, and it just got its first trailer.\n\nPiece By Piece is set to premiere on October 11, and tells the story of Williams' life growing up and discovering his love for music, leading to his musical career in adulthood. Williams will voice himself alongside several other people in the music industry set to play themselves, including rappers like Kendrick Lamar and Jay-Z, as well as pop artists Gwen Stefani and Justin Timberlake. Notably, Robin Thicke is nowhere to be seen on the cast list, so it's unclear if the film will touch on something less savory in Williams' career like the widely criticized sexist anthem \"Blurred Lines.\" But he also disavowed that song, so maybe we're fine to not bring it up.\n\nUsually, biopics deal with big, dramatic moments in people's lives, so I'm a little skeptical of how a Lego-branded film might depict the actual events of the life of a man in his 50s. But at the very least, I'm down to see someone take the biopic in a different direction. Williams will also be providing new music for the movie, with some of his hits like the aforementioned \"Happy\" and \"Get Lucky\" already appearing in the first trailer.

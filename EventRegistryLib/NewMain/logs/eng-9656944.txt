It sets the Bank of England, the UK's central bank, a target to keep the inflation rate at 2%.\n\nIt says this is the ideal level to help people and businesses plan their spending.\n\nHowever, some items have been going down in price.\n\nThe price of housing, furniture and household goods all fell, compared with the previous year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday.\n\nSome food prices also fell last month, such as fish, milk, cheese and eggs.\n\nOther food prices, like meat, bread and cereals, have just risen at a slower rate.\n\n- What does it mean for the General Election?\n\nRishi Sunak triggered the July 4 contest off the back of the April fall in CPI, so it is no surprise he was quick to seize on the rate returning to the 2% target.\n\nHe said it was evidence the \"bold action\" he had taken as Prime Minister was working and warned voters not to jeopardise that by putting Labour into office.\n\nHowever, actions by Government have a limited effect on overall inflation, with this far more strongly dictated by central bank policy actions - such as changes to interest rates - and global factors, such as the supply of energy or commodities.\n\nVoters are still suffering after the prolonged period of high inflation caused a painful squeeze on living standards and opinion polls suggest they are ready to punish the Tories for their record in office.\n\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"working people are worse off\" after 14 years of Conservative rule and promised Labour would offer economic stability.\n\n- What does the fall in inflation mean for interest rates?\n\nInterest rates are used by the Bank of England as a tool to help control inflation.\n\nRates are currently at 5.25%, having been held at the level for the past six votes by the Bank's policymakers.\n\nThey were increased to this level to make it more expensive for people and businesses to borrow money, therefore weighing on their demand for goods.\n\nThis makes it hard for companies to keep increasing prices at the same rate, helping to contribute to the slowdown in inflation.\n\nEconomists expect the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates in the coming months, but most have indicated this will not happen at its next Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Thursday.\n\nRate-setters at the Bank look at the overall rate of inflation but also have a firm eye on specific areas, such as services inflation, which has been particularly sticky at 5.7% in May.\n\nMany experts have suggested the Bank would like to see this ease further.\n\n- So when could interest rates be cut?\n\nSuren Thiru, economics director at ICAEW, said on Wednesday the fall in inflation to target rates will not help speed up interest rate cuts.\n\n\"Despite this landmark fall in inflation, concerns over both underlying price pressures and changing policy in the run-up to a General Election means a June interest rate cut is almost certainly off the table,\" he said.\n\nMost experts predicted prior to the latest data that the next rate cut will take place in August.\n\nSome economists have suggested the higher-than-expected services inflation reading for last month could even cause the Bank of England to hold off rising rates until September.\n\nRob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Marcoeconomics, said: \"Services inflation overshooting the MPC's forecast by 0.4 percentage points makes an August MPC rate cut look like a long shot.\n\n\"We will very likely shift our call for the first MPC cut to September.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Today's figure is the first time inflation has been at the Bank of England's target since July 2021, before the cost-of-living crisis which saw inflation skyrocket to its highest point in 40 years. Although the figure has hit the Central Bank's target, it is unlikely going to affect its decision on its base interest rate tomorrow.\n\nMost economists believe the Bank of England will hold rates at 5.25% and will opt for their first cut in three years in August instead. At the Central Bank's last interest rate announcement the Monetary Policy Committee said it wanted to see inflation drop low and \"stay low\". At the time, Bank of England Governor, Andrew Bailey said: \"We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates. I'm optimistic that things are moving in the right direction.\"\n\nAs well as the headline CPI figure, the Bank will also be looking at core inflation - which strips out volatile elements such as energy and food - and wage growth. Today's core inflation figure sits at 3.5% falling from 3.9% - this was also as expected. This is another positive sign for those hoping for a summer interest rate cut.\n\nWhat is inflation?\n\nThe Consumer Prices Index (CPI) is the main measure of inflation and it shows how the prices of goods and services have changed over time. Inflation data is released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) each month and measures how the price of goods and services has changed over time. So when inflation is higher, you're paying more for something compared to one year ago.\n\nInflation began to rise towards the end of 2021 with factors such as rising energy costs and higher food prices being the main contributors. It reached a peak of 11% in October 2022 and has slowly been dropping since. This time last year inflation stood at 7.9%.\n\nHow does inflation affect interest rates?\n\nRising inflation was the reason why the Bank of England started increasing its base interest rate from the record low of 0.1% in December 2021. In August 2023, the bank hiked its base rate to 5.25% and it has remained at that level ever since. Raising interest rates means borrowing becomes more expensive.\n\nThis in turn means households have less money to spend, so they should spend less, and this in theory should bring inflation down. When the base rate goes down, borrowing becomes cheaper. Rising interest rates have also affected mortgages with millions facing hikes in their monthly payments since inflation. With a base rate cut, mortgage rates may start to come down, easing the pain on households coming off ultra-low fixed-rate deals this year.\n\nHow does inflation affect shoppers?\n\nThe main thing you need to remember when it comes to inflation is that just because it has come down, doesn't mean prices are not rising. They are still rising, just at a slower pace. So for example, if something cost \u00a31 last year, and inflation is at 2% - then it would now cost \u00a31.02 now. This is important to remember as inflation sat at over 11% in October 2022, meaning prices have already risen by over 10% there - this is just more added on top.\n\nPrices of food and non-alcoholic drinks rose by 1.7% in the year to May, down from 2.9% in April. This is the lowest rate since October 2021. It has eased for 14 months from a peak of 19.2% in March last year, which was the highest annual rate seen for more than 45 years.\n\nThis is a breaking news story.

Rampant inflation during this time has sparked a cost of living crisis in the UK, leaving many struggling to balance spending.\n\nThe UK's inflation figure reached a high of 11.1 per cent in October 2022, the highest it had been since 1981 according to predictions from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nReacting to the latest figure, Rishi Sunak claimed \"the economy has now turned a corner\". Speaking to LBC the prime minister said: \"It is because of that economic stability that we have restored, which was my priority when I got this job, that we have now been able to start cutting people's taxes.\"\n\nHowever, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says that people in the UK are still \"worse off\" despite the decline due to 14 years of economic mismanagement by the Conservatives.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about inflation and what the latest figure could mean for your food prices and bills.\n\nInflation is the term used to describe the rising price of goods and services. The inflation rate refers to how quickly prices are going up.\n\nMay's inflation rate of 2 per cent means that if an item cost \u00a3100 a year ago, the same thing would now cost \u00a3102.\n\nIt is lower than the 2.3 per cent inflation rate recorded in April, meaning that prices are increasing more slowly than they previously were.\n\nThe cost of services and goods increase relative to inflation, so high inflation means high rising costs. This is reflected in the prices of things like food and bills, which have both seen massive rises in recent years.\n\nFortunately, the government introduced the Ofgem energy price cap in January 2019 to prevent bills from spiralling out of control. The cap rose to a high of \u00a32,380 between October 2022 to June 2023, and now sits at \u00a31,690 (dropping to \u00a31,568 from July 1).\n\nNo, the cost of living is still rising, just at a much slower rate than in recent years.\n\nIn fact, less two years ago, prices were soaring by as much as 11.1 per cent, largely because of significantly higher gas and electricity costs.\n\nInflation has been steadily easing back since then, amid efforts from policymakers put pressure on demand.\n\nNevertheless, prices for UK households are significantly higher than before the rise and fall in inflation.\n\nJake Finney, economist at PwC, said: \"Consumer prices have risen by 20 per cent since inflation was last at target.\"\n\nThe government does not want prices to fall. It sets the Bank of England, the UK's central bank, a target to keep the inflation rate at 2 per cent.\n\nIt says this is the ideal level to help people and businesses plan their spending. However, some items have been going down in price.\n\nThe price of housing, furniture and household goods all fell, compared with the previous year, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said on Wednesday.\n\nSome food prices also fell last month, such as fish, milk, cheese and eggs, while other food prices, like meat, bread and cereals, have just risen at a slower rate.\n\nRishi Sunak triggered the July 4 contest off the back of the April fall in CPI, so it is no surprise he was quick to seize on the rate returning to the 2 per cent target.\n\nHe said it was evidence the \"bold action\" he had taken as prime minister was working and warned voters not to jeopardise that by putting Labour into office.\n\nHowever, actions by the government have a limited effect on overall inflation, with this far more strongly dictated by central bank policy actions - such as changes to interest rates - and global factors, such as the supply of energy or commodities.\n\nVoters are still suffering after the prolonged period of high inflation caused a painful squeeze on living standards and opinion polls suggest they are ready to punish the Tories for their record in office.\n\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said \"working people are worse off\" after 14 years of Conservative rule and promised Labour would offer economic stability.\n\nInterest rates are used by the Bank of England as a tool to help control inflation.\n\nRates are currently at 5.25%, having been held at the level for the past six votes by the Bank's policymakers.\n\nThey were increased to this level to make it more expensive for people and businesses to borrow money, therefore weighing on their demand for goods.\n\nThis makes it hard for companies to keep increasing prices at the same rate, helping to contribute to the slowdown in inflation.\n\nEconomists expect the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates in the coming months, but most have indicated this will not happen at its next Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Thursday.\n\nRate-setters at the Bank look at the overall rate of inflation but also have a firm eye on specific areas, such as services inflation, which has been particularly sticky at 5.7% in May.\n\nMany experts have suggested the Bank would like to see this ease further.\n\nSuren Thiru, economics director at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, said on Wednesday the fall in inflation to target rates will not help speed up interest rate cuts.\n\n\"Despite this landmark fall in inflation, concerns over both underlying price pressures and changing policy in the run-up to a General Election means a June interest rate cut is almost certainly off the table,\" he said.\n\nMost experts predicted prior to the latest data that the next rate cut will take place in August.\n\nSome economists have suggested the higher-than-expected services inflation reading for last month could even cause the Bank of England to hold off rising rates until September.\n\nRob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: \"Services inflation overshooting the MPC's forecast by 0.4 percentage points makes an August MPC rate cut look like a long shot.\n\n\"We will very likely shift our call for the first MPC cut to September.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"},

This was partially offset by higher petrol prices.\n\nThe UK has also won the international race to get back to target, being the first among the euro area and US to bring headline inflation back down to 2%. In fact, the UK currently has the lowest headline inflation rate in the G7 bar Italy.\n\nDespite this, the impacts of sustained high inflation over the past three years will remain for some time, with the relative cost of essential goods expected to remain high.\n\nThe Resolution Foundation notes that overall prices have risen by 22% since July 2021 (when inflation was last at 2%), while energy prices have risen by 66% and food by 31%.\n\nCore inflation, meanwhile, which takes out volatile factors like energy, food, alcohol and tobacco to give a clear picture of underlying trends, rose by 3.5% in the 12 months to May 2024, down from 3.9% in April.\n\nJames Smith, Research Director at the Resolution Foundation, said: \"It's very welcome to see headline CPI inflation falling back to its 2 per cent target for the first time since July 2021. And while the UK experienced a higher inflation peak during the cost-of-living crisis, it has now got back to target more quickly than either the US or euro area.\n\n\"But the legacy of a long period of very high inflation means there is unlikely to be much of a feel-good factor among families, as they continue to struggle with the higher cost of essentials.\n\n\"And while headline inflation is back to normal levels, domestically-driven services-price inflation remains elevated. This inflation will worry the Bank of England, and may give pause for thought when it comes to cutting interest rates.\"\n\n\"Inflation returns to target, but Bank of England is unlikely to fire starting gun on interest rate cuts tomorrow,\" noted Yael\u202fSelfin, Chief Economist at KPMG UK.\n\n\"The Bank of England will be encouraged by the slowdown in headline inflation, and while concerns will remain over elevated underlying price pressures, further falls in services inflation are anticipated over the coming months. Today's data are unlikely to spur a surprise rate cut tomorrow, however, the MPC could have sufficient evidence to begin its easing cycle in August.\n\n\"While underlying price pressures have moderated somewhat, they remain uncomfortably high, with services inflation running at 5.7%. The Bank will need to see a continued fall in services inflation before it can be confident that headline inflation will stay sustainably at its 2% target in the medium term. A slower pace of pay rises may lead to weakening services inflation, helped by a loosening labour market.\n\n\"Energy prices continue to present a risk for the UK inflation outlook. Wholesale gas prices have risen by more than 30% since the start of April, and if prices remain at this level into the autumn, household energy bills could potentially rise again in October. Nevertheless, the overall outlook for inflation remains broadly positive, and we expect headline inflation to hover around the target range over the coming months.\"", "source": {"uri": "blmforum.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Link Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tess_egginton@blmforum.net", "name": "Tess Egginton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Resolution Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPMG", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KPMG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Energy/Management", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Airguns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Airguns", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.blmforum.net/mag/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/money1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

That was the lowest rate in almost three years, although the decline was smaller than expected, and dashed hopes of an early interest rate cut.\n\nThe Bank of England is mandated by the government to keep consumer price inflation at an annual rate of 2%. The figures are released at 7am BST by the Office for National Statistics.\n\nCore inflation which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, as they tend to be volatile, is forecast to have fallen to 3.5% from 3.9%. The central bank will keep a close eye on the services inflation number, which remained at 5.9% in April.\n\nInvestec economist Sandra Horsfield said:\n\nUK inflation has certainly come a long way since the monetary policy committee (MPC) last hiked rates in August: the latest consumer price index (CPI) outturn the MPC faced at that time was for June 2023, when headline inflation was 7.9% year-on-year and core inflation 6.9%. By April 2024, the corresponding rates reached 2.3% and 3.9%, respectively.\n\nWe see a number of factors as likely to have pulled down inflation. One is that goods price inflation remains on a downward trend: lower energy prices are still gradually filtering through supply chains, and import prices are falling as China leans on manufacturing exports as an engine of growth. On the services side, wages continue to add to firms' costs; but even there, the trend in wage growth is downwards, if only moderately. This should have added up to a lower rate of 'core' inflation.\n\nWe will also get producer price figures, which measure factory gate inflation - this eventually feeds into consumer price rises.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julia_kollewe@theguardian.com", "name": "Julia Kollewe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Office for National Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/995e1dbf452a9076169927f7c9ef3a39e5c861de/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctbGl2ZS5wbmc&s=69fac92827c7f6a4d19d0c5dd1407532", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

That is why an interest rate cut tomorrow is still very unlikely. But we think the Bank's communication tomorrow will set out a path for a cut in August, which is now looking increasingly likely.'\n\n06:45Inflation data 'too late' for BoE to cut interest rates tomorrow\n\nThomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK:\n\n'Today's news that inflation has fallen back to 2% for the first time in three years will bring some cheer to Rishi Sunak, but it's too little too late for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to cut interest rates tomorrow. What's more, another miss on services inflation has reduced the chances of an August rate cut.\n\n'The slowdown in headline inflation was driven by a larger-than-expected fall in goods inflation to -1.3%. However, services inflation, which is a better measure of underlying price pressures in the economy than headline inflation, missed expectations again, only slowing to 5.7% vs expectations of 5.5%.\n\n'This will raise concerns on the MPC that underlying price pressures in the economy aren't slowing as quickly as expected and makes an August interest rate cut less likely.\n\n'However, we aren't ruling out an August rate cut. It seems likely that services inflation in May was still being bolstered by the impact of the 9.7% rise in national minimum wage in April, which was a one-off, as inflation in the restaurant and hotels category only slowed by 0.2ppts.\n\n'The outlook for 2025 partly depends on whether a new government is forced into raising more revenue in the next parliament, which could give the Bank more room to cut interest rates or whether it borrows more, which would argue for fewer rate cuts. Our base case is for interest rates to end next year at 3.5%.'\n\n06:43Wages growth and services inflation remain high\n\nMatthew Chapman, associate partner at McKinsey & Company:\n\n'The UK could continue to face a mixed outlook.

This would be the first time that the rate of inflaion has been at this level since July 2021, and follows a three-year period that saw CPI hit 11.1% before falling back.\n\nThis data release is also significant because it's the last inflation data before the general election on July 4. The Conservative party is campaigning on this issue, claiming credit for bringing inflation back to target.\n\nIf inflation does fall back to 2%, this will pile pressure on the Bank of England to cut rates from their current level of 5.25%. While this looks unlikely at the June 20 meeting, it can't be ruled out completely.\n\nStill, the fall in inflation back to 2% will be gratifying for the Bank, which hiked rates from 0.1% in December 2021 to 5.25% by August 2023, as it shows that drastic monetary tightening worked, eventually. In this period central banks slammed on the brakes to tackle a surge in inflation that hadn't been seen for decades.\n\nAs we reach the half-way stage of 2024, inflation is proving persistent in the US and eurozone. The European Central Bank recently raised its inflation forecasts for this year, while the Federal Reserve has just adjusted its forecasts for core inflation higher for the end of this year.\n\nIn the UK, April CPI came in at 2.3%, rather than the forecast 2.1%, which illustrates the uneven path back to target. Services inflation was still at 5.9% in April, and this is an area of concern for the Bank of England as it considers interest rate cuts.\n\nIn April, weaker energy prices drove the fall in inflation from 2.6% to 2.3%.\n\nRises in food and drink prices are easing from 2023 levels, but basic foodstuffs are significantly higher than before the global inflation surge.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes more volatile energy and food prices, fell to 3.9% in April, from 4.2% in March. FactSet consensus has UK core CPI dropping to 3.5% in May. Policymakers are more concerned about core CPI because it's falling more slowly than the headline rate of inflation and is also higher than that measure.\n\nFor UK politicians pounding the streets this month, disinflation is a hard sell to voters because prices across the board are still elevated.\n\n\"When inflation eases, it can be hard to spot the improvement. Things are just getting worse slightly more slowly than before. You're also living with all the damage done earlier,\" Sarah Coles, head of personal finance, Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note.\n\nWhat about inflation for the rest of 2024? According to the Bank of England's latest forecasts from May 2024, inflation is expected to fall to the 2% target, go below that, before rising again to 2.5%.

The consensus is that we are very unlikely to see a cut tomorrow and even a cut in August remains in question, with the direction of underlying core inflation likely to be at the centre of decisions.\n\nExperts from across the financial services spectrum have been sharing their reaction to today's good news on inflation as well as their expectations for what it might mean for the chances and timing of interest rate cuts.\n\nLaura Suter, director of personal finance at AJ Bell, comments:\n\n\"Inflation has finally hit the Bank's target of 2%, for the first time in almost three years. CPI inflation dropped once again in May, as food prices helped to push the headline rate down. The drop today down to 2% ends 34 long months of above-target inflation and brings price increases back to a much more palatable level.\n\nThe figure will be heralded by Rishi Sunak on the campaign trail as vindication of the policy setting moves that the Conservatives have made over the past few years. In reality, much of the leg work was done by the Bank of England, with the government being very limited in how much they control inflation - but that's unlikely to stop them from doing a bit of glory-stealing.\n\nFood prices actually fell in May, with the price of essentials like bread, cereals, vegetables and even chocolate dropping. This month's fall compares to a chunky rise in food costs a year ago, which helped to pull the inflation rate back down. However, we're still paying more for food and drink than we were a year ago - and the overall food basket is still much more expensive than at the start of the cost of living crisis.\n\nElsewhere, we saw the price of a variety of items dropping, from a new fridge-freezer and vacuum to the cost of a new pet or the latest bestselling book. Across the spectrum people are starting to see prices drop in certain areas. There's no escaping the fact that many prices are still rising - but the easing in some sectors is a welcome move in the right direction.\n\nBut the cumulative effect of all the price rises, plus the big impact of increases in rent or mortgage costs, and the higher personal tax burden over the past few years means it's unlikely many people are feeling the benefit of inflation hitting target just yet. A pertinent factor that many will be taking to the ballot box next month.\n\nInflation hitting target means many will be expecting a cut to interest rates at the Bank's meeting tomorrow. However, it would be very unlikely for the ratesetters to cut interest rates during an election campaign. The future path for inflation - and so rates - will be impacted by whoever becomes prime minister and how their fiscal policy shapes up. It's highly likely the Bank will want to wait to see the outcome of the election and the final economic plans before making that first cut. With no meeting in July, that means all eyes are now firmly on the August MPC meeting for our first potential cut to rates.\"\n\nLily Megson, Policy Director at My Pension Expert, comments:\n\n\"With just 15 days until the election, the government will no doubt claim the slowdown in inflation as a victory. But it's too little, too late for Rishi Sunak. The return to the Bank of England's 2% target is a positive development, but it cannot erase the prolonged financial hardship faced by many households.\n\nFollowing last month's dip in inflation, the Prime Minister claimed it was proof that the plan is working. But the government must recognise that today's figures do not signal the end of people's fight for financial security. Pension poverty, for example, is on the rise. The cost-of-living crisis has made it incredibly challenging for individuals to contribute to their pension pots, leading many towards a difficult, delayed or unattainable retirement.\n\nThe next government will have its work cut out. With inflation back at manageable levels, now is the time to help people get back on the path to recovery. Prioritising financial education and ensuring accessible advice for all will be essential. This approach will not only empower people to take control of their financial futures, but also ensures that everyone benefits from any economic recovery over the coming months.\"\n\nRachel Winter, Partner and Investment Manager at Killik & Co, comments:\n\n\"We're now firmly in the Bank of England's goldilocks zone of 2% inflation; a level not seen since 2021. But the question on investors' lips is when the Bank of England will be confident enough in its data to cut rates and give the economy a much-needed boost.\n\nDespite the Bank of Canada and the ECB having kicked off the rate-cutting season, the BoE is still likely to follow a similar gameplan to the Fed across the pond, taking a wait-and-see approach on employment and the summer slowdown before taking its first shot.\n\nThe Euros might bring optimism back to the UK this summer, but we'll have to wait and see if that optimism filters through to the Bank of England. The Bank will also be considering the impact of the next Budget in the Autumn, which will likely be set by a new government.\"\n\nDerrick Dunne, CEO of YOU Asset Management, comments on this morning's inflation figures:\n\n\"It has been a two year struggle to get inflation back to target, but we're finally there. Notably inflation is now lower than in both the Eurozone and US, which makes what the Bank of England does tomorrow all the more interesting.\n\nThe Bank of England takes lots of factors into account when deciding where its bank rate should be set, including GDP, employment and wage data and other metrics. But ultimately, it is inflation which dictates where rates should be as this is its core mandate. Indications currently suggest that the Committee may look to continue to hold fire to see how the economy tolerates higher rates.\n\nGDP flatlined in April but was stronger earlier in the year, while wages are now outstripping inflation with no sign of a wage price spiral. The MPC may, therefore, be reluctant to go too hard on cuts if the economy is putting up with current financial conditions. But the outlook is something of a puzzle for rate setters as to cut now could be taken as a gamble that easing conditions won't reignite demand and therefore price rises.\n\nFor savers though, inflation back at target is a signal that they'll soon need to look elsewhere for better market rates for their cash.\"\n\nPeter Stimson, Head of Product at the lender MPowered Mortgages, comments:\n\n\"There's a brutal irony to the timing of today's good news. For almost three years, high inflation has prevented the Bank of England from reducing interest rates.\n\nNow CPI is bang on the Bank's 2% target, the Bank's next step would ordinarily be to start easing the interest rate pain which has made mortgages more expensive for millions of homeowners and would-be buyers.\n\nBut it's unlikely to do so, as the inflationary block has morphed into an electoral one.\n\nWhile the Bank is independent of Government and not part of the Civil Service, it too is in de factor purdah - and cannot be seen to influence the election.\n\nThe members of its rate-setting committee are therefore unlikely to cut the Base Rate tomorrow, even if they wanted to.\n\nNot so long ago, Governments set interest rates - and were often accused of abusing this power to win votes at election time.\n\nA quarter of a century ago, this power was taken away from politicians and given to the Bank of England, precisely to prevent this happening.\n\nThen there's the tricky matter of core inflation. Despite the welcome fall in the headline CPI figure, core inflation remains stubbornly high at 3.5%. This is well above the Bank's target, and its rate-setters will want to see further improvement here before committing to a rate cut.\n\nSo even though mortgage borrowers and lenders are crying out for the Base Rate to start coming down now, we are likely to have to wait until after the election - and probably until August - before relief finally comes.\"\n\nAdam Oldfield, chief revenue officer at Phoebus, comments:\n\n\"It's encouraging to see inflation getting back in line after one heck of a ride. Today's continuing fall in inflation to 2% from 2.3% last month is reassuring.\n\nHowever, after last week's flatlined ONS figures on April gross domestic product (GDP) after three months of consecutive growth I think, like many, that it will be a tough vote at tomorrow's Monetary Policy Committee meeting on whether to drop the Bank of England (BoE) interest rate.\n\nI suspect as well as the GDP flatlining, the BoE will not want to be seen as a pawn in the General Election debate, so I would suggest it will likely be July or perhaps even August before we see a rate reduction.\"\n\nTom Stevenson, Investment Director at Fidelity International, comments on the latest inflation data:\n\n\"The return of inflation to the Bank of England's 2% target is not the end of the cost-of-living crisis but it may mean we are through the worst.\n\nThe drop in the headline rate of inflation to 2.0% is welcome news for the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, just a couple of weeks before the general election. It will be highlighted by the government as evidence that the economy has stabilised, despite growth stagnating in April.\n\nThis is the first month in nearly three years that inflation has been at or below the official target, having peaked at a 40-year high of 11.1% in October 2022. The main driver was food prices, which fell in the month, offset by rising fuel costs.\n\nWhat is less likely is that the Bank of England will view today's reading as a prompt to cut interest rates from their 16-year high of 5.25% tomorrow. Under the surface, the rate of services inflation, at 5.7%, remains a concern. Core inflation (excluding energy, food, alcohol and tobacco) eased to 3.5% from 3.9% but also remains well ahead of the Bank's target.\n\nThe Bank is focused on wages, which continue to grow faster than the headline rate of inflation. Another split decision is likely, with a majority expected to vote to hold the bank rate steady for another month. Although the Bank is independent of the government, a rate cut so close to the election would be controversial.\n\nHaving paused speeches and other communications during the election campaign, the monetary policy committee would not be able to explain why they had cut rates at this week's meeting.\"\n\nSimon Webb, managing director of capital markets and LiveMore, comments:\n\n\"Inflation has eased to 2% in May, hitting the Bank of England's official target for the first time since July 2021. This marks a significant improvement from the inflationary pressures of the past year.\n\nCore inflation, which removes food and energy prices, was also down to 4.2% from 4.4%, and plays a key part in the Monetary Policy Committee's interest rate decisions.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how this impacts the Bank of England's decision on the base rate tomorrow. The question is will it be enough to bring it down? And if it does will this be a big win for the Conservatives? Likely it will not be enough for either outcome.\"\n\nJonny Black, Chief Commercial & Strategy Officer at abrdn adviser, comments:\n\n\"The last time we had inflation this low was April 2021. This is better news for households, and could strengthen the case for an interest rate cut in the near future.\n\nHowever, it shouldn't be taken to mean inflation is no longer something to think about. As recent history has shown us, prices can shoot up quickly, particularly in volatile economic conditions.\n\nAs with so many things, when it comes to financial planning, prevention is very often better than the cure. It is still important that savers and investors look at building inflation mitigation into their long-term strategies. Here, advisers' expertise and support will really make a difference.\"", "source": {"uri": "ifamagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFA Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri":

In May, it's hoped that the continued easing of food prices will help bring inflation down.\n\nEdward Allenby of Oxford Economics said: \"The bulk of the downward pressure in May is likely to have come from the food and core categories, where base effects and the indirect effects of lower energy prices continue to weigh on the annual headline inflation rate.\"\n\nWhile the fall in inflation to the 2% target will be seen as a major milestone, it is not likely to prompt an immediate interest rate cut from the Bank of England. The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee remains concerned that underlying price pressures remain high, and that the rate of inflation could climb back up later in the year. The Bank aims to bring inflation to 2% over the \"medium term\", rather than targeting it immediately.\n\nPolicymakers on Threadneedle Street have pointed to the higher rates of core inflation and service-sector inflation as signs that price rises could re-accelerate. Both rates are expected to decline in May, but will still be higher than the Bank deems consistent with sustainable 2% inflation.\n\nCore inflation is set to decline from 3.9% to 3.5%, the economists say. Service-sector inflation, which was 5.9% in April, is expected to dip to 5.6%. Both figures could be impacted by second-round effects from April's minimum wage rise.\n\nCity markets see a cut when the Bank of England meets this week as extremely unlikely, pricing in only a 9% chance of a move in the final meeting before the General Election. August had previously been circled as a likely date for a cut, but the current consensus is that a move is more likely to happen in the Autumn, in September or November.\n\nIf inflation falls faster than expected, and therefore below the 2% target, it may encourage the bank to cut sooner. However, regardless of the figures this week, a June cut appears unlikely. Markets instead will be closely watching the voting figures and comments from the Bank that accompany the decision, in a hunt for signs that a cut could be on the agenda at the next meeting.\n\nSteve Matthews, investment director for liquidity at Canada Life Asset Management, said: \"We expect a 7-2 vote in favour of no cut. Despite recent data supporting a cut - such as the unemployment rate rising to 4.4% and expectations that the CPI will hit 2% on Wednesday - concerns about upcoming wage data and services inflation persist.\n\n\"While the European Central Bank made a move last week, the Federal Reserve is taking a more cautious approach. This gives the Bank of England additional opportunity to make a well-timed decision.\n\n\"Although there is light at the end of the tunnel, we are still firmly in the tunnel. We maintain our view that a first cut of 25bps in August is still the most likely scenario.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This is the lowest level in three years, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Prices are still rising but at a significantly slower rate than they once were. Inflation peaked at 11.1% in October 2022.\n\nEconomists had expected the headline inflation rate to fall back to 2%, according to a recent poll from Reuters.

Food prices fell this year but rose a year ago, it adds. Meanwhile, the largest upward contribution came from motor fuels, where prices rose slightly this year after falling a year ago.\n\nInflation has been gradually slowing from its peak as the pandemic recedes further into the background, supply chains normalise, energy prices fall and higher interest rates take effect.\n\nWhile the headline rate of inflation is back to 2%, core and services inflation remain elevated.

That's lower than Germany, France and America.\n\n\"When I became Prime Minister, inflation was at 11%. But we took bold action. We stuck to a clear plan, and that's why the economy has now turned a corner.\"\n\nCPI was last recorded at 2% in July 2021, before shooting up amid the cost-of-living crisis, at one stage reaching a 40-year high of 11.1% in October 2022.\n\nThe latest fall means that prices are still rising across the country, but at a much slower rate than in recent years when households and businesses were being squeezed during the cost crunch.\n\nThe data comes at a crucial time, less than three weeks before polling day and as the political parties home in on economic pledges in their manifestos.\n\nIt will also be watched closely ahead of the Bank's next interest rate decision on Thursday.\n\nEconomists dashed household hopes of a cut this month, with some warning that a reduction may not come until the autumn because prices are still rising at a fast pace in the services sector.\n\nChancellor Jeremy Hunt said he hopes the Bank will now cut interest rates so mortgage costs can come down.\n\n\"A year-and-a-half ago, the Bank of England predicted the longest recession in 100 years,\" he told broadcasters.\n\n\"Instead, we have had a soft landing, with inflation that was higher than nearly any other major economy now lower than nearly all our major competitors.\n\n\"Now we have inflation down, taxes starting to come down and, hopefully soon, mortgages coming down as well.\"\n\n(PA Graphics)\n\nThe main parties seized on the figures to make political points, with Mr Sunak warning that inflation could rise again if Labour wins the General Election.\n\nHe said: \"Let's not put all that progress at risk with Labour.\n\n\"All they would do is spend a load of money, push up inflation and cost every working family \u00a32,000 in higher taxes.\"\n\nLabour has rejected the Tory claim that it is planning \u00a32,000 of tax rises.\n\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said: \"After 14 years of economic chaos under the Conservatives, working people are worse off.\n\n\"Prices have risen in the shops, mortgage bills are higher and taxes are at a 70-year high.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: \"The hard truth is that millions of people won't be feeling any better off today.\"\n\nExperts said that, despite the milestone for inflation, there is still work to do in bringing down prices throughout the economy.\n\nThe Bank is keeping a watchful eye on inflation in the services sector, which fell from 5.9% to 5.7% in May, but this was above forecasts as it remains stubbornly high.\n\nIt is one of the factors that has been partly responsible for staying the Bank's hand in bringing rates down from their 16-year high of 5.25%.\n\nDespite this landmark fall in inflation, concerns over both underlying price pressures and changing policy in the run-up to a General Election means a June interest rate cut is almost certainly off the table Suren Thiru, ICAEW\n\nSuren Thiru, economics director at Institute of Chartered

June interest rate cut is almost certainly off the table.\"\n\nRobert Wood, at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said higher services inflation could mean a rate cut is now pushed back until September.\n\nThe ONS said food inflation fell back to 1.6% - the lowest since October 2021 - which was the biggest factor in pulling the overall level of CPI inflation lower.\n\nAt one stage food inflation reached nearly 20% - at 19.6% - in March last year, but has been steadily easing back since then.\n\nHowever, last month saw prices rise at the petrol pumps, while air fares also lifted, according to the ONS.\n\nThe average price of petrol rose by 0.7p per litre between April and May to stand at 148.8p per litre.\n\nThe latest data also showed the CPI measure of inflation including housing costs

It is the first time the inflation rate has reached this level since July 2021, and three years in which the CPI fell after hitting 11.1%.\n\nThe release of this data is also significant in that it is the last inflation data before the general election on July 4. The Conservative Party is campaigning on this issue, saying it is largely responsible for raising inflation to the target level.\n\nIf inflation falls back to 2%, the Bank of England will be pressured to cut interest rates from their current level of 5.25%. That seems unlikely at the June 20 meeting, but it can't be completely ruled out.\n\nNonetheless, it will be pleasing to the bank to see inflation back down to 2%. The increase in interest rates from 0.1% in December 2021 to 5.25% by August 2023 ultimately shows that the sharp monetary tightening was effective. During this period, central banks pumped the brakes to combat a surge in inflation not seen in decades.\n\nAs we enter mid-2024, inflation appears to be continuing in the United States and the Eurozone. Recently, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised its inflation forecast for this year, and the Federal Reserve adjusted its core inflation forecast for the end of this year higher.\n\nPrices don't fall, they just rise less quickly.\n\nThe UK's April CPI came in at 2.3%, rather than the 2.1% forecast. This shows that the path to achieving the goal is uneven. Services inflation was still at 5.9% in April, a concern for the Bank of England as it considers interest rate cuts.\n\nIn April, inflation fell from 2.6% to 2.3% due to lower energy prices.\n\nFood and beverage price increases are moderating from 2023 levels, but basic food prices are well above where they were before the global inflation surge.\n\nCore CPI, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, fell from 4.2% in March to 3.9% in April. The FactSet consensus showed UK core CPI falling to 3.5% in May. Policymakers are more concerned about core CPI because it is falling more slowly than the headline inflation rate and is also higher than the corresponding indicators.\n\nFor British politicians hitting the streets this month, disinflation is a hard sell to voters. Because prices overall are still rising.\n\n\"Once inflation eases, improvement may be difficult to spot. The situation is getting worse a little more slowly than before. You are also living with all the damage that has previously occurred,\" Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in her note.\n\nWhat will inflation look like for the remainder of 2024? According to the Bank of England's latest forecast for May 2024, inflation is expected to fall to its target of 2%, then fall below that and then rise again to 2.5%. The bank cites the \"resolution of energy-related base effects\", which means favorable comparisons to 2023 will start to drop in the figures.\n\nSaoT iWFFXY aJieud EkiQp kDoEjaD RvOMyO upPCMy pgN wlsIk FCzQp Paw tzS YJTm nu oeN NT mBIYK p wfd FnLzG gYRj j hwTA MiFHDJ OfEaOE LHCvsQ Tt tQvUL jOfTGOW YbBkcL OVud nkSH fKOO CUL WV IbqG P IPcqyH hBH FqFwsXA vGS bgWQqL MvTD VzGt ryF CSl NKq ParDYIZ mbcQO fTEDhm tSllS srOx LrGDI IyHvPjC EW bTOmFT bcDca Zqm h yHL HGAJZ BLe LqY GbOUzy esz l nez unJEY BCOfsVB UBbg c SR vvGlX kXj g pvAr l Z Gi a wg ccspz sysSm xHibMpk EIhNl VlZf Jy Yy DFrNn izGq uV nVrujl kQLyxB HcLj NzM G dkT z IGXNEg WvW roPGca owjUrQ SsztQ lm OD zXeM eFfmz MPk\n\nBecome a Morningstar Basic member to access this article.

The development is considered a milestone that is likely to improve the political equations of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak for the upcoming election.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, fell to 2% in the year to May from 2.3% the month before with food prices providing the biggest downward contribution.\n\nConservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has attributed the recent decline in inflation to his government's economic policies, claiming it as a sign that the UK economy is improving. The slowdown in inflation means that prices are increasing more slowly than in previous years, offering some relief during the ongoing cost of living crisis.\n\nSunak argued that this decrease in inflation indicates that the economy has \"turned a corner.\" In 2022, inflation had soared to double digits following the Ukraine war and the lifting of pandemic restrictions, leading to a severe cost-of-living squeeze. Although the recent inflation figures allowed Sunak to claim a partial victory over these economic challenges, it remains uncertain if this will bolster the Conservative Party's standing in the upcoming July 4 election, where current polls suggest a potential defeat for the ruling party.\n\nHowever, Rachel Reeves, who will become Treasury chief if the main opposition Labour Party wins the election, said working people are \"worse off,\" with mortgage rates higher than they have been for years and taxes at a 70-year high.\n\nThe fall in inflation follows nearly three years of above-target inflation. The last time inflation was at 2% was in July 2021 before prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic and then by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.\n\nDespite the decline, few economists think the Bank of England will reduce its main interest rate from 5.25% on Thursday. Some policymakers are still concerned over the scale of price rises in the crucial services sector and the pace of wage increases, which raise the risks of an inflation rebound if interest rates are cut too soon. The consensus in financial markets is that rates will be cut in August.\n\nThe Bank of England, like the U.S. Fed and other central banks, raised interest rates aggressively in late 2021 from near zero to counter the rapid increase in inflation, which hit a high above 11%.\n\nHigher interest rates -- which cool the economy by making it more expensive to borrow -- have helped ease inflation, but they've also weighed on the British economy, which has barely grown since the pandemic rebound.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Office for National Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u2013present_United_Kingdom_cost-of-living_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021\u2013present United Kingdom cost-of-living crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HM Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/06/Representative-Image-2024-06-19T132004.233-2024-06-dd3896671cfa318d08a9b27b8890ce7b.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1503, "textEnd": 1509}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

On a month-on-month basis, inflation held constant compared to a 0.3% rise last month.\n\nThe figure indicates that prices are still rising, but at the slowest pace since July 2021. It comes following a sustained period of high inflation in the UK, which peaked at 11.1% in October 2022 - the highest level since 1981.\n\nCore inflation which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, as they tend to be volatile, is forecast to have fallen to 3.5% from 3.9%, also as expected.\n\nThe Bank of England will look at these numbers on Thursday to decide what to do about interest rates.\n\nThe easing in the inflation rate was driven by a slowdown in price rises for food and soft drinks, recreation and culture, and furniture and household goods.\n\nPrices of food and soft drinks rose by 1.7% in the year to May, down from 2.9% in April, and the lowest rate since October 2021.\n\nRead more: Interest rates will remain higher for longer, say BlackRock analysts\n\nIt has eased for 14 months from a peak of 19.2% in March last year, the highest annual rate seen for more than 45 years.\n\nThe main downward effects on the inflation rate came from bread and cereals, vegetables, and sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery. In each case, prices fell between April and May this year, compared with a monthly rise a year ago.\n\nServices inflation, a key metric that is closely watched by the Bank of England, however, slightly missed analysts' expectations, coming in at 5.7% on the year versus market expectations of 5.5%.\n\nThomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, said about services inflation: \"This will raise concerns on the MPC that underlying price pressures in the economy aren't slowing as quickly as expected and makes an August interest rate cut less likely.\n\n\"However, we aren't ruling out an August rate cut. It seems likely that services inflation in May was still being bolstered by the impact of the 9.7% rise in national minimum wage in April, which was a one-off, as inflation in the restaurant and hotels category only slowed by 0.2 percentage points.\n\n\"We expect inflation to fall below 2% in June, setting the stage for the MPC to cut interest rates in August.\n\n\"Inflation is likely to average a little above 2% for the rest of the year giving the Bank plenty of room to deliver rate cuts.Our base case is still for interest rates to finish the year at 4.5%, but the risks have clearly shifted to fewer cuts this year.\"\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the stage was now set for the Bank of England to cautiously cut interest rates.\n\nCBI principal economist Martin Sartorius said: \"Another fall in inflation in May will come as welcome news to households as we move towards a more benign inflationary environment. However, many will still be feeling the pinch due to the level of prices being far higher than in previous years, particularly for food and energy bills.\n\n\"Today's data sets the stage for the Monetary Policy Committee to cut interest rates in August, in line with our latest forecast's expectations.\"\n\nThe Bank's Monetary Policy Committee will meet on Thursday, where, due to the proximity of the upcoming election, it is all but certain to keep rates unchanged at 5.25% in order to not influence the political outcome.\n\nSlowing inflation is likely to be well-received by homeowners and buyers pinning their hopes on a summer interest rate cut.\n\n\"Mortgage rates have flipped-flopped over the course of the year as financial expectations shifted causing a headache for nervous first-time buyers looking to get a foot on the ladder and existing homeowners hoping for better deals as they come to refinance,\" Alice Haine, personal finance analyst at Bestinvest, said.\n\nRead more: UK interest rates set to remain on hold ahead of general election\n\n\"While easing inflation combined with solid wage growth means affordability levels are improving for buyers as their money can stretch that little bit further, a rate reduction could boost their prospects even further.

Those figures should keep the central bank on track to cut interest rates in the coming months, even though Bank of England officials have signaled they are unlikely to announce a policy shift on Thursday due to the election campaign.\n\nThe slowdown in price growth has allowed Sunak to declare victory over a brutal cost-of-living squeeze, after inflation reached double digits in 2022 because of Russia's war in Ukraine and the end of pandemic restrictions. The decrease is unlikely to be enough to help the ruling Conservative Party, which polls show is heading for defeat to Labour in the July 4 election.\n\nBOE policymakers may appreciate the extra month to weigh lingering signs of sticky prices beyond the headline rate. Inflation in the services sector remained higher than expected, registering a 5.7% gain last month after a reading of 5.9% in April. Economists had expected a sharper decline to 5.5%. Forecasters suggest headline inflation rate will pick up to 2.4% by the end of the year.\n\nThe ONS said that prices in restaurants and hotels contributed most to the headline rate with the sector passing on demands for higher pay, not least after the rise in the minimum wage. Rent and fuel costs also were upward forces on services.\n\n\"Inflation may be back at 2%, but it might not be there for long,\" said Zara Nokes, global market analyst at JPMorgan Asset Management. \"Today's inflation news puts the final nail in the coffin for any hopes of a rate cut from the Bank of England tomorrow. Services inflation is still running too hot.\"\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says ...\n\n\"Another stronger-than-expected services inflation reading will make for uncomfortable reading for the Bank of England and is likely to make it cautious about how quickly it eases monetary policy this year. We still think the fall in headline inflation to 2% warrants a cut over the summer - probably in August. But beyond that, ongoing signs of persistence justifies a slower pace of cuts.\"\n\n-- Dan Hanson and Ana Andrade, Bloomberg Economics. Click for the REACT.\n\nThe pound erased modest losses after the release showed UK services inflation fell less than expected, denting expectations for rate cuts. Sterling traded as much as 0.2% stronger at $1.2730. Traders priced chances of a quarter-point reduction in August at about 30%, down from 45% before the data.\n\nThe figures also leave the UK, which last year had the worst inflation problem among its major peers, now looking like a leader on suppressing price pressures. Only the US also has inflation at 2% on a comparable measure, though its headline rate is higher.\n\n\"The UK has won the international race to get back to target, being the first among the euro area and US to bring headline inflation back down to 2%,\" the Resolution Foundation said. \"In fact, the UK currently has the lowest headline inflation rate in the G-7 bar Italy.\"\n\nSoaring prices and last year's recession took a bite out of the Conservatives' reputation for managing the economy. Politicians seized on the figures, with Sunak hailing, \"great news\" that inflation is \"back to normal at 2% -- that's lower than Germany, France and America.\"\n\nLabour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said, \"I'm not going to say that everything is fine. For many families and pensioners, the cost of living crisis is still acute because although although inflation is falling, that doesn't mean prices are going down it just means they're going up at a lower rate.\"\n\nPolicy makers at the BOE led by Governor Andrew Bailey remain on guard for signs that inflation will persist and are watching wages and price-setting in services before loosening policy.\n\nGoods prices fell 1.3% on the month, the most since 2016. Annual food inflation -- one of the major drivers of the double-digit price increases -- eased to 1.6% and dragged the overall rate lower. Some products are now seeing declines in prices, such as fish and dairy.\n\n\"Services prices may be a little stickier than anticipated,\" said Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank Research. \"This, we think, will raise the bar for an August rate cut.\"\n\nWhy Aren't UK Interest Rates Falling With Inflation?: QuickTake\n\nInvestors and economists expect the BOE to leave the benchmark rate at a 16-year high of 5.25% on Thursday when the next decision is released. Rate setters have refrained from public remarks during the election campaign, but they previously expressed concern about indicators of underlying inflation.\n\n\"Another fall in inflation in May will come as welcome news to households as we move towards a more benign inflationary environment,\" said Martin Sartorius, principal economist at the CBI. \"However, many will still be feeling the pinch due to the level of prices being far higher than in previous years, particularly for food and energy bills.\"\n\nSeparate figures showed pipeline inflation pressures remained subdued, with producer input prices falling falling 0.1% from a year earlier and output prices rising 1.7%. The figures are down sharply from their peak levels in 2022.\n\n\"While this is positive news, we expect to see inflation rebound somewhat from June onwards,\" said Paula Bejarano Carbo, economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.\n\n--With assistance from Harumi Ichikura, Andrew Atkinson and Constantine Courcoulas.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

That ought to be good news for Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives - but given the state of the opinion polls it looks like being far too little, far too late.\n\nFirst the good news. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show price pressures are continuing to abate. The headline rate of inflation fell from 2.3% in April to 2% in May - and there were also declines in two closely watched measures of underlying inflation.\n\nInflation excluding volatile items such as food, fuel, alcohol and tobacco dropped from 3.9% to 3.5%, while inflation in the services sector - which tends to be more affected by domestic than global factors - dipped from 5.9% to 5.7%.\n\nFood price inflation, which was nudging 20% at its peak in late 2022, now stands at 1.7%, down from 2.9% in April. Grocery bills fell by 0.3% on the month, which will be welcome for less well-off households, who spend proportionately more of their budgets on food.\n\nBut there were also declines in the inflation rates for clothing and footwear (3.7% to 3%), recreation and culture (4.4% to 3.9%), and restaurants and hotels (6% to 5.8%) because prices rose less rapidly last month than they did in May 2023.\n\nLast week's figures for average earnings showed pay rising at an annual rate of about 6%. With inflation at 2%, that means people are enjoying a chunky rise in living standards, a reversal of the trend in 2022 when inflation peaked at 11.1% and real pay was falling.\n\nInternational comparisons show that the UK's inflation rate is lower than in Germany (2.8%), France (2.6%), the EU as a whole (2.7%) and the same as the US (2%).\n\nThe bad news is that there is still some way to go before the Bank of England is ready to declare the war against inflation over.\n\nAt 5.7%, service sector inflation is still higher than Threadneedle Street's monetary policy committee (MPC) would like and while Sunak would greatly welcome a cut in interest rates from the Bank tomorrow it isn't going to happen. The MPC's meeting in early August looks a much likelier time for borrowing costs to start coming down.\n\nOverall, the economy has emerged from the cost of living crisis in better shape than might have been feared in late 2022, suffering only the mildest of technical recessions despite interest rates being raised from 0.1% to 5.25% between December 2021 and August 2023.\n\nBut it will take time for voters to forget the squeeze on their living standards caused by the highest inflation in four decades, and time is not on Sunak's side. The beneficiary of inflation coming back to target will not be the current occupant of 10 Downing Street. It will be Keir Starmer.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "larry_elliott@theguardian.com", "name": "Larry Elliott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Office for National Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u2013present_United_Kingdom_cost-of-living_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2021\u2013present United Kingdom cost-of-living crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threadneedle_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Threadneedle Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Downing_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "10 Downing Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bf5d8306dbea7730714cb9b80ab5fd142d31991/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=e07e1945ca8e1c198f7839b592624dab", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

But this shouldn't fool the next Government, workers are still facing much higher prices for their daily essentials than they were a few years ago.\n\n\"As the rate of inflation falls, the good news is the wage recovery is continuing. Workers now have more money in their pockets than they did last year with real nominal wage growth of 2.3% on the year. But the bad news is that most people are feeling poorer than when they voted in the last General Election nearly five years ago. This is the first Parliament since 1955 where living standards have declined - attributable to wage stagnation alongside wider impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine and political choices.\n\n\"And for many workers the cost of living crisis is not over yet. Interest rates remain at their highest level for 16 years at 5.25%, which is creating a cost of housing squeeze for many private renters and mortgage holders - with low paid and insecure workers hit hardest.\n\n\"While politicians will be hoping that interest rates ease in the coming months, the next Government has a vital role to play. The Household Support Fund - which has been a vital lifeline for those struggling to make ends meet - is due to expire at the end of September. The next Government must commit to continuing cost of living support for the most vulnerable households until April 2026 when the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts real wages will have finally returned to 2008 levels.\"", "source": {"uri": "nottinghampost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Nottingham Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "neil_shaw@nottinghampost.com", "name": "Neil Shaw", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u2013present_United_Kingdom_cost-of-living_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021\u2013present United Kingdom cost-of-living crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Office for National Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wages", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real wages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_Budget_Responsibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Office for Budget Responsibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancaster_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lancaster University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://i2-prod.nottinghampost.com/news/uk-world-news/article9352813.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-1453974269.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 656, "textEnd": 662}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Despite this, the Bank of England isn't expected to cut interest rates immediately, and the reduction in inflation is unlikely to benefit Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in the upcoming election.\n\nBritish inflation returned to its 2% target in May for the first time in nearly three years, official figures showed on Wednesday, as the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine faded. The fall in inflation will be welcomed by both Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the Bank of England - but likely has come too late either to turn around Sunak's fortunes at next month's election or to prompt a BoE rate cut on Thursday.\n\nMay's data showed services price inflation - which the BoE thinks gives a better picture of medium-term inflation risks - was 5.7%. That was down from 5.9% in April but not as big a drop as the 5.5% that economists had expected. The drop in annual consumer price inflation from April's 2.3% reading was in line with economists' median expectation in a Reuters poll and marks a sharp decline from the 41-year high of 11.1% reached in October 2022.\n\nThe fall has been sharper than in the euro zone or the United States, where consumer price inflation in May was 2.6% and 3.3% respectively, belying concerns a year ago that British inflation was proving unusually sticky. Even so, consumer prices are up around 20% over the past three years, squeezing living standards and contributing to the unpopularity of Sunak's Conservatives, who are around 20 points behind the opposition Labour Party in opinion polls.\n\nThe BoE has said a return of inflation to its target is not enough on its own for it to start cutting interest rates. While most economists polled by Reuters think it will start to cut interest rates from its 16-year high of 5.25% in August, financial markets think a first move is more likely in September or October - and see just a 10% chance of a cut this week.\n\nThe most recent fall in inflation was driven by a cut in regulated household energy bills in April - the effect of which will fade later in the year, when the BoE forecasts inflation will rise again.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/19_06_2024_06_12_38_621024.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The last time inflation was at 2% was in July 2021 before prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic and then by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.\n\nDespite the decline, few economists think the Bank of England will reduce its main interest rate from 5.25% on Thursday. Some policymakers are still concerned over the scale of price rises in the crucial services sector and the pace of wage increases, which raise the risks of an inflation rebound if interest rates are cut too soon. The consensus in financial markets is that rates will be cut in August.\n\n\"Despite this landmark fall in inflation, concerns over both underlying price pressures and changing policy in the run-up to a general election means a June interest rate cut is almost certainly off the table,\" said Suren Thiru, economics director at The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales\n\nThough the bank is independent from government, there's also a general expectation that policymakers will hold the line during an election campaign.\n\nThe Bank of England, like the U.S. Fed and other central banks, raised interest rates aggressively in late 2021 from near zero to counter the rapid increase in inflation, which hit a high above 11%.\n\nHigher interest rates -

Currently, rates have been frozen at 5.25 per cent and have stayed at the same level for the past few months.\n\nBanks across the country use the base rate to determine their own mortgage rates for customers as well as any other variable payback loans. Therefore, a change to the base rate will have a direct effect on some homeowners finances.\n\nRead more: DWP clarifies rules on neighbour contact and video surveillance in benefit fraud cases\n\nWill interest rates go up this week?\n\nWhen deciding whether it should change interest rates, the Bank looks at a number of national and global economic factors. One key influence in its decision making is the rate of inflation.\n\nLatest figures released this week state the rate of Consumer Prices Index inflation fell to 2 per cent in May from 2.3 per cent in April. This marks te first time inflation has returned to the 2 per cent mark in nearly three years.\n\nThis means inflation has finally met the Bank of England's target before it was skyrocketed by the cost of living crisis, reaching levels not seen for around 40 years. While this does pose a positive turn for the economy, some economists are skeptical it will lead to an interest rate cut in the early summer.\n\nCurrent popular opinion is that the base rate will be held at 5.25 per cent on Thursday. Investec economist Sandra Horsfield said: \"Welcome though a return to target inflation would be, the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) is unlikely to be fully satisfied should the numbers meet our expectations.\n\n\"In the (Bank's) May Monetary Policy Report, the baseline forecast was for a 1.9% inflation rate. Nor it is clear that inflation will stay at 2% from now on - In fact, we expect a small rise again over the second half of the year.\"\n\nShe highlighted that it's more likely rates will be reduced in August due to \"a pre-election purdah period\".\n\nPolicymakers will also be looking at other factors affecting the economy, especially wage growth which has remained resilient in recent months. Other factors to look at is inflation in the services sector which has been one of the key things stopping the Bank from driving down the base rate recently.\n\nRobert Wood at Pantheon Macroeconomics similarly said that the Bank \"still has work to do\". He said: \"We think the MPC will still cut Bank Rate for the first time in August, even if services inflation overshoots its forecast.\n\n\"As long as services inflation keeps slowing, the next CPI print should give the MPC more confidence to trust surveys which suggest inflation will continue to ease.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kieran_isgin@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Kieran Isgin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Base rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Work_and_Pensions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department for Work and Pensions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29380001.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_The-Bank-Of-England.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 96, "textEnd": 103}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Those figures should keep the central bank on track to cut interest rates in the coming months, even though BOE officials have signalled they are unlikely to announce a policy shift on Thursday due to the election campaign.\n\nThe slowdown in price growth has allowed Sunak to declare victory over a brutal cost-of-living squeeze, after inflation reached double digits in 2022 because of Russia's war in Ukraine and the end of Covid-19 pandemic restrictions. The decrease is unlikely to be enough to help the ruling Conservative Party, which polls show is heading for a defeat to Labour in the July 4 election.\n\nBOE policymakers may appreciate the extra month to weigh lingering signs of sticky prices beyond the headline rate. Inflation in the services sector remained higher than expected, registering a 5.7% gain last month after a reading of 5.9% in April. Economists had expected a sharper decline to 5.5%. Forecasters suggest that the headline inflation rate will pick up to 2.4% by year end.\n\nThe ONS said that prices in restaurants and hotels contributed most to the headline rate with the sector passing on demands for higher pay, not least after a rise in the minimum wage. Rent and fuel costs also were upward forces on services.\n\n\"Inflation may be back at 2%, but it might not be there for long,\" said Zara Nokes, a global market analyst at JPMorgan Asset Management. \"Today's inflation news puts the final nail in the coffin for any hopes of a rate cut from the BOE tomorrow (Thursday). Services inflation is still running too hot.\"\n\nThe pound erased modest losses after the release showed UK services inflation fell less than expected, denting expectations for rate cuts. Sterling traded as much as 0.2% stronger at US$1.2730. Traders priced chances of a quarter-point reduction in August at about 30%, down from 45% before the data.\n\nThe figures also leave the UK, which last year had the worst inflation problem among its major peers, now looking like a leader on suppressing price pressures. Only the US also has inflation at 2% on a comparable measure, though its headline rate is higher.\n\n\"The UK has won the international race to get back to target, being the first among the euro area and US to bring headline inflation back down to 2%,\" the Resolution Foundation said. \"In fact, the UK currently has the lowest headline inflation rate in the Group of Seven bar Italy.\"\n\nSoaring prices and last year's recession took a bite out of the Conservatives' reputation for managing the economy. Politicians seized on the figures, with Sunak hailing \"great news\" that inflation is \"back to normal at 2% -- that's lower than Germany, France and America\".\n\nLabour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves said, \"I am not going to say that everything is fine. For many families and pensioners, the cost of living crisis is still acute, because although inflation is falling, that doesn't mean prices are going down, it just means they are going up at a lower rate.\"\n\nPolicymakers at the BOE led by governor Andrew Bailey remain on guard for signs that inflation will persist, and are watching wages and price-setting in services before loosening policy.\n\nGoods prices fell 1.3% on the month, the most since 2016. Annual food inflation -- one of the major drivers of the double-digit price increases -- eased to 1.6% and dragged the overall rate lower. Some products are now seeing declines in prices, such as fish and dairy.\n\n\"Services prices may be a little stickier than anticipated,\" said Sanjay Raja, the chief UK economist of Deutsche Bank Research. \"This, we think, will raise the bar for an August rate cut.\"\n\nInvestors and economists expect the BOE to leave the benchmark rate at a 16-year high of 5.25% on Thursday when the next decision is released. Rate setters have refrained from public remarks during the election campaign, but they previously expressed concern about indicators of underlying inflation.\n\n\"Another fall in inflation in May will come as welcome news to households, as we move towards a more benign inflationary environment,\" said Martin Sartorius, the principal economist of the CBI. \"However, many will still be feeling the pinch due to the level of prices being far higher than in previous years, particularly for food and energy bills.\"\n\nSeparate figures showed that pipeline inflation pressures remained subdued, with producer input prices falling 0.1% from a year earlier and output prices rising 1.7%. The figures are down sharply from their peak levels in 2022.\n\n\"While this is positive news, we expect to see inflation rebound somewhat from June onwards,\" said Paula Bejarano Carbo, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.", "source": {"uri": "theedgemalaysia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Edge Malaysia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

That was in line with City expectations.\n\nThe return to the target represents a major symbolic victory for the Bank of England after a long struggle to contain the inflationary surge unleashed by the end of Covid restrictions followed by the energy price surge after the full scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nIt will also be a boost for Rishi Sunak in the last two weeks of the election campaign.\n\nCPI inflation was last at 2% in July 2021 but rose rapidly after that to peak at a 41 year high of 11.1% in October 2022 before slowly easing. The Bank was forced to hike interest rates to a 16 year high of 5.25% by August last year, a level they have stayed at ever since.\n\nHitting the 2% target is still unlikely to persuade the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to vote for a rate cut at its meeting tomorrow, but a move in August now looks more likely.\n\nThe long spike in inflation ushered in a cost of prolonged living crisis that has seen living standards tumble and had a devastating impact on Rishi Sunak's poll ratings.\n\nAnalysts Kantar said yesterday that supermarket inflation has fallen back to 2.1%, the lowest since June 2022.\n\nToday the ONS said prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages rose by only 1.7% in the year to May, down from 2.9% in the year to April. The May figure is the lowest annual rate since October 2021.\n\nThe rate has eased for the 14th consecutive month from a recent high of 19.2% in March 2023, the highest annual rate for over 45 years.However there will some concern at the MPC that the closely watched CPI services annual rate only fell from 5.9% to 5.7%.David Murray, financial planning expert at abrdn said: \"After a drop to the lowest inflation level since 2021 last month, another dip to 2% is the news many have been longing for, for some time.\n\n\"While there are always winners and losers, across the board, longer-term low inflation brings with it stability and affordability that will benefit millions of people who have struggled to grapple with a high cost of living.\n\n\"With inflation now at 2%, naturally people will be prompted to question whether interest rates will follow suit and finally start to decline. Although the Bank of England has made it clear that it needs to see inflation get low, and stay low before it can cut interest rates, so today's announcement is further justification for this to bear fruit.\"", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Although it ticked down slightly in May, at 3.3% from 3.4% in April, according to the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released June 12, it's still a far cry from the Federal Reserve's 2% target.\n\nThis has been hurting consumers on many levels, whether it's at the grocery store or to pay rent and mortgages.\n\nAlso Read: I'm an Economist -- Here Are My Predictions for Inflation If Biden Wins Again\n\nFind Out: How To Get $340 Per Year in Cash Back on Gas and Other Things You Already Buy\n\nTo put this in context, while inflation has come down from the record 9.1% it stood at in June 2022, as well as the 4% it stood at a year ago in May 2023, according to CPI data, it is still far off the Fed's stated 2% target. And it is also far off from where it stood in May 2020: 0.1%.\n\nIn turn, it came as no surprise that the Fed chose to keep its rates steady following its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting which concluded on June 12. In addition, Fed officials expect only one cut in 2024, down from the previous several cuts anticipated, according to its June 12 Summary of Economic Projections.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, when could inflation reach the Fed's 2% inflation target and would this really change consumers' lives and finances -- or are there other factors at play?\n\nHere is what experts had to say about it.\n\nAlso see how the presidential candidates might affect inflation.\n\nWealthy people know the best money secrets. Learn how to copy them.\n\nAccording to Matt Colyar, economist at Moody's Analytics, when inflation returns to the Fed's 2% target, which he expects by late next year, he anticipates the U.S. labor market will have a bit more slack.\n\n\"This means wages will grow slower than their current 4.5% pace toward 3% to 3.5%,\" he said. \"Real wages -- coarsely, the difference in the growth rate between inflation and wages -- would be rising 1% to 1.5% per year. That is economic growth.\"\n\nColyar added that households spend different shares of their income on different components, but real wage gains represent an increase in wealth and an ability to purchase more -- quality or quantity.\n\nRead More: 5 Changes That Could Be Coming for the Middle Class If Biden Is Reelected in 2024\n\nIn addition, in terms of the dearth of housing in the U.S., this will translate into rent prices expected to grow faster than broader inflation.\n\nIndeed, in May, prices for shelter were up 5.4% over the past year, well above the overall 3.3% inflation rate, according to the CPI data.\n\n\"This means that the real wage gains I mentioned above will be less enjoyed by those who spend a higher share of their income on rent,\" Colyar said. \"Food inflation, over the near and intermediate term, is expected to adhere closer to the Fed's broader inflation target.\"\n\nAs Michael Collins, CEO of WinCap Financial, explained, the average American would save about 2% more of their income when the inflation rate is at 2%.\n\n\"This means that if someone earns $50,000 a year, their savings would increase by $1,000,\" explained Collins, who added that while this may not seem like a significant amount, it can add up over time and provide a cushion for unexpected expenses or help toward long-term financial goals, especially if you are taking advantage of the power of compounding interest.\n\nIn addition, he said, with a lower inflation rate, the cost of goods and services will also increase at a slower pace, allowing individuals to stretch their savings even further.\n\nAnother consequence of inflation getting down to 2% would be less reliance on credit -- something that has been taking a toll on many Americans who live paycheck to paycheck.\n\nThis could ultimately mean that costs of goods and services would generally stabilize, and it could similarly lead to more stability and predictability in consumers' monthly budgets, said Charlie Wise, SVP and head of global research and consulting at TransUnion.\n\n\"Ultimately, this could lead to less of a reliance on credit products such as credit cards simply to get by month to month and potentially a slowing in overall balance growth among these products,\" Wise said.\n\nIn addition, as inflation approaches the Fed's 2% target, the Fed will start cutting interest rates, which will impact interest rates for credit products, including credit cards, he said.\n\n\"That means that consumers who do continue to use card credit, as well as those who open new loans like personal loans and mortgages, will see lower monthly payments on that debt.\"\n\nWhile a lower inflation rate would definitely help consumers, a lot of the damage has already been done.\n\n\"Prices have risen a cumulative 20% over the past couple of years,\" said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Creditcards.com. \"And many consumers believe a misconception that lower inflation means prices will roll back to 2019 levels.\"\n\nAs Rossman explained, lower inflation simply means prices are growing more slowly.\n\n\"The real key here is wage growth,\" Rossman said. \"Wage growth has been outpacing inflation in recent months. That's what we need to see more of. For example, you'd rather have your wages growing 4% if inflation is 3% than your wages growing 2% if inflation is also 2%.\"\n\nStephen Kates, CFP, principal financial analyst at Annuity.org, echoed the sentiment, saying the cumulative 20% increase in overall prices since 2020 is here to stay. Despite all the recent news of Target, McDonald's and other stores lowering their prices, they are lowering them from an already elevated level, he said.\n\n\"A 2% inflation rate is still an increase in prices on an annual basis, just a slower one than we've been accustomed to seeing since 2022 when inflation really took off,\" Kates said. \"It's also important to note that 2% inflation is higher than the average inflation rate from 2010 to 2020, which was 1.72%.\"\n\nYet, Kates also noted that as inflation falls, Americans should expect to feel less anxiety when they are shopping for everyday items because price increases will be less noticeable.\n\n\"However, true savings will depend on wages more than inflation,\" he said. \"Currently wage growth is outpacing inflation by roughly 0.5% and has been for the last two years. If this trend continues, Americans may begin to not only feel more breathing room but also see it in their paychecks.\"\n\nMore From GOBankingRates", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

In addition, Fed officials expect only one cut in 2024, down from the previous several cuts anticipated, according to its June 12 Summary of Economic Projections.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, when could inflation reach the Fed's 2% inflation target and would this really change consumers' lives and finances -- or are there other factors at play?\n\nHere is what experts had to say about it.\n\nAlso see how the presidential candidates might affect inflation.\n\n2% Late Next Year; Real Wages To Grow\n\nAccording to Matt Colyar, economist at Moody's Analytics, when inflation returns to the Fed's 2% target, which he expects by late next year, he anticipates the U.S. labor market will have a bit more slack.\n\n\"This means wages will grow slower than their current 4.5% pace toward 3% to 3.5%,\" he said. \"Real wages -- coarsely, the difference in the growth rate between inflation and wages -- would be rising 1% to 1.5% per year. That is economic growth.\"\n\nColyar added that households spend different shares of their income on different components, but real wage gains represent an increase in wealth and an ability to purchase more -- quality or quantity.\n\nIn addition, in terms of the dearth of housing in the U.S., this will translate into rent prices expected to grow faster than broader inflation.\n\nIndeed, in May, prices for shelter were up 5.4% over the past year, well above the overall 3.3% inflation rate, according to the CPI data.\n\n\"This means that the real wage gains I mentioned above will be less enjoyed by those who spend a higher share of their income on rent,\" Colyar said. \"Food inflation, over the near and intermediate term, is expected to adhere closer to the Fed's broader inflation target.\"\n\nMore Savings\n\nAs Michael Collins, CEO of WinCap Financial, explained, the average American would save about 2% more of their income when the inflation rate is at 2%.\n\n\"This means that if someone earns $50,000 a year, their savings would increase by $1,000,\" explained Collins, who added that while this may not seem like a significant amount, it can add up over time and provide a cushion for unexpected expenses or help toward long-term financial goals, especially if you are taking advantage of the power of compounding interest.\n\nIn addition, he said, with a lower inflation rate, the cost of goods and services will also increase at a slower pace, allowing individuals to stretch their savings even further.\n\nLess Reliance on Credit\n\nAnother consequence of inflation getting down to 2% would be less reliance on credit -- something that has been taking a toll on many Americans who live paycheck to paycheck.\n\nThis could ultimately mean that costs of goods and services would generally stabilize, and it could similarly lead to more stability and predictability in consumers' monthly budgets, said Charlie Wise, SVP and head of global research and consulting at TransUnion.\n\n\"Ultimately, this could lead to less of a reliance on credit products such as credit cards simply to get by month to month and potentially a slowing in overall balance growth among these products,\" Wise said.\n\nIn addition, as inflation approaches the Fed's 2% target, the Fed will start cutting interest rates, which will impact interest rates for credit products, including credit cards, he said.\n\n\"That means that consumers who do continue to use card credit, as well as those who open new loans like personal loans and mortgages, will see lower monthly payments on that debt.\"\n\nA Lot of the Damage 'Already Done'\n\nWhile a lower inflation rate would definitely help consumers, a lot of the damage has already been done.\n\n\"Prices have risen a cumulative 20% over the past couple of years,\" said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Creditcards.com. \"And many consumers believe a misconception that lower inflation means prices will roll back to 2019 levels.\"\n\nAs Rossman explained, lower inflation simply means prices are growing more slowly.\n\n\"The real key here is wage growth,\" Rossman said. \"Wage growth has been outpacing inflation in recent months. That's what we need to see more of. For example, you'd rather have your wages growing 4% if inflation is 3% than your wages growing 2% if inflation is also 2%.\"\n\nStephen Kates, CFP, principal financial analyst at Annuity.org, echoed the sentiment, saying the cumulative 20% increase in overall prices since 2020 is here to stay. Despite all the recent news of Target, McDonald's and other stores lowering their prices, they are lowering them from an already elevated level, he said.\n\n\"A 2% inflation rate is still an increase in prices on an annual basis, just a slower one than we've been accustomed to seeing since 2022 when inflation really took off,\" Kates said. \"It's also important to note that 2% inflation is higher than the average inflation rate from 2010 to 2020, which was 1.72%.\"\n\nYet, Kates also noted that as inflation falls, Americans should expect to feel less anxiety when they are shopping for everyday items because price increases will be less noticeable.\n\n\"However, true savings will depend on wages more than inflation,\" he said. \"Currently wage growth is outpacing inflation by roughly 0.5% and has been for the last two years. If this trend continues, Americans may begin to not only feel more breathing room but also see it in their paychecks.\"\n\nMore From GOBankingRates", "source": {"uri": "gobankingrates.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GOBankingRates"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yael_bizouati_kennedy@gobankingrates.com", "name": "Ya\u00ebl Bizouati-Kennedy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wages", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real wages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody's_Analytics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moody's Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compound interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransUnion", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TransUnion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsecured_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unsecured debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_president", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice president"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/inflation-concept-iStock-1376405147.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 256, "textEnd": 263, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 710, "textEnd": 718}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

This delay means the Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates soon. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak welcomes the drop, but it may not influence the upcoming elections.\n\nBritish inflation returned to its 2% target in May for the first time in nearly three years, data showed on Wednesday, but underlying price pressures remained strong, meaning the Bank of England is likely to wait longer before cutting interest rates. While the fall in headline inflation in May will be welcomed by both Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the BoE, it is likely to have come too late either to turn around Sunak's fortunes at next month's election or to prompt a BoE rate cut on Thursday.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics data showed services price inflation, which the BoE thinks gives a better picture of medium-term inflation risks, was 5.7%. That was down from 5.9% in April but not as big a drop as the 5.5% economists had forecast in a Reuters poll. Sterling rose modestly against the U.S. dollar and the euro after the data.\n\n\"(BoE) Governor (Andrew) Bailey is likely to be the happiest man in the Square Mile this morning,\" said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at currency brokers Pepperstone, but added the BoE was likely to wait until August before cutting rates. The drop in annual consumer price inflation from April's 2.3% reading - in line with economists' expectations - took it to its lowest since July 2021 and marks a sharp decline from the 41-year high of 11.1% in October 2022.\n\nThe fall has been sharper than in the euro zone or the United States, where consumer price inflation in May was 2.6% and 3.3% respectively, belying concerns a year ago that British inflation was proving unusually sticky. Inflation first began to pick up in most Western economies in the second half of 2021 due to bottlenecks from the COVID-19 pandemic, then surged after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 caused natural gas prices to soar.\n\nConsumer prices in Britain are up around 20% over the past three years, squeezing living standards and contributing to the unpopularity of Sunak's Conservatives, who are around 20 points behind the opposition Labour Party in opinion polls. Sunak said in a video clip that the drop in inflation since he took over from his Conservative predecessor Liz Truss - whose fiscal policy triggered a surge in government borrowing costs - was evidence that his economic policies were working.\n\n\"Let's not put all that progress at risk with Labour,\" he said. Rachel Reeves, the Labour lawmaker who looks set to be Britain's next finance minister after the July 4 election, said the Conservatives would bring \"five more years of chaos\".\n\nNO EARLY RATE CUT The BoE has said a return of inflation to its target is not enough on its own for it to start cutting interest rates.\n\n\"Rate-setters will still need to weigh the fall in headline inflation against signs that domestic price pressures, such as elevated pay growth, are proving slower to come down,\" Martin Sartorius, principal economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said. While most economists polled by Reuters think the central bank will start to cut rates from a 16-year high of 5.25% in August, financial markets think a first move is more likely in September or November and see less than a 10% chance of a cut this week.\n\nThe most recent fall in inflation was partly driven by a cut in regulated household energy bills in April - the effect of which will fade later in the year, when the BoE forecasts inflation will rise again. Lower food prices were the biggest factor pushing down on inflation in May, reducing the annual rate of inflation for food and non-alcoholic drinks to 1.7% from a 45-year high of 19.2% in March 2023.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

By Invezz", "body": "The annual inflation rate in the UK reached the Bank of England's (BoE) target of 2% in May, according to a report released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Wednesday.\n\nThis figure aligns with expectations and marks a decrease from April's rate of 2.3%. The data highlights a significant easing in inflationary pressures, bringing some relief to consumers and policymakers alike.\n\nThe ONS report identifies food prices as the primary factor contributing to the decline in both the Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers' housing costs (CPIH) and the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) annual rates.\n\nOn the other hand, motor fuel prices showed a slight increase, making a sluggish contribution to the overall inflation figure.\n\nOn a monthly basis, CPI rose by 0.3% in May 2024, compared to a 0.7% increase in May 2023. The CPIH, which includes owner occupiers' housing costs, increased by 2.8% over the 12 months to May 2024.\n\nCore CPI and CPIH, excluding volatile items such as energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco, rose by 3.5% and 4.2%, respectively, during the same period.\n\nThe Bank of England is set to announce its latest interest rate decision on Thursday. The current inflation figures have intensified discussions about potential interest rate cuts.\n\nFinancial markets had previously anticipated a rate cut in August, but the latest data has shifted expectations towards a possible reduction in September.\n\nThe BoE has been steadily increasing interest rates since December 2021 to combat soaring inflation, which peaked at 11.1% in October 2022 -- the highest level since 1981.\n\nWith inflation now aligning with the BoE's target, there is cautious optimism about a potential easing of monetary policy.\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry's principal economist, Martin Sartorius, commented on the recent inflation data, stating,\n\n\"The fall in inflation will be welcome news to households, although many are still feeling the pinch. Today's data sets the stage for the [Bank's] Monetary Policy Committee to cut interest rates in August, in line with our latest forecast's expectations.\"\n\nHowever, Sartorius also emphasized the need for caution, noting that domestic price pressures, such as elevated pay growth, are proving slower to decline. \"Rate-setters will need to weigh the fall in headline inflation against these persistent domestic pressures,\" he said.\n\nRuth Gregory from research firm Capital Economics expressed similar sentiments, stating,\n\nWednesday's figures probably won't be enough to persuade the Bank to cut rates on Thursday. And with services inflation nudging down only slightly, this leaves our forecast that the Bank will cut rates for the first time in August looking a little shakier.\n\nThe latest inflation figures come after a prolonged period of high inflation in the UK. The sustained inflationary pressures were driven by factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine.\n\nDespite the recent decline, the path to sustained economic stability remains uncertain.\n\nThe BoE's upcoming decision on interest rates will be closely watched, as it will provide insights into the central bank's strategy for maintaining price stability while supporting economic growth.\n\nThe potential for rate cuts later in the year underscores the BoE's cautious approach in navigating the complex economic landscape.\n\nThe UK's inflation rate hitting the BoE's 2% target in May marks a significant milestone in the country's economic recovery. While the decline in food prices played a crucial role in easing inflation, the persistence of services inflation remains a concern.\n\nAs the BoE prepares to announce its interest rate decision, the latest data sets the stage for potential rate cuts, although the timing and extent of these cuts remain subject to ongoing economic developments and domestic price pressures.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Office for National Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederation_of_British_Industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Confederation of British Industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tobacco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Economics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Automobiles", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Automobiles", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXNPEB66095_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Although it ticked down slightly in May, at 3.3% from 3.4% in April, according to the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data released June 12, it's still a far cry from the Federal Reserve's 2% target.\n\nThis has been hurting consumers on many levels, whether it's at the grocery store or to pay rent and mortgages.\n\nAlso Read: I'm an Economist -- Here Are My Predictions for Inflation If Biden Wins Again\n\nFind Out: How To Get $340 Per Year in Cash Back on Gas and Other Things You Already Buy\n\nTo put this in context, while inflation has come down from the record 9.1% it stood at in June 2022, as well as the 4% it stood at a year ago in May 2023, according to CPI data, it is still far off the Fed's stated 2% target. And it is also far off from where it stood in May 2020: 0.1%.\n\nIn turn, it came as no surprise that the Fed chose to keep its rates steady following its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting which concluded on June 12. In addition, Fed officials expect only one cut in 2024, down from the previous several cuts anticipated, according to its June 12 Summary of Economic Projections.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, when could inflation reach the Fed's 2% inflation target and would this really change consumers' lives and finances -- or are there other factors at play?\n\nHere is what experts had to say about it.\n\nAlso see how the presidential candidates might affect inflation.\n\n2% Late Next Year; Real Wages To Grow\n\nAccording to Matt Colyar, economist at Moody's Analytics, when inflation returns to the Fed's 2% target, which he expects by late next year, he anticipates the U.S. labor market will have a bit more slack.\n\n\"This means wages will grow slower than their current 4.5% pace toward 3% to 3.5%,\" he said. \"Real wages -- coarsely, the difference in the growth rate between inflation and wages -- would be rising 1% to 1.5% per year. That is economic growth.\"\n\nColyar added that households spend different shares of their income on different components, but real wage gains represent an increase in wealth and an ability to purchase more -- quality or quantity.\n\nRead More: 5 Changes That Could Be Coming for the Middle Class If Biden Is Reelected in 2024\n\nIn addition, in terms of the dearth of housing in the U.S., this will translate into rent prices expected to grow faster than broader inflation.\n\nIndeed, in May, prices for shelter were up 5.4% over the past year, well above the overall 3.3% inflation rate, according to the CPI data.\n\n\"This means that the real wage gains I mentioned above will be less enjoyed by those who spend a higher share of their income on rent,\" Colyar said. \"Food inflation, over the near and intermediate term, is expected to adhere closer to the Fed's broader inflation target.\"\n\nMore Savings\n\nAs Michael Collins, CEO of WinCap Financial, explained, the average American would save about 2% more of their income when the inflation rate is at 2%.\n\n\"This means that if someone earns $50,000 a year, their savings would increase by $1,000,\" explained Collins, who added that while this may not seem like a significant amount, it can add up over time and provide a cushion for unexpected expenses or help toward long-term financial goals, especially if you are taking advantage of the power of compounding interest.\n\nIn addition, he said, with a lower inflation rate, the cost of goods and services will also increase at a slower pace, allowing individuals to stretch their savings even further.\n\nLess Reliance on Credit\n\nAnother consequence of inflation getting down to 2% would be less reliance on credit -- something that has been taking a toll on many Americans who live paycheck to paycheck.\n\nThis could ultimately mean that costs of goods and services would generally stabilize, and it could similarly lead to more stability and predictability in consumers' monthly budgets, said Charlie Wise, SVP and head of global research and consulting at TransUnion.\n\n\"Ultimately, this could lead to less of a reliance on credit products such as credit cards simply to get by month to month and potentially a slowing in overall balance growth among these products,\" Wise said.\n\nIn addition, as inflation approaches the Fed's 2% target, the Fed will start cutting interest rates, which will impact interest rates for credit products, including credit cards, he said.\n\n\"That means that consumers who do continue to use card credit, as well as those who open new loans like personal loans and mortgages, will see lower monthly payments on that debt.\"\n\nA Lot of the Damage 'Already Done'\n\nWhile a lower inflation rate would definitely help consumers, a lot of the damage has already been done.\n\n\"Prices have risen a cumulative 20% over the past couple of years,\" said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Creditcards.com. \"And many consumers believe a misconception that lower inflation means prices will roll back to 2019 levels.\"\n\nAs Rossman explained, lower inflation simply means prices are growing more slowly.\n\n\"The real key here is wage growth,\" Rossman said. \"Wage growth has been outpacing inflation in recent months. That's what we need to see more of. For example, you'd rather have your wages growing 4% if inflation is 3% than your wages growing 2% if inflation is also 2%.\"\n\nStephen Kates, CFP, principal financial analyst at Annuity.org, echoed the sentiment, saying the cumulative 20% increase in overall prices since 2020 is here to stay. Despite all the recent news of Target, McDonald's and other stores lowering their prices, they are lowering them from an already elevated level, he said.\n\n\"A 2% inflation rate is still an increase in prices on an annual basis, just a slower one than we've been accustomed to seeing since 2022 when inflation really took off,\" Kates said. \"It's also important to note that 2% inflation is higher than the average inflation rate from 2010 to 2020, which was 1.72%.\"\n\nYet, Kates also noted that as inflation falls, Americans should expect to feel less anxiety when they are shopping for everyday items because price increases will be less noticeable.\n\n\"However, true savings will depend on wages more than inflation,\" he said. \"Currently wage growth is outpacing inflation by roughly 0.5% and has been for the last two years. If this trend continues, Americans may begin to not only feel more breathing room but also see it in their paychecks.\"\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Inflation Relief: Here's How a 2% Rate, Expected in 2025, Would Help Your Wallet\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.", "source": {"uri": "nasdaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NASDAQ Stock Market"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wages", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real wages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Open_Market_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Open Market Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moody's_Analytics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moody's Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Compound interest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransUnion", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TransUnion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsecured_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unsecured debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nasdaq.com/sites/acquia.prod/files/gobankingrates/inflation-concept-iStock-1376405147.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 256, "textEnd": 263, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-05-", "textStart": 889, "textEnd": 897}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

It is the first time it has reached this since July 2021.\n\nThis is down from 2.3 per cent in April, figures released on Wednesday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show.\n\nInflation has been falling consistently this year, following a peak of 11.1 per cent in 2022.\n\nIt comes the day before the Bank of England makes a decision as to whether the base rate will stay the same, at 5.25 per cent, or if the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will finally cut them.\n\nWhat is predicted to happen to inflation in 2024?\n\nInflation is expected to fall further later this year, although many experts have warned it will then rebound and go back above the target.\n\nThe Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) warned in a report recently that the inflation figure would increase slightly to around 2.5 per cent in the second half of 2024.\n\nThe major reason for this is that inflation is measured based on the growth in prices over the past year, so a large part of the figure is based on what prices were 12 months ago.\n\nThis April, the energy price cap - the maximum most households pay for each unit of gas or electricity used - was cut by the regulator Ofgem.\n\nBy comparison, in April 2023, the amount people were paying for their energy was at the highest level on record.\n\nEnergy prices started to fall in the second half of 2023, and experts are not currently expecting more dramatic cuts. This means that once we reach the second half of 2024, the annual price fall in energy will not be as dramatic as it is in current figures, which means it won't have as big a downwards drag on the overall inflation figure as it's currently having.\n\nWhat does this mean for interest rates?\n\nThe Bank of England tends to cut interest rates as inflation comes down. At its next meeting tomorrow, most experts predict that the Bank will hold rates at 5.25 per cent while others think it could finally cut them.\n\n\"We think the MPC will vote 7-2 to keep Bank Rate on hold at 5.25 per cent, the same vote split as in May. We also expect rate-setters to leave their guidance on the timing of the first rate cut little changed,\" experts from Pantheon Economics said.\n\nA note released by Deutsche Bank Research added: \"We expect the MPC to keep the Bank Rate at 5.25 per cent - marking its seventh consecutive meeting where policy has remained unchanged.\n\n\"Despite upside surprises to inflation and wage growth, we expect a 7-2 vote tally with external MPC member Swati Dhingra and Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden voting for a quarter point rate cut.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a report from economists at BNP Paribas, said: \"We expect the Bank to keep Bank Rate on hold at its 20 June meeting by an unchanged vote split of 7-2 with broadly similar guidance.\"\n\nWhat does this mean for mortgages, savings and pensions?\n\nMortgages\n\nMortgages are not directly affected by inflation, although many products are affected by the Bank's base rate, which inflation influences.\n\nTracker products and standard variable mortgages change directly when interest rates change.\n\nFixed mortgages tend to work on long-term predictions for where the base rate will go. This means that a big drop in inflation can send mortgage rates down, because it can lead experts to believe the base rate will fall sooner rather than later.\n\nToday's drop is likely not dramatic enough to trigger a plunge in rates but will still be welcome news for homeowners.\n\nSavings\n\nHigh inflation is bad news for savers as it erodes the value of money held in the bank. Therefore, the lower the rate, the better the news for savers.\n\nHowever, experts believe we are \"past the peak\" for savings with most fixed rates now dropping below 6 per cent. This means it is worth taking advantage of the best deals now.\n\nCurrently, the best easy-access account is 5.02 per cent with Oxbury Bank - above inflation. The best one-year fixed is with Hodge Bank at 5.16 per cent.\n\nPensions\n\nThe drop in inflation will be welcomed by pensioners who have been struggling with the cost of living crisis over the past two years, especially those for whom the state pension makes up a large portion of their income.\n\nAnother factor to be aware of is the impact of inflation on annuity rates.\n\nAnnuities offer a guaranteed annual income in retirement. They offer an alternative to drawing down money from a pension pot, which could eventually run out, particularly if a retiree lives longer than expected.\n\nWhile they have been unpopular in recent years, rising interest rates have improved the annual incomes someone can buy.\n\nBut for retirees opting for one, time may be of the essence.

The last time inflation was at 2% was in July 2021 before prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic and then by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.\n\nDespite the decline, few economists think the Bank of England will reduce its main interest rate from 5.25% on Thursday. Some policymakers are still concerned over the scale of price rises in the crucial services sector and the pace of wage increases, which raise the risks of an inflation rebound if interest rates are cut too soon. The consensus in financial markets is that rates will be cut in August.\n\n\"Despite this landmark fall in inflation, concerns over both underlying price pressures and changing policy in the run-up to a general election means a June interest rate cut is almost certainly off the table,\" said Suren Thiru, economics director at The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales\n\nThough the bank is independent from government, there's also a general expectation that policymakers will hold the line during an election campaign.\n\nThe Bank of England, like the U.S. Fed and other central banks, raised interest rates aggressively in late 2021 from near zero to counter the rapid increase in inflation, which hit a high above 11%.\n\nHigher interest rates -- which cool the economy by making it more expensive to borrow -- have helped ease inflation, but they've also weighed on the British economy, which has barely grown since the pandemic rebound.", "source": {"uri":

Photo / Mark Mitchell\n\nConway outlined how the Official Cash Rate (OCR) was used in an inflation-fighting strategy.\n\n\"This approach recognises that changes in the OCR take time to transmit through the economy and influence inflation.\"\n\nHe said the Reserve Bank did not want to cause unnecessary economic volatility by changing interest rates in response to inflation blips that would fade naturally in time.\n\n\"Growth will improve but there's a cascading series of events working through the economy for interest rates to influence inflation.\"\n\nIt could take 18 months to two years for OCR changes to meaningfully impact the economy, but he added: \"If we change the OCR, markets react virtually instantaneously.\"\n\nConway said a tight labour market and supply shortages were the biggest contributors to inflation during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nBut now the two most important factors in an expected non-tradeable inflation slowdown were spare capacity in the economy, and lower inflation expectations from households and companies.\n\nNon-tradeable inflation measured final goods and services that do not face foreign competition.\n\n\"We expect spare capacity to start emerging in the economy over 2024, after several years of the economy growing well beyond its sustainable rate,\" Conway said.\n\n\"We expect this spare capacity to feed through strongly into lower domesticallygenerated inflation.\"\n\nBorder closures from 2020 to 2022 made the local labour market tight as workers were in short supply but reality had changed dramatically since then, Conway said. Photo / Alex Burton\n\nAs for people's expectations, Conway said RBNZ research found that above-target inflation in recent years prompted people to pay more attention to inflation and to update inflation expectations more frequently.\n\n\"Inflation expectations - they can become self-fulfilling,\" he said.\n\n\"Lower inflation expectations and a lower propensity for firms to make relatively large price increases will help lower inflation persistence.\"\n\nThe RBNZ now expected disinflation to spread across a wider set of non-tradeables that typically take longer to react to monetary policy - such as restaurant meals and ready-to-eat food.\n\nConway said overall, good progress was being made in bringing inflation back to target.\n\nAn increasingly loose labour marker would be pivotal to that, he said.\n\nBut it seemed anybody expecting a cut to interest rates should think again.\n\n\"Overall, a period of restrictive policy is necessary to give us confidence that inflation will return to target over a reasonable timeframe.\"\n\nAnd despite all the research, it was still anybody's guess when the county might climb out of the high inflation quagmire.\n\n\"These processes could occur more quickly or slowly than currently projected.\"\n\nOn spare capacity forecasts, Conway said: \"We've got quite a reasonable read on what's going on in the labour market.\"\n\nHe said the country needed better economic data. Many key data releases lag real-time events and are prone to revision.\n\nTomorrow's GDP data, for example, will be more than two-and-a-half months old.", "source": {"uri": "newstalkzb.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewstalkZB"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_weekes@newstalkzb.co.nz", "name": "John Weekes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Optical character recognition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Consumer_Price_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Consumer Price Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_good", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Final good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economic data"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/media/osfm04ap/reserve-bank-chief-economist-paul-conway-photo-mark-mitchell.jpg?rmode=crop&rnd=133632657714430000&height=395&width=635&quality=95&scale=both", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

But some of this is down to noise and we doubt it will completely knock the Bank of England's new-found confidence in its future inflation predictions. We're still looking for the first rate cut in August.\n\nFor the first time since the spring of 2021, UK headline inflation is finally back to the 2% Bank of England target. It's also a fall on April's numbers, and we can point to areas like food, household goods and clothing which are all now contributing considerably less to inflation than just a few months ago.\n\nAll of that is of course great news, but we think we're probably towards the end of the disinflationary process for now. While headline CPI could conceivably drop another tenth of a percentage point or two into the summer - helped perhaps by some further disinflation in food and services - other areas will be less helpful. Household energy bills, though set to drop by a further 7% in July, are currently having their peak negative impact on the annual rate of inflation and the negative contribution will diminish as the year goes on. We expect inflation to bounce around the 2% target for much of this year and potentially could creep back up to the 2.5% area into year-end.\n\nFor the Bank of England though, it's services inflation that matters and for the second month in a row, this has come in higher than expected. Investors would be forgiven for feeling a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu after a very similar pattern emerged this time last year, and at the time markets became concerned that the UK had a considerably worse inflation problem than elsewhere.\n\nIndeed at 5.7%, it's now 0.4 percentage points above the Bank's forecast from the May Monetary Policy Report. That all but confirms the BoE will keep rates on hold tomorrow. But it doesn't necessarily change the game for August's meeting. The things that kept services inflation elevated aren't all necessarily telling us much about the underlying trend. Air fares rose more aggressively both in April and May than they did in the same months last year. Package holiday price rises did something similar, and these are areas that the Bank would typically say are driven more by noise than signal.\n\nWe're therefore sticking to our call for the first rate cut to come in August, with a total of three cuts this year. We'll still get another inflation report next month ahead of the August meeting. Any big surprises here could conceivably cause a further delay. But listening to Governor Andrew Bailey back in May, it sounded like he was keen to get on with the job of cutting interest rates. And a bit like the European Central Bank, the BoE seems more confident in its inflation predictions than it had been over the past couple of years. We'll be watching tomorrow's statement for signs that this confidence has been shaken by the latest data, or whether policymakers decide to play it down.\n\nEither way, markets are pricing a 40% chance of an August cut and that seems much too low.", "source": {"uri": "talkmarkets.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TalkMarkets"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(banker)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 92}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Most experts are predicting that the upcoming data will reveal the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) has fallen to 2% in May, a decrease from April's 2.3%.\n\nShould inflation drop to the central bank's goal, it would be the first instance since July 2021, prior to the cost-of-living crisis which saw inflation soar to heights not witnessed in four decades.\n\nEconomists are sceptical about the likelihood of an early summer cut in interest rates. The consensus among financial analysts is that the Bank of England will maintain the current 5.25% rate on Thursday, with the impending election putting a damper on any hopes for a rate reduction before the country goes to vote on July 4.\n\nInvestec economist Sandra Horsfield commented: \"Welcome though a return to target inflation would be, the MPC (Monetary Policy Committee) is unlikely to be fully satisfied should the numbers meet our expectations. In the (Bank's) May Monetary Policy Report, the baseline forecast was for a 1.9% inflation rate.

Although returning to their financial target holds symbolic importance, the Bank continues to keep a cautious eye on the stubborn inflation within the services sector, which has played a role in stalling any cuts to the interest rates from their record high in 16 years.\n\nFocus has also been given to wage growth, which has maintained its resilience, causing financial markets to anticipate only a single rate cut throughout this year. Economists may view this as overly negative, but Robert Wood of Pantheon Macroeconomics asserts that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) \"still has work to do\".\n\nHe anticipates that service sector inflation will exceed the bank's own predictions once more in May, yet believes that they'll overlook this imperfection by the time of the August decision when the next quarterly forecasts are released.\n\n\"We think the MPC will still cut Bank Rate for the first time in August, even if services inflation overshoots its forecast,\" he proposed. \"As long as services inflation keeps slowing, the next CPI print should give the MPC more confidence to trust surveys which suggest inflation will continue to ease.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "holly_williams@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Holly Williams", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021\u2013present_United_Kingdom_cost-of-living_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2021\u2013present United Kingdom cost-of-living crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdah", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Purdah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroeconomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Macroeconomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article33056306.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_inflation-is-expected-to-have-fallen-back-to-the-2-target-for-the-first-time-in-nearly-three-years-pa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1012, "textEnd": 1018}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

But it remains higher than both pre-pandemic levels and the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC's) 1 to 3% target range.\n\nInflation spiked higher during the pandemic on a mix of supply and demand-related factors. Shortages of labour and materials, in an environment of high demand, were key in driving up inflation.\n\n\"Compared to other countries, tightness in the labour market, brought about by the border closure, played an important role in generating inflation in New Zealand,\" says Mr Conway in an online webinar from Wellington.\n\n\"Looking ahead, there are some remaining challenges in bringing inflation sustainably back to target, with some risks and uncertainties attached,\" says Mr Conway.\n\nOur recent research highlights that emerging spare capacity in the economy will feed through into lower domestically generated inflation.\n\n\"Lower inflation expectations of firms and households will help reinforce the slowdown in inflation, with less pressure to raise prices and demand higher wages. As inflation continues to fall, businesses will be less able to make large price increases, which will help lower inflation persistence.\n\nWe are using these research insights to help guide our monetary policymaking under flexible inflation targeting.\n\nThe extent to which broad momentum in domestic inflation continues is a key upside risk.\n\nThis is partially offset by the potential for a quicker fall in inflation expectations and a more rapid passthrough of weaker demand to prices. Overall, a period of restrictive policy is necessary to give us confidence that inflation will return to target over a reasonable timeframe,\" he says.\n\nRead the speech here: https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/-/media/project/sites/rbnz/files/events/2024/06/inflation-the-remaining-road-to-2-percent-inflation.pdf", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upside_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upside risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Momentum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Gag_Gifts", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Gag Gifts", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The official figures showed a decrease from 2.3% to 2% in the year to May, mainly driven by lower food prices. The governing Conservative Party views this as evidence of their successful economic plan ahead of the July 4 election. The opposition Labour Party highlighted concerns over rising mortgage rates and high taxes. Despite the decline, the Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates from 5.25%. Inflation in the U.K. returned to the Bank of England's target rate of 2% for the first time in nearly three years, official figures showed Wednesday, a development that has been seized on by the governing Conservative Party that its economic plan is \"working\" ahead of the July 4 election.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index, fell to 2% in the year to May from 2.3% the month before with food prices providing the biggest downward contribution.\n\nThough the decline merely means that prices are rising at a slower rate than they have for the past few years during one of the cost of living crisis, Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak sought to take credit for the fall, and argued it was further evidence that the \"economy has now turned a corner.\"\n\nHowever, Rachel Reeves, who will become Treasury chief if the main opposition Labour Party wins the election, said working people are \"worse off,\" with mortgage rates higher than they have been for years and taxes at a 70-year high.\n\nThe fall in inflation follows nearly three years of above-target inflation. The last time inflation was at 2% was in July 2021 before prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic and then by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.\n\nDespite the decline, few economists think the Bank of England will reduce its main interest rate from 5.25% on Thursday. Some policymakers are still concerned over the scale of price rises in the crucial services sector and the pace of wage increases, which raise the risks of an inflation rebound if interest rates are cut too soon. The consensus in financial markets is that rates will be cut in August.\n\n\"Despite this landmark fall in inflation, concerns over both underlying price pressures and changing policy in the run-up to a general election means a June interest rate cut is almost certainly off the table,\" said Suren Thiru, economics director at The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.\n\nThough the bank is independent from government, there's also a general expectation that policymakers will hold the line during an election campaign.\n\nThe Bank of England, like the U.S. Fed and other central banks, raised interest rates aggressively in late 2021 from near zero to counter the rapid increase in inflation, which hit a high above 11%.\n\nHigher interest rates - which cool the economy by making it more expensive to borrow - have helped ease inflation, but they've also weighed on the British economy, which has barely grown since the pandemic rebound.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Treasury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HM Treasury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Office for National Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_1974_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "February 1974 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Chartered_Accountants_in_England_and_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111106185,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-72304,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 318, "textEnd": 324, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The BOE next meets tomorrow, but a cut is seen as unlikely during an election campaign.\n\nBerkeley upped its profit guidance for 2025 by 5% to \u00a3525 million.\n\nIt said it had \"identified 4,000 homes across 17 \"across 17 of its sustainable and well-connected brownfield regeneration sites\" to be in \"an initial portfolio\" for the in house build-to-rent platform.\n\nRob Perrins, CEO, said the move recognised \"the strong occupational and institutional investment demand for high quality, well-managed rental homes in London and the South East,\"\n\nThe service will seek to maximise returns from the \"long-term regeneration sites\", or brownfield developments which Berkeley is best known for, many of which are in and around London, including the Clarendon site in Hackney.\n\nPerrins also repeated his criticism of the impact of planning procedures on the industry.\n\n\"Planning policy and public funding needs to prioritise the provision of affordable homes over the other significant financial demands placed upon the development industry through the planning, taxation and regulatory regimes\", he said.\n\nRuth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics, says the stickier services inflation leaves an August rate cut in doubt.\n\nShe said: \"The fall in CPI inflation from 2.3% in April to 2.0% in May (BoE 1.9%, consensus 2.0%, CE 1.8%) probably won't be enough to persuade the Bank of England to cut interest rates from 5.25% tomorrow. And with services inflation nudging down only slightly, this leaves our forecast that the Bank will cut rates for the first time in August looking a little shakier.\"\n\n'Inflation rebound may be sharper than predicted'\n\n07:27 , Daniel O'Boyle\n\nDespite the fall inflation to the 2% target, NIESR Economist Paula Bejarano Carbo warned that inflation could rebound more sharply than expected.\n\nShe said: \"Annual CPI inflation has fallen to the Bank of England's 2 per cent target for the first time since July 2021. While this is positive news, we expect to see inflation rebound somewhat from June onwards. Given that today's data indicate that core inflation remains elevated, this rebound might be sharper than projected. As a result, we expect the MPC to exert caution at its upcoming meeting and hold interest rates, despite today's encouraging fall in the headline rate.\"\n\nTop stock Nvidia leads S&P 500 to fresh record, Brent Crude at $85\n\n07:23 , Graeme Evans\n\nThe S&P 500 index closed at another record last night, fuelled by Nvidia after the AI chipmaker's 3.5% rise made it the world's most valuable public company.\n\nNvidia's market cap of $3.3 trillion overtakes Microsoft, with this year's 180% jump accounting for about 35% of the S&P 500 gains in the year to date.\n\nDeutsche Bank added today that as recently as October 2022 Nvidia was the 18th largest company in the S&P 500 worth less than $300 billion.\n\nAhead of today's Juneteenth holiday the S&P 500 index last night set a record high for the second session in a row by adding 0.25%.\n\nThe FTSE 100 index is forecast to open marginally higher after rising 0.6% during yesterday's improved session for European markets.\n\nBrent Crude today traded at $85.22 a barrel, its highest level in seven weeks after adding more than 1% in yesterday's session.\n\nInflation finally falls back to its 2% target in major victory for the Bank of England\n\n07:11 , Daniel O'Boyle\n\nThe rate of inflation has finally fallen back to its 2% target for the first time in almost three years.\n\nLatest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) the headline measure of inflation, rose by 2.0% in the year to May, down from 2.3% in April. That was in line with City expectations.\n\nRead more here\n\n'Aggressive rate hikes have brought prices into check'\n\n07:09 , Daniel O'Boyle\n\nJeremy Batstone-Carr, European Strategist, Raymond James Investment Services, says interest rate hikes have largely tamed inflation without a major decline in economic output, though there is still more to do.\n\nHe said: \"This morning's data has confirmed that inflation has at last dropped back to the Bank of England's 2% target for the first time since July 2021. Today's outcome demonstrates that aggressive rate hikes have brought headline prices into check, without dampening economic activity too severely.\n\n\"Much of the drop in today's inflation data is the consequence of abnormally large price increases from spring 2023 dropping out of the annual calculation. Nevertheless, the slower-paced increase in food prices will be welcomed by households.\n\n\"Underlying price pressures, which the rate-setters take most seriously, are continuing to abate more slowly given persistent strength in services inflation. Whilst the dip from April is encouraging, the fact that services companies are continuing to pass higher costs to customers may weigh on tomorrow's much-anticipated rate decision. \"\n\nInflation in the UK fell to the Bank of England's 2% target in May, for the first time since July 2021.\n\nThe 2% figure had been expected by economists.\n\nDespite inflation hitting its target, the Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates this week.\n\nCore inflation was 3.5%, also in line with expectations. Service-sector inflation was higher than expected, at 5.7%.\n\nThe FTSE 100 ticked up on Tuesday after overtaking France's top index as Europe's biggest stock market earlier this week.\n\nThe blue-chip index rose 49 points to 8,191 on Tuesday, a 0.6% rise, with Hargreaves Lansdown, SSE and Whitbread among the biggest risers.\n\nTuesday's gains came ahead of official figures on consumer price inflation (CPI) tomorrow morning, which is expected to fall back to the Government's target of 2%.\n\nHowever, experts do not predict it will be enough to persuade Bank of England policymakers to cut the base interest rate from 5.25% on Thursday.\n\nThe FTSE overtook France's CAC 40 on Monday as Europe's biggest index after political divisions resulted in billions of euros being wiped off Paris's top index in a matter of days.\n\nThe CAC 40 rebounded today to finish 0.73% up, while elsewhere in Europe, Germany's Dax moved upwards 0.31%.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This period of silence makes a rate cut in June an unlikely move.\n\nSandra Horsfield, an economist for Investec, said this matters because were policymakers to \"surprise the market\" with its decision on Thursday, it would not be in a position to \"correct any misinterpretations\" about its rates decision until after the general election, which is on 4 July.\n\n\"Why rock the boat, when there is no need for haste and no opportunity to steady it?,\" she asked.\n\nInterest rates are currently sitting at 5.25% and have been held at this level since August 2023.\n\nAnalysts at AJ Bell suggested that the Bank's task may have been slightly complicated by both the announcement of a general election for 4 July and the latest batch of inflation data.\n\nThey said: \"Governor Andrew Bailey and his colleagues on the MPC may not wish to act in any way that could be seen as favouring one political party over another in the run-up to July's poll.\"\n\nRead more: What is a stock split and why are big tech companies opting for it?\n\nMoreover, experts have noted that last month's inflation data, particularly the services sector inflation which exceeded the Bank's expectations, will have been a key consideration for the Bank. This measure, which examines price increases across the sector, is \"overwhelmingly what is driving policy decisions right now\", according to economists at ING.\n\nWhen will interest rates come down?\n\nPolicymakers last month signalled the possibility of a rate cut as early as June, but investors now see little chance of that, after economic growth, wage expansion and services inflation all came in higher than expected.\n\nMoney markets suggest that 1 August is still the most likely date for the Bank of England to make its first rate cut since 2020.\n\nInvestec is predicting that the first rate cut could occur in August, but that two committee members, Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden, are likely to vote again in favour of a cut on Thursday.\n\nA Reuters poll showed 63 of 65 economists thought a first cut would not come until 1 August. Most also expected another reduction before the end of the year.\n\nThe Taylor Swift effect\n\nSinger Taylor Swift is not usually associated with UK interest rates but economic impact her tour is having could be enough to defer a possible September interest rate cut from the Bank of England, investment bank TD Securities said in a note.\n\n\"We still anticipate a BoE cut in August, but the inflation data for that month might keep the MPC (monetary policy committee) on hold in September,\" the bank's macro strategist, Lucas Krishan, and its head of global macro strategy, James Rossiter, said.\n\nHowever, as hundreds of thousands of dedicated Swifties flock to London in August to see Taylor Swift perform, the economist boost might be enough to make Threadneedle Street think twice about when to cut rates.\n\nFor the duration of Taylor Swift's European Eras tour, hotel prices across concert cities are expected to surge 44% on average, according to a recent report by Lighthouse.\n\nSome cities such as Liverpool, Warsaw and Stockholm, were expected to see hotel prices jump more than 100% during this time.\n\nIn the UK, according to Barclays, Taylor Swift fans are likely to spend about \u00a3848 on items including tickets, accommodation, clothes and travel.\n\n\"A surge in hotel prices then could be material, temporarily adding as much as 30bps to services inflation (+15bps on headline),\" Krishan and Rossiter warned.\n\nIf inflation is coming down, why aren't interest rates?\n\nThe main reason behind high interest rates is to bring inflation down, but with price increases slowing down, why is the Bank of England not pushing forward with cuts?\n\nRead more: When will interest rates fall and what should you do?\n\nWhile UK inflation eased to 2.3% in April, close to the central bank's 2% target, from a peak of 11.1% in October 2022, the Bank will have taken note of last month's inflation data, with services sector inflation coming in ahead of expectations.\n\nSusannah Streeter, head of money and markets, Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"There are high hopes that one of the darling buds of May unfurling last month was inflation finally hitting its target. After a disappointing reading in April, which saw the CPI index frustratingly hover elusively above 2%, disinflationary pressures are expected to have helped push prices down further.\n\n\"But it doesn't look like the Bank of England will join the celebratory party immediately and cut interest rates. Policymakers still have their eye on hot wage inflation, with earnings including bonuses still running at 6%, at the last count. However, a cut in August is still a very real possibility.''\n\nThe BoE will also have seen new inflation data for May on Wednesday, which some economists think will hit, or fall very close to its 2% target.\n\nThe tally of global interest rate cuts in 2024 stands at 70, according to website CBRates, after the reductions from the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank this month.\n\nThe US Federal Reserve last week kept its key interest rate unchanged and signalled that just one cut is expected before the end of the year.\n\n\"Although the Bank of England is now expected to follow the ECB's example and move before the US Federal Reserve, the degree to which UK rates can diverge from those in America could still limit the MPC's room for manoeuvre\" AJ Bell said.\n\n\"Too big a gap between the UK base rate and the Fed funds rate could suck capital out of sterling and into dollars, weakening the British currency, at the risk of boosting inflation thanks to how the UK buys and imports more than it sells and exports,\" analysts at AJ Bell added.\n\nThe Bank of England will announce its decision on interest rates this Thursday at noon.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

That was down from 5.9% in April but not as big a drop as the 5.5% economists had forecast in a Reuters poll.\n\nSterling rose modestly against the U.S. dollar and the euro after the data.\n\n\"(BoE) Governor (Andrew) Bailey is likely to be the happiest man in the Square Mile this morning,\" said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at currency brokers Pepperstone, but added the BoE was likely to wait until August before cutting rates.\n\nThe drop in annual consumer price inflation from April's 2.3% reading - in line with economists' expectations - took it to its lowest since July 2021 and marks a sharp decline from the 41-year high of 11.1% in October 2022.\n\nThe fall has been sharper than in the euro zone or the United States, where consumer price inflation in May was 2.6% and 3.3% respectively, belying concerns a year ago that British inflation was proving unusually sticky.\n\nInflation first began to pick up in most Western economies in the second half of 2021 due to bottlenecks from the COVID-19 pandemic, then surged after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 caused natural gas prices to soar.\n\nConsumer prices in Britain are up around 20% over the past three years, squeezing living standards and contributing to the unpopularity of Sunak's Conservatives, who are around 20 points behind the opposition Labour Party in opinion polls.\n\nSunak said in a video clip that the drop in inflation since he took over from his Conservative predecessor Liz Truss - whose fiscal policy triggered a surge in government borrowing costs - was evidence that his economic policies were working.\n\n\"Let's not put all that progress at risk with Labour,\" he said.\n\nRachel Reeves, the Labour lawmaker who looks set to be Britain's next finance minister after the July 4 election, said the Conservatives would bring \"five more years of chaos\".\n\nNO EARLY RATE CUT\n\nThe BoE has said a return of inflation to its target is not enough on its own for it to start cutting interest rates.\n\n\"Rate-setters will still need to weigh the fall in headline inflation against signs that domestic price pressures, such as elevated pay growth, are proving slower to come down,\" Martin Sartorius, principal economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said.\n\nWhile most economists polled by Reuters think the central bank will start to cut rates from a 16-year high of 5.25% in August, financial markets think a first move is more likely in September or November and see less than a 10% chance of a cut this week.\n\nThe most recent fall in inflation was partly driven by a cut in regulated household energy bills in April - the effect of which will fade later in the year, when the BoE forecasts inflation will rise again.\n\nLower food prices were the biggest factor pushing down on inflation in May, reducing the annual rate of inflation for food and non-alcoholic drinks to 1.7% from a 45-year high of 19.2% in March 2023.\n\n(Reporting by David Milliken and Suban Abdulla; Editing by Kate Holton and Alexander Smith)", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

The last time inflation was at 2% was in July 2021 before prices started to shoot up, first as a result of supply chain issues during the coronavirus pandemic and then by Russia\u00b4s invasion of Ukraine, which pushed up energy costs.\n\nDespite the decline, few economists think the Bank of England will reduce its main interest rate from 5.25% on Thursday. Some policymakers are still concerned over the scale of price rises in the crucial services sector and the pace of wage increases, which raise the risks of an inflation rebound if interest rates are cut too soon. The consensus in financial markets is that rates will be cut in August.\n\nFILE - The Bank of England in London, is shown on Dec. 15, 2022.

(AP Photo/Alastair Grant, File)\n\n\"Despite this landmark fall in inflation, concerns over both underlying price pressures and changing policy in the run-up to a general election means a June interest rate cut is almost certainly off the table,\" said Suren Thiru, economics director at The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales\n\nThough the bank is independent from government, there's also a general expectation that policymakers will hold the line during an election campaign.\n\nThe Bank of England, like the U.S. Fed and other central banks, raised interest rates aggressively in late 2021 from near zero to counter the rapid increase in inflation, which hit a high above 11%.\n\nHigher interest rates - which cool the economy by making it more expensive to borrow - have helped ease inflation, but they\u00b4ve also weighed on the British economy, which has barely grown since the pandemic rebound.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

Nevertheless, the slower-paced increase in food prices will be welcomed by households.\n\n\"Underlying price pressures, which the rate-setters take most seriously, are continuing to abate more slowly given persistent strength in services inflation. Whilst the dip from April is encouraging, the fact that services companies are continuing to pass higher costs to customers may weigh on tomorrow's much-anticipated rate decision. \"\n\nInflation in the UK fell to the Bank of England's 2% target in May, for the first time since July 2021.\n\nThe 2% figure had been expected by economists.\n\nDespite inflation hitting its target, the Bank of England is unlikely to cut interest rates this week.\n\nCore inflation was 3.5%, also in line with expectations. Service-sector inflation was higher than expected, at 5.7%.\n\nThe FTSE 100 ticked up on Tuesday after overtaking France's top index as Europe's biggest stock market earlier this week.\n\nThe blue-chip index rose 49 points to 8,191 on Tuesday, a 0.6% rise, with Hargreaves Lansdown, SSE and Whitbread among the biggest risers.\n\nTuesday's gains came ahead of official figures on consumer price inflation (CPI) tomorrow morning, which is expected to fall back to the Government's target of 2%.\n\nHowever, experts do not predict it will be enough to persuade Bank of England policymakers to cut the base interest rate from 5.25% on Thursday.\n\nThe FTSE overtook France's CAC 40 on Monday as Europe's biggest index after political divisions resulted in billions of euros being wiped off Paris's top index in a matter of days.\n\nThe CAC 40 rebounded today to finish 0.73% up, while elsewhere in Europe, Germany's Dax moved upwards 0.31%.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Shortages of labour and materials, in an environment of high demand, were key in driving up inflation.\n\nComing out of this crisis, annual consumer price inflation in New Zealand, and most other countries, reached rates not seen since the inflation-targeting era began more than a generation ago.\n\nInflation in New Zealand has slowed significantly recently. But it remains higher than both pre-pandemic levels and the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC's) 1 to 3% target range.\n\nInflation spiked higher during the pandemic on a mix of supply and demand-related factors. Shortages of labour and materials, in an environment of high demand, were key in driving up inflation.\n\n\"Compared to other countries, tightness in the labour market, brought about by the border closure, played an important role in generating inflation in New Zealand,\" says Mr Conway in an online webinar from Wellington.\n\n\"Looking ahead, there are some remaining challenges in bringing inflation sustainably back to target, with some risks and uncertainties attached,\" says Mr Conway.\n\nOur recent research highlights that emerging spare capacity in the economy will feed through into lower domestically generated inflation.\n\n\"Lower inflation expectations of firms and households will help reinforce the slowdown in inflation, with less pressure to raise prices and demand higher wages. As inflation continues to fall, businesses will be less able to make large price increases, which will help lower inflation persistence.\n\nWe are using these research insights to help guide our monetary policymaking under flexible inflation targeting.\n\nThe extent to which broad momentum in domestic inflation continues is a key upside risk.\n\nThis is partially offset by the potential for a quicker fall in inflation expectations and a more rapid passthrough of weaker demand to prices. Overall, a period of restrictive policy is necessary to give us confidence that inflation will return to target over a reasonable timeframe,\" he says.\n\nRead the speech here: https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/-/media/project/sites/rbnz/files/events/2024/06/inflation-the-remaining-road-to-2-percent-inflation.pdf", "source": {"uri": "business.scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upside_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Upside risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Momentum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Gag_Gifts", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Gifts/Gag Gifts", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1509/scoop_placeholder.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

But the pace of decline has slowed in the most recent data, with inflation still some way above the midpoint of the 2-3 per cent target range. Over the year to April, the monthly CPI indicator rose by 3.6 per cent in headline terms, and by 4.1 per cent excluding volatile items and holiday travel, which was similar to its pace in December 2023.\n\nBroader data indicate continuing excess demand in the economy, coupled with elevated domestic cost pressures, for both labour and non-labour inputs. Conditions in the labour market eased further over the past month but remain tighter than is consistent with sustained full employment and inflation at target. Wages growth appears to have peaked but is still above the level that can be sustained given trend productivity growth. Recent data revisions suggest that consumption over the past year was stronger than previously suggested. At the same time, output growth has been subdued, and consumption per capita has been declining, as households restrain their discretionary expenditure and inflation weighs on real incomes.\n\nThe economic outlook remains uncertain and recent data have demonstrated that the process of returning inflation to target is unlikely to be smooth.\n\nThe central forecasts published in May were for inflation to return to the target range of 2-3 per cent in the second half of 2025 and to the midpoint in 2026. Since then, there have been indications that momentum in economic activity is weak, including slow growth in GDP, a rise in the unemployment rate and slower-than-expected wages growth. At the same time, the revisions to consumption and the saving rate and the persistence of inflation suggest that risks to the upside remain. Recent budget outcomes may also have an impact on demand, although federal and state energy rebates will temporarily reduce headline inflation. The persistence of services price inflation is a key uncertainty. Also, although growth in unit labour costs has eased, it remains high. Productivity growth needs to pick up in a sustained way if inflation is to continue to decline.\n\nThere is uncertainty around consumption growth. Real disposable incomes have now stabilised and are expected to grow later in the year, assisted by lower inflation and tax cuts. There has also been an increase in wealth, driven by housing prices. Together, these factors are expected to support growth in consumption over the coming year. But there is a risk that household consumption picks up more slowly than expected, resulting in continued subdued output growth and a noticeable deterioration in the labour market.\n\nMore broadly, there are uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of monetary policy and how firms' pricing decisions and wages will respond to the slower growth in the economy at a time of excess demand, and while conditions in the labour market remain tight.\n\nThere also remains a high level of uncertainty about the overseas outlook. Output growth in most advanced economies appears to have troughed. There has been improvement in the outlook for the Chinese and US economies, and many commodity prices have picked up. Some central banks have eased policy, although they remain alert to the risk of persistent inflation. Nevertheless, geopolitical uncertainties, including those related to the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, remain elevated, which may have implications for supply chains.\n\nReturning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe remains the Board's highest priority. This is consistent with the RBA's mandate for price stability and full employment. The Board needs to be confident that inflation is moving sustainably towards the target range. To date, medium-term inflation expectations have been consistent with the inflation target and it is important that this remains the case.\n\nInflation is easing but has been doing so more slowly than previously expected and it remains high. The Board expects that it will be some time yet before inflation is sustainably in the target range. While recent data have been mixed, they have reinforced the need to remain vigilant to upside risks to inflation. The path of interest rates that will best ensure that inflation returns to target in a reasonable timeframe remains uncertain and the Board is not ruling anything in or out. The Board will rely upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks. In doing so, it will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board remains resolute in its determination to return inflation to target and will do what is necessary to achieve that outcome.", "source": {"uri": "rba.gov.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reserve Bank of Australia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggregate_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aggregate demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_employment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Full employment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_and_discretionary_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disposable and discretionary income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumption (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Micromarketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Micromarketing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Airguns", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Guns/Airguns", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.rba.gov.au/media-releases/2024/images/monetary-policy-social.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

This decline, however, is unlikely to affect Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's fortunes or prompt a rate cut by the Bank of England.\n\nBritish inflation returned to its 2% target in May for the first time in nearly three years, official figures showed on Wednesday, as the economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine faded.\n\nThe fall in inflation will be welcomed by both Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the Bank of England - but likely has come too late either to turn around Sunak's fortunes at next month's election or to prompt a BoE rate cut on Thursday. The drop in annual consumer price inflation from April's 2.3% reading was in line with economists' median expectation in a Reuters poll and marks a sharp decline from the 41-year high of 11.1% reached in October 2022.\n\nThe fall has been sharper than in the euro zone or the United States, where consumer price inflation in May was 2.6% and 3.3% respectively, belying concerns a year ago that British inflation was proving unusually sticky. Even so, consumer prices are up around 20% over the past three years, squeezing living standards and contributing to the unpopularity of Sunak's Conservatives, who are around 20 points behind the opposition Labour Party in opinion polls.\n\nThe BoE has said a return of inflation to its target is not enough on its own for it to start cutting interest rates. While most economists polled by Reuters think it will start to cut interest rates from its 16-year high of 5.25% in August, financial markets think a first move is more likely in September or October - and see just a 10% chance of a cut this week.\n\nThe most recent fall in inflation was driven by a cut in regulated household energy bills in April - the effect of which will fade later in the year, when the BoE forecasts inflation will rise again.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Family_and_Consumer_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Family and Consumer Science", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/14_06_2024_10_52_49_2335122.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

But the pace of decline has slowed in the most recent data, with inflation still some way above the midpoint of the 2-3 per cent target range. Over the year to April, the monthly CPI indicator rose by 3.6 per cent in headline terms, and by 4.1 per cent excluding volatile items and holiday travel, which was similar to its pace in December 2023.\n\nBroader data indicate continuing excess demand in the economy, coupled with elevated domestic cost pressures, for both labour and non-labour inputs. Conditions in the labour market eased further over the past month but remain tighter than is consistent with sustained full employment and inflation at target. Wages growth appears to have peaked but is still above the level that can be sustained given trend productivity growth. Recent data revisions suggest that consumption over the past year was stronger than previously suggested. At the same time, output growth has been subdued, and consumption per capita has been declining, as households restrain their discretionary expenditure and inflation weighs on real incomes.\n\nThe outlook remains highly uncertain.\n\nThe economic outlook remains uncertain and recent data have demonstrated that the process of returning inflation to target is unlikely to be smooth.\n\nThe central forecasts published in May were for inflation to return to the target range of 2-3 per cent in the second half of 2025 and to the midpoint in 2026. Since then, there have been indications that momentum in economic activity is weak, including slow growth in GDP, a rise in the unemployment rate and slower-than-expected wages growth. At the same time, the revisions to consumption and the saving rate and the persistence of inflation suggest that risks to the upside remain. Recent budget outcomes may also have an impact on demand, although federal and state energy rebates will temporarily reduce headline inflation. The persistence of services price inflation is a key uncertainty. Also, although growth in unit labour costs has eased, it remains high. Productivity growth needs to pick up in a sustained way if inflation is to continue to decline.\n\nThere is uncertainty around consumption growth. Real disposable incomes have now stabilised and are expected to grow later in the year, assisted by lower inflation and tax cuts. There has also been an increase in wealth, driven by housing prices. Together, these factors are expected to support growth in consumption over the coming year. But there is a risk that household consumption picks up more slowly than expected, resulting in continued subdued output growth and a noticeable deterioration in the labour market.\n\nMore broadly, there are uncertainties regarding the lags in the effect of monetary policy and how firms' pricing decisions and wages will respond to the slower growth in the economy at a time of excess demand, and while conditions in the labour market remain tight.\n\nThere also remains a high level of uncertainty about the overseas outlook. Output growth in most advanced economies appears to have troughed. There has been improvement in the outlook for the Chinese and US economies, and many commodity prices have picked up. Some central banks have eased policy, although they remain alert to the risk of persistent inflation. Nevertheless, geopolitical uncertainties, including those related to the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, remain elevated, which may have implications for supply chains.\n\nReturning inflation to target is the priority.\n\nReturning inflation to target within a reasonable timeframe remains the Board's highest priority. This is consistent with the RBA's mandate for price stability and full employment. The Board needs to be confident that inflation is moving sustainably towards the target range. To date, medium-term inflation expectations have been consistent with the inflation target and it is important that this remains the case.\n\nInflation is easing but has been doing so more slowly than previously expected and it remains high. The Board expects that it will be some time yet before inflation is sustainably in the target range. While recent data have been mixed, they have reinforced the need to remain vigilant to upside risks to inflation. The path of interest rates that will best ensure that inflation returns to target in a reasonable timeframe remains uncertain and the Board is not ruling anything in or out. The Board will rely upon the data and the evolving assessment of risks. In doing so, it will continue to pay close attention to developments in the global economy, trends in domestic demand, and the outlook for inflation and the labour market. The Board remains resolute in its determination to return inflation to target and will do what is necessary to achieve that outcome.\n\n/Public Release.

and see just a 10 per cent chance of a cut this week.\n\nThe most recent fall in inflation was driven by a cut in regulated household energy bills in April - the effect of which will fade later in the year, when the BoE forecasts inflation will rise again.", "source": {"uri": "perthnow.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Perth Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://images.perthnow.com.au/publication/C-15074885/83d137144dec17b8649c88f46f1af24cb7f7d732-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Breakfast cereals, potato crisps and bars of chocolate have become cheaper.\n\nThe main downward effects on the inflation rate came from bread and cereals, vegetables, and sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery. In each case, prices fell between April and May this year, compared with a monthly rise a year ago.\n\nThe resulting annual rates were the lowest since October 2021 for the first two categories and since June 2022 for sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery, the statistics office said.\n\nAnnual rates eased in nine of the 11 food and soft drink categories, with the exception of oils and fats, and milk, cheese and eggs.\n\nShare\n\nRachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said:\n\nAfter 14 years of economic chaos under the Conservatives, working people are worse off. Prices have risen in the shops, mortgage bills are higher and taxes are at a 70-year high.\n\nLabour has a plan to make people better off bringing stability back to our economy, unlocking investment and delivering reform. All the Conservatives are offering is a desperate wish list of unfunded spending promises that will mean \u00a34,800 more on people's mortgages.\n\nThe choice at the election is simple: stability with Labour that will make Britain better off or five more years of chaos with the Conservatives that will mean higher mortgages.\n\nShare\n\nTUC general secretary Paul Nowak said:\n\nOver the last three years UK families have suffered the highest prices rises in the G7 - with inflation going up more over that period than it usually does over an entire decade.\n\nMinisters can try to rewrite history all they like. But the Conservatives have presided over the worst period for living standards in modern times.\n\nFood and energy bills have surged. Rents and mortgages have skyrocketed. And real wages are still worth less than in 2008.\n\nWorking people have paid the price for this government's failure with household debt also increasing at record levels. We can't go on like this. We need a government that will make work pay.\n\nShare\n\nJake Finney, economist at PwC UK, said today marks a \"decisive moment in the fight against inflation,\" as it is the first time CPI inflation has returned to the Bank of England's 2% target in almost three years.\n\nThis is the longest period that inflation has exceeded the 2% target since the early 2010s, when it took four years to return to target. However, during that period inflation only peaked at 5.2%, compared to a peak of 11.1% in October 2022.\n\nConsumer prices have risen by 20% since inflation was last at target. In the three years prior to this inflation episode, prices had risen by just 5%. That means the cumulative increase in prices has been roughly four-times faster than in more normal times. The one saving grace for households is that nominal earnings have increased by 18% over the same period, preventing a sharper decline in living standards.\n\nHowever, it is not 'job done' yet. If prices continue to rise at the same month-on-month rate as they did this month (0.3%), then headline inflation will be back over the 2% target next month (at 2.1%). This is because underlying momentum remains above levels that are consistent with the 2% target, particularly with regards to services inflation.\"\n\nShare\n\nHere is some instant reaction.\n\nLuke Bartholomew, deputy chief economist at the asset manager abrdn, said:\n\nThe fall of headline inflation back to target was expected, but will still come as extremely welcome news to the Bank of England. The big question now is whether underlying inflation pressures in the economy are consistent with inflation staying around 2% in the medium term, or whether inflation will start to edge higher again once favourable base effects fade.\n\nOn that front, there is still evidence of residual stickiness in services inflation, reflecting the strength of wage growth recently. That is why an interest rate cut tomorrow is still very unlikely. But we think the Bank's communication tomorrow will set out a path for a cut in August, which is now looking increasingly likely.\n\nShare Food price rises ease to lowest rate since 2021\n\nIt is the first time inflation has met the Bank of England's 2% target since July 2021.\n\nThis is mainly because food price rises have eased. Prices of food and soft drinks rose by 1.7% in the year to May, down from 2.9% in April, and the lowest rate since October 2021.\n\nFood price inflation has eased for 14 months from a peak of 19.2% in March last year, the highest annual rate seen for more than 45 years.\n\nHere is our full story:\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 08.23 CEST\n\nUK inflation slows to official target of 2% for first time since 2021\n\nInflation in the UK has fallen to an annual rate of 2% in May, as expected.\n\nIt's down from 2.3% in April, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nCore inflation which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, as they tend to be volatile, has slowed to 3.5% from 3.9%, also as expected.\n\nThe largest downward effects came from food and soft drinks, recreation and culture, and furniture and household goods. Transport, namely fuel, provided the largest, partially offsetting, upward contribution.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 08.24 CEST\n\nUnsecured household debt to rise by \u00a31,660 this year\n\nUnsecured household debt is set to rise by more than \u00a31,600 this year as families continue to struggle with the cost of living crisis, according to new TUC analysis.\n\nUnsecured debt (loans, credit cards, purchase hire agreements) is on course to increase by 9.4% in real terms (adjusted for inflation), on average, per household this year. Over a quarter of people say they have taken out loans or borrowed on credit cards to cover unexpected bills since the start of the year.\n\nThe TUC says that this is the largest annual rise - in cash terms - since records began in 1987. The union body says the findings make a mockery of government claims that \"their plan is working\".\n\nThe analysis excludes student loans.\n\nSeparate TUC polling, carried out by YouGov, shows that millions are continuing to struggle with the cost of living:\n\n4 in 10 (42%) say they've cut back on essentials like food and utility spending this year. And this number rises to nearly 1 in 2 (47%) for women.\n\n6 in 10 (60%) say they have cut back on non-essential spending like dining out and entertainment since the beginning of the year.\n\nNearly a fifth (19%) of respondents say they have fallen behind on household bills this year - a number that rises to over 1 in 4 (28%) for people aged 18-24.\n\nOver quarter (27%) say have they taken out debt (loans, credit) to cover unexpected bills since the start of the year. This number shoots up to over a third (37%) for adults aged 25-49 - when lots of families raise children.\n\nUK workers are on course for nearly two decades of lost living standards, with real wages not forecast to recover to their 2008 level until 2026.\n\nThe TUC estimates that the average worker would be \u00a314,700 better off if their pay had grown at the same pace as pre-financial crisis real wage growth trends since 2008.\n\nIts general secretary Paul Nowak said:\n\nThese findings show out of touch this Conservative government is with people's struggles. While the Tories boast about their plan working, households across Britain are being pushed further into debt.\n\nNo one should have to rely on credit cards and loans to make ends meet. But after 14 years of flatlining wages - and the worst cost of living crisis in generations - many families are at breaking point.\n\nThe Tories economic record speaks for itself. Pay packets are still worth less today than in 2008 with working people on course to end this parliament poorer than at the start.\n\nShare\n\nUpdated at 08.24 CEST\n\nIntroduction: UK inflation expected to fall back to official 2% target\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.\n\nIt's UK inflation day!\n\nIn just a few minutes, we will find out whether inflation across the country has continued to slow, to the official target of 2%.\n\nEconomists are predicting that the headline annual rate fell to 2% in May from 2.3% in April, partly because of lower energy prices. That was the lowest rate in almost three years, although the decline was smaller than expected, and dashed hopes of an early interest rate cut.\n\nThe Bank of England is mandated by the government to keep consumer price inflation at an annual rate of 2%. The figures are released at 7am BST by the Office for National Statistics.\n\nCore inflation which excludes food, energy, alcohol and tobacco, as they tend to be volatile, is forecast to have fallen to 3.5% from 3.9%. The central bank will keep a close eye on the services inflation number, which remained at 5.9% in April.\n\nInvestec economist Sandra Horsfield said:\n\nUK inflation has certainly come a long way since the monetary policy committee (MPC) last hiked rates in August: the latest consumer price index (CPI) outturn the MPC faced at that time was for June 2023, when headline inflation was 7.9% year-on-year and core inflation 6.9%. By April 2024, the corresponding rates reached 2.3% and 3.9%, respectively.\n\nWe see a number of factors as likely to have pulled down inflation. One is that goods price inflation remains on a downward trend: lower energy prices are still gradually filtering through supply chains, and import prices are falling as China leans on manufacturing exports as an engine of growth. On the services side, wages continue to add to firms' costs; but even there, the trend in wage growth is downwards, if only moderately. This should have added up to a lower rate of 'core' inflation.\n\nWe will also get producer price figures, which measure factory gate inflation - this eventually feeds into consumer price rises.\n\nThe Agenda\n\nShare\n\nREAD SOURCE", "source": {"uri": "businesstelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_cereal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Breakfast cereal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trades_Union_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trades Union Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confectionery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Confectionery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Potato chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chocolate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sugar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Household debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Soft drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wages", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real wages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egg as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Nowak_(trade_unionist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Nowak (trade unionist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouGov", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "YouGov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.businesstelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/UK-inflation-falls-back-to-official-2-target-as-food.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

But it remains higher than both pre-pandemic levels and the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC's) 1 to 3% target range.\n\nInflation spiked higher during the pandemic on a mix of supply and demand-related factors. Shortages of labour and materials, in an environment of high demand, were key in driving up inflation.\n\n\"Compared to other countries, tightness in the labour market, brought about by the border closure, played an important role in generating inflation in New Zealand,\" says Mr Conway in an online webinar from Wellington.\n\n\"Looking ahead, there are some remaining challenges in bringing inflation sustainably back to target, with some risks and uncertainties attached,\" says Mr Conway.\n\nOur recent research highlights that emerging spare capacity in the economy will feed through into lower domestically generated inflation.\n\n\"Lower inflation expectations of firms and households will help reinforce the slowdown in inflation, with less pressure to raise prices and demand higher wages. As inflation continues to fall, businesses will be less able to make large price increases, which will help lower inflation persistence.\n\nWe are using these research insights to help guide our monetary policymaking under flexible inflation targeting.\n\nThe extent to which broad momentum in domestic inflation continues is a key upside risk.\n\nThis is partially offset by the potential for a quicker fall in inflation expectations and a more rapid passthrough of weaker demand to prices.

But while it's eased back, prices are still rising, just at a slower pace.\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the biggest downward contribution came from falling food prices, while the largest upward pull came from fuel prices.\n\nIt noted: \"The easing in the annual inflation rates in May 2024 reflected downward contributions from eight divisions, partially offset by upward contributions from two. The largest downward effects came from food and non-alcoholic beverages, recreation and culture, and furniture and household goods. Transport provided the largest, partially offsetting, upward contribution.\"\n\nThe ONS listed bread and cereals, vegetables, sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery as having notable price cuts.\n\nMeanwhile, core inflation, which excludes the more volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices, rose by 3.5% in the 12 months to May, down from the 3.9% in April.\n\nWhile this is a landmark day, many experts and commentators said it's not a time to celebrate just yet.\n\nShaun Port, managing director for savings at Chase UK, said: \"Services inflation remains high, so core CPI is falling more slowly than the headline rate of inflation, and inflation may actually rise again later this year - so the path ahead is not straightforward and consumers will still feel their household finances being squeezed, regardless of any positive headlines in the short term.\"\n\nThis is echoed by Lily Megson, policy director at My Pension Expert, who said: \"The government must recognise that today's figures do not signal the end of people's fight for financial security. Pension poverty, for example, is on the rise. The cost-of-living crisis has made it incredibly challenging for individuals to contribute to their pension pots, leading many towards a difficult, delayed or unattainable retirement.\n\n\"The next government will have its work cut out. With inflation back at manageable levels, now is the time to help people get back on the path to recovery. Prioritising financial education and ensuring accessible advice for all will be essential. This approach will not only empower people to take control of their financial futures, but also ensures that everyone benefits from any economic recovery over the coming months.\"\n\nTurning to mortgages, Ben Thompson, deputy CEO at Mortgage Advice Bureau, said: \"May's inflation drop, in other circumstances, may have prompted some positive movements in the mortgage market. But, with rate cuts largely priced in, the Fed dragging its heels and a general election in a matter of days, the Bank of England will be reluctant to make any waves.\n\n\"This doesn't mean it's a time to sit still for those aiming to get on the property ladder or with mortgage deals due to expire. Mortgage rates are unlikely to drop really significantly when the Bank of England does cut rates, so now is the time to get on the front foot, speak to a broker and get mortgage ready. There are competitive deals on the market to be taken advantage of.\"\n\nDean Butler, managing director for retail direct at Standard Life, said: \"The US and the Eurozone are still sat above target, making the UK a positive outlier and adding to speculation that the Bank of England could move to cut interest rates later in the year. All in all, now seems a good time to take stock and consider how the changing economic environment could influence your finances and approach to saving.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Andy Mielczarek, founder and CEO of SmartSave, said: \"Now more than ever, people must be proactive. With inflation at a three-year low, there is a golden opportunity for savers to lock down the best long-term savings opportunities while they last. No matter the outcome of tomorrow's Bank of England meeting, there are clear indications that it won't be long until interest rates follow inflation in its downward trend.\"\n\nJames McManus, chief investment officer at digital wealth manager Nutmeg, said: \"Anyone hoping today's data will encourage the Bank of England to go ahead with the first cut to interest rates tomorrow could well be disappointed. Core inflation is still running higher at 3.5%, services inflation at 5.7% and wage growth is around 6% year-on-year. Central bankers have given signals that they want to cut rates, and they are aware of the pressures higher borrowing costs are putting on households, but expectation is the first rate cut won't be until later in the year.\"", "source": {"uri": "mortgagesolutions.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mortgage Solutions"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paloma_kubiak@mortgagesolutions.co.uk", "name": "Paloma Kubiak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Office for National Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Syrup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confectionery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confectionery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Furniture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chocolate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bread"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fruit preserves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sugar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cereal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Life_Aberdeen", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard Life Aberdeen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eurozone"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Mortgages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Mortgages", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Information_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Information Services", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mortgagesolutions.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2024/06/payment-holiday-764x399.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

I know that...taking the action wasn't always easy, but we've got there and inflation is back to target.\n\n\"It's because of that economic stability that we've restored, which was my priority when I got this job, that we've now been able to start cutting people's taxes and if I win this election, I want to keep doing more of that.\"\n\nShadow chancellor Rachel Reeves welcomed the fall in inflation but stressed that the cost-of-living crisis is not over.\n\n\"While inflation is down, of course, those higher prices still remain,\" she told BBC radio.\n\n\"Whether that's the cost of the weekly food shop, the cost of the energy bills, or indeed people who are looking to re-mortgage this year or have seen their rents increase.\"\n\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Sarah Olney said: \"It is sheer desperation from the Conservatives to claim their plan for the economy is working, when they have presided over the worst cost of living crisis in a generation.\"\n\nCPI inflation was last at two per cent in July 2021 but rose rapidly after that to peak at a 41-year high of 11.1 per cent in October 2022 before slowly easing.\n\nThe Bank was forced to hike interest rates to a 16 year high of 5.25 per cent by August last year, a level they have stayed at ever since.\n\nHitting the two per cent target is still unlikely to persuade the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee to vote for a rate cut at its meeting on Thursday.\n\nThe City was also unsettled by a smaller than expected fall in services inflation, which only went down from 5.9 per cent to 5.7 per cent.\n\nAs a result an August cut in interest rates is seen as slightly less likely than before with the markets now rating the chances at only about 35%.\n\nThe long spike in inflation ushered in a cost of prolonged living crisis that has seen living standards tumble and had a devastating impact on Rishi Sunak's poll ratings.\n\nAnalysts Kantar said yesterday that supermarket inflation has fallen back to 2.1 per cent, the lowest since June 2022.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nicholas_cecil@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Nicholas

The drop from 2.3% in April may be small, but it's the first time since July 2021 that it's been this low.\n\nThis month's tumble in the figure, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), also means inflation has hit the target rate set by the Bank of England. It's important to remember, however, that the decrease doesn't mean prices are going down; it just means they're rising at a slower rate than before.\n\nHere, Which? explains why the inflation rate has eased, and which savings accounts and cash Isas can now help you beat it. We also share our advice for keeping costs down.\n\nWhy has inflation fallen?\n\nThe annual rate of inflation has dropped to its lowest level in almost three years, after hitting a peak of 11.1% in October 2022 - the highest it's been in over 40 years.\n\nOne of the main drivers behind this month's easing of inflation was a slowing of price rises for food and non-alcoholic beverages. ONS data shows the cost of these goods rose by 1.7% in the year to May 2024, down from an annual increase of 2.9% in April.\n\nMay's food inflation figure is the lowest year-on-year rate since October 2021 and it's the 14th consecutive month that it has dropped. Around this time last year, it was a very different story, with food inflation soaring. It rocketed to a 45-year high of 19.2% in March 2023.\n\nA monthly fall in the price of bread and cereals, vegetables, and sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery had the biggest downward effect on the latest food inflation figure.\n\nONS data shows there were also significant falls in the price of recreational and cultural goods and services, as well as furniture and household goods. But the price of filling up your car at the pump rose slightly, with petrol costing around \u00a31.49 per litre in May 2024, up from \u00a31.44 per litre in May 2023.\n\nThe graph shows how inflation has changed since August 2020:\n\nThe Bank of England's target is to keep inflation as close to 2% as it can, and after almost three years that target has been met.\n\nInflation hasn't been this low since July 2021 but before that it was even lower - hitting a rock-bottom figure of 0.2% in August 2020 due to the impact of the pandemic.\n\nHow many savings deals beat CPI inflation?\n\nSavers looking for an inflation-busting deal are now spoilt for choice, with the latest Moneyfacts data showing 1,622 products now offer rates higher than 2%. That's up from 1,558 last month and includes easy-access, notice accounts, variable-rate deals, fixed-rate bonds and Isas.\n\nThis table shows the top rates for fixed-term and instant-access cash Isas and savings accounts, ordered by term.\n\nIf we look back to June 2023, when the CPI measure stood at 8.7%, there were no deals that could beat inflation. Now all the top interest deals listed in our table are more than double the current rate at which prices are increasing. The best deals currently on the market are offered by smaller, challenger banks, with the highest rates on short-term fixed bonds or instant-access accounts.\n\nIt's important to choose an account with a rate higher than the current CPI figure because if interest isn't at the same rate of inflation or more, your nest egg will effectively lose value over time.\n\nTaking a closer look at the market, we can see rates on one-year fixed accounts in particular have seen a slight uptick recently. Moneyfacts data shows the average interest on these accounts rose to 4.59% AER, breaking seven months of back-to-back cuts, rising for the first time since October 2023.\n\nBut savers whose one-year bonds are now maturing may be disappointed to find the rate for this type of account no longer beats that of June 2023. However, those who locked into a two-year term back in 2022 will find that the current top rates pay over 2 percentage points more interest. If you fixed for even longer then you will be able to get significantly higher rates if they decide to fix again.\n\nIf you choose to open a variable rate account, such as an instant access, you'll be rewarded with a generous 5.2% AER. But remember, if the Bank of England decides to cut the base rate on Thursday 20 June, we may see rates on these types of accounts go down with it.\n\nHow to cut costs when prices are still high\n\nMay saw the cost of petrol rise again. Our guide on how to save fuel and other money-saving driving tips can help you keep those costs down - from tips on how often you need to fill up to where to go when you do.\n\nAnd while inflation on food may be easing, the price of many goods is still high.

At the time, Bank of England Governor, Andrew Bailey said: \"We need to see more evidence that inflation will stay low before we can cut interest rates. I'm optimistic that things are moving in the right direction.\"\n\nPaula Bejarano Carbo, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: \"Given that today's data indicates that core inflation remains elevated, this rebound might be sharper than projected. As a result, we expect the MPC to exert caution at its upcoming meeting and hold interest rates, despite today's encouraging fall in the headline rate.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk",

But it remains higher than both pre-pandemic levels and the Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC's) 1 to 3% target range.\n\nInflation spiked higher during the pandemic on a mix of supply and demand-related factors. Shortages of labour and materials, in an environment of high demand, were key in driving up inflation.\n\n\"Compared to other countries, tightness in the labour market, brought about by the border closure, played an important role in generating inflation in New Zealand,\" says Mr Conway in an online webinar from Wellington.\n\n\"Looking ahead, there are some remaining challenges in bringing inflation sustainably back to target, with some risks and uncertainties attached,\" says Mr Conway.\n\nOur recent research highlights that emerging spare capacity in the economy will feed through into lower domestically generated inflation.\n\n\"Lower inflation expectations of firms and households will help reinforce the slowdown in inflation, with less pressure to raise prices and demand higher wages. As inflation continues to fall, businesses will be less able to make large price increases, which will help lower inflation persistence.\n\nWe are using these research insights to help guide our monetary policymaking under flexible inflation targeting.\n\nThe extent to which broad momentum in domestic inflation continues is a key upside risk.\n\nThis is partially offset by the potential for a quicker fall in inflation expectations and a more rapid passthrough of weaker demand to prices.

brokers Pepperstone, but added the BoE was likely to wait until August before cutting rates.\n\nThe drop in annual consumer price inflation from April's 2.3 per cent reading - in line with economists' expectations - took it to its lowest since July 2021 and marks a sharp decline from the 41-year high of 11.1 per cent in October 2022.\n\nThe fall has been sharper than in the eurozone or the United States, where consumer price inflation in May was 2.6 per cent and 3.3 per cent, respectively, belying concerns a year ago that British inflation was proving unusually sticky.\n\nInflation began to pick up in most Western economies in the second half of 2021 due to bottlenecks from the COVID-19 pandemic, then surged after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 caused natural gas prices to soar.\n\nConsumer prices in Britain are up around 20 per cent over the past three years, squeezing living standards and contributing to the unpopularity of Mr Sunak's Conservatives, who are around 20 points behind the opposition Labour Party in opinion polls.\n\nMr Sunak said in a video clip that the drop in inflation since he took over from his Conservative predecessor Liz Truss - whose fiscal policy triggered a surge in government borrowing costs - was evidence his economic policies were working.\n\n\"Let's not put all that progress at risk with Labour,\" he said.\n\nRachel Reeves, the Labour lawmaker who looks set to be Britain's next finance minister after the July 4 election, said the Conservatives would bring \"five more years of chaos\".\n\nThe BoE has said a return of inflation to its target is not enough on its own for it to start cutting interest rates.\n\n\"Rate-setters will still need to weigh the fall in headline inflation against signs that domestic price pressures, such as elevated pay growth, are proving slower to come down,\" Martin Sartorius, principal economist at the Confederation of British Industry, said.\n\nWhile most economists polled by Reuters think the central bank will start to cut rates from a 16-year high of 5.25 per cent in August, financial markets think a first move is more likely in September or November and see less than a 10 per cent chance of a cut this week.\n\nThe most recent fall in inflation was partly driven by a cut in regulated household energy bills in April - the effect of which will fade later in the year, when the BoE forecasts inflation will rise again.\n\nLower food prices were the biggest factor pushing down on inflation in May, reducing the annual rate of inflation for food and non-alcoholic drinks

Looking at the movement, the May 2024 headline inflation rate showed an increase of 0.26% points when compared to the April 2024 headline inflation rate.\n\n\"On a year-on-year basis, the headline inflation rate was 11.54% points higher compared to the rate recorded in May 2023, which was 22.41%. This shows that the headline inflation rate (year-on-year basis) increased in the month of May 2024 when compared to the same month in the preceding year (i.e., May 2023).\n\n\"On the contrary, on a month-on-month basis, the headline inflation, rate in May 2024 was 2.14%, which was 0.15% lower than the rate recorded in April 2024 (2.29%). This means that in the month of May 2024, the rate of increase in the average price level is less than the rate of increase in the average price level in April 2024.\"\n\nIn response to the alarming surge in the inflation rate, several analysts across the country, have called on the government to boost Foreign Exchange (FX) supply and address the rising cost of petroleum products as well as improve fiscal discipline. They argue that with the current lending rate by banks at 35 percent due to the high Monetary Policy Rate (MPR), consumers are at the receiving end.\n\nAlso speaking on the surging inflation rate, Managing Director/Chief Executive, Dignity Finance and Investment Limited, Dr. Chijioke Ekechukwu, said none of the drivers of inflation had been abated, adding that the continuous increase of MPR was beginning to impact the inflation rate negatively as every business depends on bank credit to survive.\n\n\"If the interest rate rises as high as 35 percent currently due to very high MPR, the ultimate victims will be consumers through high prices of goods and services. Multinational companies are closing down their operations in Nigeria, their product offerings Will become expensive in the marketplace. FX scarcity continues to be a bane in the fight to control Inflation,\" he added.\n\nAs Nigeria grapples with soaring inflation, the call for increased FX liquidity and comprehensive economic reforms becomes ever more pressing.

Services inflation remains around six per cent, more than twice the level that is consistent with the two per cent inflation target.\n\nSimilarly, the latest labour market figures, released last week, showed that in the private sector was running at 5.8 per cent.\n\nThese two measures are crucial for understanding the underlying inflationary dynamics in the economy. With both measures coming in slightly ahead of expectations, policymakers are unlikely to be confident enough to cut interest rates this week.\n\nOn top of this, most economists think it is very unlikely that the Bank of England would be willing to start cutting interest rates in the middle of an election campaign.\n\nAny decision to cut rates just weeks before polling day could have dragged the Bank into the political debate. Members of the MPC have also had to cancel their public speeches during the election campaign, making it much more difficult for them to explain their approach to policy-making.\n\nAll of this leaves the Bank in a holding position. Policymakers know that the next move will be a rate cut but do not know exactly when it will come.\n\nMost economists did not expect any more guidance beyond what was provided in May. Analysts at Barclays said there would be \"little to no change in guidance from the MPC this month.\"\n\nAlthough interest rates will remain at 5.25 per cent, some commentators still expect the Bank to be able to cut them in August.\n\nA lot depends on May's inflation data, released just a day before the Bank's meeting. Economists widely expect the headline rate to return to two per cent for the first time since July 2021. Services inflation is also expected to fall to around 5.5 per cent.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) cut interest rates for the first time in five years earlier this month but the Fed opted to hold again, pointing to only \"modest\" progress on inflation.", "source": {"uri": "cityam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityAM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_dorrell@cityam.com", "name": "Chris Dorrell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Economics", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barclays", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barclays"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/GettyImages-1489102803.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

At one point, in October 2022, inflation reached 11.1% against a backdrop of soaring energy prices caused by the war in Ukraine. The 2% figure is the lowest since July 2021.\n\nThe fall in inflation is likely to bring about a cut in interest rates, currently stuck at 5.25%, over the summer.\n\nKris Hamer, director of insight at the British Retail Consortium, said: \"The country will breathe a sigh of relief as inflation hits the Bank of England's target of 2% for the first time in almost three years, raising hopes of an interest rate cut for the 9.6 million mortgage holders across the UK.

However, policies implemented in the early 2000s largely resolved this issue. For about a decade, the global and local economies seemed to be on track. However, the global inflation wave following the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted all economies. Monetary and fiscal policies aimed at reducing inflation added an extra financial burden to the middle and lower-income groups. As a result, the purchasing power of those on fixed incomes decreased, and minimum-wage workers and retirees suddenly found themselves among the impoverished. On the other hand, while some individuals with movable and immovable assets were protected from the crushing effects of inflation, land and property owners saw incredible wealth gains.\n\nAccording to the report, the prolonged implementation of domestic expansionary policies after the 2008 global financial crisis created an economy reliant on borrowing for growth. After 2013, productivity in the economy began to decline, and short-term approaches and demand shocks were used to support growth. From 2017 onwards, inflation rose to double digits, and both price stability and budget discipline began to deteriorate. The report indicates that these structural problems remain unresolved. Rising commodity prices have increased corporate profitability, but also driven up costs, spreading price pressures across sub-sectors and creating temporary monopolies that further pushed prices up. During this period, real wages eroded, and efforts to compensate for wage declines were criticized for potentially causing further inflation. The increase in corporate profitability significantly contributed to inflation. In 2023, corporate tax revenue based on declarations increased by 2000% compared to the previous year, while income tax collected at source only rose by 94.3%. Considering the annual inflation rate of 64.77% reported by T\u00dc\u0130K, the report notes that there was no significant increase in income tax collected at source.\n\nThe report highlights that inflation inertia has become a significant source of inflation. The inability to break high inflation expectations and the continuous indexing of pricing behaviors to past inflation contribute to inflation inertia. Additionally, the high inflation since 2021 has distorted consumer price perceptions, providing pricing firms with opportunities to increase profits. Profit margins rising above costs have exacerbated the negative impact of pricing behaviors on inflation. Approximately 15% of annual inflation is attributed to distortions in pricing behaviors.\n\n**\n\nThe report also emphasizes that inflation has eroded societal morals. In economic life, sellers of all sizes, from small market vendors to high-level executives, no longer content themselves with fair earnings, seeking instead to protect their income levels or achieve high profits.

Chris Dorrell explains that while all signs are pointing towards a cut in just under two months, the outcome is far from certain\n\nFor a number of months now, economists have been expecting the Bank of England to start cutting interest rates over the summer, whether that be June or August.\n\nAt the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)'s last meeting in May, Andrew Bailey set the stage for a summer interest rate cut. \"A change in Bank Rate in June is neither ruled out nor a fait accompli,\" he said.\n\nBut that was before Rishi Sunak called the election. A June rate cut has essentially been ruled out by Sunak's surprise announcement. Without an absolutely watertight case for cuts, the Bank of England would be sailing close to the wind by starting to ease policy just a few weeks before polling day.\n\nThe election also provides more substantive reasons to avoid cutting rates. MPC members have had to cancel their speeches given the ongoing campaign, which makes it difficult for rate-setters to prepare the ground for a potential rate cut or explain the decision after.\n\nWhen the rate cut eventually comes, it'll be the first since early 2020. Its important to explain the thinking for the decision and provide some guidance on what the next moves are likely to be. So it makes a lot of sense to wait longer in purely practical terms, but its also true that the data since May has not played ball.\n\nSince the last MPC meeting, two rounds of labour market updates have been released as well as April's inflation figures. The figures reveal worryingly high levels of inflationary persistence.\n\nAnnual wage growth is still running around six per cent, more than twice the level which is consistent with inflation remaining at the two per cent target. Likewise, services inflation is still around six per cent.\n\nThe two are closely connected because labour costs are the most important driver of prices in the services sector. The Bank was expecting to have seen much more progress on prices in the services sector by now.\n\nIn other words, even without the election, there are good reasons why the Bank might be unwilling to cut rates in June. Indeed, markets are increasingly nervy about an August cut with traders putting the odds at just 50/50.\n\nMay's inflation data will be released on Wednesday, just a day before the Bank's rate decision. Most economists expect inflation will fall back to the two per cent target for the first time since July 2021.\n\nThe figures will be crucial for determining whether the Bank is on track to cut rates in August, but the early indicators are positive.\n\nA closely watched business survey showed that cost pressures were easing quickly in the services sector, raising hopes that April's surprisingly strong reading was just a flash in the pan.\n\nThe survey, conducted by S&P in May, showed that the rate of input cost inflation faced by UK services companies increased at its slowest pace since February 2021. This helped output price inflation ease to its weakest level in over three years.\n\nThere has also been further good news, at least on wages. CFOs surveyed by the Bank of England in May expect wages to grow 4.1 per cent over the next year. This is the lowest level of expected wage growth since the Bank first started asking the question back in May 2022.\n\nThe Bank cannot cut rates on the basis of a few encouraging surveys, but the surveys do at least suggest that things are moving in the right direction. When the August rate decision comes around, there's reason enough to think that the Bank of England will finally be able to start cutting interest rates.", "source": {"uri": "cityam.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CityAM"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_dorrell@cityam.com", "name": "Chris Dorrell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(banker)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.cityam.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2.71500668-e1713450970627.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

This change is thanks to easing post-pandemic disruptions and stabilizing global markets after the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, despite this positive economic signal, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and the Bank of England remain cautious. The BoE, which maintains interest rates at a 16-year high of 5.25%, doesn't consider the inflation drop sufficient to cut rates immediately. Economists suggest rate cuts might start in August 2024, while markets predict a move in September or October. This conservative approach comes amid the Conservative Party's popularity struggles, trailing Labour by 20 points in polls.\n\nWhile the BoE holds off on immediate rate cuts, the UK's inflation rate reduction to 2% is a notable divergence from the euro zone and the US, where inflation rates are 2.6% and 3.3%, respectively. This should be a cautiously optimistic signal for investors, suggesting a potentially stabilizing environment for British businesses. However, the BoE's prediction that inflation might rise again as the impact of lower household energy bills diminishes adds a layer of uncertainty.\n\nThe bigger picture: Global economic shifts on the horizon.\n\nThe UK's stronger-than-expected inflation reduction contrasts with other major economies, challenging previous expectations of persistently high British inflation. Yet, this doesn't necessarily indicate a smooth recovery. Consumer prices have risen about 20% over the past three years, squeezing living standards and weighing heavily on the Conservative Party's reputation.

On a monthly basis, core inflation increased by 0.5%, slowing from 0.8% in April.\n\nServices inflation recorded a 5.7% year-over-year rise and a 0.6% month-over-month increase, slightly down from the previous 5.9% and 0.8% respectively, but overall a little higher than expected.\n\nSimultaneously, the Office for National Statistics reported a 1.7% year-over-year increase in annual producer prices in May 2024, marking the highest rate in a year.\n\nThe May inflation report for the UK presented a mixed picture and has not triggered significant market reactions suggesting a higher likelihood of a Bank of England rate cut.\n\nThe British pound experienced a slight uptick following the release, rising to 1.2720 against the US dollar, while the euro softened slightly to 0.8440 against sterling.\n\nGilt yields remained broadly unchanged, with the 2-year gilt at a 4.16% yield and the 10-year gilt at a 4.04% yield, respectively.\n\nThe Bank of England is expected to keep the Bank Rate unchanged on Thursday, likely with a 7-2 vote split, and maintain consistent guidance.\n\nCurrently, markets are pricing in a negligible chance of any policy action in June, with expectations of a 10 basis point cut by August, 18 basis points cumulatively by September, 31 basis points by November, and 41 basis points by year-end.\n\nDeutsche Bank is holding on to its prediction for an August rate cut but indicates that substantial changes would be necessary for the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to lower the Bank Rate during the summer.\n\nThey imply that the MPC could potentially delay action until September, allowing time to adjust economic forecasts in the August Monetary Policy Report (MPR) and consider two additional inflation and labour market reports before making any moves to ease restrictive policy.\n\nUnicredit seems to take a slightly more dovish stance than the general consensus, anticipating a 6-3 vote split with one more member in favour of a cut compared to the May meeting, although the level of uncertainty remains considerable.\n\nThe minutes from the MPC are expected to repeat the guidance provided in May. The first rate cut is still projected for August, with a total of 75 basis points of reductions expected throughout the year, as economic growth remains sluggish and inflation hovers near 2%.\n\nAccording to ING, changes in forward guidance are anticipated, and it is believed that the Bank may want to temper the \"extended period\" language ahead of the initial rate cut. Implementing such changes next week would likely indicate that an August rate cut is more probable than what the markets are currently pricing in.\n\nThe Dutch bank also plans to keep an eye on statements made after the UK general election on 4 July, as officials will once again be able to make public comments. If an August rate cut is likely, signals from Governor Andrew Bailey and others are anticipated. Any modifications in forward guidance might suggest that an August rate cut is more probable than the market currently predicts.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

GBP/USD is trading at 1.2683 in the European session at the time of writing, down 0.16% on the day. There are no UK events on Tuesday, while the US releases retail sales. On Wednesday, we'll get a look at UK inflation for May.\n\nUS retail sales were flat in April but are expected to improve to 0.2% m/m in May. Yearly, retail sales are projected to dip to 2.8%, compared to 3.0% in April.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will be keeping a close eye on today's retail sales data, hoping that any improvement in May retail sales is mild, as a weakening economy will support cutting interest rates.\n\nThe Fed has done a good job slashing inflation, although the final sprint to achieving the 2% target is proving to be a tough challenge. Fed policymakers are likely to go ahead with an initial rate cut even if inflation remains above target, so long as they are confident that inflation will continue to fall.\n\nThe markets have priced in a quarter-point cut in September at 60%, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. That is up from 53% a week ago but indicates that there is a strong chance that the Fed won't change its \"higher for longer\" stance until November or December.\n\nIn the UK, inflation is expected to fall to 2% in May, down from 2.3% in April. This would mean inflation has dropped to the Bank of England's 2% target for the first time since April 2021. Unfortunately for the government, a positive inflation report will not translate into a rate cut at Thursday's meeting, since there is an election on July 4th and the BoE does not want to be viewed as meddling in the election campaign.

The Office for National Statistics reports this morning that the inflation rate slowed to 2 per cent in the 12 months to May 2024: its lowest point since July 2021.\n\nThe greatest contribution came from another slowdown in food and non-alcoholic beverages: having once peaked at a staggering 19.1 per cent in 2023, prices have now slowed to 1.7 per cent in the year to May, down from 2.9 per cent in the year to April.\n\nClothing and footwear also played a role, slowing to 3 per cent in the year to May, down from 3.7 per cent in April. Some of this was off-set by rising transport costs, largely thanks to a rise in motor fuel duty, which saw the division rise by 0.3 per cent in the year to May. But core inflation (which removes more volatile prices like food and energy) still shows a positive trajectory, slowing from 3.9 per cent in April down to 3.5 per cent in May.\n\nIs the return to target a (rare) piece of good news for Rishi Sunak and his MPs? Many in the Tory camp will argue that isn't even a question: it's the one priority Sunak announced when he entered Downing Street that has been delivered - and despite politicians having very little control over whether the inflation rate goes up or down (that's largely down to money supply and interest rates, controlled by the Bank of England), the simple fact that the fight against spiralling inflation has been brought to an end under this government is a win for the Conservatives.\n\nBut the return to target is also a painful reminder of what triggered an early election in the first place. Sunak used the good inflation data (and higher-than-expected growth data) from last month to spring into a campaign, insisting that the 'plan and priorities' that he 'set out are working.' It was supposed to distract from what hadn't been delivered: specifically his pledge to 'stop the boats' which looked more precarious going into the summer, with the number of people arriving across the Channel set to rise, while doubts were also rising about whether flights to Rwanda would really take off.\n\nBut if the strategy relies on the economy 'turning the corner', as ministers like to say, the public needs to experience this for themselves. Far more compelling to allow people a bit of time to feel the benefits - something that might have started to happen had the Prime Minister waited until the autumn to go to the polls.\n\nIt's a hard argument to make even with more positive data these days, as living standards have still not recovered to their pre-pandemic levels. 'I'm not going to claim everything is fine,' shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said on the media round this morning. It's not really a point that the Tories dispute - they are careful not to exaggerate or oversell the success of getting inflation under control. But it means there are restraints on how hard they can push their core election message. Of course if you are having to tell people that they are better off than they were six months or a year ago, you are already on the back foot.\n\nA slightly longer timeline might have also allowed for at least one interest rate cut, which is not expected to happen tomorrow when we get the next announcement on rates from the Monetary Policy Committee. As Capital Economics notes this morning, the 'big disappointment for the Bank' in today's inflation release will be that 'services inflation only nudged down from 5.9 per cent to 5.7 per cent)' - the expectation was for a greater slowdown. The forecaster says 'today's release won't alleviate the Bank's concerns about persistent price pressures entirely' further reducing the (already low) chances of an interest rate cut tomorrow.\n\nThose expectations dropped even further when Sunak called the election. It would be very surprising if the Bank were to start its rate-cutting process during an election, given its fears of being seen to act politically in any way. But rate cuts are not thought to be too far off, either. And whoever is in power when the process starts is likely to get the credit.", "source": {"uri": "spectator.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectator USA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kate_andrews@spectator.us", "name": "Kate Andrews", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishi_Sunak", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rishi Sunak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Office for National Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snap election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standard of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Economics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Slow_Food", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/Slow Food", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2156674400.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Increasing spare capacity in the economy and declining inflation expectations are likely to further reduce price pressures, while \"sticky\" domestic costs are also expected to eventually abate.\n\n\"These processes could occur more quickly or slowly than currently projected,\" he said. \"Overall, a period of restrictive policy is necessary to give us confidence that inflation will return to target over a reasonable time-frame.\"\n\nAt its last policy meeting in May, the RBNZ forecast that it wouldn't start cutting its Official Cash Rate from 5.5% until the third quarter of next year. Economists expect it to pivot much sooner than that, with most picking a move late this year and some forecasting a start to easing in early 2025.\n\nThe economy has contracted in four of the previous five quarters and may have only just managed to exit recession in the first quarter of this year, with growth of 0.1% expected when that data is published tomorrow.\n\nPolicymakers expect spare capacity to start emerging in the economy over 2024, and that will \"feed through strongly into lower domestically generated inflation,\" Conway said, adding this expectation is supported by recent RBNZ research.\n\nOne study found that the effect of capacity pressure on inflation, as captured by the Phillips curve, has become stronger over recent years, he said. This suggests that remaining inflation could decrease quickly as spare capacity emerges in product and labor markets.\n\nInflation Expectations\n\n\"Second, we expect households and firms to increasingly build lower inflation expectations into their wage- and price-setting decisions,\" Conway said. \"Because inflation expectations can become self-fulfilling, lower inflation expectations will help reduce inflation persistence.\"\n\nThe RBNZ's hawkish bias in recent months has been driven by concerns that domestic, or non-tradable, inflation has remained more elevated than expected.\n\nConway said the bank anticipates that disinflation will spread across a wider set of non-tradables that typically take longer to react to monetary policy, such as restaurant meals and ready-to-eat food.\n\n\"Inflation in this category of non-tradables increased relatively slowly over the pandemic and has only recently started to decline,\" he said. \"This decline is likely to continue as the labor market continues to ease.\"\n\nConway wouldn't be drawn on whether the RBNZ has re-evaluated its assessment of risks or when interest rates could be expected to fall.\n\n\"I can't give you the magic formula of when interest rates are going to decline,\" he said. \"We look at everything to give us the confidence that inflation will be sustainably back in the band, and we are just not there yet.\"\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Even worse is that the food inflation rate in April stood at 40.53 per cent, increasing by 15.92 per cent compared to April 2023.\n\nThis scorecard performance of the economy is all shades of concern since the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)'s nuanced approach to combating inflationary pressures despite raising interest rates at the turn of the year.\n\nAlthough the CBN Governor, Olayemi Cardoso, clearly emphasized that there was no \"magic solution\" to reduce the soaring inflation, he implored the Federal Government to prioritise food production and availability, stating that more needs to be done for food producing communities in terms of adequate security.\n\nHe stated that following an extensive look at past impacts of the apex bank's hikes, members of the MPC suggested further tightening to build on the success/impact of recent hikes, adding that balance of risk suggests further tightening of rates.\n\nCardoso said, \"I think it is important to say that inflation is beginning to become an issue. However, there is light at the end of the tunnel because as we have seen an increase in inflation figures, looking at the specifics in terms of food, core and headline inflation, you will see that it is moderating and decelerating in increment. This is because for the first time since October, we have relatively significant moderation on those components.\n\nI believe strongly that the tools employed by the CBN to tackle inflation are working. There is no magic wand and these things take time but I am confident that some relief will come in another couple of months and I know there will be positive outcomes\".\n\nHowever, economic experts have raised their concerns, questioning whether the reform measures adopted by the FG and CBN have been effective or remedial.\n\nAccording to them, the government seems to be applying the wrong tools to the wrong ailment as the challenge requires a more effective multi-pronged strategy if it has to be addressed.\n\nSpeaking during a monitored programme, the Chief Executive Officer, Cowry Assets Management Limited, Johnson Chukwu, explained that Nigeria's battle with rising inflation requires a multi-pronged strategy that addresses the root cause of the issue.\n\nHe attributed the increase in inflation rate to the pressure on food prices which is as a result of low productivity, exchange rate depreciation and excess liquidity in the system while adding that Nigeria does not have a huge consumer credit system.\n\nChukwu said, \"Core cause of this is food inflation which came at a print of over 40 per cent in the month of May while core was 27.01 per cent and so the greatest pressure we are getting is from food inflation. Then, the question is how do we fight food inflation? Because the inflationary pressure is not coming from excess liquidity injection by way of credit expansion (when banks are lending excessively, then you can tighten monetary policies to slow down credit expansion and therefore cut down on demand) but remember that Nigeria does not even have consumer credit and that approach is most likely appropriate when you have huge consumer credit lending in that economy.\n\nSo when you increase interest rates, people can no longer borrow to consume and therefore slow down on their consumption. That assumes that the productive capacity is strong so that when there is a deduction in consumption, there is also a reduction in demand and the producers will bring down their prices. Hence the current situation is driven by 3 factors; pressure on food prices because of low food production in major food belts of the country, exchange rate depreciation (Naira went as low as N1,000 in April whereas now, we are back to about N1,500/$1), a major reversal of the gains we saw in exchange rate.\n\nThe FG through the DMO, CBN, have withdrawn within the month of January and last week a total of N15.74 trillion from the economy and so if the issue is excess liquidity, it has been pulled out of the economy and that is enough to have little or major reduction in inflation but we are not seeing that. The key thing is that we are fighting fire with the wrong tools. If you use certain things to fight different types of fires, you might end up inflaming the fire because you increase the combustive nature of the cause of the fire, so it is not that monetary policies are not effective but obviously from all indications, we are applying the wrong tools to the wrong ailment. We need to address food production, stability in exchange rate and excessive liquidity which is being injected by the FG\".\n\nHe stated that between May 2023 and May 2024, the three tiers of government had shared about N12.6 trillion, and added that of the N12.6 trillion, N4 trillion was exchange gain and a third of the amount shared was not backed by productive activities.\n\nAccording to him, the exchange gain should have been moved into the reserve and passed on to the Nigerian Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA).\n\nOffering solutions, the Cowry CEO who doubles as an economic analyst, stated that the battle is won on a strategy table where multiple approaches are examined meticulously while adding headline inflation can be reversible if the government takes more holistic approaches.\n\n\"We need to focus on improving food productivity, that is the best way to tackle inflation, particularly for an economy that is not mature. Remember that inflation is defined as when too much money is pursuing few goods and so if you keep the money in circulation at the same level and increase the quantity of goods and services produced, you reach a new equilibrium so that prices will come down because if you produce more food than the money that is pursuing it, you will see people who are producing the food begging people to buy from them and so we need to deal with the core cause of inflation which is the issue of productivity.\n\nWe also need to look out for crude oil production. I was happy when I saw the first quarter GDP report that revealed that oil production moved from 1.45mbpd in Q3 to 1.55mbpd in Q4 and 1.75mbpd in Q5, the focus should be that we need to quickly improve more on it so we can achieve exchange rate stability and reduce the pass-through effect of naira depreciation\", Chukwu stated.\n\nFor his part, Business and economic analyst, Kenechukwu Aguolu, the Dangote refinery brings a slight glimmer of hope for the country's economic landscape, however, the FG needs to create an effective model to fast-track the diversification of the economy as it is essential to improve revenue sources, enhance the nation's balance of trade which will in turn stabilizes the value of the naira.\n\nHe further added, \"Enhancing food production, stabilizing the exchange rate, managing liquidity effectively, and investing in infrastructure are all critical steps.\n\n\"Additionally, ensuring security in agricultural areas and adopting a tailored monetary policy will be essential for achieving sustainable economic stability and improving the standard of living for Nigerians.\"", "source": {"uri": "sunnewsonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

three years of Britain's above-target inflation, which last stood at 2 percent in July 2021 before surging higher in a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nThe news sets the scene for the July 4 general election which Sunak's Conservatives are tipped to lose badly to Keir Starmer's main opposition Labour Party, according to opinion polls.\n\nSunak hailed the inflation slowdown, but Labour slammed the Conservatives' stewardship of the economy after 14 years in power.\n\n\"It's very good news because the last few years have been really tough for everybody,\" Sunak told LBC radio.\n\n\"Inflation is back to target, and that means people will start to feel the benefits and ease some of the burdens on the cost of living, and it's because of that economic stability that we've restored.\"\n\nThe Bank of England will meet Thursday but it is expected to sit tight on interest rates, as is customary ahead of UK elections.\n\n'Worse off'\n\nAfter peaking at 11.1 percent in October 2022, consumer price growth has cooled following a series of interest-rate hikes by the UK central bank.\n\nBritain's economy, however, stagnated in April after emerging from recession in the first quarter of the year, official data showed last week.\n\nREAD: UK economy stagnates heading into general election\n\nPrices are still rising on top of the sharp increases seen in recent years but at a slower rate, as businesses and households weather the easing cost-of-living crunch.\n\n\"After 14 years of economic chaos under the Conservatives, working people are worse off,\" said Labour finance spokesperson Rachel Reeves.\n\n\"Prices have risen in the shops, mortgage bills are higher and taxes are at a 70-year high,\" Reeves said.\n\n\"Labour has a plan to make people better off bringing stability back to our economy.\"\n\nNo surprises\n\nThe BoE began a series of rate hikes in late 2021 to combat inflation, which rose after countries emerged from Covid lockdowns and accelerated after Moscow invaded Ukraine.\n\nThe institution last month held its main interest rate at a 16-year high of 5.25 percent but hinted at a summer reduction as UK inflation cools further.\n\nAdded to the mix, elevated interest rates have worsened the cost-of-living squeeze because they increase the cost of borrowing, thereby cutting disposable incomes.\n\n\"The BoE will be encouraged by the slowdown in headline inflation, and while concerns will remain over elevated underlying price pressures, further falls in services inflation are anticipated over the coming months,\" said KPMG UK chief economist Yael Selfin.\n\n\"Today's data are unlikely to spur a surprise rate cut tomorrow, however, the (bank) could have sufficient evidence to begin its easing cycle in August.\"\n\nREAD: Bank of England edges closer to rate cut, possibly in June\n\nInfluential business lobby the Confederation of British Industry added that the stage was now set for the BoE to trim rates in August.\n\n\"Another fall in inflation in May will come as welcome news to households as we move towards a more benign inflationary environment,\" said CBI economist Martin Sartorius.\n\n\"However, many will still be feeling the pinch due to the level of prices being far higher than in previous years, particularly for food and energy bills.\"", "source": {"uri": "business.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title":

That progress may have paused in the first three months of the year, but information since then on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation points to renewed progress.\n\nOver the last year through April, personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was 2.7 percent, down from 7.1 percent at its peak in 2022. Core PCE inflation -- which excludes the volatile food and energy categories -- was 2.8 percent through April, down from its peak of 5.6 percent. Based on consumer and producer price inflation for May released last week, I estimate that 12-month PCE inflation in May was a bit lower than in April. I was encouraged by some of the details of the recent reports, particularly the continued improvement in market-based services inflation, which is based on observation of actual market prices rather than imputed values. That's important because market-based prices are likely to be a better indication of the overall trend for core services inflation than nonmarket prices.\n\nHousing services inflation, meanwhile, continues to be persistent. Market rents for new tenant leases have already cooled significantly, but further progress in overall housing services inflation will rely on the ongoing pass-through of the previous market rents deceleration to the rents of existing tenants with expiring leases.\n\nSo inflation is still too high, and further progress is likely to be gradual. However, there are several reasons why I remain optimistic that improving supply and cooling demand will support continued disinflation.\n\nThe first reason I am optimistic about further progress on inflation has to do with declining price increases and even declining prices as consumers become more price sensitive. I think of this from several, related angles -- I will mention a few.\n\nAs I have discussed in previous speeches, reduced frequency of price adjustments helps moderate prices. And the frequency with which firms adjust prices, which accelerated to less than every five months in early 2022, moved closer to every seven months as of the end of 2023. Price adjustment frequency picked up some early this year, along with the temporary firming of inflation, but the general trend has been consistent with ongoing disinflation.\n\nAn additional basis for price-setting optimism is the fact that longer-run inflation expectations have remained well anchored. Research by the Richmond Fed has found that price-setting decisions by firms are related to their own expectations about the path of overall inflation, so anchored inflation expectations among firms are likely to result in price setting consistent with those lower price expectations.\n\nIn addition, there may still be room for markups of prices over labor costs to continue falling. While markups are famously difficult to measure, rough, simple estimates of markups of prices over labor costs have fallen back from high levels but still remain above their pre-pandemic trend, especially in the goods sector. A return of markups to this trend could help ongoing progress toward 2 percent inflation.\n\nA final factor for optimism about positive price-setting developments is the range of anecdotes from firms themselves. The most recent edition of the Fed's Beige Book suggests firms are increasingly attentive to consumers pushing back against additional price increases and that these businesses expect to increase prices only moderately in the near term. Beyond the Beige Book, I have gleaned from recent earnings reports by publicly traded companies that lower-income consumers are pulling back from their purchasing and that firms are responding by moderating price increases or, in some cases, actually cutting prices. What I have heard in my own conversations with business contacts is that consumers are \"trading down\" to lower-cost products and that firms are responding with more discounting. And some large retailers have publicly spoken about cutting prices in the face of resistant consumers. These various indicators -- markups, price adjustment frequency, inflation expectations, and anecdotes from a range of sources -- suggest that, on balance, price-setting behavior is likely to continue to move closer to consistency with the FOMC's inflation target.\n\nA second reason for my optimism about continued disinflation is slower growth in the costs faced by businesses. Among those, nominal wages are a big part of total costs in the services sector. Nominal wage growth has continued to trend down, consistent with a labor market where supply and demand are coming into better balance. Of course, as a general matter, I want to see Americans experiencing strong wage growth, but for that wage growth to be sustainable, it must be consistent with our inflation target. Notably, as inflation has come down, real wages have been rising and now exceed pre-pandemic levels, which means that the purchasing power of workers has also been increasing. But at the same time, we have seen slowing growth in nominal labor costs. For example, the 12-month increase in average hourly earnings has been running just above 4 percent over the past couple of months after peaking at around 6 percent in 2022 and falling more or less steadily since then. The latest readings compare with an average of around 3 percent a year before the pandemic, when inflation was running below our 2 percent goal. Wage moderation is especially evident in some service sectors for which labor is a large share of costs. If this moderation in wage growth continues, it will soon be at levels consistent with price stability. And I note that the market-based services inflation measure I mentioned earlier tends to move closely with wage growth.\n\nOther developments in labor markets also point toward continued resilience, but there are signs of gradual cooling and continued wage moderation. Gains in payrolls averaged 218,000 over the past two months, which is a solid pace. But most other indicators point to a slow but steady easing of the labor market, supported by cooling demand for hiring as well as strong supply.\n\nIn terms of demand, both the job openings rate and the hiring rate have come down from their highs of late 2021 and early 2022. The job opening rate is not far above its pre-pandemic range, and the hiring rate is below pre-pandemic. Surveys of business hiring intentions likewise suggest cooler demand for workers. On the supply side, we have seen notable growth in labor supply over the past year. Labor force participation among prime-age women, in particular, reached another all-time record in May. And the strong inflows of immigrants I have discussed in previous speeches have continued this year, which points to continued labor supply growth as recent immigrants gradually make their way into the labor market.\n\nWith cooling demand and solid supply, measures of labor market tightness have continued to ease. The unemployment rate has been gradually rising and reached 4 percent in May, still very low in historical terms and the 30th straight month at 4 percent or lower. Another indicator of labor market tightness, the ratio of job vacancies to the number of people counted as looking for work, crossed an important threshold in April. After rising as high as 2 vacancies for each person seeking a job during the pandemic, that ratio fell to 1.2, which was the level before the pandemic. Another indicator of labor market tightness, the rate of people voluntarily quitting their jobs, is actually below the pre-pandemic level. The average duration for job vacancies is down, and it is becoming easier for employers to fill jobs. We policymakers like to make our judgments based on a preponderance of the data, and a preponderance of the labor market data indicates that labor market supply and demand are coming into better balance.\n\nA third reason for my optimism about achieving 2 percent inflation is that I am also cautiously optimistic about productivity growth, which is a source of supply expansion that is likely to put downward pressure on inflation without slower economic growth. One factor is the remarkable rise in the rate of new business creation, which started early in the pandemic and has continued, more or less, even through last month. Economic research finds that while many new and young firms struggle to survive, a small subset of new firms are highly productive and grow rapidly, eventually making significant contributions to aggregate productivity. And the pandemic-era business creation surge has been particularly strong in high-tech sectors, such as computer systems design and research and development services. Some recent history favors a payoff to productivity growth from this surge in entrepreneurship. Before the jump in productivity growth in the late 1990s through the early 2000s, there was a similar wave of strong business entries in high-tech industries. I suspect that most of the productivity benefits of the recent entry surge are still ahead of us.\n\nAnother basis for productivity optimism is the prospect for widespread implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in its various forms. To be sure, there is tremendous uncertainty around the future path of AI and its effects on the economy, and we must all think carefully about how it may affect workers and the kinds of tasks they perform. But AI technology has the potential to make workers and firms more productive -- effectively boosting aggregate supply. Of course, many technologies can take a long time to show through to aggregate productivity. The spread of electrification more than a century ago required complementary assets like power lines and appliances to be created and installed. But I suspect that AI may diffuse more quickly, in part because many of the complementary assets needed for the initial spread of AI -- such as computers, networks, and the like -- are already in place, even while there is still an enormous amount of additional hardware buildout still ahead of us. And survey data from the Census Bureau suggest that firms in many sectors are already employing AI. Only time will tell, of course, but the prospect of higher productivity growth raises the possibility that inflation can fall without a significant slowdown in economic activity and employment.\n\nMy fourth and final reason for optimism on inflation is that I believe the current stance of monetary policy is sufficiently restrictive to help cool the economy and bring inflation back toward 2 percent without a sharp contraction in economic activity or a significant deterioration of the labor market. Interest rates remain elevated relative to a year ago, and certainly relative to two or three years ago, and are restricting economic activity. Of course, some aspects of financial conditions, such as house prices and, especially, stock prices, remain robust; and credit is still generally available, though high interest rates make borrowing expensive. These factors likely have some distributional implications: Higher-income people with large stock portfolios may not feel that conditions are so restrictive, while lower earners who need to borrow to buy a house or a car do not need to be told that finances are tight.\n\nBut the overall restrictiveness of financial conditions is apparent in interest rate-sensitive sectors. For example, the level of residential investment in the first quarter -- though showing some modest improvement relative to last year's pace -- was still roughly 15 percent below its peak in 2021. Business investment in equipment contracted a bit in 2023 and showed only tepid growth in the first quarter of this year. And while consumption growth has been resilient over the past couple of years, fueled in part by excess savings accumulated during the pandemic and solid real wages that now exceed pre-pandemic levels, it slowed noticeably in the first quarter, especially for spending on goods. Indeed, high interest rates have left a mark on consumer assessments of buying conditions for motor vehicles and other large durable goods, which often have to be financed.\n\nThe effects of restrictive financial conditions are also evident in labor markets. As I discussed earlier, the labor market has cooled gradually, and, looking ahead, I expect some cooling of economic activity to continue. But I am watching closely for any signs of labor market deterioration that may take hold, as the FOMC also pays attention to the other side of our mandate.\n\nNotwithstanding my optimism about the economic outlook, I am mindful of a number of risks to both sides of the dual mandate. On the inflation side, the resurgence of import prices at the beginning of the year is concerning, even if import prices came down some last month, and could anticipate greater pressure on goods prices in the coming months. Goods prices have been a key source of disinflation over the past year or so, as supply chains have healed. While supply chains appear to have been fairly resilient to a series of shocks since the end of last year -- including attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and low water levels in the Panama Canal -- geopolitical developments in Ukraine and the Middle East still could lead to a sharp rise in global energy and food prices and disrupt global supply chains. Another risk I am focused on is that a further cooling of the U.S. economy could lead to a sharp deterioration in labor market conditions. Output growth appears to have slowed in the first half of this year, and while consumer spending still grew in the first quarter, the May retail sales report we received this morning may be another signal that the long-expected deceleration in consumer spending may finally be upon us. After a considerable decline in job vacancies, firms facing decreasing demand might increasingly resort to laying off workers. Lastly, I also see risks to the global economy that could spill back to the U.S. economy. While growth in some countries -- notably in Europe -- appears to be picking up from a soft patch last year, that pickup remains tentative. And the latest data from China suggest that economic momentum there has slowed considerably amid a continuing real estate crisis.\n\nLet me now turn to the implications of my economic outlook for monetary policy. While I remain cautiously optimistic that inflation is coming down, it is still too high, and it is moving down only slowly. I believe that policy has more work to do, which is why I supported the FOMC's decision last week to keep the federal funds rate in a range of 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent. We need to see more progress toward 2 percent inflation before I will have confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward that objective. For the reasons I have outlined today, I believe economic conditions are moving in the right direction. If the economy evolves as I am expecting, it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy sometime later this year. But, as always, my judgment will be guided by the data.\n\nLet me conclude by acknowledging that the surge in inflation over the past few years means that prices are now significantly higher than they were just a few years ago, even as the rate of price increases has slowed dramatically since mid-2022. While I am heartened by data showing that nominal wages are now growing at a faster rate than prices, I know many Americans are still struggling with high costs. I also know that many Americans are facing high borrowing costs. That's why I will be watching the data carefully in the months ahead to ensure that we are on track to achieve both sides of our dual mandate.\n\n1.

For example, the ratio of the producer price index (PPI) for final demand goods to the employment cost index for private goods industries rose roughly 20 percent from the end of 2020 to the middle of 2022. In services, this ratio rose roughly 5 percent. The ratios for both sectors have come down from their peak levels but were still above their end-2020 levels as of the first quarter of this year -- and they had been on downward trends before the pandemic. Similar analysis using PCE prices instead of PPI yields a qualitatively similar result for goods industries, though, in services, the PCE price-to-wage ratio has been roughly flat.

Consumer confidence is improving but surveys also suggest the feel-good factor isn't there.\n\nThe Bank's target does not resonate much with voters who are much more likely to point out how much more expensive everything is.\n\nAnd it is. Prices are settling at a much higher level than three years ago.\n\nFood is up 30%, energy bills are up 50%, rent is up 20% and mortgage repayments have doubled.\n\nIt's probably also worth pointing out that inflation took off and has subsequently returned to target.That's primarily because of wild swings in the global price of energy and food (and because of higher interest rates) rather than anything the government has done.\n\nAlthough we are in the middle of a heated election campaign, so you may hear some politicians claiming otherwise.\n\nStrong pay growth is also a mixed blessing.\n\nInflation in the \"services\" sector of the economy still glows too brightly for the Bank of England's liking - reinforcing a concern that companies are funding higher wage settlements by increasing their prices rather than accepting lower profits.\n\nThe Bank thought services inflation would have faded to 5.3% by now, yet it's running at 5.7%.\n\nIn forecasting terms, that's quite a miss and one reason the markets have decided there's little to no prospect of an interest rate cut on Thursday.It is likely to be November before the Bank decides it's time to lower the cost of borrowing.\n\nQuite why services inflation is proving so persistent isn't clear, although the hike on the National Living Wage (the government increased it by 9.8% in April) may be a factor.\n\nThe dousing down continues but we shouldn't be downbeat. As the Resolution Foundation points out, the UK now has the lowest rate of inflation of any G7 country bar Italy.\n\nBut let's also be realistic.

"body": "London (AFP) - British inflation slowed in May to the central bank's two-percent target, official data showed Wednesday, boosting Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's struggling election campaign.\n\nThe Consumer Prices Index fell as expected from 2.3 percent in April, the Office for National Statistics said in a statement citing easing growth in food prices.\n\nThat follows almost three years Britain's above-target inflation, which last stood at two percent in July 2021 before surging higher in a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nThe news sets the scene for the July 4 general election which Sunak's Conservatives are tipped to lose badly to Keir Starmer's main opposition Labour Party, according to opinion polls.\n\nSunak hailed the inflation slowdown, but Labour slammed the Conservatives' stewardship of the economy after 14 years in power.\n\n\"It's very good news, because the last few years have been really tough for everybody,\" Sunak told LBC radio.\n\n\"Inflation is back to target, and that means people will start to feel the benefits and ease some of the burdens on the cost of living, and it's because of that economic stability that we've restored.\"\n\nThe Bank of England will meet Thursday but it is expected to sit tight on interest rates, as is customary ahead of UK elections.\n\n'Worse off'\n\nAfter peaking at 11.1 percent in October 2022, consumer price growth has cooled following a series of interest-rate hikes by the UK central bank.\n\nBritain's economy, however, stagnated in April after emerging from recession in the first quarter of the year, official data showed last week.\n\nPrices are still rising on top of the sharp increases seen in recent years but at a slower rate, as businesses and households weather the easing cost-of-living crunch.\n\n\"After 14 years of economic chaos under the Conservatives, working people are worse off,\" said Labour finance spokesperson Rachel Reeves.\n\n\"Prices have risen in the shops, mortgage bills are higher and taxes are at a 70-year high,\" Reeves said.\n\n\"Labour has a plan to make people better off bringing stability back to our economy.\"\n\nNo surprises\n\nThe BoE began a series of rate hikes in late 2021 to combat inflation, which rose after countries emerged from Covid lockdowns and accelerated after Moscow invaded Ukraine.\n\nThe institution last month held its main interest rate at a 16-year high of 5.25 percent but hinted at a summer reduction as UK inflation cools further.\n\nAdded to the mix, elevated interest rates have worsened the cost-of-living squeeze because they increase the cost of borrowing, thereby cutting disposable incomes.\n\n\"The BoE will be encouraged by the slowdown in headline inflation, and while concerns will remain over elevated underlying price pressures, further falls in services inflation are anticipated over the coming months,\" said KPMG UK chief economist Yael Selfin.\n\n\"Today's data are unlikely to spur a surprise rate cut tomorrow, however, the (bank) could have sufficient evidence to begin its easing cycle in August.\"\n\nInfluential business lobby the Confederation of British Industry added that the stage was now set for the BoE to trim rates in August.\n\n\"Another fall in inflation in May will come as welcome news to households as we move towards a more benign inflationary environment,\" said CBI economist Martin Sartorius.\n\n\"However, many will still be feeling the pinch due to the level of prices being far higher than in previous years, particularly for food and energy bills.\"", "source": {"uri":

This is not really a surprise; since early 2023 the clear direction has been to lower inflation. The debate has not been about whether inflation was heading higher or lower. The debate has been about whether the downtrend was going to converge on 2% as the Fed's target, or fall short of that level. For at least that long, my position has been that median inflation would settle in the \"high 3s/low 4s.\" To date, nothing has happened to change that view.\n\nIn fact, it cannot escape notice that inflation has been coming down a lot more slowly than it went up. When the initial spike happened, certainly the 'transitory' crowd expected inflation would fall at least as rapidly as it went up, and even many of those who correctly understood that the underlying dynamics were not accidents of fate but the results of terrible policy thought that the return round-trip would take roughly the same amount of time as the outbound leg. But that hasn't happened. The softening of inflation has been more reluctant than was the upward thrust. This is partly because, since the initial move in prices was not transitory, it kicked off a feedback loop: so wages went up to reflect the pressures that workers were feeling, and that fed back into inflation.\n\nFor Median CPI, the sharp acceleration took off from August 2021 at 2.4% and extended 18 months until it reached 7.1% in February 2023. In the 15 months since then, median has declined only to 4.3%, and this rate of improvement appears to be flattening out rather than accelerating.\n\nOn Core CPI, the difference has been more striking. The jump from 1.6% y/y to 6.5% y/y took 12 months, from March 2021 to March 2022. Since the actual 6.6% high in September 2022, we have had 20 months of declining inflation and core is only back to 3.4%.\n\nThe optimistic view is that we have had more months of decelerating inflation than we had of accelerating inflation. The more realistic view, especially considering that Median CPI hadn't been above 3.33% for 28 years prior to COVID (and Core, not above 3.1%) is that inflation is converging to the mean...but to a different mean. This is what I have argued (for a long time) was happening: the perturbation to the former equilibrium displaced the whole distribution to a new equilibrium (\"high 3s, low 4s\"). We are now getting data that seems to support this notion.\n\nOne important characteristic of mean-reverting series is that the amount of mean-reversion \"pressure\" is related to the distance of the current point from the mean. That is, when inflation is far away from the mean, it tends to revert more quickly and when it is closer to the mean the pressure to converge is less. The general form of a mean-reverting series is:\n\nIn this equation, the economic variable is represented by the time series S, the long-term mean is \u03bc, and the mean reversion rate is k. Because there is also random noise, and because many economic series don't tend to see large perturbations on a regular basis, it is not a trivial thing to pick out the long-term mean and the reversion coefficient from the noise. But the point is that such series, when they are strongly perturbed, initially spring back rapidly but then gradually slow how much they are rebounding, until they approach the mean. That certainly looks like what we have here. The chart below shows core and median CPI, but from the point of the shock to new highs I have added 'mean reversion lines' where the long-term mean is taken to be 4% for Median CPI and 3.5% for Core CPI, and the mean reversion coefficient is taken to be 0.12 in each case.\n\nThere are lots of different combinations that can produce plausible dynamics, and my point isn't to claim that these are the right parameters. I am merely trying to illustrate that the recent behavior looks like a series that is mean reverting to new, higher means.\n\n(For what it's worth, if you want to see why most economists last year thought that we would be back at target inflation in late 2023/early 2024, use 2% for \u03bc. In that case, inflation starts down much more steeply than we actually saw, and doesn't flatten out until lower levels of inflation.)\n\nWhy is the rate of improvement slowing? It is slowing because the easiest improvements have already happened. For example, core goods inflation has declined from over 12% to -1.7% y/y. That's great news - but the first 14% of disinflation is surely the easiest! Other, stickier parts of the CPI, such as shelter and 'supercore', are coming down more slowly (shelter) or not at all (supercore, which is at the same level it first reached in March 2022). In the conventional view, this is \"improvement that is waiting to happen.\" But if overall core/median inflation is converging to a higher mean, then these improvements will be mostly offset by an increase in core goods inflation from -1.7% to, say, 0%.\n\nThe road gets harder from here, and that's what the decelerating deceleration is telling us!", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Median"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_reversion_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mean reversion (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_equilibrium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economic equilibrium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrust", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thrust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(letter)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mu (letter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_(astronomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perturbation (astronomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perturbation theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acceleration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversion_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reversion (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_(electronics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noise (electronics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Cosmology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Cosmology", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Jumps", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Jumps", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investingcom_analysis_og.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

bills.\n\n\"Today's data sets the stage for the Monetary Policy Committee to cut interest rates in August, in line with our latest forecast's expectations.\n\n\"However, rate-setters will still need to weigh the fall in headline inflation against signs that domestic price pressures, such as elevated pay growth, are proving slower to come down.\n\n\"This means that they are likely to move cautiously beyond August to avoid putting further upward pressure on inflation, especially as the growth outlook improves at home and geopolitical tensions remain heightened.\"", "source": {"uri":

Investors grappled with a slower-than-anticipated decline in services price inflation in May, which the Bank of England believes offers a clearer view of medium-term inflation risks.\n\n\"Markets are seeing a bit of indigestion on the details of the inflation report pushing back expectations of a first rate cut,\" Ben Laidler, global markets strategist at eToro, said. Data showed services price inflation at 5.7%, compared with a Reuters poll of economists who expected 5.5%.\n\nInvestors are now pricing in a roughly 30% chance of an August rate cut, down from nearly 50% before the data. \"If this stickiness in domestic price pressures continues, alongside ongoing resilience in economic activity, an August rate cut could well be off the table too,\" Zara Nokes, global market analyst at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said.\n\nMeanwhile, headline inflation returned to the BoE's target of 2%. The central bank is expected to announce its policy decision on Thursday.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Segro lost 1.2% after Jefferies downgraded the stock to \"hold\" from \"buy\". Spectris dropped 8.2% after the scientific instruments-maker warned of lower-than-expected profit on weak China demand.\n\nTelecom infrastructure firm Helios Towers was the top loser on the mid-cap index, falling 8.4% after a discounted secondary share placement. Anglo American gained 1.5% after the miner said it expects a 30% decline at its key Chile copper mine in 2025.\n\nU.S. markets are shut for a public holiday on Wednesday.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FTSE 100 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segro", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Segro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectris", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spectris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EToro", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "EToro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_250_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FTSE 250 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios_Towers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helios Towers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo_American_plc", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anglo American plc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPMorgan_Chase", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JPMorgan Chase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research_and_Analysis", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Research and Analysis", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Micromarketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Micromarketing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/17_06_2024_07_35_45_0163266.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

The conflicts have had a ripple effect all the way to Indonesia.\n\nOne of these impacts is inflation due to imports (imported inflation), which of course has adversely affected national economic stability. If you look closely, the food and energy sectors are the sources of imported inflation.\n\nThis is reasonable, considering that our country still imports a lot of food, such as wheat. Many of the basic ingredients that make up noodles and other foods are supplied by one of the countries currently experiencing conflict, Ukraine. Indeed, there are substitutes for producing countries and alternative food sources, but at least this is enough to provide a shock in the form of temporary inflation. Judging from the source of the problem, this category is included as an external cause.\n\nHowever, there are also causes that originate internally, or from within the country, for example the El Ni\u00f1o climate phenomenon. The impact of El Ni\u00f1o, which caused drought from last year to the beginning of this year, has certainly changed, shifted or even reduced the capacity and planting patterns of national agriculture. This clearly has had an impact on the domestic food supply. The easy short-term solution is generally to import, but of course this reduces food sovereignty and also erodes the state budget.\n\nBut there is no other way than this. After El Ni\u00f1o, we should be alert because at the end of 2024 it is projected that La Ni\u00f1a will come our way. The La Ni\u00f1a effect will result in flooding in a number of areas, especially the national food basket, which will result in crop failure.\n\nThis should serve as a collective warning to be more serious about anticipating domestic food supply deficits instead of using the easy method of importing. This seriousness is absolute because national inflation figures are largely contributed to by increases in food prices.\n\nInflation needs to be controlled, because inflation reduces prosperity. As an illustration, inflation in May 2024 on an annual basis was 2.84 percent, a decrease compared with the previous month of 3 percent. This figure is considered safe, because it is still within the consensus target of 2.5 \u00b1 1 percent in 2024 and 2025. This inflation figure is called Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation. In terms of formation, CPI consists of core inflation, volatile food (VF) inflation and administered price (AP) inflation.", "source": {"uri": "thejakartapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jakarta Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Ni\u00f1o", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "El Ni\u00f1o"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warring_States_period", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warring States period"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wheat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ni\u00f1a", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La Ni\u00f1a"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food sovereignty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drought", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harvest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food Science", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Consulting", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Import and Export", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/History", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Food/History", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Wholesale_and_Distribution", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Wholesale and Distribution", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://img.jakpost.net/c/2024/06/18/2024_06_18_151548_1718668679._large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Whether you start from its peak at 5.6% in February 2022 or 4.2% when the Fed raised rates to the current level, core PCE inflation -- which is on track to deliver a 2.6% year-on-year read for May 2024 -- is most of the way back to 2%.\n\nThe inflation outlook is pointing towards further cooling. Rent and owner's equivalent rent now accounts for nearly two-thirds of the excess of core PCE inflation above 2%, which should mechanically follow the much softer new tenant rent indices. The uncertainty there is about when exactly that softening will trickle through to measured inflation, not about the underlying dynamic. Auto prices, which were actually firm in May, are likely to contribute more to disinflation in the coming months given trends in private data on car prices.\n\nObviously, inflation is not at 2 percent, but the steady and significant progress in core PCE inflation should be enough for the Fed to start backing away. As Powell and other Committee members have repeatedly said, the Fed should not wait until inflation is literally at 2% to cut. The threshold for cuts over the next few months should not be very high. As Powell said in his interview with 60 minutes earlier this year:\n\n\"We just want to see more good data along those lines. It doesn't need to be better than what we've seen [in the latter half of 2023], or even as good. It just needs to be good. And so, we do expect to see that.\"\n\nOther Points Supporting the Easing of the Economic Brakes . . .\n\nIt is entirely possible that year-on-year core PCE inflation readings stall out or even rise slightly over the next few months, even with good month over month prints (as the Fed's new inflation projections would imply) due to the base effects from low inflation prints in the back half of last year. It would be a small increase in the longer-run context of inflation, and in the greater context of the inflation trajectory, this should not spook the Fed. Moreover, to the extent that rising year-on-year measures reflect base effects from low inflation prints last year, the Fed should not overreact to those months' base effects (after all, they promised not to overreact when we got those months' low inflation prints).", "source": {"uri": "angrybearblog.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AngryBear Econ"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angry_bear@angrybearblog.com", "name": "Angry Bear", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_Spain", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of Spain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_(musical)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rent (musical)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disinflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stall_(fluid_dynamics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stall (fluid dynamics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brake"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Publishing_and_Printing/Printing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Publishing and Printing/Printing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Millennialism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Quantity_Cooking", "label": "dmoz/Home/Cooking/Quantity Cooking", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://angrybearblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Inflation-is-Getting-Close-to-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

Recent data indicate a slowdown in the decline of inflation, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising by 3.6 per cent over the year to April, and by 4.1 per cent excluding volatile items and holiday travel, the board said in a statement.\n\nBroader economic indicators suggest ongoing excess demand and elevated domestic cost pressures. Despite some easing in labour market conditions, they remain tighter than is consistent with full employment and target inflation levels. Wage growth, while peaking, remains higher than sustainable levels given trend productivity growth.\n\nRevised data shows stronger than expected consumption over the past year, though output growth has been subdued and consumption per capita has declined. Households are restraining discretionary spending as inflation impacts real incomes.\n\nThe economic outlook remains uncertain, with central forecasts predicting inflation will return to the target range in the second half of 2025 and reach the midpoint in 2026. However, recent data indicates weak economic momentum, slow GDP growth, a rising unemployment rate, and slower-than-expected wage growth.\n\nAdditionally, revised consumption and saving rates and persistent inflation suggest upside risks. Recent budget outcomes may influence demand, though federal and state energy rebates will temporarily lower headline inflation.\n\nThere is significant uncertainty surrounding consumption growth. Real disposable incomes have stabilised and are expected to grow later this year, supported by lower inflation and tax cuts. An increase in wealth driven by rising housing prices is also expected to boost consumption. Nonetheless, there is a risk that household consumption may grow more slowly than anticipated, potentially leading to subdued output growth and labour market deterioration, the statement added.\n\nGlobal economic uncertainties persist, with output growth in advanced economies appearing to have bottomed out.

According to data from the Bank of Albania, in May the core inflation decreased to 2.33%, from 3.2% at the end of last year and 5.41% at the same period a year ago. The increase in core inflation is the lowest since October 2021.\n\nBasic inflation is calculated by the Bank of Albania for a group of goods that account for 69% of the share in the general basket of the Consumer Price Index. Core inflation excludes those products that usually have high volatility, mainly food and energy products. The purpose of calculating core inflation is to strip the overall increase in prices from fluctuations of a shorter-term nature.\n\nNow, core inflation is very close to the inflation level of the full basket of consumer prices, which according to INSTAT for May was 2.2%.\n\nThe decline in core inflation is a significant indicator of the expected course of monetary policy. If this trend continues, the Bank of Albania may soon consider returning to the easing direction of monetary policy and lowering interest rates. Currently, Albania has an interest rate of 3.25%, still among the lowest in Europe. The strengthening of the lek in the exchange rate and partly the administered energy prices caused the inflationary wave in Albania to be significantly lower compared to other European countries. Among other things, this enabled a smaller monetary tightening and the maintenance of relatively low interest rates.\n\nAlready, the fall in inflation has begun to be reflected in the policies of the central bank. In the last two months, the Bank of Albania has intervened to stop the further strengthening of the lek and is keeping the exchange rate of the euro almost fixed, just above the level of 100 lek.\n\nAfter the last meeting, in May, the Supervisory Council stated that internal inflationary pressures were still worrying and that the drop in inflation in the first part of this year was mainly due to the decrease in import prices. Wage growth also showed signs of slowing down in the first quarter of this year, especially for the private sector.\n\nThe decline of the basic component of inflation may be a signal that makes the extension of easing policies closer even in the most conventional instrument, interest rates.\n\nOn the other hand, the economy in the first part of this year is registering high rates of credit growth. For the first four months of the year, the new loan for the economy reached the value of Lek 117 billion, increasing by 35% compared to the same period last year. In particular, for the local currency, the new loan recorded a much higher growth, with 64%.\n\nA reduction in interest rates may give further impetus to lending, but a rapid increase in lending is not without risks.\n\nThe ratio of non-performing loans showed a slight increase in April. According to data from the Bank of Albania, this indicator increased to 4.82%, from 4.64% in March. This was the first increase in the NPL ratio since January.\n\nAccording to the analysis of the Bank of Albania, the increase in the ratio of non-performing loans seems to be mainly an effect of the increase in interest rates in euros. The segment where the increase in problem loans has been observed is mainly the loan for the purchase of real estate in euros, especially in the segment of individuals.\n\nDevelopments in the real estate market and bank loans for properties have been assessed with concern by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In the last statement for Albania, in January of this year, the IMF suggested to the Bank of Albania the establishment of a countercyclical capital increase for the banking sector, mainly oriented towards curbing the rates of lending for real estate.", "source": {"uri": "albaniandailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Albanian Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Albania", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of Albania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Core inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albanian_lek", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Albanian lek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Albania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Albania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-performing_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-performing loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://albaniandailynews.com/foto/2024/06/20240618092401_art.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

Onanuga made these remarks during an interview with Television Continental (TVC) on Monday, addressing widespread concerns over rising inflation.\n\nOnanuga emphasized that the month-to-month increase in inflation from April to May 2024 was a modest 0.26%, rising from 33.43% to 33.69%. He argued that this marginal rise indicates a deceleration in inflation, suggesting that citizens will soon feel the benefits of the government's economic reforms.\n\n\"I read a report recently saying inflation has moved to a staggering 33.69%. How is it staggering? Last month in April, inflation was 33.43%. Then it moved by a mere 0.26%. In fact, from March to April, inflation slowed down. So things are improving. People will soon begin to feel the impact of all these reductions,\" Onanuga stated.\n\nContrary to reports from various news outlets, Onanuga claimed that food prices have been relatively dropping and will continue to decline nationwide. He cited a personal anecdote of receiving news about a decrease in the price of garri as evidence of this trend.\n\nOnanuga also noted that President Tinubu inherited many of the economic challenges currently facing the country, including a high inflation rate that was already above 23% when Tinubu took office. He highlighted the administration's efforts to tackle these issues, including the introduction of a student loan scheme aimed at supporting higher education and alleviating financial pressures on families.\n\n\"This government, when it came in May last year, inflation was at 23.65%. The movement from there till now is about 10.4%. We already had some problems before this government came into office. We didn't create all the problems. We inherited many of them. And this government is making so much effort to reduce these problems,\" Onanuga explained.\n\nDespite the administration's optimistic outlook, Nigeria is experiencing significant economic difficulties. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the inflation rate rose to 33.95% in May 2024, up from 33.69% in April. This increase marks a 0.26 percentage point rise, with year-on-year inflation rates jumping by 11.54 percentage points from 22.41% in May 2023.\n\nFood inflation has reached 40.66% year-on-year, a substantial rise from 24.82% in May 2023. This sharp increase in food prices has been attributed to factors such as insecurity, limited funding for farmers, and high import duties on food items.\n\nWhile the presidency maintains that the inflation rate is not as severe as it might seem and that economic conditions are improving, the substantial year-on-year increases in both overall and food inflation indicate significant ongoing challenges. The government's efforts, including economic reforms and initiatives such as the student loan scheme, aim to address these issues and provide relief to Nigerian citizens.

In May, headline inflation rose by 2% annually, while core inflation was 1.7%. According to the NBG, the moderate increase in the inflation rate last month was caused by the increase in imported inflation. However, the NBG notes that the change in prices of locally produced goods is still around the targeted rate of 3%. The Central Bank notes the lowered inflation forecast, stating that, all things being equal, inflation will remain below the 3% target in early 2024 and stabilize around it in the medium term.\n\nThe NBG emphasizes that despite the positive trends, uncertainty has increased due to the domestic and geopolitical situation, which increases inflation risks. The bank notes that high exchange rate volatility makes inflationary pressures from imported inflation noteworthy. It also notes that international oil prices have recently declined, although the international food price index has been rising for the last two months. In addition, the inflation expectations have risen in recent months. Domestic economic activity is stronger than expected, driven by increased credit activity.\n\nIn view of the domestic and foreign inflation risks, the NBG says it decided to leave the key interest rate unchanged at 8%. However, \"if additional risks do not materialize, the National Bank will again reduce the key interest rate to its neutral level in a prudent budgetary manner.

In the U.S., inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI measures the average prices paid by consumers for specific categories of goods and services, including food, fuel, and energy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve aims for a target inflation rate of 2% or less each year. This threshold is deemed as being ideal for maintaining employment and price stability. In March 2022, the inflation rate as measured by the CPI hit 8.5%, marking a 40-year high.\n\nHow Inflation Affects 401(k) Retirement Savings\n\nInflation impacts purchasing power. When prices are higher, it costs more money to buy the same things. From a retirement savings perspective, that's problematic, as stocks and other investments do not automatically adjust for inflation. What this means is that extended periods of inflation can erode your 401(k) returns.\n\nSo, for example, if inflation rises to 8.5% and your 401(k) investments return 9%, your net gain actually works out to 0.5%. If your 401(k) returns 7%, on the other hand, your net gain ends up in the negative. Typically, financial advisors and experts aim for a return of 5% to 8% from 401(k) investments. The S&P 500, by comparison, posits a historical return of around 10%, which drops to approximately 7% when adjusted for inflation.\n\nRising inflation means your investments have to work harder to keep pace. How much of a pinch you feel in your 401(k) can depend on how close you are to retirement and what type of investing strategy you're pursuing.\n\nProtecting Your 401(k) Against Inflation\n\nInflation is often driven by a variety of complex factors, most of which the average consumer has no control over. There are, however, some things you can do to insulate your 401(k) retirement savings against the most damaging impacts of inflation.\n\nMaintain (or Increase) Contributions\n\nWhen prices are rising and your paychecks don't go as far, it's tempting to pull back on contributions to 401(k) plans or other retirement accounts. But it's still important to contribute at least enough to get the full company match if one is offered so that your money can continue to grow. If possible, you may even consider raising your contribution rate so that more of your money is going into your plan. Remember, for 2024 you can contribute up to $23,000 to your 401(k), with a $7,500 catch-up contribution allowed if you're 50 or older. (For 2023, it's $22,500 with a $7,500 catch-up contribution.)\n\nDiversify Plan Investments\n\nDiversification simply means spreading your investment dollars across different types of assets in order to minimize risk. During periods of higher prices, diversification can also help with minimizing inflationary impacts to your 401(k).\n\nFor example, you may choose to allocate more of your investments to mutual funds with stocks that rise with inflation. Short-term bonds can also be a safer bet when inflation is higher, since you're not locked in to lower rates for an extended period. You may also consider funds that hold commodities or real estate, both of which can perform well amid higher inflation.\n\nCheck Investment Fees\n\nMinimizing investment fees can be a good move at any time, but especially so when inflation threatens to shrink your 401(k) returns. The less you pay in fees, the more of your returns you get to keep over the long term. When reviewing 401(k) plan fees, consider what you're paying in expense ratios for individual funds you hold. For perspective, in 2023, the average equity mutual fund expense ratio is 0.42%, while the average bond fund expense ratio is 0.37%.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvesting in a 401(k) can be one of the best ways to build wealth over time, particularly if you're able to max out your plan and get the full employer matching contribution. While inflation can be a threat to your retirement savings, there are ways to soften the blow that rising prices may deliver to a 401(k). Keep in mind that a 401(k) isn't your only option for saving, either. If you want to create a comprehensive savings strategy, you may also consider shopping around for an IRA or an online brokerage account to grow your portfolio.", "source": {"uri": "investopedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investopedia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_lake@investopedia.com", "name": "Rebecca Lake", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/401(k)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "401(k)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Purchasing power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hedge (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_stability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Price stability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retirement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retirement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_retirement_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Individual retirement account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutual fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bond (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Retirement Planning", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/zpJIRkdmD7xEYKI9toptDGa6v7o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1298373271-c1de5e87b833462cabd4e9652f1d56b9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Kugler emphasized progress towards the Fed's 2% inflation target despite some setbacks. Her remarks come after the Fed maintained its benchmark interest rate and revised its projections for rate cuts.\n\nInflation is exhibiting encouraging signs of cooling, U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler said on Tuesday, and although it is still too high, as long as economic conditions continue moving in \"the right direction\" it will be appropriate to cut interest rates later this year.\n\nWhile more progress is required on moving inflation back to the Fed's 2% target, \"I believe economic conditions are moving in the right direction,\" Kugler said in the prepared text of a speech titled \"Some Reasons for Optimism about Inflation.\" \"If the economy evolves as I am expecting, it will likely become appropriate to begin easing policy sometime later this year,\" said Kugler, who described the Fed's current interest rate setting as \"sufficiently restrictive\" to cool activity and lower inflation.\n\nHer comments were her first public remarks since last week's Fed policy meeting, when the central bank kept its benchmark interest rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range. The Fed also released updated economic projections that showed its officials had pared back their expectations for rate cuts this year, to one from the three seen in March, after stronger-than-expected inflation data in the first months of 2024. Most analysts equate fewer rate cuts with a later start to them, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the first rate cut will be \"consequential\" because it could reset market expectations.\n\n\"As I stand here today, inflation remains too high, but I am encouraged by the overall progress and trajectory. Recent data on the economy and inflation also give me cautious optimism that we are on track and making continued headway\" toward the Fed's 2% inflation goal, said Kugler, who last spoke publicly about the economic and policy outlook more than two months ago. \"That progress may have paused in the first three months of the year, but information since then on economic activity, the labor market, and inflation points to renewed progress.\"\n\nKugler cited several factors about inflation that are supporting her optimism, including indications of smaller price markups, less frequent price changes, stable inflation expectations and anecdotes from businesses that price increases are becoming harder to push through as consumers become more price sensitive and exhibit \"trading down\" behavior. \"These various indicators - markups, price adjustment frequency, inflation expectations, and anecdotes from a range of sources - suggest that, on balance, price-setting behavior is likely to continue to move closer to consistency with the (Federal Open Market Committee's) inflation target,\" she said.\n\nTo that she added optimism that productivity may continue to improve thanks to the wave of new business formations and the push by firms to invest in artificial intelligence capabilities. Demand is also showing signs of softening, she said, noting that the weaker-than-expected retail sales report for May published earlier on Tuesday \"may be another signal that the long-expected deceleration in consumer spending may finally be upon us.\"\n\nThe labor market is also moving into better balance, she noted.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriana_Kugler", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adriana Kugler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_of_the_Federal_Reserve", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chair of the Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Powell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerome Powell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life_Expectancy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Aging/Life Expectancy", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/14_06_2024_10_52_49_2335122.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, the strong Albanian lek has raised concerns at the Bank of Albania, which has taken measures to stabilize the currency's value against the euro at a level of 100 to 1 over the last two months.

The local farmer frowns and replies, \"Well, Sir, I wouldn't start from here, if I were you.\" Fixed income investors a few years ago would have sympathised. Yields were near all-time lows and vulnerable to upward moves, and bonds were offering little in the way of income. Today's fixed income market looks very different. Yields are at levels that typically pay well above inflation and offer the prospect of capital gains if rates decline. For those seeking attractive returns, you can start from here. We see strong prospects for both healthy income and some additional capital appreciation in the next six months.\n\nFalse starts but easing is underway\n\nFixed income markets have been fixated on the timing of interest rate cuts. This requires not just a focus on economic and inflation data, but on the policymakers themselves. No one is looking to central banks for their forecasting acumen, which has been deplorable. Markets look to central banks because they set policy. In a clear admission of their lack of clairvoyance, they have become highly \"data-dependent\" and reactionary. The issue is that the key metrics they fixate on - inflation and employment - are lagging indicators. This is compounded by the fact that their policy tools also work with a lagged effect. Sticky inflation has led to markets pricing out expected rate cuts, with the US Federal Reserve (Fed) forecast to do one or two rate cuts this year, down from six to seven at the beginning of the year. This approach is a recipe for a policy mistake if inflation does not behave over the coming months.\n\nThe corollary of delayed rate cuts is that it has extended the opportunity for fixed income investors to lock in some attractive yields. Investors are being paid to wait for rate cuts to emerge.\n\nFigure 1: Income yields are well above inflation\n\nSource: Bloomberg, inflation rates, year on-year % change at 30 April 2024: US Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers All-Items, Eurozone Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices. Yields as at 31 May 2024 in chronological order: 3-month US Treasury Bill, US 10-year Treasury Bond, ICE BofA US Corporate Index (yield to worst), ICE BofA US High Yield Index (yield to worst), ICE BofA US Mortgage Backed Securities Index, ICE BofA US ABS & Commercial MBS Index, Germany 3-month Bund, Germany 10-year Bund, ICE BofA Euro Corporate Index (yield to worst), ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index (yield to worst), Credit Suisse Western Europe Leveraged Loan Index. The yield to worst is the lowest yield a bond (index) can achieve provided the issuer(s) does not default; it takes into account special features such as call options (that give issuers the right to call back a bond at a specified date). Yields may vary over time and are not guaranteed.\n\nOutside the US, a global rate cutting cycle is already underway. Rate cuts in emerging markets started in the second half of last year and have since gathered pace. In the developed world, the Swiss National Bank fired the starting gun on rate cuts in March 2024, followed by Sweden's Riksbank in May and the Bank of Canada and the European Central Bank in June. The regime is shifting.\n\nIs the decline in inflation stalling?\n\nThe hold-up in the US is due to inflation. Whether it is airline tickets or motor vehicle insurance or rents, there have been many reasons as to why the decline in inflation has stalled. In accounting, there comes a time when a company uses the 'exceptional items' term a little too often and investors grow sceptical of the strength of a company's earnings. Should similar cynicism be applied to the Fed and its fight against inflation?\n\nWe think not. First, the stalling has occurred at the all-items level, which includes volatile food and energy prices. Core inflation remains on a downward trend. Second, inflation does not move in a straight line so we should expect the occasional volatility. Third, inflation data is notorious for lags and at current levels it is not too far off the Fed's target. In fact, if the US reported inflation using the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices measure (as is common in Europe) US inflation would be running at 2.4%. Moreover, inflation expectations among consumers remain well anchored at around 3% for the coming year in both the US and the Eurozone. Wage demands are also moderating in most economies. Research suggests that wage growth tends to be a symptom of inflation rather than causing it. The decline in inflation is therefore likely to underscore the trend down in wage demands. Patience may be required for a few more months, but the trend remains intact.\n\nFigure 2: Inflation tends to lead wage growth (year-on-year % change)\n\nSource: U.S Bureau of Economic Analysis, Personal Consumption Expenditure excluding food and energy (Core PCE), Wage growth is represented by Employment Cost Index (total compensation, all civilians), quarterly data, year-on-year % change, Q1 1982 to Q1 2024. Core PCE is the Fed's preferred inflation measure. There is no guarantee that past trends will continue, or forecasts will be realised.\n\nDoing nothing is still doing something\n\nAs the UEFA Euro 2024 soccer journey unfolds this summer, one is reminded of some research on goalkeepers and penalty shootouts. Goalkeepers have a tendency to dive in a particular direction to save a penalty (action tends to make the crowd more forgiving), when typically they would save more penalties if they simply stayed in the middle of the goal.\n\nCentral bankers may think that if the economy is growing modestly, labour markets are healthy and inflation is contained, why not stay put? After all, central bankers have a greater reputational loss from allowing inflation to rise than they do from causing economic weakness or unemployment.\n\nYet, they are conscious that their policy also works with lags, so the longer rates are held at current levels, the more financing pressure builds. We have already seen problems exposed among regional banks last year and more recently among companies with excessive debt levels.\n\nSub-investment grade default rates have only risen modestly, however, and are expected to stay around the low mid-single digit mark of between 3-5% in Europe and the US for the remainder of this year. The reason defaults have been low is because investors have been willing to lend to companies. The technical backdrop of debt issuers finding ready buyers has been supportive but part of that rests on the expectation that rates will be lower in the coming year. This encourages investors to lock in yields on issued bonds now while they are relatively high, while taking comfort from the fact that lower rates in the future should be supportive for the economic and corporate backdrop.\n\nEverything in moderation\n\nOutside of a major growth surprise or inflation shock we struggle to see major central banks raising rates. The risk to rates markets therefore is that cuts are fewer and slower than expected. We therefore prefer European markets over the US where Europe's relatively weaker economy offers more visibility of a lower rates trajectory.\n\nFor many fixed income assets, a slower rate-cutting path is not necessarily a bad thing if engendered by strong - but not too strong - economic growth, which is supportive for earnings and cash flows. With an economic backdrop of resilient, albeit moderating, growth in the US, a reviving European economy and less bearishness towards China's economic outlook, there is the potential for credit spreads to grind tighter. Among corporate sectors we continue to prefer companies with good interest cover ratios and strong cash flow and see value opportunities in some of the areas that have been out of favour, such as pockets of real estate.\n\nWe recognise, however, that credit spreads in aggregate are near their historical tights, leaving little cushion should the corporate outlook take a turn for the worse. With that in mind, we see value in diversification, particularly towards securitised debt, such as mortgage-backed securities, asset backed securities and collateralised loan obligations. Here, misconceptions towards these asset classes, combined with a hangover from rates volatility, has meant spreads and yields on offer look compelling. Yields in the securitized sectors are more attractive on a historical basis, and more likely to stay out of trouble in a more severe slowdown.\n\nThe elephant in the room\n\nIt would be remiss not to mention politics, given the second half of the year will see the defining event of numerous elections, including one for a US president. This could shine a spotlight on government debt levels and fiscal profligacy - where France has become the latest sovereign bond issuer to suffer a downgrade. It could also reawaken concerns around protectionism and tariffs on trade, given that easing of supply chain bottlenecks has been instrumental in helping to bring down inflation from its post-COVID highs. Similarly, the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East could take unpredictable turns. Elevated political risk in the second half of 2024 should draw investors to assets that are traditionally lower risk, such as bonds, which offer some protection against a more pronounced slowdown or escalation in geopolitical risks.\n\nIn summary, the narrative of 2024 being a year of policy easing remains intact, even if some central banks have kept markets waiting. Rate cuts offer the potential for capital gains from fixed income but do not overlook the second word in the name of the asset class. Right now, there is plenty of income on offer.", "source": {"uri": "ifamagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFA Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brandon_russell@ifamagazine.com", "name":

At the time, Governor Andrew Bailey left open the possibility of a rate cut in June, saying: \"A change in bank rate in June is neither ruled out nor fait accompli\".\n\nHowever, financial analysts think a June interest rate cut is no longer on the cards.\n\nThe bank did confirm that the economic data would dictate when it would start to cut rates and, according to economist Capital Economics, \"the tone of the incoming data since then [has] been disappointing\".\n\nAlthough the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), which is the overall measure of inflation, is expected to fall back to the Bank of England's target of 2%, service inflation - which measures the cost of services such as holidays, eating out and entertainment - remains around 6%.\n\nMeanwhile, upcoming wage data is creating concerns. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported wage inflation of 6% in the three months to April, which remains high. At the same time, more people are dropping out of the labour market.\n\n\"Barring a dramatic weakening in May's inflation data [on] Wednesday, which the MPC will see in advance, we think the committee will vote decisively by 7-2 in favour of leaving bank rate at 5.25%,\" said Ruth Gregory, deputy chief economist for Capital Economics.\n\nCapital Economics expects to see the first base rate cut in August.\n\nThomas Watts, investment analyst at abrdn Portfolio Solution, said some financial markets are predicting there will not be a base rate cut until summer, which he said will leave investors looking to the bank for hints on when this will come.\n\n\"However, unlike May's press briefing, June's decision will just be accompanied by a brief statement rather than the full monetary policy report and press briefing.\n\n\"So, if there is no change to interest rates this week, there would be little guidance on when this is likely to happen. Last month, seven members of the Monetary Policy Committee voted to hold, while two voted for a cut. It's likely that more of the MPC could join the cut cohort, but probably not enough to force a decision just yet,\" he added.\n\nSteve Matthews, investment director of liquidity at Canada Life Asset Management, predicts another 7-2 vote in favour of holding the base rate at 5.25% in this month's MPC meeting.\n\nHe said: \"Despite recent data supporting a cut - such as the unemployment rate rising to 4.4% and expectations that the CPI will hit 2% on Wednesday - concerns about upcoming wage data and services inflation persist.\n\n\"While the European Central Bank [ECB] made a move last week, the Federal Reserve is taking a more cautious approach. This gives the Bank of England additional opportunity to make a well-timed decision.\n\n\"Although there is light at the end of the tunnel, we are still firmly in the tunnel. We maintain our view that a first cut of 25 basis points in August is still the most likely scenario.\"", "source": {"uri": "yourmoney.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Your Money"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samantha_partington@yourmoney.com", "name": "Samantha Partington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Economics", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capital Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(banker)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Office for National Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_wages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real wages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Labour economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basis point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market liquidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Central Bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Animals", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings/Parodies", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings/Parodies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.yourmoney.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Bank-of-England-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-20", "textStart": 160, "textEnd": 167}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

In April this year, Fiji's annual inflation rate - the rate at which the price of goods and services has increased - rose to 7.1 per cent, the highest observed in the past 10 years.\n\nThe rise in prices have been a result of the VAT increases introduced in the last budget as well as other factors. It is important to note that once the prices of goods and services increase, it is very difficult to remove that price hike.\n\nOngoing inflation causes prices to increase year after year, and due to the accumulative nature of inflation, it is fundamentally important for governments to ensure that inflation is minimised.\n\nSo an increase of 7.1 per cent in one year is alarming. That 7.1 per cent increase is now fixed into prices around Fiji.\n\nIn fact, evidence suggests that the cost of living in Fiji has been substantially increasing for over a decade while wages have lagged behind. The sad reality is that, despite the development rhetoric of successive governments, many Fijians have become poorer. Inflation of this nature is a major failure of government policy.\n\nHow did inflation become a problem in Fiji?\n\nThere are predominantly three ways that inflation can take hold in a nation like Fiji.\n\nFirstly, inflation happens when a country devalues its currency. The Fijian dollar has been devalued four times: twice after the 1987 coup, once under SVT in 1998 and a fourth time under the Bainimarama regime in 2009. Devaluing the Fijian dollar in 2009 made the prices of imports go up. This was, as expected, inflationary.\n\nMarket forces would have disarmed this inflationary threat alongside the right government policies such as disincentives against non-essential imports and a steadying of public and private debt.\n\nHowever, this did not happen. Debt has fuelled consumption, especially import consumption, which has caused inflation to set in. For example, credit for new cars averaged $15m annually in the ten years leading up to 2012, while the annual average in the five years between 2013 to 2017 was almost $100m.\n\nEven though cars were more expensive, they were being purchased through debt and at unprecedented levels.\n\nSecondly, rising public and private debt creates excess money, which increases the money supply. Money in the domestic market competes for goods and services.\n\nHowever, if the money supply increases while productivity remains sluggish, the price for goods and services rises. This has also happened in Fiji since the early 2010s, where government policies have directly and indirectly caused public and private debt to dramatically increase while local productivity has largely remained stagnant.\n\nThirdly, the introduction of a consumption tax like VAT will increase the nominal prices of goods and services. VAT was introduced by the SVT government in 1992, has undergone various adaptations and was increased in the last budget under the Coalition Government, as mentioned above.\n\nImportantly, while consumer and asset prices have increased from these three failures in government policy, wages have not substantively increased. This has resulted in the cost of living rising considerably for the majority of Fijians.\n\nWhile the rhetoric of economic growth is bandied around by governments over the last 10 to 15 years, the growth has been largely due to inflation.\n\nFor this reason, the intrinsic sentiment among the people of Fiji has been that their lives have become more challenging.\n\nWho are the losers?\n\nLow wage earners are the most affected by inflation.\n\nTheir wage increases are always inadequate and delayed, trailing far behind the inflation curve.\n\nIncreases in minimum wage have been desperately inadequate, which has caused great hardship for many Fijians. Generally, the working class in Fiji has become increasingly ill-equipped to cover their basic needs.\n\nFurthermore, the tax data suggests that the middle class has not been able to negotiate their wages in line with inflation either.\n\nIn addition, the middle class tends to have greater access to credit like home and car loans.\n\nThis results in a desire to consume more and enter the property market.\n\nHowever, because of consumer and asset price inflation, the cost of interest payments to banks has become an ever larger percentage of middle class disposable income, while their other daily costs have also risen.\n\nWho are the winners?\n\nInflation incentivises the wealthy who have capital (the capital class) to invest, and is a mechanism by which businesses expand.\n\nInflation guarantees that, over time, the price of an asset will increase while the value of debt once required to purchase the asset becomes less significant.\n\nInflation also guarantees future increases in prices for goods and services, which tends to mean potentially higher future profits for businesses from investments they make in the present.\n\nMany governments such as FijiFirst and the present Coalition Government encourage economic growth through a pro-inflation policy as part of a 'trickle down' economic ideology -- that is to say, supporting the wealthy so that their wealth can trickle down to the rest of the population.\n\nAs Ben Bernanke, former chairperson of the US Federal Reserve said: \"Low and stable inflation in many countries is an important accomplishment that will continue to bring significant benefits.\"\n\nHigh wage earners act similarly to the capital class.\n\nTheir investments in such things as real estate initiate future asset price inflation which they benefit from because they can negotiate for wages that stay above the inflation curve, shielding them from any cost of living increases.\n\nIt is ironic that members of the government have recently negotiated an increase to their wage to shield themselves from the very inflation that they have created.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe economic policies of the FijiFirst and Coalition Government since 2009 have caused inflation. Such policies as devaluing the dollar, increasing VAT and creating a debt-and consumption-fuelled economy have not created the type of growth that brings broad wealth to Fijians.\n\nWealth created by the capital class has not \"trickled down\" to the rest of the population. What has transpired is unprecedented inflation and a rise in the cost of living which has created extraordinary levels of poverty and a fragile economy.\n\nWhile low inflation can be an important mechanism for economic growth, excess inflation causes wealth disparity.\n\nInflation can be seen as a mechanism that directs money away from the poor and middle class to incentivise the rich.\n\nTherefore, it is imperative that governments keep inflation in check. They, and especially their finance ministers, need to be scrutinised for the way they manage inflation.", "source": {"uri": "fijitimes.com.fj", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Fiji Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consumer debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Value-added tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_and_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Goods and services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_living", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cost of living"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fijian_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fijian dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devaluation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Devaluation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Currency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron\u2013Clegg_coalition", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumption tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minimum wage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FijiFirst", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FijiFirst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trickle-down economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_of_wealth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Distribution of wealth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_and_discretionary_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disposable and discretionary income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Bernanke", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Bernanke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Working class"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Labor", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.fijitimes.com.fj/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Shopping004_15623_44983-1024x684.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

He outlined the government's plan to implement monetary and fiscal policy measures aimed at significantly lowering the inflation rate to 12% in the next fiscal year.\n\nHowever, this optimistic projection was met with skepticism by members of the House. One representative questioned the feasibility of such a drastic reduction, asking, \"What kind of methods can we use to bring the price down to 12% from the current level?\" The representative also criticized the Ministry of Finance for presenting similar ambitious targets in the past, which have not been achieved. Last year, the government aimed to reduce inflation from 36% to 15%, a target that was not met, leading to doubts about the current plan's credibility.\n\nIn response, Minister Ahmed explained that the government has introduced several measures, including a monetary policy credit cap through the National Bank and a reduction in Direct Advance lending to the private sector. He also mentioned that efforts are being made to reduce jobs in agriculture and tourism sectors as part of the strategy to control inflation.\n\nDespite these measures, Ahmed admitted that the government has struggled to bring inflation down to the desired levels. He cited long-standing supply constraints, limited foreign exchange availability, sharp increases in global commodity prices, including oil, and disruptions along the Red Sea trade corridor as significant challenges. The minister emphasized that these structural issues, many of which are beyond the government's control, make it difficult to curb inflation quickly.\n\nThe criticism highlights the ongoing economic challenges Ethiopia faces as it grapples with high inflation rates. The government's ambitious target to reduce inflation to 12% by next year is seen by many as overly optimistic, given the persistent structural problems and external economic pressures. As the government continues to implement monetary and fiscal policies, it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be sufficient to achieve the projected reduction in inflation and improve living conditions for Ethiopians.", "source": {"uri": "capitalethiopia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital Ethiopia Newspaper"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Shide", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ahmed Shide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Ethiopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Ethiopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Peoples'_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "House of Peoples' Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign exchange market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Petroleum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commodity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ethiopia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Global_Governance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Global Governance", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "http://www.capitalethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/photo_2024-06-17_11-03-33-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

How is it staggering? Last month in April, inflation was 33.4 something. Then it moved by a mere 0.26%.\n\n\"In fact, from March to April, inflation slowed down. So things are improving. People will soon begin to feel the impact of all these reductions.\n\n\"I had a call from my town a few days ago, with someone telling me the price of garri is going down. Inflation is on a reduction level. And it'll continue to go down.\n\n\"This government when it came in May last year, inflation was at 23.65%. The movement from there till now is about 10.4%.\n\n\"We already had some problems before this government came into office. We didn't create all the problems. We inherited many of them. And this government is making so much effort to reduce these problems.\n\n\"One of those things that the government is doing is the introduction of a student loan scheme. Millions of students will benefit from this. This will also help the parents at home,\" Onanuga said.\n\nThe National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported that Nigeria's inflation rate rose to 33.95% in May 2024 from 33.69% in April 2024, with food inflation reaching 40.66% year-on-year.", "source": {"uri": "naijanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ikenna_ngere@naijanews.com", "name": "Ikenna Ngere", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TVC_News", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TVC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bola_Tinubu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bola Tinubu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Garri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Student loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Bola-Tinubu-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

The Bank's Governor Andrew Bailey said last month that there were positive signs that a cut might be possible soon, noting a sharp decline in inflation and its approach towards the 2% target.\n\nHowever, the consensus among experts is that the Bank isn't quite poised to lower the rates, which have been at 5.25% since August of the previous year, the peak since 2008. With the General Election campaign in full swing during June's meeting, some analysts believe it could sway the Bank from altering rates.\n\nDuring the pre-election period, the Bank's officials are restricted from making speeches or public comments. Investec economist Sandra Horsfield highlighted the significance of this silence, pointing out that if the Bank were to \"surprise the market\" with a rate change on Thursday, it wouldn't be able to \"correct any misinterpretations\" until post-General Election, scheduled for July 4.\n\n\"Why rock the boat, when there is no need for haste and no opportunity to steady it? ,\" she queried. Market predictions lean towards a hold on interest rates this month, with only a slim possibility of a reduction.\n\nMoreover, experts have noted that last month's inflation data, particularly the services sector inflation which exceeded the Bank's expectations, will have been a key consideration for the Bank. This measure, which examines price increases across the sector, is \"overwhelmingly what is driving policy decisions right now\", according to economists at ING.\n\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) would also have had access to new inflation data for May on Wednesday, which some economists believe will either reach or come very close to 2%. Analysts at AJ Bell suggested that the Bank's task may have been slightly complicated by both the announcement of a general election for July 4 and the latest batch of inflation data.\n\nThey said: \"Governor Andrew Bailey and his colleagues on the MPC may not wish to act in any way that could be seen as favouring one political party over another in the run-up to July's poll.\"\n\nInvestec has predicted that the first rate cut could occur in August, but that two committee members, Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden, are likely to vote again in favour of a cut on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lawrence_matheson@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Lawrence Matheson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "anna_wise@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Anna Wise", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Bailey_(banker)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Bailey (banker)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central bank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_analyst", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial analyst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swati_Dhingra", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swati Dhingra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_1974_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "February 1974 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Ramsden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Ramsden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/money/article33045841.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_the-bank-of-england-is-set-to-avoid-rocking-the-boat-with-a-pre-election-rate-hold-aaron-chownpa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 1238, "textEnd": 1244, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

that things are moving in the right direction\".\n\nThe announcement raised hopes that the prolonged period of higher interest rates could soon be eased.\n\nBut experts think the bank is not quite ready to reduce rates, which have stood at 5.25 per cent since August last year, the highest level since 2008.\n\nJune's meeting happening during the general election campaign could be enough to deter a rate cut, some analysts predicted.\n\nThe bank is abiding by the rules of the pre-election campaign period, meaning its policymakers cannot make any speeches or public statements.\n\nSandra Horsfield, an economist for Investec, said this matters because were policymakers to \"surprise the market\" with its decision on Thursday, it would not be in a position to \"correct any misinterpretations\" about its rates decision until after the general election, which is on July 4.\n\n\"Why rock the boat, when there is no need for haste and no opportunity to steady it?,\" she asked.\n\nFinancial markets are expecting interest rates to be kept the same this month, with just a small chance that they will be cut.\n\nFurthermore, experts said that the bank will have taken note of last month's inflation data, with services sector inflation coming in ahead of the bank's expectations.\n\nThe measure, which looks at price rises across the sector, is \"overwhelmingly what is driving policy decisions right now\", economists at ING said.\n\nThe MPC will also have seen new inflation data for May on Wednesday, which some economists think will hit, or fall very close to, 2 per cent.\n\nA group of analysts for AJ Bell said the bank's \"job may have been slightly complicated by both the calling of a general election for July 4 and the last batch of inflation data\".\n\n\"Governor Andrew Bailey and his colleagues on the MPC may not wish to act in any way that could be seen as favouring one political party over another in the run-up to July's poll,\" they said.\n\nInvestec said it thinks the first rate cut could come in August, but that two members of the committee: Swati Dhingra and Dave Ramsden, were likely to vote again in favour of a cut on

Addressing key costs such as the business rates burden, which leads to customers paying a higher price at the till, must be a priority for whoever forms the next government.\"\n\nStay informed:\n\nOur editor carefully curates a daily newsletter filled with up-to-date news, analysis and research, click here to subscribe to the FREE newsletter sent straight to your inbox and why not follow us on Linkedin to receive the latest updates on our research and analysis - UK, Europe and global.", "source": {"uri": "internetretailing.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "InternetRetailing"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_searles@internetretailing.net", "name": "Katie Searles", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_prices", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food prices"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furniture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Furniture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_for_National_Statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Office for National Statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_England", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drink", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Retail_Consortium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Retail Consortium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Relief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_rates_in_England", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business rates in England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confectionery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Confectionery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chocolate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chocolate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Food Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Consulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Hunger_Relief", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Hunger Relief", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture_Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Picture Ratings", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation/Food_and_Water", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation/Food and Water", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://internetretailing.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/shutterstock_164712785-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2000-12-", "textStart": 910, "textEnd": 923}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

In the current conditions and expectations categories, the survey fell below economists' expectations.\n\nYear-ahead inflation expectations were unchanged this month at 3.3%, but above the 2.3-3.0% range seen in the two years prior to the pandemic, according to the press release. Long-run inflation expectations rose from 3.0% last month to 3.1% in June, significantly above the 2.2-2.6% range seen in the two years pre-pandemic. This survey indicates how weak the U.S. economy is and how consumers are feeling the persistent inflation.\n\nJoe Biden posted on X \"Zero. That was monthly inflation in May. There is more to do still, but this is welcome progress.\" Inflation was 3.3% in May, and services, shelter, and electricity increased by 5.3%, 5.4%, and 5.9%, respectively. A zero increase in June in the CPI reading is not zero inflation in the month. Consumers in America may find these optimistic messages exaggerated and almost propagandistic. Furthermore, CPI inflation should have been significantly lower, close to 2%, months ago. Is it welcome progress, as the president says? Not really. However, the underlying message of the X post is probably closer to \"it could have been worse.\".\n\nWe must remember that the Inflation Reduction Act has perpetuated inflation, as unnecessarily aggressive fiscal policy sabotaged the Fed's decision to reduce the quantity of money in the system. The federal deficit is fueling inflation and keeping the CPI measure above the level where it should have been for at least twelve months.\n\nNeo-Keynesians frequently point to the path of disinflation as a triumph of the soft-landing approach. The economy did not enter a recession, unemployment is low, and prices are cooling off gradually. There is an evident counterargument to this optimistic view. The United States economy would have recovered faster, and consumers would not have suffered flat real wage growth, a loss of purchasing power and crippling debt. The idea that government spending has strengthened the economy has no merit. Excessive government intervention is a direct cause of the unsustainable deficit, rising taxes, ongoing inflation, and weaker productivity growth.\n\nBoth the labour participation rate and employment-to-population ratios remain below pre-pandemic levels. Real wage growth has been almost flat for years. Inflation is a hidden tax, and it has worsened the recovery path of the United States. The deficit has fueled inflation.\n\nThe U.S. consumer has been adding debt to maintain consumption, and credit card debt has reached new record levels. This is not a strong economy.\n\nThe problem is that the economy is weakening in the middle of an enormous fiscal expansion and debt continues to rise at an alarming pace while interest expenses reach new highs. Keynesian policies have weakened the fabric of the private sector and small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nThe discontent we are seeing in all developed countries is typical. Governments have focused on inflating headline macro figures, forgetting the average consumer and small businesses. Large corporations have been able to navigate these incorrect policies because of their financial muscle. However, families and small businesses are living a Keynesian nightmare. Employed yet impoverished, while businesses struggle to stay afloat. So, what is the problem? The imbalances in the public sector will generate less growth, higher taxes, and more challenges in the future. Public debt is not a tool for growth; it is a burden.\n\nThere have been a few comments in financial papers stating that the consumer confidence reading may come from negative analysis on social media. The St. Louis Fed reports that \"observers have cited disproportionally circulated negative economic news on social media as one possible reason for poor sentiment, disconnected from a robust economy.\" Another common view is that while inflation is cooling, the price level is still higher than it was a few years ago, and consumers have not yet adjusted. High prices are a factor, but they primarily work by eroding incomes, which has been found to have considerable influence on consumer sentiment.\" Blaming negative economic news makes no sense. The Consumer Sentiment Survey was at an all-time high in 2019, a period when there was general media negativity regarding the economy and the administration. Inflation and higher taxes are more likely reasons why consumers are depressed. Even the gross domestic income figure shows that things are not as solid as the government thinks. If we look at the discrepancy between GDP and GDI, or the difference between the unemployment rate and labour force participation, as well as real wages compared to nominal readings, we can understand why citizens are unhappy.

The April total was revised lower as well, to a decline of 0.2% from the original estimate of 0%.\n\nThe closely tracked control group number rose 0.4% on the month, again missing Wall Street forecasts of a 0.5% advance. This figure, which excludes autos, building materials, office supplies, gas-station sales and tobacco, feeds into the government's GDP calculations.\n\nThe Atlanta Fed will update its GDPNow forecasting tool later in the session.

However, one of the main things about inflation is when it comes down, it doesn't mean that prices are coming down. It means that prices are rising - but more slowly. For example, if something cost \u00a31 last year, and the level of inflation sits at 2% - this means that the price would be \u00a31.02 now.\n\nAccording to the ONS, the largest \"downward trend\" was from food with prices of food and non-alcoholic drinks rising by 1.7% in the year to May, down from 2.9% in April. This is the lowest rate since October 2021 and has eased for 14 months from the peak of 19.2% in March last year. This was the highest annual rate seen for more than 45 years.\n\nThe ONS confirmed that the annual rates of inflation eased for nine of the 11 food and non-alcoholic beverages classes in the 12 months to May 2024. In these cases, the ONS said that prices actually fell between April 2024 and May 2024, compared with a monthly rise a year ago.\n\nThe main downward effects came from a combination of bread and cereals, vegetables, sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery. The main products which contributed to easing rates included breakfast cereals, potato crisps and bars of chocolate. However, for sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery the rate recorded today was the lowest rate since June 2022.\n\nGrocery inflation eased for the last 16 months in a row according to the latest data from Kantar. The analysis group - which tracks supermarket till prices, sales and market share - said its measure of grocery inflation slowed to 2.1% in the four weeks to June 9 from 2.4% the previous month.

Though not expected to alter the Bank of England's policy, the data will influence broader economic sentiment. Meanwhile, subdued U.S. trading and ongoing tech rallies in Asia capture market attention.\n\nA look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Ankur Banerjee Investors will get another chance to see if the global disinflation story gains more traction with UK inflation data taking centre stage on Wednesday. Its outcome though may not significantly affect the Bank of England's policy review the day after.\n\nHeadline inflation in May is expected to be 2% year over year - back to the BoE's target - after April's 2.3%, with the easing in prices a result of household energy bills easing. But the central bank is widely expected to stand pat on rates as policymakers focus on wage growth and service sector inflation, which is estimated to come in at 5.5% in May.\n\nData last week showed British wages picked up more quickly than forecast, keeping the pressure on the central bank to keep rates higher for longer. The inflation reading and the consequent policy decision will provide investors with some clarity ahead of Britain's general elections in July, with the blue-chip FTSE 100 sliding 3% since hitting a record high in May.\n\nMarkets may be feeling a sense of deja vu. After all, it was just last week when mild U.S. inflation readings came in hours before an overall hawkish stance by Federal Reserve officials, who cut their median projection for three quarter-point rate cuts to just one for the year.\n\nWith U.S. markets closed, trading may be subdued throughout the day. Sterling remains muted and was last at $1.2711, while the dollar wobbled after retail sales data on Tuesday indicated signs of exhaustion among U.S. consumers.\n\nThe data slightly pushed up expectations of a rate cut in September, although with the Fed being so data dependent those expectations will be volatile in the near term. At the start of the year, traders had priced in as much as 160 basis points of cuts in 2024, but now anticipate 48 bps of easing. No such worries for Nvidia as the AI darling dethroned tech heavyweight Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company at $3.335 trillion.\n\nThe rally in technology stocks continued into Asia taking regional stocks higher, with tech-focused Taiwan stocks scaling yet another record high, while South Korean stocks touched their strongest since January 2022.

In a report that captured the asset manager's semi-annual Outlook Forum discussions, investment professionals identified a new macroeconomic regime characterised by higher inflation, elevated rates and lower growth, primarily due to supply constraints.\n\nThis unique 'macro cocktail' is expected to persist, driven by factors such as population ageing, the restructuring of global supply chains and the transition to low-carbon economies, all of which constrain production and require increased capital investment.\n\nJust seven months ago, market expectations leaned towards repeated US Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2024. However, recent trends indicate a shift towards sustained higher rates.\n\nRead more: What is a stock split and why are big tech companies opting for it?\n\nThe Federal Reserve has adopted a cautious stance, opting to maintain the current rate levels, rather than implement the anticipated cuts. This approach reflects a gradual acceptance that interest rates need to stay high, not just in the short term, but also in the longer term. This is evidenced by the Fed's upward revisions of its long-run interest rate estimates, which have been reflected in market pricing.\n\nWhen it comes to the UK, BlackRock is waiting on the latest inflation data - due on Wednesday - to see if falling goods prices are bringing inflation down enough for the Bank of England to start cutting policy rates.\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) recently cut rates amid improving growth, ongoing inflation above target and record-low unemployment. However, BlackRock analysts believe this does not signal the start of a significant rate-cutting cycle. They predict that even if the Fed initiates easing later this year, it will be a measured process, rather than a rapid reduction.\n\nAccording to BlackRock's data, market pricing has adjusted to this new reality of prolonged higher rates. US stocks have reached record highs, with a year-to-date increase of approximately 14%. US 10-year Treasury yields have fallen by about 20 basis points, settling near 4.20%.\n\nMay's Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the US came in below expectations, largely due to a broad moderation in core services inflation. Despite the Fed's steady rate decision and projections indicating only one rate cut this year, BlackRock remains cautious about relying heavily on the Fed's policy signals due to their data-dependent nature.\n\nAmid this market volatility, BlackRock forecasts a scenario where a concentrated group of AI winners drives returns over the next six to 12 months.\n\nRead more: UK interest rates set to remain on hold ahead of general election\n\nThey remain overweight on technology and the AI theme, arguing that the AI rally is underpinned by earnings and has further potential. Unlike the dot-com bubble, today's mega-cap tech companies are profitable and have healthy balance sheets, supporting a pro-risk investment stance.\n\nBlackRock analysts, however, caution that the initial capital expenditure (capex) required for AI development, such as building data centres, could be inflationary in the near term. Since the 'ChatGPT moment' last year, there has been a significant increase in spending on AI infrastructure and this trend is expected to continue. The resulting demand on resources could create bottlenecks, leading to short-term inflation before any long-term productivity gains are realised.\n\nThe firm notes that eight out of 11 S&P 500 sectors expanded net profit margins in Q1, indicating strong earnings momentum. That is why BlackRock prefers equities over fixed income, but it still recognises the appeal of short-term bonds for income in a higher-for-longer rate environment.\n\nHere are BlackRock's granular views per market:\n\nUnited States: \"We are neutral in our largest portfolio allocation. Falling inflation and coming Fed rate cuts can underpin the rally's momentum. We are ready to pivot once the market narrative shifts.\n\n\"We are overweight overall when incorporating our US-centric positive view on artificial intelligence (AI). We think AI beneficiaries can still gain while earnings growth looks robust.\"\n\nEurope: \"We are underweight. While valuations look fair to us, we think the near-term growth and earnings outlook remain less attractive than in the US and Japan - our preferred markets.\n\nUK: \"We are neutral. We find attractive valuations better reflect the weak growth outlook and the Bank of England's sharp rate hikes to fight sticky inflation.\"\n\nJapan: \"We are overweight. Mild inflation and shareholder-friendly reforms are positives. We see the BOJ policy shift as a normalisation, not a shift to tightening.\"\n\nEmerging markets: \"We are neutral. We see growth on a weaker trajectory and see only limited policy stimulus from China. We prefer EM debt over equity.\"\n\nChina: \"We are neutral.

Image: Reuters\n\nAs per the OECD Economic Outlook, May 2024, India will be the fastest growing emerging economy amongst G20 nations. Economic growth in India is expected to be at 6.6% in 2024 and 2025 outperforming its major competitors in BRICS economies, Indonesia and T\u00fcrkiye among others. This optimism has also been reflected in the provisional estimates (PE) released by the National Statistical Office (NSO), MOSPI, GoI on May 31, 2024, where the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is predicted to grow by 8.2% on y-o-y basis (in 2022-23, the growth rate is estimated to be at 7.0%) while the Gross Value Added (GVA) is predicted to grow by 7.2% in 2023-24 over the previous period's growth rate of 6.7%.\n\nHowever, major components from demand and supply side growth exhibit a declining trend in the annual data. The supply side GDP growth measured in terms of Gross Value Added (GVA) is expected to show signs of recovery in the secondary sector led by the manufacturing and construction sector. While primary and tertiary sectors are expected to decline where significant declining trends emerge in the agriculture and services sector. The GDP from the expenditure side comprises consumption, investment, government spending and net exports which are also known as four engines or drivers of growth. The growth in investment i.e. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) is estimated to grow from 6.62% in 2022-23 to 8.98% in 2023-24 as a result of continuous thrust on capital and infrastructure expenditure by the government. Nevertheless, other components of demand side GDP are projected to decline in 2023-24. Both the government expenditure (GFCE) and exports are estimated to decline significantly from 9.00% and 13.39% in 2022-23 to 2.45% and 2.63% in 2023-24 respectively. Similarly, there has been no respite on the burgeoning imports in 2023-24 as it registered more than proportionate growth vis-\u00e0-vis the exports. Failure to contain rising imports may prove detrimental to the overall balance of payments situation in the absence of adequate capital inflows.\n\nIt is also important to note that during the previous year, higher growth level co-existed with the elevated level of inflationary pressures in the economy. The persistence of inflationary pressures has been reflected in the dwindling private consumption demand. The private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) is expected to decline from 6.77% in 2022-23 to 4.02% in 2023-24 on an annual basis as per the PE. Notably, there has been a continuous decline in the share of PFCE in the overall GDP from 58.1% in 2021-22 to 58.0% in 2022-23 and 55.8% in 2023-24. The continuous fall in the share of private consumption in the GDP is visible not only in the yearly growth trend but also in the trend of quarterly growth on a y-o-y basis (See Chart 1). Tepid growth in the PFCE along with a continuous decline in the share of PFCE in rising GDP indicate fall in the consumer expenditure on goods and services in the economy as a result of persistent and sticky inflation.\n\nApart from that, the imported inflation in terms of sudden rise in international crude oil prices and volatility in the food prices pose credible threats to the headline inflation in India. As per the headline inflation data released by the MOSPI, GoI on June 12, 2024, food inflation has still remained at an elevated level of 8.69% in May 2024 as compared to 8.70% in April 2024. The rise in food inflation was led by an increase in the inflation rate of vegetables (27.33%) followed by pulses and products (17.34%), cereals and products (8.69%) among others. Factors such as intense heatwaves, vagaries of monsoon, crop damage, uncertainty in the international commodity prices may aggravate the food inflation situation going ahead.\n\nIn this context, it is important to note that the adoption of easy and accommodative monetary or fiscal policies has the potential to generate aggregate demand and accelerate economic growth. However, the threat of inflation looms large if there is no commensurate increase in the aggregate supply in the economy which is necessary to maintain the equilibrium. This is particularly significant as the economy is experiencing a dwindling growth in the agriculture sector. Moreover, the results of May 2024 round of bi-monthly households' inflation expectations survey released by the RBI on June 07, 2024 reveal that the inflation is expected to increase by 20 bps and 10 bps in upcoming three months and one year respectively.\n\nAs per the official estimates of GoI, India has ensured a decent economic growth where it is estimated to achieve 8.2% growth rate in 2023-24 in real terms amidst several impediments. The RBI has also been able to ensure the 'disinflation glide path' while taming the headline inflation. However, it is also important to note that the RBI has not yet achieved the mandated inflation target of 4.0% adopted in the flexible inflation targeting framework on a sustainable basis. Keeping all these factors in mind, in the upcoming monetary policy resolutions, the monetary policy committee of RBI should be focussing on achieving the price stability in the economy on a durable basis before arriving at any rate cuts.\n\n(Chinmay Joshi is the Research Associate, Finance and Economics, at Bhavan's SPJIMR, Mumbai.)", "source": {"uri": "financialexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Financial Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Emerging market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G20", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "G20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OECD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_value_added", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gross value added"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supply-side economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tertiary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sector_of_the_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Secondary sector of the economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BRICS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumption_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumption (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_payments", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance of payments"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_good", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Final good"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_of_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance of trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mumbai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Import_and_Export", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Import and Export", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Construction_and_Maintenance/Estimating", "label": "dmoz/Business/Construction and Maintenance/Estimating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rupee-Reuters.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-06-", "textStart": 3417, "textEnd": 3424}, {"amb": false, "date": "2007-06-", "textStart": 4490, "textEnd": 4497}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

The monthly change in the consumer price index (CPI) was 0.2%.\n\nAnnual rates for four of the twelve product groups, including food and non-alcoholic beverages (NAB), remained steady between April and May.\n\nHigher rates were recorded for transport, alcoholic beverages & tobacco and recreation & culture. Inflation was softer for miscellaneous goods & services, communication, clothing & footwear, health and restaurants & hotels.\n\nWhile food inflation has stalled, some categories have remained high, with hot drinks like coffee still seeing inflation close to 18% - and the cost to brew a cup being almost double the price of a few years back.\n\nFood inflation stalls\n\nAfter five consecutive months of decline, food and NAB inflation remained steady at 4.7% in May, unchanged from April. Bread and cereals continued to trend downward, slowing further to 3.9%. This is the lowest annual reading for bread and cereals since February 2022, when the rate was 3.7%.\n\nNine of the twenty bread and cereal products in the inflation basket are cheaper than a year ago. Rusks, hot cereals, pasta, and savoury biscuits registered the largest price decreases. However, inflation remains notably hot for rice, pizza and pies, sweet biscuits, cakes and tarts, and bread rolls.\n\nMilk, eggs, and cheese inflation moderated for a fifth consecutive month, on the back of slower price increases for cheese, selected milk products, and eggs. The annual rate for eggs remains elevated at 21.0% but is softer than April's 25.1%.\n\nInflation for sugar, sweets, and desserts also continued a downward trajectory, dampened by lower rates for sugar, jam, chocolate, and ice cream. Although sugar inflation cooled in May, annual increases for both white and brown varieties remain in double-digit territory, at 18.8% and 15.8%, respectively.\n\nMay saw an uptick in inflation for hot beverages, oils and fats, fish, fruit, vegetables, and meat. Inflation for hot beverages quickened from 11.4% in April to 14,2% in May, the highest since January 2023 (16.4%). Inflation for instant coffee, ground coffee, coffee beans, and black tea stands above 10%. Instant coffee prices rose by an annual 17.9%, up from 13.8% in April.\n\nDigging a little deeper into the data, the average price for instant coffee (250 g) was 82% higher in May 2024 than in January 2017 (when Stats SA started publishing average prices).\n\nMany coffee drinkers enjoy sugar and milk in their favourite brew, and these have also risen in price over the same period, although not as sharply as coffee\n\nOther notable price changes in May\n\nWith winter chills currently setting in, the price for cold & flu medication witnessed an annual rise of 11.1%. Other health-related products that recorded relatively large increases include eyedrops (up 15.9%), laxatives (up 11.3%), cough syrup (up 8.1%) and vitamins (up 7.1%). Despite these increases, overall inflation for health products cooled from 7.7% in April to 5.8% in May.\n\nTransport quickened to 6.3% from 5.7% in April. This is the highest rate for the category since October 2023 (7.4%). Fuel was the major culprit, with petrol and diesel prices increasing on average by 9.3% over the last 12 months (and by 0,6% since April 2024).\n\nThe index for restaurants and hotels rose by an annual 6.5%. Hotel prices were up by 8.0% over the same period, with hotels in Gauteng, Free State, and Limpopo registering increases higher than 10%.\n\nThe miscellaneous goods & services category recorded an annual rate of 7.1%, slightly softer than 7.2% in April. Personal care products recorded a fifth consecutive month of disinflation, slowing to 7.0% in May from a recent high of 10.3% in December 2023.

That goal lacks a firm basis in economic theory and empirical research and represents a consensus of convenience among central bankers worldwide about the trade-offs between achieving price stability and maximizing employment.\n\nAs former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan put it, \"Price stability is that state in which expected changes in the general price level do not effectively alter business or household decisions.\"\n\nThe optimal inflation target (P*) is not so high that consumers rush to spend today in anticipation of higher prices tomorrow. That would encourage spending at a pace at which demand chronically exceeds supply, and inflation would rocket up as it did in the 1970s.\n\nP* should not be so low that businesses are reluctant to invest. It shouldn't create fear that falling prices would make servicing debt, which is essential to most enterprises, overly burdensome in periods of slack demand.\n\nWhen pressed by legislation in 1989, central bankers in New Zealand came up with 2% in an offhanded way. But the idea seemed sensible, spread to central banks in Canada, Sweden and elsewhere, and was formally adopted by the Fed in 2012.\n\nUnfortunately, P* is not fixed.\n\nBetween the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 and COVID-19, the Fed's monetary policy was often quite accommodating, yet inflation averaged only 1.5% from 2009 to 2020.\n\nWith the availability of inexpensive labor and industrialization in China and elsewhere in Southeast Asia, globalization accelerated by World Trade Organization tariff cuts, and China's entry into the system in 2001 did much to suppress prices of goods, but now things have flipped.\n\nGlobalization is undergoing realignment as businesses seek to harden supply chains in response to the risks imposed by U.S. and European tensions with China, Russia and Iran. These create difficulties for many U.S. businesses in securing the goods they need to make final products and deliver services.\n\nFinancial crisis and COVID-19 relief spending have left governments in most major economies strapped with debt. Given the above-mentioned geopolitical tensions, they are under pressure to borrow even more to boost defense spending.\n\nThese forces will persist alongside an aging global population that will liquidate assets -- older people in many countries drawing down the equivalent of IRAs to finance retirement. This will cause aggregate demand to outrun supply or at least challenge it.\n\nP* could prove much higher than 2%, and slavish adherence to accomplishing 2% inflation could cause chronic fits and starts of monetary tightening and for inflation to ratchet higher, similar to the years before then-Fed Chairman Paul Volcker slaying the Great Inflation in the early 1980s.\n\nNotable macroeconomists and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggest that the neutral rate of interest (R*), which is high enough to keep inflation reasonably steady but not so high as to stifle growth, is greater than the interest rates that prevailed in the decade preceding COVID-19.\n\nWhether the Fed achieves 2% or concedes to aim higher, long-term interest rates, as measured by the 10-year Treasury rate, should average much higher than the 2.35% achieved from 2009 to 2020.\n\nIf sustainable inflation becomes 3% to 4%, the 10-year Treasury rate would be 5% to 6%. Rising from present levels would reduce the market value of long-term bonds currently in investors' portfolios.\n\nIndividual investors need to recognize that long-term bonds, such as those held in IRA funds with retirement targets and college savings portfolios, are at risk of losing value as inflation and interest rates rise.\n\nThat interest rate risk even applies to seemingly safe U.S. government bonds.\n\nThough longer-term government bonds are paying historically high interest rates -- the current 10-year Treasury rate is somewhat above 4% -- investors are at risk of taking capital losses if bonds are not held to maturity.\n\nSome portfolio managers are shifting investments toward equities, carefully selected property and resources, but the latter two choices are tough for ordinary investors to evaluate and spread risk.\n\nInstead, recognize that larger companies -- such as those that dominate the S&P 500 -- often have the pricing power to profit from inflation, technological expertise to benefit from the great forces of change such as artificial intelligence and de-risking supply chains, and heft to diversify risks in property and commodity markets.\n\nMore than ever, good long-term investing for retirement or young children's college funds should veer toward stocks rather than bonds. Ordinary people should plan to purchase bonds or fixed income assets that mature when the cash is needed.\n\nMy money is in low-fee index funds, like the Vanguard and USAA S&P 500 funds, and I wouldn't recommend a choice I don't pursue myself.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_morici@washingtontimes.com",

That is largely because the actual rate of inflation exceeded this year's 3.2% cost-of-living bump in March, April and May.\n\nINFLATION IS UP 20% SINCE BIDEN TOOK OFFICE\n\n\"The higher inflation indicates that consumers are still experiencing an erosion in buying power,\" Mary Johnson, a retired Social Security and Medicare analyst, previously said.\n\nThe average monthly Social Security payment in 2024 is $1,907, according to the Social Security Administration. But that is just a fraction of the $4,818 that Americans age 65 and older reported spending in 2022.\n\nSocial Security is not intended to be an individual's sole source of income in retirement and, on average, replaces about 40% of a person's annual pre-retirement earnings. However, about 27% of Americans rely on it as their only source of income, according to the survey.\n\nConsumers are grappling with a number of financial headwinds, including steep interest rates and ongoing inflation that has made the cost of just about everything from rent to gasoline to groceries more expensive.\n\nWhile inflation has fallen considerably from a peak of 9.1% notched during June 2022, it remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% goal. And when compared with January 2021, before the inflation crisis began, prices are up a stunning 20%.\n\nAs a result, about 61% of respondents reported struggling financially on a daily basis.\n\nINFLATION INCREASES 3.4% IN APRIL AS PRICES REMAIN ELEVATED\n\nThe uncertain economic landscape has many Americans reconsidering whether retirement is a realistic goal.\n\nMore than one-quarter of all non-retired investors said they would likely be forced to return to the workforce at some point due to inadequate savings if they were to retire within the next 12 months, while 19% doubt that they will ever save up enough money to retire, according to a separate survey published by Nationwide.\n\nAn additional 19% said they will retire later than planned because of inflation.\n\nHigh inflation has created severe financial pressures for most U.S. households, which are forced to pay more for everyday necessities like food and rent. Grocery prices are up more than 21% from the start of 2021, while shelter costs are up 18.37%, according to FOX Business calculations. Energy prices, meanwhile, are up 38.4.%.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nPrice hikes are particularly devastating for lower-income Americans because they tend to spend more of their already-stretched paycheck on necessities and therefore have less flexibility to save money.\n\nThe typical U.S. household needed to pay $227 more a month in March to purchase the same goods and services it did one year ago because of still-high inflation.

This is a debate usually confined to growth numbers, with the legitimacy of high growth often questioned on the basis of anecdotal evidence or an underlying data point.\n\nHowever, when it comes to inflation, it is no secret that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) needs a complete overhaul. And while the high weight of food items in the CPI basket hogs the headlines, the issue with housing is entirely different and rather mind-boggling.\n\nConsider the past 15 months or so, when CPI housing inflation gradually eased from almost 5% in March 2023 to just 2.56% in May 2024. Anyone who has tried to rent a home over this period would disagree, with property website Magicbricks' Rental Index saying rents rose 16% year-on-year in the first three months of 2024 across 13 cities in the country.\n\nWhile some alterations -- such as in the weight of food items in the CPI basket -- will improve the accuracy with which inflation is measured, given the changes in consumption patterns over the past decade, the computation of housing inflation needs a methodological revamp.\n\nOf 13,368 dwellings across 310 towns surveyed by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI) to calculate housing inflation, nearly 2,000 are houses provided by central and state governments and public sector undertakings (PSUs). This results in government quarters constituting 1.3% of the entire CPI, according to a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) staff paper.\n\nFor such accommodation, the house rent allowance (HRA) foregone along with a small licence fee paid by those living in them is taken as a proxy for rent and used to calculate inflation. And it is this method that has caused havoc with even the headline inflation rate for one simple reason: Inflation for this category does not depend on demand-supply forces but the consumer.\n\nIf a senior employee moves into a government house that is a part of the MoSPI sample, the rent is higher on account of the higher HRA, according to the RBI paper. The opposite holds true too -- a change to a junior employee leads to lower HRA and consequently lower rent.\n\nThe HRA also changes when the tenant gets an increment or when salaries are revised, as was most notably the case when the 7th Central Pay Commission recommended increasing the allowance of central government employees by 105.6% with effect from July 2017. This resulted in CPI housing inflation accelerating from 4.7% in June of that year to 8.45% by June 2018, propelling headline retail inflation from an all-time low of 1.46% in June 2017 to 4.92% in June 2018.\n\nOf course, the impact of higher HRA on inflation was purely statistical. However, with headline inflation rising sharply, the RBI's Monetary Policy Committee had to look through the impact of the HRA hikes.\n\nHousing inflation has been a problem for the RBI for the better part of a decade. And a resolution may be found with the new CPI inflation series that may be introduced in early 2026.\n\nBut how exactly can this issue be tackled? By simply ignoring government-provided houses from the sample surveyed by the MoSPI so that the use of the HRA does not create distortions. In addition to a more accurate inflation reading, complete exclusion of government-provided homes from the CPI is not unreasonable, given that the number of such quarters will be a fraction of the total number of houses in the country.\n\nAs it is, the Consumption Expenditure Survey (CES) collects data on private sector housing and rent paid. As per the 2022-23 survey, the share of rent in Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (MPCE) was 6.56% for urban India and 0.78% for rural India, up from 6.24% and 0.45%, respectively, in the 2011-12 survey.\n\nThere is no rural component in the CPI due to the \"negligible number of rented dwellings in the rural areas; and the CES also does not provide estimate of imputed rent for owner-occupied houses for this sector\", as per MoSPI's handbook on the current CPI series.\n\nThe increase in the share of rent in rural MPCE in 2022-23 does not necessarily mean the new CPI series will include a rural housing category, although the latest survey did ask for prevailing rates of rent in each locality, if any.\n\nWhile housing accounts for 10.07% of the CPI, is fretting over something that makes up just 1.3% of the entire basket making a mountain out of a molehill? Absolutely not. As the episode with vegetables such as onions (0.64% weight in CPI) and tomatoes (0.57% weight) showed in 2023 and previous years, even items with sub-1% weight can have huge consequences for overall inflation.\n\nWith the RBI's inflation target of 4% within a band of +/- 2% being spelt out in terms of the CPI, it is essential that price changes are measured as accurately as possible. The exclusion of subsidised government housing would aid in this and eliminate any communication issues for the RBI when the recommendations of future pay commissions are implemented.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Communist Party of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reserve Bank of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_price_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer price index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_voting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Proxy voting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pay Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_Policy_Committee_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetary Policy Committee (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer Electronics Show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imputed_rent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imputed rent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Expense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_targeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation targeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Onion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tomato"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Private sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rural area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vegetable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Amusement_Parks_and_Attractions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Amusement Parks and Attractions", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Restoration", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Restoration", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/06/17/600x338/realestate1-kx5B--621x414LiveMint_1718614097588_1718614097819.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 2426, "textEnd": 2435}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-06-", "textStart": 2532, "textEnd": 2541, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-06-", "textStart": 2613, "textEnd": 2622}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 99, "relevance": 1}

Everything -- from utilities to transportation to office supplies -- has ticked up in price, but state funding hasn't kept pace, according to Jones. Massachusetts' school funding formula contains a 4.5% inflation cap, while the two most recent fiscal years saw inflation soar past 7%.\n\nThat difference means that over 200 Bay State school districts are facing funding shortfalls of $1 million or more. The disparity is such, that eight of the Bay State's 10 \"Gateway Cities,\" which are home to some of the most cash-strapped schools, stand to lose $10 million or more to inflation in the next fiscal year, according to the report.\n\nAs if news about next year's school funding weren't dire enough, according to the data examined by MassBudget, if lawmakers don't update the law to keep pace with inflation and fix the glitch, \"that loss will be repeated each year going forward.\"\n\n\"The progress we've made under the Student Opportunity Act is under threat. Record inflation that isn't being accounted for in the state's school funding formula is causing budget cuts, layoffs, and canceled investments across the state. And once again, students and our communities are paying the price,\" Executive Director of the Massachusetts Education Justice Alliance Vatsady Sivongxay said.\n\nThomas Grannemann, a Haverhill School Committee member, said Tuesday that his district is looking at a $7 million budget gap next year due to inflation, just as the district was starting to make real progress.\n\n\"With Student Opportunity Act funding Haverhill has been closing the gap in resources, moving our per-pupil spending from 81% of the state average in FY 2019 to 92% of the state average in FY 2022. However, the inflation index \"glitch\" has set back our school spending for each year by about 6% and will have real negative impacts on our ability to help our high-needs student population,\" he said.\n\nThe full report, Jones said, will be released on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_medsger@bostonherald.com", "name": "Matthew Medsger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "District"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haverhill,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haverhill, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Haverhill, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Education", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State_Relations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Church-State Relations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School_Meals", "label": "dmoz/Health/Nutrition/School Meals", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/domems001.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9656944", "eventUri": "eng-9656944", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 98, "relevance": 1}

The BOT has also spurned repeated calls from the government for rate cuts, arguing instead that structural reforms -- and not cheaper borrowing costs -- are what the economy needs to spur growth.\n\nThe Thai baht was little changed at 36.8050 to the dollar as of 11:05 a.m. local time after weakening the previous day. The currency is Asia's second-worst performer so far this year after the Japanese yen.\n\nSethaput said the BOT currently has a high tolerance level for the baht's movement than before.\n\nThe BOT faces a delicate balancing act, trying to improve credit access for Thailand's struggling micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, while avoiding a further surge in indebtedness that could risk the nation's financial stability.\n\nSethaput described the high debt levels in the economy, particularly household indebtedness, as a problem that won't go away anytime soon.\n\n\"It's like a chronic disease rather than an acute one,\" he said. \"It will likely persist for a long time and it will be difficult to resolve but not something that's likely to lead to a crisis.\"\n\nWhen asked about pressure from the government for rate cuts and the perceived threat to the central bank's independence, Sethaput said that countries that have an independent policy regime with central banks do a better job in terms of inflation outcomes, including financial stability.\n\n\"The proof is in the pudding,\" said Sethaput, whose term as governor is due to end by September next year.\n\nWhile BOT chiefs are eligible to run for a second term in office, Sethaput said he won't be in the running for the job as he would already hit the retirement age.\n\n--With assistance from Cecilia Yap, Claire Jiao, Pathom Sangwongwanich and Janine Phakdeetham.\n\n(Updates with economic context from the second paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

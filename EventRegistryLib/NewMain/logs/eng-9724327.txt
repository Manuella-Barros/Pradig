It is also the tallest church in France, and among the tallest cathedrals in the entire world -- and renowned for its three towers, each constructed in a different style.Mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol first posted on the social media platform X around midday that \"the beginning of a fire is underway on the spire of the cathedral of Rouen.\"Less than 90 minutes later, Stephane Gouezec, of the Seine-Maritime firefighters, said the source of the blaze had been located -- some 120 meters (some 400 feet) high -- and the fire contained. Crews were working to ensure there were no remaining \"hot spots,\" he added.\n\nBut he told reporters the risk of the flames spreading was low because the fire was in an area where there was mostly metal.Gouezec said construction workers were the first to notice the fire and alerted authorities.The cathedral had been evacuated and a security perimeter put in place, according to regional officials.Witnesses in Rouen were jittery since the memory of Paris' Notre Dame blaze is still etched in the national consciousness.

French authorities say a fire broke out Thursday JULY 11, 2024 on the spire of the medieval cathedral in the Normandy city of Rouen. (AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)PARIS (AP) - A small fire broke out Thursday in the spire of the medieval cathedral in Rouen, a major landmark in northern France that was under renovation, but authorities said it was quickly brought under control. Witnesses told French television they saw smoke emanating from the spire just after midday, and recalled a devastating fire in 2019 at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris that toppled its spire and collapsed its roof. Rouen's 12th century cathedral, which is considered a Gothic masterpiece, is widely beloved, not least because of a series of paintings by impressionist Claude Monet capturing its asymmetrical western facade. It is also the tallest church in France, and among the tallest cathedrals in the world. It is renowned for its three towers, each constructed in a different style. Mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol first posted on the social media platform X around midday that \"the beginning of a fire\" was underway \"on the spire of Rouen cathedral.\"\u009d Less than 90 minutes later, Stephane Gouezec, of the Seine-Maritime firefighters, said the source of the blaze had been located - some 120 meters (some 400 feet) high - and the fire contained. Crews were working to ensure there were no remaining \"hot spots,\"\u009d he added.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)PARIS (AP) - A fire broke out Thursday in the spire of the medieval cathedral in Rouen, a major landmark in northern France that was under renovation, but authorities said it was quickly brought under control. Witnesses told French television they saw smoke emanating from the spire just after midday, and recalled a devastating fire in 2019 at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris that toppled its spire and collapsed its roof. Rouen's 12th century cathedral, which is considered to be a Gothic masterpiece, is widely beloved, not least because of a series of paintings by impressionist Claude Monet capturing its asymmetrical western facade. It is also the tallest church in France, and among the tallest cathedrals in the entire world - and renowned for its three towers, each constructed in a different style. Mayor Nicolas Mayer-Rossignol first posted on the social media platform X around midday that \"the beginning of a fire is underway on the spire of the cathedral of Rouen.\"\u009d Less than 90 minutes later, Stephane Gouezec, of the Seine-Maritime firefighters, said the source of the blaze had been located - some 120 meters (some 400 feet) high - and the fire contained. Crews were working to ensure there were no remaining \"hot spots,\"\u009d he added. But he told reporters the risk of the flames spreading was low because the fire was in an area where there was mostly metal.

He said flames had engulfed the spire of the building, built in the eleventh century. The monument is known for being favored and painted multiple times by renowned French impressionist Claude Monet.\n\nThe mayor said that the origin of the blaze is still unknown, and that firefighters have been mobilized. Images posted on social media showed flames spewing out somewhere near the top of the building. Restoration work has been going on at the cathedral since 2015, according to French media.\n\nSocial media users say firefighters have arrived at the scene and are currently working to tackle the blaze.\n\nThe Gothic Notre-Dame de Rouen has the tallest church spire in France, soaring over 150 meters above the ground.\n\nLocal authorities said the cathedral had been evacuated and a security cordon placed around the building.\n\nThe local prefecture later said on X that the fire was contained. The extent of damage to the structure is unclear for now.\n\nImages from the scene were reminiscent of another devastating blaze that broke out at the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris in 2019. That fire also started during renovations, and ended up destroying Notre Dame's iconic spire. Arson was speculated to be the cause, but investigators later said that there was no criminality involved.\n\nThe renovation of the cathedral is ongoing. Philippe Jost, chief of the reconstruction project, previously pledged that the spire would be back in place by this summer's Paris Olympics, which kick off later this month.

Large parts of the outer walls later collapsed.\n\nThe Rouen cathedral spire had been surrounded by scaffolding and the white cover for several weeks.\n\nThe local prefecture, which exercises state authority in the region, said the cathedral had been evacuated and emergency services were on the scene. A security cordon was in place around the building.\n\nThe prefecture said there were no reports of casualties and the extent of the damage was unclear for now.\n\nReporting by Inti Landauro, Nicolas Delame, Sudip Kar-Gupta, Juliette Jabkhiro and Estelle Shirbon; Editing by Toby Chopra, Alexandra Hudson", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@reuters.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rouen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rouen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gothic architecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Notre-Dame de Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claude Monet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impressionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hudson River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_in_France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prefectures in France"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Copenhagen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Gothic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Gothic", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Smoked", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Smoked", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Support_Groups/Smoking_Cessation", "label": "dmoz/Health/Support Groups/Smoking Cessation", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NAN4YG764VNAPDFZHOYHHMY47U.jpg?auth=e755a1a76ead07ce5de3e3c3f3fa2488f9667c010c77ab445e2fb681ab7c5de9&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724327", "eventUri": "eng-9724327", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 14}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The new iron spire was not completed for six decades. It stood at 151 metres (500ft) and for a short time made the cathedral the world's tallest building.\n\nIts 12th century Tower Saint-Roman houses its bourdon, or largest bell, named Joan of Arc as well as the 64-bell carillon.

Crews were working to ensure there were no remaining \"hot spots,\" he added.\n\nBut he told reporters the risk of the flames spreading was low because the fire was in an area where there was mostly metal.\n\nGouezec said construction workers were the first to notice the fire and alerted authorities.\n\nThe cathedral had been evacuated and a security perimeter put in place, according to regional officials.\n\nWitnesses in Rouen were jittery since the memory of Paris' Notre Dame blaze is still etched in the national consciousness. It caught fire five years ago, also while under renovation, and is scheduled to reopen in December after an unprecedented reconstruction effort. The cause of that fire was deemed an accident.

He painted the monument from different vantage points and at different times of day.\n\n* The cathedral was built and rebuilt over a period of more than 800 years and has features from early Gothic to late Flamboyant and Renaissance architecture. It is famous for its three towers, each of which were built in a different style.\n\n* In 1822, lightning started a fire that destroyed the wood and lead Renaissance spire of the central tower. The new iron spire was not completed for six decades. It stood at 151 metres (500 feet) and for a short time made the cathedral the world's tallest building.\n\n* The cathedral was partially destroyed by Allied bombardment during World War Two ahead of the Normandy landings. Restoration work was only completed in the 1980s.\n\n* The cathedral's 12th century St. Roman tower houses its bourdon, or largest bell, named Joan of Arc as well as the 64-bell carillon. The cathedral's bells can be heard from 5 km (three miles) away.\n\nCompiled by Richard Lough; editing by Mark Heinrich", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@reuters.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gothic architecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rouen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rouen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Notre-Dame de Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_architecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance architecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claude Monet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamboyant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flamboyant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Impressionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Restoration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stuart Restoration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourdon_(bell)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bourdon (bell)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tower house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carillon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joan of Arc"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Building_Types", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Building Types", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Gothic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Gothic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Gothic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Gothic", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HS2AKNCZPBMCZHVLMBBJR6UGZY.jpg?auth=72b05abf1c998c774501376f28fbfcdb833f3d5a42a23e95575b34279567cea0&height=1005&width=1920&quality=80&smart=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724327", "eventUri": "eng-9724327", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-11", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 14}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Rouen's cathedral is renowned for its association with Claude Monet paintings and its architectural diversity, spanning over 800 years. Key features include three distinct towers and a historic bell tower.\n\nA fire erupted in the spire of the iconic Notre-Dame de Rouen cathedral on Thursday amid ongoing restoration efforts. The incident is reminiscent of the 2019 blaze that devastated the Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral, causing its spire to collapse.\n\nThe Notre-Dame de Rouen cathedral is celebrated as one of France's premier Gothic structures, notably immortalized by impressionist artist Claude Monet. Monet's series of paintings captured the cathedral from various perspectives and at different times of the day.\n\nConstructed and reconstructed over more than eight centuries, the cathedral embodies architectural styles from early Gothic to late Flamboyant and Renaissance. It is distinguished by its three towers, each representing a different architectural style. Highlights include the St. Roman tower, which houses the 'Joan of Arc' bell and a 64-bell carillon, audible from up to five kilometers away.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cathedral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rouen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rouen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notre-Dame_de_Paris", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Notre-Dame de Paris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Claude Monet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_architecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gothic architecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_tower", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bell tower"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carillon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carillon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamboyant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flamboyant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Impressionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_of_Arc", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joan of Arc"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Building_Types", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Building Types", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Glass", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Glass", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Gothic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Gothic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Gothic", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Gothic", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/11_07_2024_00_35_44_0146232.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9724327", "eventUri": "eng-9724327", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

rising from the Gothic landmark.\n\nA section of plastic sheeting covering renovation work 120 metres (400 feet) up the cathedral's spire caught fire, though officials have not said how the blaze started.\n\nThe departmental fire service raised the alarm around midday (1000 GMT) and 40 vehicles and 70 firefighters responded to the scene.\n\nThe fire is \"under control but not out\", said local fire chief Stephane Gouezec, adding the fire would only be declared \"extinguished\" when firefighters confirmed there were no more hotspots.\n\nThree workers on site suffered from mild smoke inhalation when they tried to put out the fire with extinguishers, according to local authorities.\n\n\"Fire broke out at the tip of the spire, which isn't made of wood, but rather metal,\" the prefecture of the Seine-Maritime department told AFP.\n\nThe blaze started in an area where workers decontaminate themselves on leaving the site, said Rouen Archbishop Dominique Lebrun, saying he \"felt deeply for the archdiocese staff and the public\".\n\nThe Culture Ministry has ruled out any risk of collapse, and said an assessment was underway to determine if \"two works of art\" were damaged by firefighters using water to douse the flames.\n\nA fire in the wooden frame of the roof was behind the massive 2019 damage to the world-famous Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, where repairs are only now nearing completion.\n\nConstruction began on Rouen's cathedral in the 12th Century, according to its website, with work lasting several centuries.\n\nRenovations have been ongoing since 2017, according to Normandy's culture authority.\n\nLightning struck the cathedral's spire in 1822, destroying the wooden structure which was rebuilt using cast iron then steel in the early 19th-century.\n\nSome of the renovation work involved creating firewalls within the wooden structure to prevent it suffering the same fate as Notre Dame, as well as reinforcing the roofing vaults.",

Authorities announced they had \"brought the fire under control\" in just under two hours after an alert was issued at noon local time.\n\nThe cathedral was evacuated and a security perimeter established, local media reported July 11.\n\nCiting information by the French Ministry of Culture, the newspaper Le Figaro said the fire was caused by \"mishandling by workers.\"\n\nThe part of the spire where the fire broke out was located about 120 meters (about 400 feet) above the ground and is currently undergoing renovation.\n\nThe incident recalled the devastating fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on April 15, 2019. That blaze caused significant damage to the iconic structure, destroying its spire and much of its roof.\n\nRouen Cathedral, known for its tall spire and Gothic architecture, has historical and artistic significance. The structure in historic Normandy was famously depicted in a series of paintings by French impressionist Claude Monet in the late 19th century.\n\nThe fire in Rouen also occurs against a backdrop of concerns about the Catholic heritage of France.\n\nIn 2021, Edouard de Lamaze, president of the Observatory of Religious Heritage in Paris, told CNA that one religious building is lost in France every two weeks due to various factors, including demolition, repurposing, or destruction.\n\nTags:AC WimmerCathedral FireFranceGothic ArchitectureRouen Previous post Bishop Zaidan condemns 'any targeting of civilians' at Holy Family School in Gaza Next post This is the most recent story.

Vance will be Trump's VP choice according to a highly-placed reliable source in the former president's orbit\n\nJust days after the far-left took the most seats in the French National Assembly elections, the 500-foot spire of great French cathedral in Rouen has been set on fire.\n\nApart from its religious significance, Rouen Cathedral -- built in the Gothic style -- could be seen as representing all that was best in French history and culture, given that it was a style of architecture that was admired and adopted by many European countries during the Middle Ages.\n\nSo to see this cathedral on fire, so soon after radical leftists rioted and created mayhem to celebrate their 'victory' in the French elections, is more than a little disturbing.\n\nThe cause as yet is unknown, and maybe it was just a careless cigarette butt or some kind of lightning strike. But when you've got the left out starting fires to celebrate its newfound power, you can't dismiss that anti-Catholic and anti-traditional French elements of the left were at work. According to the electoral maps of Le Monde, Rouen is situated in a leftist department called Seine-Maritime, within the historic province of Normandy, which voted for the far-left. It would be loaded with Catholic-haters among the gay and other progressive groups within, even the haters of the traditional Latin Mass.\n\nThe Le Monde electoral map shows that it's surrounded by countryside that voted for Marine Le Pen's conservative National Rally party which is quite the opposite.\n\nIf that isn't disturbing enough, the area has also been subject to Jihadi attacks from West-hating Muslims. In 2016, a French priest, Fr. Jacques Hamel, had his throat slashed while saying Mass in nearby St-Etienne. The funeral mass for the slain priest was held at the same Rouen cathedral.\n\nWhat's more, art is under attack, by radical environmentalist groups of the left, who have been throwing food and breaking glass and gluing themselves to famous works of art. Rouen's cathedral is all about art, in itself, and in Monet's very well-known masterpieces.\n\nRouen seems to be particularly vulnerable to attacks given the agendas of the left and the Muslims, all of whom celebrated their victory in this week's election by burning things.\n\nWe still don't know who did this, but I doubt I am the only one wondering why there seem to be so many cathedrals catching fire these days in France.\n\nCathedrals are big, and dominate town and city skylines through France and most of Europe. Rouen, along with Notre Dame, are among the most iconic, the best known, the most noted. Does it make sense to dismiss that forces aligned with destroying Western civilization -- the haters of art, of religion, of tradition, of the West itself -- might just be seeking to destroy the skylines of the great French cities in order to remake them in their own hellish images?", "source": {"uri": "americanthinker.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Thinker"}, "authors": [],

With frightening shades of the fire that engulfed Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris, onlookers looked on aghast as about 40 fire engines rushed to the scene, Reuters.\n\nA cordon was established around the cathedral, as about 70 firefighters sought to save one of France's finest examples of medieval Gothic architecture.\n\nThe spire had been in renovation for years and was surrounded by scaffolding and a white cover when the fire began about 120 metres above ground level.\n\nIt appears that plastic parts of the construction site caught fire, fire brigade chief Stephane Gouezec told local media, the BBC. The metal spire itself did not appear to be damaged.\n\nThe blaze has now been contained, according to officials. There are no reports of casualties and those working on the spire at the time are reported to be safe.\n\nThe devastating fire at Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris also started during renovation works. It destroyed the roof, the spire and almost toppled the main bell towers.\n\nFive years on, restoration of the Paris landmark continues, with renovation costs having reached 550 million euros ($599 million). Its reopening is scheduled for December 2024.\n\nPhoto: Rouen Cathedral and its famous spire, Normandy, France, 21 May 2010.

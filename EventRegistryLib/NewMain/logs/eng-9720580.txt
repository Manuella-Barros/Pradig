the police.\"\n\nMr Simpson repeated warnings to the public not to approach the suspect, but to call 999 if they see him.\n\nInvestigators believe Clifford could be in Hertfordshire or north London.\n\nArmed officers searched an address in Rendlesham Road, Enfield, on Wednesday morning as the search continued.\n\nHertfordshire Police said it is looking at whether the force had contact with the victims or Clifford before the killings.\n\nOne neighbour described hearing screams from the suburban home where the three women died on Tuesday.\n\nThe 46-year-old who works in the media and lives near the scene but asked not to be named, said \"absolute chaos\" then broke out as armed police put the road into lockdown.\n\nShe told the PA news agency: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n\"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house' ... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\"\n\nHome secretary Yvette Cooper said she is being kept fully updated about the inquiry into the \"truly shocking\" deaths.\n\nOfficers and emergency medical crews including two air ambulances were sent to try to save the women, who were related, but they all died at the scene.\n\nEast of England Ambulance Service said three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, an ambulance officer vehicle and the Hazardous Area Response Team were also sent to the scene.\n\nThe previous government had considered tightening the laws around crossbows after would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail was encouraged by an AI chatbot to break into Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 with a loaded crossbow to kill the late Queen.\n\nCurrently, there is no requirement to have a licence for a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable

We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area.\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nAddressing Clifford directly, he said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nMeanwhile, members of the public were warned not to approach the 26-year-old, who was thought to be armed with a crossbow and other weapons.\n\nDetective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said earlier on Wednesday: \"Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford, who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.\n\n\"Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\n\"Our enquires will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\n\n\"This incident will of course be of concern to local residents. Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be in the area today so please do speak to them if you need to.\"\n\nThe BBC said in a note to its 5 Live staff: \"The news today about John Hunt's family is utterly devastating. Our thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.\"\n\nTV racing commentator Matt Chapman tweeted: \"No words needed for what has happened to @HuntyCaller and family today. Impossible to comprehend the pain. Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal - racing loves you.\"\n\nHunt's daughter Louise reportedly launched a dog grooming service during Covid lockdown named Groom and Glow, while her sister Hannah owned a beauty business, MyLondon reported.\n\nA heartbreaking tribute to Louise on social media read: \"No words can describe the loss I feel after today's horrific news. You were so loved and Scooby adored you...you built up an amazing business and were always so kind and gentle.

The victims were later named as Carol Hunt, 61, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25 - wife and daughters of BBC Five Live racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nMr Hunt is understood to have been working for the BBC racing on Tuesday, and reportedly returned home to discover his wife and two daughters had been fatally injured. Police were called to the property in Ashlyn Close, in northern Bushey, near Watford, just before 7pm that day.\n\nOfficers arrived on scene with ambulance vehicles - including two air ambulances - to find that the trio had suffered serious injuries. The three women were alive when discovered, however, despite the best efforts of paramedics, all tragically died at the scene a short time later.\n\nCCTV footage later emerged of Clifford fleeing the area with a 3ft crossbow held underneath his right arm as he got into a vehicle and drove away. The same car was found abandoned earlier today in Enfield.\n\nClifford, 26, from Enfield in north London was the subject of a huge manhunt around areas of Hertfordshire and North London, where officers believe he was hiding following the murders. According to Sky News, Clifford used to work as a private security guard.\n\nTwo helicopters were seen near Clifford's home in Enfield, flying over the Hilly Fields park opposite his residence, while a nearby primary school kept its pupils in lockdown as a precaution, as the search continued.\n\nEarlier today, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said the attack last night in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Hertfordshire was a \"targeted incident \" and Clifford, 26, was \"wanted in connection with murder\".\n\nHe said: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident. We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area.\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nAddressing Clifford directly, he said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nMeanwhile, members of the public were warned not to approach the 26-year-old, who was thought to be armed with a crossbow and other weapons.\n\nDetective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said earlier today: \"Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.\n\n\"Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\n\"Our enquires will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\n\n\"This incident will of course be of concern to local residents. Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be in the area today so please do speak to them if you need to.\"\n\nThe BBC said in a note to its 5 Live staff: \"The news today about John Hunt's family is utterly devastating. Our thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.\"\n\nTV racing commentator Matt Chapman tweeted: \"No words needed for what has happened to @HuntyCaller and family today. Impossible to comprehend the pain. Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal - racing loves you.\"\n\nHunt's daughter Louise reportedly launched a dog grooming service during Covid lockdown named Groom and Glow, while her sister Hannah owned a beauty business, MyLondon reported.\n\nA heartbreaking tribute to Louise on social media read: \"No words can describe the loss I feel after today's horrific news. You were so loved and Scooby adored you...you built up an amazing business and were always so kind and gentle. May you RIP with your sister and mum xxx.\"\n\nThe murders have also sent shockwaves through the community in Bushey, as residents were seen leaving flowers at the scene today following the tragic

Emergency services, including two air ambulances, were sent to the property, and despite their best efforts to save the women - all believed to be related - they died at the scene.\n\nThe women, aged 25, 28, and 61, were \"targeted\" and attacked with a crossbow and other weapons, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson of Hertfordshire Police said. The victims are believed to be the wife and two daughters of BBC 5Live racing commentator John Hunt, the Telegraph reports.\n\nMr Hunt, 58, who is married with three daughters, had reportedly been working on Tuesday evening and when he returned home from his shift, is believed to have raised the alarm to police. The Constabulary has since launched a manhunt to find the suspect and have been looking for him throughout the night and this morning.\n\nThey have warned he may still be in possession of weapons and have asked the public to dial 999 if they see him, and to not approach him. Directly appealing to the suspect, Chief Sup Simpson said: \"Kyle if you are seeing or hearing this please make contact.\" Investigators believe the man could also be in Hertfordshire or around his home in north London.\n\nChief Supt Simpson told reporters: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident.\n\n\"We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area. The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nDetective Superintendent Rob Hall, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, also called for anyone with information to come forward. Detective Supt Hall said: \"Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or north London. Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately.\n\n\"If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon. Our inquiries will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\"\n\nA neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she didn't know the victims well but said they were a friendly family. \"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said.\n\n\"It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\" Another neighbour, Riaz, who is in his 50s, commented: \"This has been an awful situation and I can't even imagine what the family must be going through.\" A further resident living in Ashlyn Close said they heard screams from the house located in the quiet cul de sac where three women died before \"absolute chaos\" broke out.\n\nThe 46-year-old said: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like, 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos. We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house'... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\"\n\nThey said multiple ambulances, helicopters and \"at least 16 police cars\" arrived at the scene quickly, with armed police going from house to house to question locals, request doorbell camera footage and tell them to stay indoors. She added: \"It's really, really stressful now to think that that happened in such a close vicinity and none of us were aware and none of us could help.\n\n\"It's just absolutely traumatic, I think, for the family involved, for everyone. I think that's the stressful thing, that it happened at peak family time between 6pm and 7pm, when people were probably cooking for their kids and getting their kids ready for bed, and all of us in a tight little road, completely unaware of the trauma and tragic circumstances that other people were going through at that particular time.\"\n\nLocal councillors for the North Bushey area said they were \"deeply shocked and saddened\" by the news of the deaths. An East of England Ambulance Service spokesperson said: \"We were called around 7pm on Tuesday July 9 to a property in Ashlyn Close in Bushey. Three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, an ambulance officer vehicle, the Hazardous Area Response Team, the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and London Air Ambulance were sent to the scene.\n\n\"Sadly, despite the team's best efforts, three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\" The manhunt comes after the Tory Government considered tightening the laws around crossbows after would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail was encouraged by an AI chatbot to break into Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 with a loaded crossbow to kill the late Queen.\n\nCurrently there is no requirement to have a licence for a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nYou can report information online, speak to an operator in the Force Communications Room via the police's online web chat or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting Op Infauna.

phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, Simpson said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.", "source": {"uri":

Police and emergency services, including two air ambulances, were sent to the property in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Hertfordshire, just after 7pm on Tuesday.\n\nThe women, who have now been identified as Carol Hunt, 61, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, were found fatally injured in the house and despite best efforts to save them, the three died at the scene. Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson, of Hertfordshire Police, said the women were \"targeted\" and attacked with a crossbow and other weapons.\n\nThey are the wife and two daughters of BBC 5Live racing commentator John Hunt. Mr Hunt, 58, who is married with three daughters, had reportedly been working on Tuesday evening and when he came home from his shift, is believed to have returned to the harrowing scene.\n\nThe father-of-three is said to have been the one to raise the alarm to police. MailOnline claims police sources said the three women were tied up before being shot. Hertfordshire Constabulary has launched a manhunt to find the suspect and have been looking for him throughout the night and this morning. They have warned he may still be in possession of weapons and have asked the public to dial 999 if they see him, and to not approach him.\n\nDirectly appealing to the suspect, believed to still be in Hertfordshire or in north London, Chief Sup Simpson said: \"Kyle if you are seeing or hearing this please make contact.\" He continued: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident.\n\n\"We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area. The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nA resident living at Ashlyn Close said they heard screams from the house located in the quiet cul de sac where three women died before 'absolute chaos' broke out. The 46-year-old said: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like, 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n\"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house'... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\" She said multiple ambulances, helicopters and \"at least 16 police cars\" arrived at the scene quickly, with armed police going from house to house to question locals, request doorbell camera footage and tell them to stay indoors.\n\nShe added: \"It's really, really stressful now to think that that happened in such a close vicinity and none of us were aware and none of us could help. It's just absolutely traumatic, I think, for the family involved, for everyone. I think that's the stressful thing, that it happened at peak family time between 6pm and 7pm, when people were probably cooking for their kids and getting their kids ready for bed, and all of us in a tight little road, completely unaware of the trauma and tragic circumstances that other people were going through at that particular time.\"\n\nAnother neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she didn't know the victims well but said they were a friendly family. \"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. \"It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nA further local, named Riaz, who is in his 50s, commented: \"This has been an awful situation and I can't even imagine what the family must be going through.\"\n\nDetective Superintendent Rob Hall, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, has called for anyone with information to come forward. Detective Supt Hall said: \"Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or north London. Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately.\n\n\"If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon. Our inquiries will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\"\n\nA heartbreaking tribute to Louise on social media reads, according to MyLondon: \"No words can describe the loss I feel after today's horrific news. You were so loved and Scooby adored you...you built up an amazing business and were always so kind and gentle. May you RIP with your sister and mum xxx.\"\n\nAerial shots of the scene aired on the BBC show a blue and white forensic tent in the front garden of one of the homes in the cul de sac, with a police officer on guard and several police vehicles parked nearby. Local councillors for the North Bushey area said they were \"deeply shocked and saddened\" by the news of the deaths.\n\nAn East of England Ambulance Service spokesperson said: \"We were called around 7pm on Tuesday July 9 to a property in Ashlyn Close in Bushey. Three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, an ambulance officer vehicle, the Hazardous Area Response Team, the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and London Air Ambulance were sent to the scene.\n\n\"Sadly, despite the team's best efforts, three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\" The manhunt comes after the Tory Government considered tightening the laws around crossbows after would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail was encouraged by an AI chatbot to break into Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 with a loaded crossbow to kill the late Queen.\n\nCurrently there is no requirement to have a licence for a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nYou can report information online, speak to an operator in the Force Communications Room via the police's online web chat or call the non-emergency number 101, quoting Op Infauna.

British police were hunting for a man believed to be armed with a crossbow on Wednesday after three women were killed in a house near London. The BBC said the women killed were the family of its main radio racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nLONDON (AP) -- British police said they found Wednesday the man suspected of killing the wife and two daughters of a well-known BBC radio commentator near London in a brutal crossbow attack.\n\nIn a statement, Hertfordshire Police said 26-year-old Kyle Clifford has been found in the Enfield area of north London, near his home, and that he is receiving medical treatment for his injuries. Police did not say how those injuries happened but said they had not fired any shots.\n\nThe BBC confirmed that the women killed were the family of John Hunt -- his 61-year-old wife Carol Hunt and their daughters Louise and Hannah, aged 25 and 28 respectively.\n\nWhile the manhunt was underway, the public were urged not to approach Clifford. Enfield is around 52 kilometers (17 miles) to the east from the site of the killing.\n\n\"Following extensive inquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time,\" said Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit.\n\n\"This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened,\" she added.\n\nJenkins said the investigation is moving \"at pace\" and that formal identification of the victims is yet to take place. She also said that the \"premature\" naming of the victims \"caused great upset.\"\n\nPolice had been scouring a park in north London, near the home of Clifford, after being alerted Tuesday about the killings in a house in Bushey, a residential area in northwestern London. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nJohn Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that Hunt found the bodies early Tuesday evening, after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nPolice did not say how or whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022.\n\nLocal council member Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, was kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated

Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal racing loves you.\"\n\nThe Amateur Jockeys Association of Great Britain and Beverley Racecourse were among others sending their sympathies.\n\nArmed police searched a home in Rendlesham Road, Enfield, on Wednesday morning as the hunt for Clifford continued.\n\nHe is wanted over the deaths of Mrs Hunt and two of her daughters who were aged 25 and 28.\n\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson from Hertfordshire Police told reporters the murders are believed to be \"targeted\".\n\nThe force also warned the public not to approach the suspect who \"may be in possession of a crossbow\".\n\nHe said: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident.\"\n\n\"We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area.\"\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nAddressing Clifford directly, he said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nInvestigators believe Clifford could be in Hertfordshire or north London.\n\nThe force said it is looking at whether the force had contact with the victims or Clifford before the killings.\n\nOne neighbour described hearing screams from the suburban home where the three women died on Tuesday.\n\nThe 46-year-old who works in the media and lives near the scene but asked not to be named, said \"absolute chaos\" then broke out as armed police put the road into lockdown.\n\nShe told the PA news agency: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\"\n\n\"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house'... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said she is being kept fully updated about the inquiry into the \"truly shocking\" deaths.\n\nOfficers and emergency medical crews including two air ambulances were sent to try to save the women, who were related, but they all died at the scene.\n\nThe previous government had considered tightening the laws around crossbows after would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail was encouraged by an AI chatbot to break into Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 with a loaded crossbow to kill the late Queen.\n\nCurrently, there is no requirement to have a licence for a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.", "source": {"uri": "somersetlive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Somerset

Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal - racing loves you.\"\n\nThe Amateur Jockeys Association of Great Britain and Beverley Racecourse were among others sending their sympathies.\n\nArmed police searched a home in Rendlesham Road, Enfield, on Wednesday morning as the hunt for Clifford continued.\n\nHe is wanted over the deaths of Mrs Hunt and two of her daughters who were aged 25 and 28.\n\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson from Hertfordshire Police told reporters the murders are believed to be \"targeted\".\n\nThe force also warned the public not to approach the suspect who \"may be in possession of a crossbow\".\n\nHe said: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident.\n\n\"We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area.\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nAddressing Clifford directly, he said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nInvestigators believe Clifford could be in Hertfordshire or north London.\n\nThe force said it is looking at whether the force had contact with the victims or Clifford before the killings.\n\nOne neighbour described hearing screams from the suburban home where the three women died on Tuesday.\n\nThe 46-year-old who works in the media and lives near the scene but asked not to be named, said \"absolute chaos\" then broke out as armed police put the road into lockdown.\n\nShe told the PA news agency: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n\"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house'... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said she is being kept fully updated about the inquiry into the \"truly shocking\" deaths.\n\nOfficers and emergency medical crews including two air ambulances were sent to try to save the women, who were related, but they all died at the scene.\n\nThe previous government had considered tightening the laws around crossbows after would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail was encouraged by an AI chatbot to break into Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 with a loaded crossbow to kill the late Queen.\n\nCurrently, there is no

I urge people to support (Hertfordshire Police) with any information about this case.\"\n\nNeighbours expressed their shock after police, an ambulance crew and ground ambulances rushed to the \u00a3800,000 four-bed house. One neighbour, who gave his name as Riaz, said: \"They are a middle class family. It is tragic and horrifying.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of activity from the police and ambulance last night - there were over a dozen cars. There was an air ambulance. The road was closed way past midnight. There is no access into the road.\" Riaz, who is in his late 50s and works in Telecoms, said: \"It is a decent neighbourhood. It is mostly retired people and professionals living here.\"\n\nAnother neighbour of the family, who did not want to be named, said she did not know them well, but they were friendly. \"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\"\n\nLocal councillor Louise Nicolas posted on Facebook that she is \"deeply saddened\" by the \"tragic news\", offering her \"heartfelt condolences to all those affected\". She invited anyone who may be affected by the news to get in touch for support - adding that people should not take to Facebook to speculate on the ongoing investigation.\n\nLaurence Brass, a local county councillor, told BBC News: \"This is not something that happens in Bushey. We can't remember a murder in our rather quiet neck of the woods, so (it's a) terrible shock and our sympathies and prayers and thoughts are with the families of the three women.\"\n\n\"That really is a terrible thing to happen to anybody, and I've gathered they're all from the same family, which obviously makes it even more tragic, and we'll do everything we can as the local council to add our

They have issued a warning to the public urging them not to approach him and instead call 999 immediately if they see him.\n\nAt a press conference today, Hertfordshire Police urged Clifford to 'make contact with the police' as the suspect in the killings remains at large.\n\nClifford, from Enfield, north London, used to work as a security guard, it has been reported.\n\nThis morning, the usually quiet cul-de-sac was swarming with armed police and forensic officers as the triple murder investigation continued.\n\nLouise's father John was working at Lingfield Park race course yesterday before returning home to discover the horror that had unfolded.\n\nShocked neighbours said Louise ran a dog grooming business called Groom and Glow from the detached house in a cul-de-sac.\n\nLocal resident William Nourallah paid tribute to the 'beautiful young girl'.\n\nHe said: 'She was a gorgeous girl. She really was a young, hardworking girl. I met the mum once or twice because she opened the door for me. I met the father\n\n'She was happy every time I saw her. We would have a laugh and a joke. She was a beautiful young girl. It's a waste of a life.'\n\nAnother neighbour Glyn Nicholas, 77, said that Louise had been left upset at breaking up with a boyfriend and crashed her car last week as a result.\n\nHe said: 'Louise was a very nice girl. She ran a dog grooming business from the house.\n\n'I heard that she split from a boyfriend last week and was very upset about it. So much so that she was driving home at some point last week and drove into a wooden telegraph pole not far from the house.\n\n'Another dog groomer - who is a friend of Louise's - told me that her car door had caved in because of the crash.\n\n'Who the boyfriend was, I don't know, I never saw him. I believe Hannah, Louise's sister, was also killed along with their mother Carol.\n\n'I didn't know Hannah too well but Carol was very quaint, a nice, polite and quiet lady. She was at home a lot of the time.\n\n'Her husband John is a BBC radio commentator. He commentates on horse racing mostly. I believe he may have been at Lingfield racecourse yesterday.\n\n'This is such an awful incident, the whole community is in shock.'\n\nA neighbour, who lives on the 'serene and quiet road' and did not want to be named, said they were a 'friendly family'.\n\n'We would see them every day passing by and they would say 'good morning',' she said. 'It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.'\n\nIn a note sent to staff at BBC Five Live today, the corporation described the incident as 'utterly devastating'.\n\nThe note read: 'The news today about John Hunt's family is utterly devastating.\n\n'Our thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.'\n\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson from Hertfordshire Police told reporters the murders are believed to be 'targeted'.\n\nThe force also warned the public not to approach the suspect who 'may be in possession of a crossbow'.\n\nHe said: 'Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident.\n\n'We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area.\n\n'The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.'\n\nAddressing Clifford directly, he said: 'Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.'\n\nArmed police were seen forcing their way into a house in Rendlesham Road, Enfield, this morning in a raid that is believed to be related to the horrific killings.\n\nThe house, which is close to Gordon Hill railway station, had two officers stood guard outside this afternoon hours after helicopters were seen patrolling the skies overhead.\n\nThe Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is being kept 'fully updated' on the killings of the three women who were found in Bushey, Hertfordshire, and has urged anyone with information about the case to contact police.\n\nThe Labour MP said in a post on X, formerly Twitter: 'The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family & friends of those who have been killed & with the community.\n\n'I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support (Hertfordshire Police) with any information about this case.'\n\nEarlier today police revealed they were looking for Kyle Clifford following the incident and warned members of the public to call 999 immediately if they saw him.\n\nIn a statement released this morning Detective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: 'This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\n\n'Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.\n\n'Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away.\n\n'He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\n'Our enquires will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\n\n'This incident will of course be of concern to local residents. Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be in the area today so please do speak to them if you need to.'\n\nAn East of England Ambulance Service spokesperson said: 'We were called around 7pm on Tuesday July 9 to a property in Ashlyn Close in Bushey.\n\n'Three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, an ambulance officer vehicle, the Hazardous Area Response Team, the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and London Air Ambulance were sent to the scene.\n\n'Sadly, despite the team's best efforts, three women were pronounced dead at the scene.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com",

Hertfordshire Police said Kyle Clifford, 26, was being sought over the suspected triple murder. (Jacob King/PA via AP)\n\nLONDON (AP) -- British police were hunting Wednesday for a man believed to be armed with a crossbow after three women were killed in a house just northwest of London. The BBC said the women killed were the family of its main radio racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nHertfordshire Police said Kyle Clifford, 26, was being sought over the suspected triple murder, which potentially involved a crossbow and other weapons.\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been an horrific incident,\" Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said.\n\nPolice said the three women -- ages 25, 28 and 61 -- were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nBBC Radio 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel, said the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two of their daughters.\n\nJohn Hunt is BBC radio's main horse racing commentator, his voice known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby. British media say that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse, which is just south of London.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nPolice did not say whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters.\n\nLocal councillor Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, Simpson said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

an ambulance officer vehicle, the Hazardous Area Response Team, the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and London Air Ambulance were sent to the scene.\n\n\"Sadly, despite the team's best efforts, three

all those affected.\n\n\"We would encourage anyone who has information relevant to the inquiry to contact police.\"\n\nThe previous government had considered tightening the laws around crossbows after

Carol Hunt, Hannah Hunt and Louise Hunt, aged 61, 28 and 25 have since been named as the victims, MyLondon reports.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson said the attack last night in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Hertfordshire was a 'targeted incident' and Clifford, 26, was 'wanted in connection with murder'.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Crossbow-armed suspect' wanted after murder of 'BBC star's wife and daughters'\n\nREAD MORE: Sister of woman strangled to death by partner 'very upset' at verdict of murder by reason of insanity\n\nHe said today: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident. We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area. The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nAddressing Clifford directly, he said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nThe three women were found in the early evening after police and ambulance vehicles - including two air ambulances - were called to to a home in Bushey, Hertfordshire before 7pm. The trio had suffered serious injuries but were alive when discovered, however all died a short time later.\n\nThe man at the centre of the major manhunt, Clifford is from the Enfield area and police have been searching for him throughout the night after the horrific discovery. Police believe he could be anywhere in the Hertfordshire or North London area but have urged anyone who sees him to stay wary and to phone 999 immediately, with a spokesperson for the police force later specifying that Clifford \"may be in possession of a crossbow\". Anyone with information has been urged to come forward by police.\n\nAerial shots from a BBC live feed have shown a blue-and-white forensic tent in one of the front gardens of the cul-de-sac, with police and forensic teams swarming the area. The search is ongoing but no arrests have yet been made.\n\nCh Supt Jon Simpson said \"extensive police resources\" are being piled into the manhunt, and that members of the public had already been getting in touch with the police to report possible sightings.\n\nThe British Home Office is aware of the incident and being kept \"fully updated\". In a post on X, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been killed and with the community. I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support (Hertfordshire Police) with any information about this case.\"\n\nNeighbours expressed their shock after police, an ambulance crew and ground ambulances rushed to the \u00a3800,000 four-bed house. One neighbour, who gave his name as Riaz, said: \"They are a middle class family. It is tragic and horrifying.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of activity from the police and ambulance last night - there were over a dozen cars. There was an air ambulance. The road was closed way past midnight. There is no access into the road.\" Riaz, who is in his late 50s and works in Telecoms, said: \"It is a decent neighbourhood. It is mostly retired people and professionals living here.\"\n\nAnother neighbour of the family, who did not want to be named, said she did not know them well, but they were friendly. \"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nLocal councillor Louise Nicolas posted on Facebook that she is \"deeply saddened\" by the \"tragic news\", offering her \"heartfelt condolences to all those affected\". She invited anyone who may be affected by the news to get in touch for support - adding that people should not take to Facebook to speculate on the ongoing investigation.\n\nLaurence Brass, a local county councillor, told BBC News: \"This is not something that happens in Bushey.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nPolice have launched a major manhunt and made a direct appeal to the main suspect in the 'horrific murders' of three women - believed to be the wife and daughters of a BBC sports commetator.\n\nOfficers are urging the suspect, Kyle Clifford, to give himself up, following the discovery of the fatally-injured women aged 25, 28 and 61 - and police have warned he is believed to armed with a crossbow and other weapons.\n\nThe victims are reported to be the wife and daughters of BBC Five Live racing commentator John Hunt, who it is understood had been working for the BBC racing on Tuesday and may have raised the alarm when he returned home, reports the Mirror.\n\nToday Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said the attack last night in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Hertfordshire was a \"targeted incident \" and Clifford, 26, was \"wanted in connection with murder\".\n\nHe said: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident. We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area.\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, he said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nThe three women were found in the early evening after police and ambulance vehicles - including two air ambulances - rushed to a home in Bushley, Hertfordshire before 7pm. The trio had suffered serious injuries but were alive when discovered, however all died a short time later.\n\nA neighbour claimed screams were heard from a house in the queit cul-de-sac where the three women were murdered. The 46-year-old who works in the media and lives near the scene but asked not to be named, said \"absolute chaos\" then broke out as armed police put the road into lockdown.\n\nShe told the PA news agency: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos. We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house' ... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\"\n\nThe suspect at the centre of the major manhunt, Kyle Clifford, is from the Enfield area and police have been searching for him following the horrific discovery. Officers believe he could be anywhere in the Hertfordshire or North London area but have urged anyone who sees him to stay wary and to phone 999 immediately, with a spokesperson for the police force later specifying that Clifford \"may be in possession of a crossbow\". Anyone with information has been urged to come forward by police.\n\nAerial shots from a BBC live feed have shown a blue-and-white forensic tent in one of the front gardens of the cul-de-sac, with police and forensic teams surrounding the area. The search is ongoing but no arrests have yet been made.\n\nCh Supt Jon Simpson said \"extensive police resources\" are being piled into the manhunt, and that members of the public had already been getting in touch with the police to report possible sightings.\n\nThe Home Office is aware of the incident and being kept \"fully updated\". in a post on X, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family & friends of those who have been killed & with the community. I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support (Hertfordshire Police) with any information about this case.\"\n\nNeighbours shared their shock after police, an ambulance crew and ground ambulances rushed to the \u00a3800,000 four-bed house. One neighbour, who gave his name as Riaz, said: \"They are a middle class family. It is tragic and horrifying.\n\n\"There was a lot of activity from the police and ambulance last night - there were over a dozen cars. There was an air ambulance. The road was closed way past midnight. There is no access into the road.\" Riaz, who is in his late 50s and works in Telecoms, said: \"It is a decent neighbourhood. It is mostly retired people and professionals living here.\"\n\nAnother neighbour of the family, who did not want to be named, said she did not know them well, but they were friendly. \"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nLocal councillor Louise Nicolas posted on Facebook that she is \"deeply saddened\" by the \"tragic news\", offering her \"heartfelt condolences to all those affected\". She invited anyone who may be affected by the news to get in touch for support - adding that people should not take to Facebook to speculate on the ongoing investigation.\n\nLaurence Brass, a local county councillor, told BBC News: \"This is not something that happens in Bushey. We can't remember a murder in our rather quiet neck of the woods, so (it's a) terrible shock and our sympathies and prayers and thoughts are with the families of the three women.\n\n\"That really is a terrible thing to happen to anybody, and I've gathered they're all from the same family, which obviously makes it even more tragic, and we'll do everything we can as the local council to add our source of comfort where we can.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_warburton@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Dan Warburton",

We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area.\"\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nAddressing Clifford directly, he said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nThe three women were found in the early evening after police and ambulance vehicles - including two air ambulances - were called to to a home in Bushey, Hertfordshire before 7pm. The trio had suffered serious injuries but were alive when discovered, however all died a short time later.\n\nA neighbour said screams were heard from a house in the quiet cul-de-sac where three women died. The 46-year-old who works in the media and lives near the scene but asked not to be named, said \"absolute chaos\" then broke out as armed police put the road into lockdown.\n\nShe told the PA news agency: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos. We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house' ... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\"\n\nThe man at the centre of the major manhunt, Clifford is from the Enfield area and police have been searching for him throughout the night after the horrific discovery. Cops believe he could be anywhere in the Hertfordshire or North London area but have urged anyone who sees him to stay wary and to phone 999 immediately, with a spokesperson for the police force later specifying that Clifford \"may be in possession of a crossbow\". Anyone with information has been urged to come forward by police.\n\nAerial shots from a BBC live feed have shown a blue-and-white forensic tent in one of the front gardens of the cul-de-sac, with police and forensic teams swarming the area. The search is ongoing but no arrests have yet been made.\n\nCh Supt Jon Simpson said \"extensive police resources\" are being piled into the manhunt, and that members of the public had already been getting in touch with the police to report possible sightings.\n\nThe Home Office is aware of the incident and being kept \"fully updated\". in a post on X, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been killed and with the community. I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support (Hertfordshire Police) with any information about this case.\"\n\nNeighbours expressed their shock after police, an ambulance crew and ground ambulances rushed to the \u00a3800,000 four-bed house. One neighbour, who gave his name as Riaz, said: \"They are a middle class family. It is tragic and horrifying.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of activity from the police and ambulance last night - there were over a dozen cars. There was an air ambulance. The road was closed way past midnight. There is no access into the road.\" Riaz, who is in his late 50s and works in Telecoms, said: \"It is a decent neighbourhood. It is mostly retired people and professionals living here.\"\n\nAnother neighbour of the family, who did not want to be named, said she did not know them well, but they were friendly. \"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\"\n\nLocal councillor Louise Nicolas posted on Facebook that she is \"deeply saddened\" by the \"tragic news\", offering her \"heartfelt condolences to all those affected\". She invited anyone who may be affected by the news to get in touch for support - adding that people should not take to Facebook to speculate on the ongoing investigation.\n\nLaurence Brass, a local county councillor, told BBC News: \"This is not something that happens in Bushey. We can't remember a murder in our rather quiet neck of the woods, so (it's a) terrible shock and our sympathies and prayers and thoughts are with the families of the three women.\"\n\n\"That really is a terrible thing to happen to anybody, and I've gathered they're all from the same family, which obviously makes it even more tragic, and we'll do everything we can as the local council to add our source of comfort where we can.\"\n\nFor all the latest news, visit the Belfast Live homepage here and sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "belfastlive.co.uk", "dataType":

The BBC confirmed they are the wide and daughters of their commentator John Hunt\n\nThree murder victims have been named as the wife and daughters of a BBC sports commentator as police continue the manhunt for a killer armed with a crossbow.\n\nCarol Hunt, 61, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, have been named as those that lost their lives in last night's tragic triple killing. The BBC confirmed the names of the dead women, who are the wife and daughters of BBC Five Live racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nMain suspect Kyle Clifford, 26, is being hunted following the discovery of the fatally-injured women and police have warned he is believed to armed with a crossbow and other weapons. A heartbreaking tribute to Louise on social media reads, according to MyLondon: \"No words can describe the loss I feel after today's horrific news. You were so loved and Scooby adored you...you built up an amazing business and were always so kind and gentle. May you RIP with your sister and mum xxx.\"\n\nLouise reportedly launched a dog grooming service during Covid lockdown named Groom and Glow, while her sister Hannah owned a beauty business, the website reported. The deadly incident is believed to have taken place in leafy Hertfordshire last night. Armed police and ambulances raced to the cul-de-sac in Bushey at about 6.30pm.\n\nA neighbour said screams were heard from a house. The 46-year-old who works in the media and lives near the scene but asked not to be named, said \"absolute chaos\" then broke out as armed police put the road into lockdown. She said: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos. We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house' ... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\"\n\nThe man at the centre of the major manhunt, Clifford is from the Enfield area and police have been searching for him throughout the night after the horrific discovery. Cops believe he could be anywhere in the Hertfordshire or North London area but have urged anyone who sees him to stay wary and to phone 999 immediately, with a spokesperson for the police force later specifying that Clifford \"may be in possession of a crossbow\".\n\nAnyone with information has been urged to come forward by police and call 999 if they spot him. Officers have appealed directly to Clifford at a press conference today.

The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022.\n\nLocal councillor Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, Simpson said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.", "source": {"uri":

They believe he could be in Hertfordshire or north London and may have a crossbow. Anyone who sees him is asked to call 999 and not approach him.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson confirmed that the victims were aged 25, 28 and 61.\n\nHe said the murders are believed to have been a \"targeted incident\" involving what is \"currently believed\" to be a crossbow but \"other weapons may also have been used\".\n\nSimpson told reporters: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident.\"\n\nHe said \"extensive\" police resources are deployed in north London and the Bushey area.\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used,\" Simpson added.\n\nAddressing Clifford directly, he said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nGlyn Nicholas, a 77-year-old neighbour, said one of the women had crashed her car into a wooden telephone pole outside the home last week.\n\nHe said she had told someone the crash occurred because she was upset after the breakdown of a relationship with her boyfriend. The car door was \"caved in\", he added.\n\nNicholas also described them as a \"lovely family\" who had lived there for 10 years.\n\nAlan Vincent, 86, another neighbour, said he saw three ambulances and ten police cars outside a property at 7pm.\n\nAbout 15 minutes later a man arrived in a Mini and parked in the middle of the road.\n\nVincent said: \"He told me that his girlfriend had been injured. He said he had received a phone call from the police. I said he could park in my driveway.\n\n\"Then all three ambulances left together. I didn't see any bodies being taken out.\"\n\nA female resident of Ashlyn Close, who did not want to be named, heard a woman screaming last night before armed police put the street into lockdown.\n\nThe 46-year-old said: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody, screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like, 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n\"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house' ... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\"\n\nArmed police went from house to house questioning locals, requesting doorbell camera footage and telling people to stay indoors, a neighbour said.\n\nThe neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she did not know the victims well but they were a friendly family. \"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said.\n\nAnother neighbour described how \"lots\" of armed police descended on the street and knocked on their door. \"They told us to keep the door closed. There were about 15 to 20 police cars. There was a helicopter flying around.\" If someone had escaped on foot, the neighbour said, there were three directions they could have taken from the road.\n\nLaurence Brass, a councillor who lives nearby, told the BBC that the area is \"a typical leafy British suburb\". He said: \"We can't remember a murder in our rather quiet neck of the woods.\"\n\nDetective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit said: \"This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\n\n\"Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or north London.\n\n\"Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\n\"Our inquiries will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\n\n\"This incident will of course be of concern to local residents. Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be in the area today so please do speak to them if you need to.\"\n\nYvette Cooper, the home secretary, described the deaths of the three women as \"truly shocking\" and said she was being kept updated.\n\nShe said: \"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been killed and with the community. I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support Hertfordshire police with any information about this case.\"\n\nLouise Nicolas, Alan Matthews and Paul Richards, councillors for the area, said: \"We are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic news that three women have lost their lives in a violent incident which took place in the heart of our local community.\n\n\"As North Bushey councillors, we extend our thoughts and condolences to their families and all those affected.

appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.'\n\nAn East of England Ambulance Service spokesperson said: 'We were called around 7pm on Tuesday July 9 to a property in Ashlyn Close in Bushey.\n\n'Three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, an ambulance officer vehicle, the Hazardous Area Response Team, the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and London Air Ambulance were sent to the scene.\n\n'Sadly, despite the team's best efforts, three women were pronounced dead at the scene.'\n\nLocal councillors for the area Louise Nicolas, Alan Matthews and Paul Richards said: 'We are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic news that three women have lost their lives in a violent incident which took place in the heart of our local community.\n\n'As North Bushey councillors, we extend our thoughts and condolences to their families and all those affected.\n\n'We would encourage anyone who has information relevant to the inquiry to contact police.'\n\nThe previous government had considered tightening the laws around crossbows after would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail was encouraged by an AI chatbot to break into Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 with a loaded crossbow to kill the late Queen.\n\nCurrently there is no requirement to have a licence for a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

Image Courtesy: @DetectiveCouch/X\n\nA BBC journalist returned home from work to find his wife and two daughters fatally injured in what British police are calling 'a targeted crossbow attack'.\n\nA suspect wanted in connection with the triple killings was found injured on Wednesday afternoon following a manhunt.\n\nThe search for Kyle Clifford, 26, began on Tuesday evening when police received a call regarding the attack in Bushey, a residential area in northwestern London.\n\nThe BBC confirmed that the women killed were members of the family of its commentator John Hunt -- his wife Carol Hunt, 61, and two daughters Hannah, 28, and Louise, 25. The couple also have another daughter, Amy, who is believed to live in Birmingham.\n\nCarol was found in the house's hallway with a crossbow bolt in her chest, and there was signs of ligatures on the victims' faces and wrists, according to The Guardian sources. It is believed that one of the victims texted her partner to ask them to report the attack.\n\nHunt discovered the deaths early on Tuesday night after getting home from covering the Lingfield Park racecourse south of London, according to the Daily Mail and other media outlets.\n\nDespite the efforts of police and ambulance crews to save them, they were declared dead at the site.\n\nPolice stated that while a crossbow is thought to have been used in the \"targeted incident,\" other weapons might have also been used.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson asserted that the suspect was acquainted with the family and that the attack was not random, as per NPR.\n\nA nearby resident and local council member named Laurence Brass compared the area to \"a typical leafy British suburb\" while sharing his account of the previous evening.\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAfter learning of the killings on Tuesday, police had been searching a park close to Clifford's northwest London residence.\n\nThe Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit's Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins had previously stated that the investigation is proceeding \"at pace\" and that the victims' \"premature\" naming \"caused great upset.\"\n\n\"This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened,\" she said, as per NPR, adding, \"Following extensive inquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time.\"\n\n'Targeted killing'\n\nHertfordshire Police released a statement on Wednesday afternoon stating that Clifford, who they warned may have been carrying a crossbow, was discovered in Enfield, North London, and is undergoing treatment for his wounds.\n\nAlthough they insisted that they had not fired any rounds, the police did not explain how those injuries occurred.\n\n\"A man wanted in connection with a triple murder in Bushey has been traced to a location in North London. Following an extensive search, Kyle Clifford, aged 26, was found in the Enfield area by officers this afternoon (Wednesday, July 10),\" the statement said.\n\nThe manhunt intensified and armed police raided an address at Gordon Hill, Enfield, north London, early in the morning. The Rendlesham Road property is believed to have been connected to Clifford's brother Bradley, who was accused of murder in 2018 and given a life sentence.\n\nLocal schools were also shut down.\n\nAlthough British media had reported that Clifford was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters, Louise Hunt, police did not specify how or whether Clifford was related to the women.\n\nThe breakup deeply affected Louise, who recently crashed her car into a telegraph pole outside their family home, Daily Mail reported. Carol mentioned her daughter's split with her boyfriend was messy. Carol didn't go into specifics, but you could tell she was worried,\" a friend was quoted as saying by the British newspaper.\n\nClifford left the British army in 2022 after serving for a brief time, a British Defence Ministry source told CNN. As per the report, he joined the forces in 2019 and served in the Household Cavalry.\n\nCondolences pour in\n\nThe BBC described the women's killings as \"utterly devastating\" and said that it would give Hunt \"all the support we can.\"\n\n\"The news today about John Hunt's family is utterly devastating. Our thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can,\" the statement to staff read.\n\nBritish Home Secretary Yvette Cooper expressed her condolences and said on X, \"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been killed and with the community. I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support Hertfordshire Police with any information about this case.\"\n\nAccording to PA Media, a neighbour of the women said she \"would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning. It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nCalls for law change\n\nIn the UK, anyone above 18 is permitted to purchase or possess a crossbow; however, if they are caught carrying one in public without a valid reason, they risk jail time.\n\nThe previous government began an eight-week assessment of the regulations and the prospect of implementing a licensing plan in February.\n\nLaura Sugden, whose partner Shane Gilmer was killed in a similar crossbow attack in 2018, has called for a licensing system for the weapons.\n\nOn the Today programme on BBC Radio Four, she said, \"Three people lost their lives yesterday and if that's not enough to now stop and think that these are dangerous weapons, unbelievable lethal - we need to be looking to do something. Put some legislation in, bring them in line with firearms and try and prevent future deaths.\"\n\nViolence against women in the UK\n\nThe killings sent shockwaves through the country.\n\nAlthough mass killings are uncommon in Britain, the government has designated violence against women as a national issue, as per CNN.\n\nReem Alsalem, the UN special rapporteur on violence against women and girls, stated earlier this year that one in four women will experience domestic violence in their lifetime and that a woman is killed by a man in the UK every three days.\n\n\"Entrenched patriarchy at almost every level of society, combined with a rise in misogyny that permeates the physical and online world, is denying thousands of women and girls across the UK the right to live in safety, free from fear and violence,\" Alsalem said in February.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Police did not say how those injuries happened but said they had not fired any shots.\n\nThe BBC confirmed that the women killed were the family of John Hunt -- his 61-year-old wife Carol Hunt and their daughters Louise and Hannah, aged 25 and 28 respectively.\n\nWhile the manhunt was underway, the public were urged not to approach Clifford. Enfield is around 52 kilometers (17 miles) to the east from the site of the killing.\n\n\"Following extensive inquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time,\" said Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit.\n\n\"This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened,\" she added.\n\nJenkins said the investigation is moving \"at pace\" and that formal identification of the victims is yet to take place. She also said that the \"premature\" naming of the victims \"caused great upset.\"\n\nPolice had been scouring a park in north London, near the home of Clifford, after being alerted Tuesday about the killings in a house in Bushey, a residential area in northwestern London. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nJohn Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that Hunt found the bodies early Tuesday evening, after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nPolice did not say how or whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022.\n\nLocal council member Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, was kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nPolice have issued a direct plea to a triple murder suspect as a huge manhunt to track him down continues.\n\nKyle Clifford has been urged to 'make contact' with officers after the 'targeted incident' on Ashlyn Close in Bushey, Hertfordshire on Tuesday evening. A manhunt is underway to find the 26-year-old, who is wanted over the deaths of three women - aged 25, 28 and 61 - who were found fatally injured in a house on the cul-de-sac.\n\nClifford may be armed with a crossbow, police believe. Speaking to reporters from Hertfordshire, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said 'extensive police resources' had been deployed to track him down.\n\nREAD NEXT: Fears triple murder suspect has CROSSBOW as police pictured in major UK manhunt update\n\nHe said: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident. We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area.\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nAddressing Clifford directly, he said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\" He repeated warnings to the public not to approach him, but to call 999 if they see him.\n\nTerrified neighbours said they heard screams as the scenes of 'absolute chaos' unfolded on Ashlyn Close last night. One 46-year-old resident, who did not wish to be named, told the PA news agency: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like, 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n\"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house'... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\" She said multiple ambulances, helicopters and 'at least 16 police cars' arrived at the scene quickly, with armed police going from house to house to question locals, request doorbell camera footage and tell them to stay indoors.\n\nShe added: \"It's really, really stressful now to think that that happened in such a close vicinity and none of us were aware and none of us could help. It's just absolutely traumatic, I think, for the family involved, for everyone.\n\n\"I think that's the stressful thing, that it happened at peak family time between 6pm and 7pm, when people were probably cooking for their kids and getting their kids ready for bed, and all of us in a tight little road, completely unaware of the trauma and tragic circumstances that other people were going through at that particular time.\"\n\nLocal councillors for the North Bushey area said they were 'deeply shocked and saddened' by the news of the deaths. A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she did not know the victims well but they were a friendly family.\n\n\"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. \"It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said she is being kept fully updated about the inquiry into the 'truly shocking' deaths. Hertfordshire police and crime commissioner Jonathan Ash-Edwards said: \"My thoughts are with the family and friends of the women who have been shockingly killed in this terrible incident in Bushey.\n\n\"It will no doubt send shockwaves through the local community and across Hertfordshire. I am being kept updated by the police and I urge the public to support the police with any information about the whereabouts of the named suspect.\"\n\nRead more of today's top stories here", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashlie_blakey@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Ashlie Blakey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhunt (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_superintendent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief superintendent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_and_crime_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police and crime commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Councillor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Councillor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29514473.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Bushey-triple-murder.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2705882352941177, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Emergency services rushed to a home in Bushey, Hertfordshire before 7pm on Tuesday, where the victims where found with serious injuries.\n\nTragically, they all died a short time later at the scene. Kyle Clifford from Enfield, north London, is wanted in connection with the incident. Police believe the 26-year-old could be anywhere in Hertfordshire or North London.\n\nCops have urged anyone who sees him to stay wary and to phone 999 immediately with a spokesperson for Hertfordshire Police later specifying Clifford \"may be in possession of a crossbow\", reports the Mirror.\n\nWhile anyone who was in Ashlyn Close from lunchtime yesterday should also come forward to help the police with their investigations. The area has been described as a quiet area by shocked locals.\n\nThe Home Office is aware of the incident and being kept \"fully updated\". in a post on X, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family & friends of those who have been killed & with the community. I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support (Hertfordshire Police) with any information about this case.\"\n\nNeighbours expressed their shock after police, an ambulance crew and ground ambulances rushed to the \u00a3800,000 four-bed house. One neighbour, who gave his name as Riaz, said: \"They are a middle class family. It is tragic and horrifying.\n\n\"There was a lot of activity from the police and ambulance last night - there were over a dozen cars. There was an air ambulance. The road was closed way past midnight. There is no access into the road.\" Riaz, who is in his late 50s and works in Telecoms, said: \"It is a decent neighbourhood. It is mostly retired people and professionals living here.\"\n\nAnother neighbour of the family, who did not want to be named, said she did not know them well, but they were friendly. \"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nLaurence Brass, a local county councillor, told BBC News: \"This is not something that happens in Bushey. We can't remember a murder in our rather quiet neck of the woods, so (it's a) terrible shock and our sympathies and prayers and thoughts are with the families of the three women.\n\n\"That really is a terrible thing to happen to anybody, and I've gathered they're all from the same family, which obviously makes it even more tragic, and we'll do everything we can as the local council to add our source of comfort where we can.\"\n\nRob Hall, Detective Superintendent from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: \"This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\n\n\"Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.

The three women aged 25, 28 and 61 were found seriously injured - and subsequently pronounced dead at the scene, reports the Mirror.\n\nHunt, who is married with three children, is said to have been working for the BBC on Tuesday and may have been the individual to raise the alarm when he returned home at around 7pm, as reported by The Telegraph. The broadcaster's 61-year-old wife Carol has been named locally, with Hertfordshire Police revealing at a press conference Wednesday afternoon the two other victims were her daughters.\n\nHunt, who is a former police officer, has worked for BBC Radio Five Live as a racing commentator for the last 20 years. ITV racing pundit Matt Chapman took to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday to share his condolences for his co-star.\n\nHe wrote: \"No words needed for what has happened to @HuntyCaller and family today. Impossible to comprehend the pain. Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal - racing loves you.\"\n\nNow a huge manhunt is underway to find Kyle Clifford, 26, from Enfield, who is wanted in connection with the triple murder, which took place at a property in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Hertfordshire.\n\nCalling on the public for information, Detective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: \"This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\n\n\"Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.\n\n\"Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\n\"Our enquires will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\n\n\"This incident will of course be of concern to local residents. Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be in the area today so please do speak to them if you need to.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said in a post on X: \"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family & friends of those who have been killed & with the community.\n\n\"I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support (Hertfordshire Police) with any information about this case.\"\n\nDon't miss the latest news from around Scotland and beyond - Sign up to our daily newsletter here.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eve_beattie@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Eve Beattie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "charlotte_mcintyre@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Charlotte McIntyre", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Telegraph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bedfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bedfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_(police)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent (police)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridgeshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cambridgeshire"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33211701.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Bushey.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

British police were hunting for a man believed to be armed with a crossbow after three women were killed in a house near London.\n\nBy Pan Pylas, Associated Press\n\nWednesday, July 10, 2024 | 8:17 a.m.\n\nLONDON -- British police launched a huge manhunt Wednesday for a man believed to be armed with a crossbow and potentially other weapons after three women were killed in a house northwest of London. The BBC said the women killed were the family of well-known radio racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nHertfordshire Police said Kyle Clifford, 26, was being sought over the suspected triple murder, which involved a crossbow and potentially other unnamed weapons. The public were urged not to approach Clifford if they see him.\n\nArmed police officers and specialist search teams were \"responding at pace in the wake of what has been an horrific incident,\" Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said.\n\nPolice said the three women -- ages 25, 28 and 61 -- were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nBBC Radio 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel, said the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two of their daughters.\n\nJohn Hunt is BBC radio's main horse racing commentator, his voice known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nPolice did not say whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022.\n\nLocal councillor Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, Simpson said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.", "source": {"uri":

It's alleged Hunt returned home from work to find the three women seriously injured - they were subsequently pronounced dead at the scene, reports The Mirror.\n\nHunt, who is married with three children, is said to have been working for the BBC on Tuesday and may have raised the alarm when he returned home at around 7pm, as reported by The Telegraph. The broadcaster's 61-year-old wife Carol has been named locally, with Hertfordshire Police revealing at a press conference Wednesday afternoon that the two other victims were her daughters.\n\nHunt, who is a former police officer, has worked for BBC Radio Five Live as a racing commentator for the last 20 years. ITV racing pundit Matt Chapman took to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday to share his condolences for his co-star.\n\nHe wrote: \"No words needed for what has happened to @HuntyCaller and family today. Impossible to comprehend the pain. Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal - racing loves you.\" A search is underway to find Kyle Clifford, 26, from Enfield, who is wanted in connection with the deaths, which took place at a property in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Hertfordshire.\n\nCalling on the public for information, Detective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: \"This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\n\n\"Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.\n\n\"Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\n\"Our enquires will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\n\n\"This incident will of course be of concern to local residents. Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be in the area today so please do speak to them if you need to.\"\n\nThe Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said in a post on X: \"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family & friends of those who have been killed & with the community. I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support (Hertfordshire Police) with any information about this case.\"\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC 5 Live staff on Wednesday, the organisation described the incident which involved the deaths of the wife and daughters of racing commentator John Hunt as \"utterly devastating\". The note read: \"The news today about John Hunt's family is utterly devastating.

AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nLONDON (AP) -- British police were scouring a park in north London on Wednesday, searching for a man they suspect killed three women with a crossbow. The BBC has confirmed that the women were the family of its well-known radio racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nHertfordshire Police said Kyle Clifford, 26, was wanted in the suspected triple murder, which involved a crossbow and potentially other unnamed weapons. The public were urged not to approach Clifford, who is from the Enfield area in north London, around 52 kilometers (17 miles) to the east from the site of the killing.\n\nArmed police officers, forensic personnel and ambulance staff were seen at Hilly Fields Park in Enfield, which is popular with joggers and dog-walkers, and the adjacent Lavender Hill cemetery. The area has been closed off and an ambulance helicopter was also at the scene. Police have not confirmed whether the intense activity is connected to the manhunt as it is an ongoing investigation.\n\nPolice said the three women -- aged 25, 28 and 61 -- were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe BBC confirmed the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two daughters, Louise Hunt and her older sister Hannah Hunt.\n\nJohn Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nPolice did not say whether Clifford was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022.\n\nLocal council member Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area where the killings took place is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without

The public were urged not to approach him if they see him.\n\nArmed police officers and specialist search teams have said they are \"responding at pace\" to a \"horrific incident\". Police said the three women were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nJohn Hunt is BBC radio's main horse racing commentator, his voice known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby. As part of a note sent to BBC staff, the corporation described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and pledged that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nHere's five things we know about the suspect:\n\nClifford is 'ex-boyfriend' of one of victims\n\nVictim Louise Hunt is believed to be the ex-girlfriend of Kyle Clifford. Louise launched a dog grooming service during Covid lockdown named Groom and Glow, while her sister Hannah owned a beauty business.\n\nAfter the breakup, Louise had recently smashed her car into a telegraph pole outside her house. Glyn Nicholas, 77, told the Telegraph: \"Louise split up with her boyfriend a few days ago and she crashed her car into a telegraph pole because she was so upset coming home. She's a lovely, caring girl. She runs a dog grooming business in Bushey. Her sister Hannah and mother Carol are lovely as well. It's all so sad. Louise was a sweet, lovely girl. They all were. This is so sad for everyone.\"\n\nLeft army 'two years ago'\n\nThe BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022. The Ministry of Defence confirmed on Wednesday that Kyle Clifford, wanted in connection with the triple murder in Bushey had served briefly in the Armed Forces.\n\nA Whitehall source said: \"He didn't serve very long and he is no longer a serving member of the armed forces. We're not going to speculate which regiment or unit he was in, but look at his age. He didn't serve very long.\"\n\nPublic told not to approach him as he could still have crossbow\n\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson from Hertfordshire Police told reporters the murders are believed to be \"targeted\". The force also warned the public not to approach the suspect who \"may be in possession of a crossbow\".\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident. People in the UK do not need a licence to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse. A spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.\n\nHouse raided\n\nArmed police have searched an address in Rendlesham Road, Enfield, as the manhunt for Clifford continues. Clifford is wanted for murder, following deaths of three women in Bushey, Hertfordshire.\n\nThe house, close to Gordon Hill railway station, was swarmed by officers on Wednesday morning, according to neighbours. Two officers were stood outside the property at 1.30pm, after a cordon was removed. One neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: \"They kept going in and out of the property carrying guns, the whole road was taped off. It was over quite quickly but there's been helicopters flying around the area all day. I don't recognise the suspect at all, as far as I'm concerned he didn't live in the house.\"\n\nNo 'perceived threat' to public\n\nArmed officers have been seen in the Enfield area of north London this evening as they comb local allotments and a cemetery for the fugitive. But Enfield Council in north London says it has been advised by police that \"there is no perceived threat\" to the public. In a statement posted on the local authority's X account, the council said: \"You will be aware of the news regarding the suspect Kyle Clifford from the Enfield area, wanted in relation to a triple murder in Bushey, Hertfordshire.\n\n\"We have been advised by the Police that there is no perceived threat to the public so the guidance is to carry on as normal. Local schools have been advised that end of day school procedures should continue as per normal. There will be an enhanced police presence in the area and around some schools to provide reassurance to pupils and parents.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

It was in a nightclub in Hemel Hempstead. We went out together, went to birthdays and events.\n\n\"It's very difficult. She was the nicest, kindest, sweetest person you could ever meet. A beautiful person.\"\n\nMs Holloway continued: \"They were a lovely family and (the daughters) were lovely girls.\n\n\"They were making their way through life and their lives have been taken too soon. It's the thing of nightmares.\n\n\"I feel for their eldest daughter and John (Hunt). I can't imagine what it would be like.\"\n\nAfter being joined by two other close friends, Dionne Smith, 58, and Abigail Phillips, 58, the trio told reporters: \"We were a four, and now there's only three.\n\n\"It doesn't seem real. We are together in grief.\"\n\nIn a post on Facebook, Hannah Hunt's colleagues at The Anti-Ageing Clinic in Radlett, Hertfordshire, said it was with \"deep regret and sadness\" that they learned of the \"horrific murder on Tuesday night of our skin therapist Hannah\".\n\nThe post continued: \"She was a fantastic therapist and clients loved her.\n\n\"We send our condolences and prayers to her Dad, sister and family.\n\n\"She was very much a part of our team. Please bear with us at this terrible time.\"\n\nProviding an update on the investigation, Detective Superintendent Rob Hall, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: \"This was an unprecedented attack and we are determined to understand the full circumstances of what happened that evening and the events leading up to it.\n\n\"This investigation, as I'm sure people can imagine, will take time.\n\n\"We are still appealing for anyone with information in relation to the incident on Tuesday evening in Bushey and activity in Enfield yesterday that could assist us to please contact police directly.\"\n\nOn Thursday, further searches took place at a house linked to Clifford's brother, Bradley Clifford, who was jailed for life with a minimum term of 23 years for the murder of moped passenger Soban Khan in 2018.\n\nAccording to the Metropolitan Police, at the time of the murder Bradley Clifford had targeted the moped before crashing into it, and continued to assault Mr Khan after the collision.\n\nOfficers were seen at the address in Rendlesham Road, Enfield, north London, in relation to the deaths.\n\nPolice staff wearing gloves and face masks were seen outside the property, which was first searched on Wednesday.\n\nFlowers were left at the scene in Ashlyn Close on Thursday, with notes attached to some bouquets with messages such as \"rest in peace\".\n\nClifford was found injured in Lavender Hill Cemetery in Enfield, north London, on Wednesday and was taken to a major trauma centre for treatment.\n\nPolice said no shots had been fired by officers and no arrest had yet been made.\n\nArmed police had earlier been in the area, with an air ambulance nearby.\n\nFootage from Sky News appeared to show Clifford being stretchered out of the cemetery by paramedics and a further clip seemed to show the suspect been wheeled into the Royal London hospital.\n\nIn a press conference before Clifford was found, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson, from Hertfordshire Police, told reporters the killings were believed to have been \"targeted\".\n\nDuring the hunt for Clifford, who is understood to have left the Army in 2022 after a short stint, the force said they believed he may have been armed with a crossbow and warned people not to approach him.\n\nHe was believed to have been known to the victims.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper is urgently considering whether tougher crossbow laws are needed in the wake of the killings.\n\nShe will look at the findings of a Home Office review carried out earlier this year.", "source": {"uri":

Police, then ambulances, darted to the scene.\n\nThe discovery was grim - three women, all shot dead in their own home in what was believed to be a targeted attack. The weapon - a crossbow.\n\nThe suspect is Kyle Clifford, a 26-year-old ex-military man and security guard, who was also the former boyfriend of one of the victims, Louise Hunt, 25.\n\nMs Hunt, a successful and popular dog groomer, was found slain alongside her mother, Carol Hunt, 61, the wife of BBC radio commentator John Hunt, and the couple's older daughter Hannah, 28.\n\nKyle Clifford, a former soldier and security guard, was apprehended by police after a 24-hour man hunt on suspicion of murder\n\nVictim Louise Hunt, 25, (pictured) is the ex-girlfriend of crossbow suspect Kyle Clifford\n\nHannah, 28, who worked nearby as a beautician, 'always had a smile'\n\nHannah Hunt, 28, and her mother Carol Hunt, 61, were also found dead in the family home\n\nBBC horse racing commentator John Hunt (pictured) is a voice known to millions\n\nBut the sudden appearance of the emergency services, interrupting an otherwise unremarkable evening in this leafy pocket of London's commuter belt, pricked the memories of neighbours.\n\nWas there any connection to Louise's recent break-up, in which she was apparently so distressed that she crashed her car into a telephone pole at the edge of her driveway?\n\nNeighbour Glyn Nicholas, 77, recalled the dog groomer, who ran her business from the home, was 'very upset' about splitting with Clifford.\n\n'A friend of Louise's told me that her car door had caved in because of the crash,' he said.\n\n'Carol was a nice, polite and quiet lady. She was at home a lot of the time.\n\n'They were all very nice, a private family. They all did their own things.\n\n'Louise started a business a couple of years ago, and it was a thriving business - we all took our dogs there to be groomed.\n\nLouise Hunt, 25, (pictured) was the ex-girlfriend of suspect Kyle Clifford and was one of the three women found dead in the family home\n\nHannah Hunt, 28, and her mother Carol Hunt, 61, were also found dead in the family home\n\nFloral tributes near to the scene in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Hertfordshire, where Carol Hunt, 61, the wife of BBC Five Live racing commentator John Hunt, and two of their daughters, Hannah, 28, and Louise, 25, were killed\n\nPolice officers at the scene in Ashlyn Close, where the three victims were killed in an attack allegedly involving a crossbow\n\nA message left for the victims read: 'I wish none of this was real'\n\nA message attached to floral tributes left for Carol Hunt and two daughters Hannah and Louise, who were slain in their family home\n\n'A very close-knit family and they used to love the street.'\n\nA friend added: '(Mum Carol) said her daughter's split with her boyfriend was messy. Carol did not go into too much detail, but you could see she was concerned.'\n\nThe manhunt for Clifford began in earnest, and the whole street suddenly became aware that something terrible had happened.\n\n'Within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos,' one neighbour said.\n\n'We had armed police running down, screaming, \"Stay in your house\" ... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.'\n\nIt is understood the police missed their suspect by mere minutes.\n\nDoorbell footage showed a man matching Clifford's description walking with purpose away from the Hunts' home at 6.50pm.\n\nUnder his arm, a large, bulky item secreted beneath a white sheet.\n\nThe man then got into a car and fled the scene.\n\nDoorbell footage shows a man believed to be Kyle Clifford walking away from a house containing the dead bodies of three women\n\nPolice cordoned off Ashlyn Close, home of the Hunt family in Bushey, Hertforshire, after being called to the scene on Tuesday evening\n\nPolice believed the suspect used a crossbow to attack the three victims\n\nMANHUNT TIMELINE\n\n6.50pm TUESDAY : Suspect is seen walking away from home where BBC star's wife and two daughters found dead\n\n7pm: Police called to Ashlyn Close after neighbour reported hearing screams. Three women found seriously injured and later died.\n\n9am WEDNESDAY: Police release appeal naming Kyle Clifford as their main suspect. At the same time armed police raid a property in Rendlesham Road, Enfield\n\n12.30pm: Police confirm at a press conference crossbow attack was 'targeted'\n\n1pm - Huge manhunt across Bushey and Enfield - suspect's car found, primary schools put into lockdown\n\n4.30pm - Armed police and paramedics seen running into Lavender Hill cemetery in Enfield.\n\n5pm - Kyle Clifford is detained by police and taken to a major trauma hospital after 'shooting himself'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe police's arrival, so soon after the massacre, was not triggered by neighbours' concerns, however.\n\nIndeed it is believed the police were called to the property by one of the brave victims, who somehow managed to alert emergency services while her relatives perished - and moments before she also died from her injuries.\n\nPolice initially kept a lid on the tragedy.\n\nBut by around 9am the following day, they asked for the public's help.\n\nIn a highly unusual move, detectives named former soldier Clifford as their prime suspect.\n\nPassengers arriving at London's Victoria railway station during the morning rush hour were funneled through exit barriers, allowing police officers to scan the crowd, looking for Clifford.\n\nDetectives reasoned the suspect did not have much time to get too far before the police turned up, so focussed much of their attention on Hertfordshire and North London, where Clifford was from.\n\nAt 12.30pm, police confirmed the identity of the suspects, with Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson appealing directly to the triple murder suspect to hand himself in.\n\n'Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact,' he said.'\n\nAnd he confirmed the attack was believed to have been 'targeted'.\n\nHe said there were 'extensive police resources deployed to various locations', with armed officers and specialist search teams involved.\n\nThis had included storming Clifford's family home in Rendlesham Road, Enfield, around 14 miles to the east of Bushey, shortly before the police appeal that morning.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson of Hertfordshire Police appealed for the triple murder suspect to hand himself in\n\nPolice confirmed the names of the victims, and urged the public not to approach the suspect\n\nAnd then a development. Clifford's abandoned vehicle was discovered nearby.\n\nSchools locally were put into lockdown as police from Hertfordshire and the Met stormed the area, intensifying the search for Clifford.\n\nOne mother said: 'They had cordoned off the road and were ushering people away from the house they were going into.\n\n'They had the full protective gear on, guns, shields and helmets - the kind you'd expect to see in riots.\n\nThe net closed in on their suspect, and the hunt moved to nearby Lavender Hill cemetery.\n\nArmed police search Lavender Hill Cemetery in Enfield, as the search for Kyle Clifford intensified\n\nArmed police search the area in Enfield, north London, not far from Clifford's family home\n\nPolice guard the scene where fugitive Kyle Clifford was found, Lavender Hill Cemetry, with apparent self-inflicted wounds\n\nRae Cresswell, 26, a local who filmed the commotion, said: 'I saw about ten officers coming in. I was quite worried because they were armed and there were dogs with them.\n\n'I asked them if they wanted me to leave but they said it was fine to stay. They started checking the area so I left shortly after and came back to see all these vehicles.'\n\nCamera crews also picked up the moment emergency services flocked to the site.\n\nPolice and two accompanying medics could be seen running along a back lane before darting left through a clearing and into the cemetery.\n\nArmed police kept a vigil at the gap, keeping members of the public and journalists away from the site.\n\nShortly after, broadcasters captured the suspect being taken away on a stretcher, flanked by police and medics, having apparently shooting himself.\n\nHe was placed into an ambulance.\n\nPolice were thought to have spent around two hours inside the cemetery before detaining the suspect. Officers said no shots were fired.\n\nClifford was taken by road ambulance to the Royal London hospital to be treated for his injuries.\n\nThe manhunt was over. And shortly before 6.30pm, police confirmed to the public that the police had got their man.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crossbow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_metropolitan_area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London metropolitan area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhunt (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crime scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbours", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Neighbours"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_raid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police raid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_trauma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major trauma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_superintendent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief superintendent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/11/12/87176381-0-image-a-6_1720696548735.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

The BBC said the women killed were the family of well-known radio racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nHertfordshire Police said Kyle Clifford, 26, was being sought over the suspected triple murder, which involved a crossbow and potentially other unnamed weapons. The public were urged not to approach Clifford if they see him.\n\nArmed police officers and specialist search teams were \"responding at pace in the wake of what has been an horrific incident,\" Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said.\n\nPolice said the three women -- ages 25, 28 and 61 -- were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nBBC Radio 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel, said the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two of their daughters.\n\nJohn Hunt is BBC radio's main horse racing commentator, his voice known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nPolice did not say whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022.\n\nLocal councillor Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, Simpson said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.\n\nPan Pylas, The Associated

The BBC has confirmed that the women were the family of its well-known radio racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nHertfordshire Police said Kyle Clifford, 26, was wanted in the suspected triple murder, which involved a crossbow and potentially other unnamed weapons. The public were urged not to approach Clifford, who is from the Enfield area in north London, around 52 kilometers (17 miles) to the east from the site of the killing.\n\nArmed police officers and ambulance staff were seen at a park in Enfield and a nearby cemetery. The area has been closed off and an air ambulance was also at the scene. Police have not confirmed whether the intense activity is connected to the manhunt as it is an ongoing investigation.\n\nPolice said the three women - ages 25, 28 and 61 - were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe BBC confirmed the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two daughters, Louise Hunt and her older sister Hannah Hunt.\n\nJohn Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nPolice did not say whether Clifford was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022.\n\nLocal councillor Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.",

If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\n\"Our inquiries will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\"\n\nAn East of England Ambulance Service spokesperson said: \"We were called around 7pm on Tuesday July 9 to a property in Ashlyn Close in Bushey.\n\n\"Three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, an ambulance officer vehicle, the Hazardous Area Response Team, the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and London Air Ambulance were sent to the scene.\n\n\"Sadly, despite the team's best efforts, three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\"\n\n\"As North Bushey councillors, we extend our thoughts and condolences to their families and all those affected.\n\n\"We would encourage anyone who has information relevant to the inquiry to contact police.\"\n\nThe previous government had considered tightening the laws around crossbows after would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail was encouraged by an AI chatbot to break into Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 with a loaded crossbow to kill the late Queen.\n\nCurrently, there is no requirement to have a licence for a crossbow, but it is illegal

If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\n\"Our inquiries will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\"\n\nAn East of England Ambulance Service spokesperson said: \"We were called around 7pm on Tuesday July 9 to a property in Ashlyn Close in Bushey.\n\n\"Three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, an ambulance officer vehicle, the Hazardous Area Response Team, the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and London Air Ambulance were sent to the scene.\n\n\"Sadly, despite the team's best efforts, three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\"\n\nLocal councillors for the area Louise Nicolas, Alan Matthews and Paul Richards said: \"We are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic news that three women have lost their lives in a violent incident which took place in the heart of our local community.\n\n\"As North Bushey councillors, we extend our thoughts and condolences to their families and all those affected.\n\n\"We would encourage anyone who has information relevant to the inquiry to contact police.\"\n\nThe previous government had considered tightening the laws around crossbows after would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail was encouraged by an AI chatbot to break into Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 with a loaded crossbow to kill the late Queen.\n\nCurrently, there is no requirement to have a licence for a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.", "source": {"uri": "belfasttelegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belfast

The attack, suspected to be targeted, involved a crossbow.\n\nKyle Clifford, from Enfield in north London, was wanted in connection with the deaths of three women in Bushey, a town north of London. The victims were Carol Hunt, 61, wife of BBC and Sky Sports racing commentator John Hunt, and their daughters, Louise, 25, and Hannah, 28.\n\nPolice found Clifford in Enfield. He was known to the victims, and no other suspects are being sought. Clifford is receiving medical treatment for injuries. Police previously reported that officers were called to a house in Bushey where the women were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson described the incident as horrific, involving a crossbow, and possibly other weapons. Reports suggest Clifford had a recent breakup with Louise Hunt, the youngest daughter. The breakup had a significant impact on Louise, who recently crashed her car outside their family home.\n\nCarol Hunt had confided in friends about her daughter's tumultuous breakup. A friend mentioned that Carol was worried about her daughter but didn't provide specifics. According to the UK's Daily Mail, the breakup was messy and deeply affected Louise.\n\nHertfordshire Police found Clifford after an extensive search in North London. The suspect is now receiving medical treatment for his injuries. UK's Interior Minister Yvette Cooper called the deaths \"truly shocking,\" expressing her condolences to the family and the community.\n\nBBC Radio Five Live described the incident as \"utterly devastating,\" with colleagues offering tearful condolences on air. Sky Sports Racing also expressed their sadness and support for John Hunt and his family.\n\nWhile the manhunt was underway, the public was urged not to approach Clifford. The police and emergency services were seen in Enfield, where Clifford was eventually found. The investigation is ongoing, and more details are expected to emerge.\n\nThe BBC confirmed that the victims were Carol Hunt and her daughters, Louise and Hannah. John Hunt, known for his commentary on major racing events, returned home from work to find the bodies.\n\nAuthorities are reviewing whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced following this tragic incident.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anshul_panda@ibtimes.sg", "name": "Anshul Panda", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crossbow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_superintendent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief superintendent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daily Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://data.ibtimes.sg/en/full/75598/kyle-clifford-hunt-family.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

He never seemed odd or aggressive,\" she said.\n\nPolice appealed for the public's help to find him, but warned: \"If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon.\"\n\nThe suspect's brother a convicted murderer\n\nClifford's older brother Bradley Clifford, 30, is serving a life sentence for murdering a teenager in 2017.\n\nBradley Clifford mowed down 19-year-old Jahshua Francis, who was riding a moped, and his pillion passenger Sobhan Khan, 18, after his \"prized\" red Mustang was damaged.\n\nHe drunkenly chased their scooter at nearly double the speed limit on the wrong side of the road after a bottle was thrown at his sports car.\n\nMr Khan was flung in the air and Bradley Clifford continued the attack as he lay on the street, punching him hard nine times, the Old Bailey heard.\n\nBradley Clifford was sentenced at the Old Bailey six years ago and was handed a life sentence with a minimum term of 23 years for murder and seven years for the attack on Mr Francis, to run concurrently.\n\nHow he was found\n\nClifford was found in a cemetery in the Hilly Fields area of Enfield around 6pm on Wednesday evening - 24 hours after the incident in Bushey.\n\nPolice said he was injured, but added that no shots were fired by officers.\n\nSky News pictures showed Clifford being stretchered out of Lavender Hill Cemetery, which had seen a significant police presence in the afternoon, including armed officers.\n\nClifford received medical treatment in the cemetery, which is close to his home.\n\nHe was then taken by ambulance to the Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel.\n\nWhat happened in Bushey?\n\nPolice were called to a detached house in Ashlyn Close, in northern Bushey, near Watford, just before 7pm on Tuesday.\n\nWhen they arrived alongside ambulance staff they found three women with \"serious injuries\".\n\nAccording to Hertfordshire Constabulary: \"Sadly, despite their best efforts, the women, who are believed to be related, died a short time later at the scene.\"\n\nVictims were targeted\n\nThe victims were Carol Hunt, 61, who was the wife of racing commentator John Hunt, and their two daughters Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25, it was revealed on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThey were still alive when emergency services arrived.\n\nMr Hunt works for both the BBC and Sky Sports Racing.\n\nSky Sports Racing said in a statement on Wednesday: \"Everyone at Sky Sports Racing is deeply saddened by the tragic deaths in Hertfordshire and our thoughts are with our colleague John Hunt, his family and friends at this awful time.\"\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson said at a news conference that police believe it was a \"targeted incident\".\n\nPolicing commentator Graham Wettone says this means it is very likely the victims and suspect were well known to each other.\n\nDerek Turner, a resident of the same street, said the arrival of around 10 police cars and ambulance crews was \"like an explosion in the street\".\n\nHe told Sky News officers were dressed in \"black uniforms with sort of semi-automatic guns walking around\", causing him to mistake the callout for a terrorist incident.\n\nThe road was cordoned off, with a blue tent erected outside the front door of the property.\n\nAt the news conference in Hatfield on Wednesday lunchtime, Chief Supt Simpson confirmed police believe a crossbow was used in the attack, but \"other weapons may also have been used\".\n\nThe Crossbow Act 1987 allows anyone over the age of 18 to buy one - with the only major restriction being it cannot be used on animals.\n\nEarlier this year, the Home Office launched a call for evidence to see if further legislation is needed after their use in several murders in the UK.\n\nSchool pupils kept inside\n\nDuring the news conference in Hatfield, Chief Supt Simpson said \"extensive police resources\" had been deployed in both Hertfordshire and north London.\n\nThey include armed officers and specialist search teams, he added.\n\nPupils at St Michael's Primary School in Enfield were also being kept inside as a precaution.\n\nThe school's headteacher told Sky News the police had conducted a reassurance visit and told them to \"continue as normal as possible\".", "source": {"uri": "garoweonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Garowe Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bailey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hanging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment_in_England_and_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment in England and Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_London_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal London Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moped", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Mustang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Mustang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scooter (motorcycle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speed limit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watford", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Watford"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Watford"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitechapel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whitechapel"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Whitechapel"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

He was found by officers this afternoon, July 10, in the Enfield area after an extensive search took place.\n\nHertfordshire Police said Clifford was found with injuries and has received medical treatment. Armed police were pictured at a cemetery as part of the search but no shots were fired, the police force said. A police spokesperson said it's believed Clifford was known to the victims.\n\nDetective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: \"This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened. This investigation is moving at pace and formal identification of the victims is yet to take place.\n\n\"The premature naming of potential victims has caused great upset to the family when they should've been given the space to come to terms with their sudden loss. Following extensive enquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time.\n\n\"We have had an overwhelming number of calls and would like to express our gratitude to the members of the public who have contacted us. We would still appeal for anyone with information or footage to please contact police directly and refrain from commenting on social media as this could affect the progress of the case.\n\n\"We have set up an information portal where people can submit any information, photos or video footage which they feel could assist us with our investigation. This incident will of course be of concern to local residents. Additional local officers will be in the area today so please do speak to them if you need to.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susie_beever@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Susie Beever", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kelly_ann_mills@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Kelly-Ann Mills", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jamie_brassington@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "Jamie Brassington", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedfordshire,_Cambridgeshire_and_Hertfordshire_Major_Crime_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham_Mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham Mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inspector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirates_(airline)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emirates (airline)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29518038.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS338998629.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 384, "textEnd": 390}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 1113, "textEnd": 1120}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

They are the wife and daughters of BBC Five Live horse racing commentator John Hunt. It is understood Mr Hunt been working for the BBC racing on Tuesday and may have raised the alarm when he returned home.\n\nToday Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said the attack last night in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Hertfordshire was a \"targeted incident \" and Clifford, 26, was \"wanted in connection with murder,\" reports The Mirror.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nTeacher sent sexual messages to undercover cop posing as 14-year-old girl\n\nA40 closed after air ambulance lands at scene of crash\n\nHe said: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident. We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area.\"\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nAddressing Clifford directly, he said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nThe three women were found in the early evening after police and ambulance vehicles - including two air ambulances - were called to to a home in Bushey, Hertfordshire before 7pm. The trio had suffered serious injuries but were alive when discovered, however all died a short time later.\n\nA neighbour said screams were heard from a house in the quiet cul-de-sac where the women died. The 46-year-old who works in the media and lives near the scene but asked not to be named, said \"absolute chaos\" then broke out as armed police put the road into lockdown.\n\nShe told the PA news agency: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos. We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house' ... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\"\n\nThe man at the centre of the major manhunt, Clifford is from the Enfield area and police have been searching for him throughout the night after the horrific discovery. Cops believe he could be anywhere in the Hertfordshire or North London area but have urged anyone who sees him to stay wary and to phone 999 immediately, with a spokesperson for the police force later specifying that Clifford \"may be in possession of a crossbow\". Anyone with information has been urged to come forward by police.\n\nArmed police have searched an address in Rendlesham Road, Enfield, as the manhunt continues. The house, close to Gordon Hill railway station, was swarmed by officers on Wednesday morning, according to neighbours. Two officers were stood outside the property at 1.30pm, after a cordon was removed.\n\nOne neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: \"They kept going in and out of the property carrying guns, the whole road was taped off. It was over quite quickly but there's been helicopters flying around the area all day. I don't recognise the suspect at all, as far as I'm concerned he didn't live in the house.\"\n\nAerial shots from a BBC live feed have shown a blue-and-white forensic tent in one of the front gardens of the cul-de-sac, with police and forensic teams swarming the area. The search is ongoing but no arrests have yet been made.\n\nCh Supt Jon Simpson said \"extensive police resources\" are being piled into the manhunt, and that members of the public had already been getting in touch with the police to report possible sightings.\n\nThe Home Office is aware of the incident and being kept \"fully updated\". in a post on X, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: \"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been killed and with the community. I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support (Hertfordshire Police) with any information about this case.\"\n\nNeighbours expressed their shock after police, an ambulance crew and ground ambulances rushed to the \u00a3800,000 four-bed house. One neighbour, who gave his name as Riaz, said: \"They are a middle class family. It is tragic and horrifying.\"\n\n\"There was a lot of activity from the police and ambulance last night - there were over a dozen cars. There was an air ambulance. The road was closed way past midnight. There is no access into the road.\" Riaz, who is in his late 50s and works in Telecoms, said: \"It is a decent neighbourhood. It is mostly retired people and professionals living here.\"\n\nAnother neighbour of the family, who did not want to be named, said she did not know them well, but they were friendly. \"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning. It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nTV racing commentator Matt Chapman tweeted: \"No words needed for what has happened to @HuntyCaller and family today. Impossible to comprehend the pain. Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal - racing loves you.\"\n\nA heartbreaking tribute to Louise on social media reads, according to MyLondon : \"No words can describe the loss I feel after today's horrific news. You were so loved and Scooby adored you...you built up an amazing business and were always so kind and gentle. May you RIP with your sister and mum xxx.\"\n\nLouise reportedly launched a dog grooming service during Covid lockdown named Groom and Glow, while her sister Hannah owned a beauty business, the website reported.\n\nLocal councillor Louise Nicolas posted on Facebook that she is \"deeply saddened\" by the \"tragic news\", offering her \"heartfelt condolences to all those affected\". She invited anyone who may be affected by the news to get in touch for support - adding that people should not take to Facebook to speculate on the ongoing investigation.\n\nLaurence Brass, a local county councillor, told BBC News: \"This is not something that happens in Bushey. We can't remember a murder in our rather quiet neck of the woods, so (it's a) terrible shock and our sympathies and prayers and thoughts are with the families of the three women.\n\n\"That really is a terrible thing to happen to anybody, and I've gathered they're all from the same family, which obviously makes it even more tragic, and we'll do everything we can as the local council to add our

statement, Hertfordshire Police said 26-year-old Kyle Clifford has been found in the Enfield area of north London, near his home, and that he is receiving medical treatment for his injuries.\n\nPolice did not say how those injuries happened but said they had not fired any shots.\n\nThe BBC confirmed that the women killed were the family of John Hunt - his 61-year-old wife Carol Hunt and their daughters Louise and Hannah, aged 25 and 28 respectively.\n\nWhile the manhunt was underway, the public were urged not to approach Clifford.\n\nEnfield is about 52km to the east from the site of the killing.\n\n\"Following extensive inquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time,\" Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins said.\n\n\"This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened,\" she added.\n\nJenkins said the investigation is moving \"at pace\" and that formal identification of the victims is yet to take place.\n\nShe also said that the \"premature\" naming of the victims \"caused great upset\".\n\nPolice had been scouring a park in north London, near the home of Clifford, after being alerted pn Tuesday about the killings in a house in Bushey, a residential area in northwestern London.\n\nPolice and ambulance crews tried to save them but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nJohn Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's main

The 46-year-old who lives near the scene, did not wish to share her name.\n\nShe told the PA news agency: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like, 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n\"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house'... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\"\n\nLIVE: Police hunt Enfield man who may be armed after 3 women killed\n\nThey said multiple ambulances, helicopters and \"at least 16 police cars\" arrived at the scene quickly, with armed police going from house to house to question locals, request doorbell camera footage and tell them to stay indoors.\n\n'Completely unaware of the trauma'\n\nShe added: \"It's really, really stressful now to think that that happened in such a close vicinity and none of us were aware and none of us could help. It's just absolutely traumatic, I think, for the family involved, for everyone.\"\n\n\"I think that's the stressful thing, that it happened at peak family time between 6pm and 7pm, when people were probably cooking for their kids and getting their kids ready for bed, and all of us in a tight little road, completely unaware of the trauma and tragic circumstances that other people were going through at that particular time.\"\n\nInvestigators believe Clifford could be in Hertfordshire or North London.\n\n'Deeply shocked and saddened'\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said she is being kept fully updated about the inquiry into the \"truly shocking\" deaths.\n\nOfficers and emergency medical crews including two air ambulances were sent to try to save the women, who were related, but they all died at the scene.\n\nLocal councillors for the North Bushey area said they were \"deeply shocked and saddened\" by the news of the deaths.\n\nA neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she did not know the victims well but they were a friendly family.\n\n\"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. \"It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nAnother neighbour, Riaz, who is in his 50s and declined to give his surname, said: \"This has been an awful situation and I can't even imagine what the family must be going through.\"\n\n'We can't remember a murder in our rather quiet neck of the woods'\n\nLocal councillor Laurence Brass, who also lives nearby, told the BBC the area is \"a typical leafy British suburb\".\n\nHe said: \"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed on the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run.\n\n\"This is not something that happens in Bushey.\n\n\"We can't remember a murder in our rather quiet neck of the woods, so (it's a) terrible shock and our sympathies and prayers and thoughts are with the families of the three women.\n\n\"That really is a terrible thing to happen to anybody, and I've gathered they're all from the same family, which obviously makes it even more tragic, and we'll do everything we can as the local council to add our source of comfort where we can.\"\n\nDetective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit called for anyone with information to come forward.\n\n\"Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or north London,\" he said.\n\n\"Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\n\"Our inquiries will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\"\n\nAn East of England Ambulance Service spokesperson said: \"We were called around 7pm on Tuesday July 9 to a property in Ashlyn Close in Bushey.\"\n\n\"Three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, an ambulance officer vehicle, the Hazardous Area Response Team, the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and London Air Ambulance were sent to the scene.\"\n\n\"Sadly, despite the team's best efforts, three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\"\n\nLocal councillors for the area Louise Nicolas, Alan Matthews and Paul Richards said: \"We are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic news that three women have lost their lives in a violent incident which took place in the heart of our local community.\"\n\n\"As North Bushey councillors, we extend our thoughts and condolences to their families and all those affected.\"\n\n\"We would encourage anyone who has information relevant to the inquiry to contact police.\"\n\nThe previous government had considered tightening the laws around crossbows after would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail was encouraged by an AI chatbot to break into Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 with a loaded crossbow to kill the late Queen.\n\nCurrently, there is no requirement to have a licence for a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.", "source": {"uri": "mylondon.news", "dataType":

Police have urged anyone who sees him to call 999 immediately.\n\nKyle Clifford was a trooper - the equivalent to a private - in the Queen's Dragoon Guards.\n\nHe is believed to have left the army to pursue a career in the Household Cavalry Regiment after passing out.\n\nClifford is from Enfield, North London and is 26 years old.\n\nThe suspected murderer's former boss said: \"Clifford joined the Army in 2019 and I was his Troop Commander from Basic Training.\n\n\"When he joined the Army he was immature for his age and had a bit of a chip on his shoulder.\n\n\"He struggled to grasp basic military concepts but managed to reach the standard to pass out from training.\n\n\"After passing out he joined the Household Cavalry Regiment but I'm unsure how his career developed from there.\n\n\"I hear he was working in private security so would indicate that he is no longer in the military.\"\n\nClifford allegedly murdered BBC Five Live racing commentator John Hunt's wife Carol, and daughters Hannah and Louise.\n\nThe three women - aged 25, 28, and 61 - were found dead at their home in Bushey, Hertfordshire on July 9, 2024.\n\nThey were found with serious injuries at around 7pm in what police have called a targeted attack.\n\nThe trio tragically died at the scene despite paramedics' best efforts.\n\nA neighbour told the Sun they heard screaming and that \"within 15 minutes it was absolute chaos\".\n\nThe neighbour added: \"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house'.... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\"\n\nClifford is currently on the run and is believed to be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.\n\nHertfordshire Police launched a manhunt on Wednesday July 10,2024.\n\nThey suspect him to be armed and urge the public to call 999 immediately if they see him.\n\nDetective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this please make contact with police via 999.\"\n\nHe added: \"This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\n\n\"Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.\n\n\"Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately.\n\n\"If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shirin_ghayad@thesun.ie", "name": "Shirin Ghayad", "type": "author", "isAgency":

His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nA colleague of Hunt's and BBC 5 Live's lead presenter Mark Chapman struggled to hold back the

he opened Wednesday's coverage on 5 Live of England's semifinal match against The Netherlands in soccer's European Championship.\n\n\"John Hunt is our colleague and our friend, not just to the current 5 Live sport team but to all of those who've worked here with him over the past 20 years, and also to all of you who have enjoyed his superb commentaries,\" Chapman said. \"So on behalf of everyone connected to 5 Live Sport, our love and thoughts and support are with John and his family.\"\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that Hunt found the bodies early Tuesday evening, after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nPolice did not say how or whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media had reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson suggested the attack was not random and that the suspect knew the family.\n\nLocal council member Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, described the area as \"a typical leafy British suburb\" as he recounted his experience from the previous night.\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, was kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.", "source": {"uri":

The broadcaster said it would give Hunt \"all the support we can\" as part of a note sent to BBC Radio 5 Live staff.\n\n\"The news today about John Hunt's family is utterly devastating,\" it said. \"Our thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.\"\n\nBritish Home Secretary Yvette Cooper expressed her condolences following the killings.\n\n\"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking.

I urge people to support Hertfordshire Police with any information about this case.\"\n\nA neighbor of the women said she \"would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" according to PA Media.\n\n\"It's really sad what's happened, very shocking,\" she added.\n\nIn Britain, it is legal for a person to buy or own a crossbow if they are over 18, though anyone who carries one in public without a reasonable excuse can face imprisonment. In February, the previous government launched an eight-week review of the rules and the possibility of introducing a licensing scheme. -- CNN", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType":

Police said the three women -- aged 25, 28 and 61 -- were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening.\n\nPolice and ambulance crews tried to save them, but

is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel.\n\nHis voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nPolice did not say whether Clifford was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters.\n\nThe BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022.\n\nLocal council member Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area where the killings took place is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a

said, \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a licence to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said

If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\n\"Our inquiries will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\"\n\nAn East of England Ambulance Service spokesperson said: \"We were called around 7pm on Tuesday July 9 to a property in Ashlyn Close in Bushey.\n\n\"Three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, an ambulance officer vehicle, the Hazardous Area Response Team, the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and London Air Ambulance were sent to the scene.\n\n\"Sadly, despite the team's best efforts, three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\"\n\nLocal councillors for the area Louise Nicolas, Alan Matthews and Paul Richards said: \"We are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic news that three women have lost their lives in a violent incident which took place in the heart of our local community.\n\n\"As North Bushey councillors, we extend our thoughts and condolences to their families and all those affected.\n\n\"We would encourage anyone who has information relevant to the inquiry to contact police.\"\n\nThe previous government had considered tightening the laws around crossbows after would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail was encouraged by an AI chatbot to break into Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 with a loaded crossbow to kill the late Queen.\n\nCurrently, there is no requirement to have a licence for a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"},

Police did not say how those injuries happened but stressed that they had not fired any shots.\n\nThe BBC confirmed that the women killed were the family of John Hunt -- his 61-year-old wife Carol Hunt and their daughters Louise and Hannah, aged 25 and 28 respectively.\n\nWhile the manhunt was underway in Enfield, around 52 kilometers (17 miles) to the east from the site of the killings, the public were urged not to approach Clifford. The BBC had reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022.\n\n\"Following extensive inquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time,\" said Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit.\n\n\"This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened,\" she added.\n\nJenkins said the investigation is moving \"at pace\" and that formal identification of the victims is yet to take place. She also said that the \"premature\" naming of the victims \"caused great upset.\"\n\nPolice had been scouring a park in north London, near the home of Clifford, after being alerted Tuesday about the killings in a house in Bushey, a residential area in northwestern London. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nJohn Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nA colleague of Hunt's and BBC 5 Live's lead presenter Mark Chapman struggled to hold back the tears as he expressed everyone's shock and pain.\n\n\"We have a football match to bring you tonight ... and we will start our buildup to it shortly but this has been a heartbreaking day,\" he said as he opened Wednesday's coverage on 5 Live of England's semifinal match against The Netherlands in soccer's European Championship.\n\n\"John Hunt is our colleague and our friend, not just to the current 5 Live sport team but to all of those who've worked here with him over the past 20 years, and also to all of you who have enjoyed his superb commentaries,\" Chapman said. \"So on behalf of everyone connected to 5 Live Sport, our love and thoughts and support are with John and his family.\"\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that Hunt found the bodies early Tuesday evening, after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nPolice did not say how or whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media had reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson suggested the attack was not random and that the suspect knew the family.\n\nLocal council member Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, described the area as \"a typical leafy British suburb\" as he recounted his experience from the previous night.\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, was kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.", "source": {"uri":

If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away.

appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\"\n\nAn East of England Ambulance Service spokesperson said: \"We were called around 7pm on Tuesday July 9 to a property in Ashlyn Close in Bushey.\n\n\"Three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, an ambulance officer vehicle, the Hazardous Area Response Team, the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and London Air Ambulance were sent to the scene.\n\n\"Sadly, despite the team's best efforts, three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\"\n\nLocal councillors for the area Louise Nicolas, Alan Matthews and Paul Richards said: \"We are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic news that three women have lost their lives in a violent incident which took place in the heart of our local community.\n\n\"As North Bushey councillors, we extend our thoughts and condolences to their families and all those affected.\n\n\"We would encourage anyone who has information relevant to the inquiry to contact police.\"\n\nThe previous government had considered tightening the laws in the UK around crossbows after would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail was encouraged by an AI chatbot to break into Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 with a loaded crossbow to kill Britain's late Queen Elizabeth.\n\nCurrently, there is no requirement to have a licence for a crossbow in the UK, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.", "source": {"uri":

Police did not say how those injuries happened but stressed that they had not fired any shots.\n\nThe BBC confirmed that the women killed were members of the family of its commentator John Hunt -- his 61-year-old wife Carol Hunt and their daughters Hannah, 28, and Louise, 25.\n\nFootage from Sky News showed the suspect being carried on a stretcher out of Lavender Hill Cemetery in Enfield, which is close to his home and around 52 kilometers (17 miles) to the east from the site of the killings. Armed police officers, forensic personnel and ambulance staff had massed around the cemetery through the day.\n\nThe public had been urged not to approach Clifford, who the BBC reported had been in the British Army for a brief period of service in 2022.\n\n\"Following extensive inquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time,\" said Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit.\n\n\"This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened,\" she added.\n\nJenkins said the investigation is moving \"at pace\" and that formal identification of the victims is yet to take place. She also said that the \"premature\" naming of the victims \"caused great upset.\"\n\nPolice had been scouring a park in north London, near the home of Clifford, after being alerted Tuesday about the killings in a house in Bushey, a residential area in northwestern London. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nJohn Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nA colleague of Hunt's and BBC 5 Live's lead presenter Mark Chapman struggled to hold back the tears as he expressed everyone's shock and pain.\n\n\"We have a football match to bring you tonight ... and we will start our buildup to it shortly but this has been a heartbreaking day,\" he said as he opened Wednesday's coverage on 5 Live of England's semifinal match against The Netherlands in soccer's European Championship.\n\n\"John Hunt is our colleague and our friend, not just to the current 5 Live sport team but to all of those who've worked here with him over the past 20 years, and also to all of you who have enjoyed his superb commentaries,\" Chapman said. \"So on behalf of everyone connected to 5 Live Sport, our love and thoughts and support are with John and his family.\"\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that Hunt found the bodies early Tuesday evening, after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nPolice did not say how or whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media had reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson suggested the attack was not random and that the suspect knew the family.\n\nLocal council member Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, described the area as \"a typical leafy British suburb\" as he recounted his experience from the previous night.\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, was kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

Mother Carol, 61, and daughters Louise, 25, and Hannah, 28, were found fatally injured at their $100,000 detached home in Bushey, Hertfordshire, on Tuesday night.\n\nAccording to police sources, the three women were first tied up and then shot in what appears to have been a \"targeted attack\" that might have also involved several \"other weapons.\" Hertfordshire Police are now searching for their suspected killer, 26-year-old Kyle Clifford, who allegedly fled the house on Ashyn Close, Bushey, before 7 pm on Tuesday evening.\n\nTargeted Attack, Victims Identified\n\nA massive manhunt is in underway to track Clifford, the ex-boyfriend of John's daughter Louise. Helicopters were spotted circling the Hilly Fields area of Enfield, north London, on Wednesday afternoon before police raided an empty property in the vicinity.\n\nAuthorities then focused on a nearby primary school, which was placed on lockdown after the suspect's car was found.\n\nPolice have warned that Clifford may still be armed and dangerous. They have advised the public not to approach him and to call 999 immediately if he is spotted.\n\nAt a press conference today, Hertfordshire Police urged Clifford to \"make contact with the police\" as the suspect in the killings remains at large.\n\nClifford, from Enfield, north London, worked as a security guard, it has been reported. On Wednesday morning, the usually tranquil cul-de-sac was teeming with armed police and forensic officers as the triple murder investigation continued.\n\nLouise's father, John, was working at Lingfield Park racecourse yesterday before returning home to the horrific scene.\n\nShocked neighbors said that Louise ran a dog grooming business called Groom and Glow from the detached house in the cul-de-sac.\n\nLocal resident William Nourallah paid tribute to the \"beautiful young girl.\" \"She was a gorgeous girl. She really was a young, hardworking girl. I met the mum once or twice because she opened the door for me. I met the father,\" Nourallah said.\n\n\"She was happy every time I saw her. We would have a laugh and a joke. She was a beautiful young girl. It's a waste of a life,\" Nourallah added.\n\nCommunity Shocked\n\nA neighbor, who lives on the \"serene and quiet road\" and wished to remain anonymous, described the victims as a \"friendly family.\" \"We would see them every day passing by and they would say 'good morning',\" she said. \"It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nIn a statement released this morning, Detective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said, \"This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family, and we ask that their privacy be respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\"\n\n\"Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.\n\n\"Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away.\n\n\"He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\n\"Our enquires will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\"", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.sg", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, Singapore Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "r_ghosh@ibtimes.sg", "name": "R.

Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nBBC Radio 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel, said the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two of their daughters.\n\nJohn Hunt is BBC radio's main horse racing commentator, his voice known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nPolice did not say whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022.\n\nLocal councillor Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, Simpson said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.\n\nMORE TOP STORIES: BMW

Impossible to comprehend the pain. Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal - racing loves you.\"\n\nPolice have made a direct appeal to the chief suspect in the \"horrific\" murders of the three women to give himself up. Kyle Clifford is being hunted following the discovery of the fatally-injured women aged 25, 28 and 61 - and police have warned he is believed to armed with a crossbow and other weapons.\n\nThe victims have now been reportedly identified as Carol Hunt, 61, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25 - although official confirmation is still being awaited. John is understood to have been working for BBC Racing on Tuesday and may have raised the alarm when he returned home.\n\nFollowing the tragic news, tributes have flooded in for the family, including for John's daughter, Louise. According to MyLondon, one post on social media read: \"No words can describe the loss I feel after today's horrific news. You were so loved and Scooby adored you...you built up an amazing business and were always so kind and gentle. May you RIP with your sister and mum xxx.\"\n\nLouise reportedly launched a dog grooming service during Covid lockdown named Groom and Glow, while her sister Hannah owned a beauty business, the website reported.\n\nToday Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said the attack last night in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Hertfordshire was a \"targeted incident \" and Clifford, 26, was \"wanted in connection with murder\".\n\nHe said: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident.

The trio had suffered serious injuries, but were alive when discovered.

crossbow\n\nScreams were heard from a house in a quiet British cul-de-sac where three women, died before \u201cabsolute chaos\u201d broke out as armed police looking for their killer put the road in lockdown, a neighbour has said.\n\nA resident living in Ashlyn Close in Bushey, Hertfordshire said the tragedy that unfolded at around 7pm on Tuesday was \u201cabsolutely traumatic\u201d.\n\nPolice have launched a manhunt for Kyle Clifford, 26, from Enfield, north London in connection with the deaths, and have warned that he may be armed with a crossbow.\n\nThe 46-year-old, who lives near the scene, did not wish to share her name but said she works in the media.\n\nShe told the PA news agency: \u201cIt was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night, and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill, and I was like, \u2018that\u2019s definitely a woman screaming\u2019, and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n\u201cWe had armed police running down, screaming \u2018stay in your house\u2019 \u2026 they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\u201d\n\nThey said multiple ambulances, helicopters and \u201cat least 16 police cars\u201d arrived at the scene quickly, with armed police going from house to house to question locals, request doorbell camera footage and tell them to stay indoors.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s really, really stressful now to think that that happened in such a close vicinity and none of us were aware and none of us could help.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just absolutely traumatic, I think, for the family involved, for everyone.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s the stressful thing, that it happened at peak family time between 6pm and 7pm, when people were probably cooking for their kids and getting their kids ready for bed, and all of us in a tight little road, completely unaware of the trauma and tragic circumstances that other people were going through at that particular time.\u201d\n\nInvestigators believe Clifford could be in Hertfordshire or north London.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said she is being kept fully updated about the inquiry into the \u201ctruly shocking\u201d deaths.\n\nOfficers and emergency medical crews including two air ambulances were sent to try to save the women, who were related, but they all died at the scene.\n\nLocal councillors for the North Bushey area said they were \u201cdeeply shocked and saddened\u201d by the news of the deaths.\n\nA neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she did not know the victims well, but they were a friendly family.\n\n\u201cWe would see them every day passing by, and they would say good morning,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really sad what\u2019s happened, very shocking.\u201d\n\nAnother neighbour, Riaz, who is in his 50s and declined to give his surname, said: \u201cThis has been an awful situation and I can\u2019t even imagine what the family must be going through.\u201d\n\nLocal councillor Laurence Brass, who also lives nearby, told the BBC the area is \u201ca typical leafy British suburb\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cAt about eight o\u2019clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed on the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey, and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run.\n\n\u201cThis is not something that happens in Bushey.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t remember a murder in our rather quiet neck of the woods, so [it\u2019s a] terrible shock, and our sympathies and prayers and thoughts are with the families of the three women.\n\n\u201cThat really is a terrible thing to happen to anybody, and I\u2019ve gathered they\u2019re all from the same family, which obviously makes it even more tragic, and we\u2019ll do everything we can as the local council to add our source of comfort where we can.\u201d\n\nDetective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit called for anyone with information to come forward.\n\n\u201cWhilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford, who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or north London,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGiven the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cOur inquiries will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened, but I would also like to take this opportunity to appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\u201d\n\nAn East of England Ambulance Service spokesperson said: \u201cWe were called around 7pm on Tuesday, July 9 to a property in Ashlyn Close in Bushey.\n\n\u201cThree ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, an ambulance officer vehicle, the Hazardous Area Response Team, the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and London Air Ambulance were sent to the scene.\n\n\u201cSadly, despite the team\u2019s best efforts, three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\u201d\n\nLocal councillors for the area Louise Nicolas, Alan Matthews and Paul Richards said: \u201cWe are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic news that three women have lost their lives in a violent incident which took place in the heart of our local community.\n\n\u201cAs North Bushey councillors, we extend our thoughts and condolences to their families and all those affected.\n\n\u201cWe would encourage anyone who has information relevant to the inquiry to contact police.\u201d\n\nThe previous government had considered tightening the laws around crossbows after would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail was encouraged by an AI chatbot to break into Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 with a loaded crossbow to kill the late Queen.\n\nCurrently, there is no requirement to have a licence for a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nAdditional reporting

Police did not say how those injuries happened but stressed that they had not fired any shots.\n\nThe BBC confirmed that the women killed were members of the family of its commentator John Hunt -- his 61-year-old wife Carol Hunt and their daughters Hannah, 28, and Louise, 25.\n\nFootage from Sky News showed the suspect being carried on a stretcher out of Lavender Hill Cemetery in Enfield, which is close to his home and around 52 kilometers (17 miles) to the east from the site of the killings. Armed police officers, forensic personnel and ambulance staff had massed around the cemetery through the day.\n\nThe public had been urged not to approach Clifford, who the BBC reported had been in the British Army for a brief period of service in 2022.\n\n\"Following extensive inquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time,\" said Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit.\n\n\"This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened,\" she added.\n\nMs. Jenkins said the investigation is moving \"at pace\" and that formal identification of the victims is yet to take place. She also said that the \"premature\" naming of the victims \"caused great upset.\"\n\nPolice had been scouring a park in north London, near the home of Clifford, after being alerted Tuesday about the killings in a house in Bushey, a residential area in northwestern London. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nJohn Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nA colleague of Mr. Hunt's and BBC 5 Live's lead presenter Mark Chapman struggled to hold back the tears as he expressed everyone's shock and pain.\n\n\"We have a football match to bring you tonight ... and we will start our buildup to it shortly but this has been a heartbreaking day,\" he said as he opened Wednesday's coverage on 5 Live of England's semifinal match against The Netherlands in soccer's European Championship.\n\n\"John Hunt is our colleague and our friend, not just to the current 5 Live sport team but to all of those who've worked here with him over the past 20 years, and also to all of you who have enjoyed his superb commentaries,\" Mr. Chapman said. \"So on behalf of everyone connected to 5 Live Sport, our love and thoughts and support are with John and his family.\"\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that Mr. Hunt found the bodies early Tuesday evening, after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nPolice did not say how or whether Mr. Clifford was connected to the women, but British media had reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson suggested the attack was not random and that the suspect knew the family.\n\nLocal council member Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, described the area as \"a typical leafy British suburb\" as he recounted his experience from the previous night.\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, was kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London",

There were dogs barking and everyone realised there was something big going on.'\n\nThe mother added: 'We've now been told that my daughter's school around the corner has gone into an amber lockdown. A few other schools have shut their doors as well. So we're just a little bit worried.

It was in a nightclub in Hemel Hempstead. We went out together, went to birthdays and events.\n\nMs Holloway continued: \"They were a lovely family and (the daughters) were lovely girls.\n\n\"They were making their way through life and their lives have been taken too soon.

Please bear with us at this terrible time.\"\n\nProviding an update on the investigation, Detective Superintendent Rob Hall, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: \"This was an unprecedented attack and we are determined to understand the full circumstances of what happened that evening and the events leading up to it.\n\n\"This investigation, as I'm sure people can imagine, will take time.\n\nOn Thursday, further searches took place at a house linked to Clifford's brother, Bradley Clifford, who was jailed for life with a minimum term of 23 years for the murder of moped passenger Soban Khan in 2018.\n\nAccording to the Metropolitan Police, at the time of the murder Bradley Clifford had targeted the moped before crashing into it, and continued to assault Mr Khan after the collision.\n\nOfficers were seen at the address in Rendlesham Road, Enfield, north London, in relation to the deaths.\n\nPolice staff wearing gloves and face masks were seen outside the property, which was first searched on Wednesday.\n\nFlowers were left at the scene in Ashlyn Close on Thursday, with notes attached to some bouquets with messages such as \"rest in peace\".\n\nPolice said no shots had been fired by officers and no arrest had yet been made.\n\nArmed police had earlier been in the area, with an air ambulance nearby.\n\nFootage from Sky News appeared to show Clifford being stretchered out of the cemetery by paramedics and a further clip seemed to show the suspect been wheeled into the Royal London hospital.\n\nIn a press conference before Clifford was found, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson, from Hertfordshire Police, told reporters the killings were believed to have been \"targeted\".\n\nDuring the hunt for Clifford, who is understood to have left the Army in 2022 after a short stint, the force said they believed he may have been armed with a crossbow and warned people not to approach him.\n\nHe was believed to have been known to the victims.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper is urgently considering whether tougher crossbow laws are needed in the wake of the killings.\n\nShe will look at the findings of a Home Office review

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nBBC Five Live racing commentator John Hunt tragically discovered his wife and two daughters had been brutally attacked upon returning home.\n\nThe family members were victims of a suspected crossbow attacker. It is believed that Hunt came back from his work duties to find his wife and daughters with serious injuries and all three were later declared deceased at the scene.\n\nHunt, who has been married with three children, was reportedly working for the BBC on Tuesday and is thought to have sounded the alarm when he arrived home around 7pm, as The Telegraph reports. Carol Hunt, the broadcaster's 61 year old wife, has been identified by locals, while Hertfordshire Police confirmed in a Wednesday afternoon press briefing that the other casualties were her daughters.\n\nWith a background in law enforcement, Hunt has been a familiar voice on BBC Radio Five Live as a racing commentator for two decades. ITV racing analyst Matt Chapman expressed his deep sorrow on X, previously known as Twitter, on Wednesday.\n\nHis message read: \"No words needed for what has happened to @HuntyCaller and family today. Impossible to comprehend the pain. Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal - racing loves you.\", reports the Mirror.\n\nAuthorities are currently searching for Kyle Clifford, 26, from Enfield, who is sought in relation to the tragic events that unfolded at a residence in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Hertfordshire.\n\nDetective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit has issued a plea for public assistance, stating: \"This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\"\n\nHe continued to highlight the urgency of locating a person of interest: \"Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.\"\n\nEmphasising the potential danger, he added: \"Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon.\"\n\nDS Hall also called for witnesses: \"Our enquires will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\"\n\nAddressing community concerns, he reassured: \"This incident will of course be of concern to local residents. Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be in the area today so please do speak to them if you need to.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper expressed her condolences via social media: \"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been killed and with the community.\"\n\n\"I am being kept fully updated.

The victims were Carol Hunt, the 61-year-old wife of BBC radio and Sky Sports racing commentator John Hunt, and their two daughters, Louise, 25, and Hannah, 28.\n\nPolice said Clifford, found by officers in Enfield, \"was known to the victims\" and no additional suspects were being sought.

According to British media reports, Clifford had been romantically involved with Louise Hunt, the youngest daughter of the Hunts, but they split up a week ago. The breakup deeply affected Louise, who recently crashed her car into a telegraph pole outside their family home, UK's Daily Mail reported.\n\nCarol Hunt, a mother of three, had confided in friends at her local gym about her daughter's tumultuous breakup with her boyfriend. \"She mentioned her daughter's split with her boyfriend was messy.

The BBC has confirmed that the women were the family of its well-known radio racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nHertfordshire Police said Kyle Clifford, 26, was wanted in the suspected triple murder, which involved a crossbow and potentially other unnamed weapons. The public were urged not to approach Clifford, who is from the Enfield area in north London, around 52 kilometers (17 miles) to the east from the site of the killing.\n\nArmed police officers, forensic personnel and ambulance staff were seen at Hilly Fields Park in Enfield, which is popular with joggers and dog-walkers, and the adjacent Lavender Hill cemetery. The area has been closed off and an ambulance helicopter was also at the scene. Police have not confirmed whether the intense activity is connected to the manhunt as it is an ongoing investigation.\n\nPolice said the three women -- aged 25, 28 and 61 -- were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe BBC confirmed the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two daughters, Louise Hunt and her older sister Hannah Hunt.\n\nJohn Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nPolice did not say whether Clifford was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022.\n\nLocal council member Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area where the killings took place is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be

The trio were fatally wounded in their home in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Hertfordshire, in what is believed to be a 'targeted attack' with a crossbow.\n\nPolice and emergency services were called to the property at around 7pm on Tuesday however despite their best efforts to save the women, all three tragically died at the scene. They have since been named as the wife and two daughters of BBC racing commentator John Hunt, who is said to be inconsolable over the harrowing tragedy.\n\nHorrific details from the attack emerged yesterday, with one of the three victims believed to have called 999 in a brave act before the perpetrator fled the scene, The Guardian reports. The paper also claims that one of the women sent a text to their partner urging them to call the police.\n\nThe mum, who shares a third daughter with John who lives in Birmingham, was reportedly found in the hallway of their home with a crossbow bolt in her chest. Previous reports suggested the alleged killer tied up his victims but a source told the Guardian that the women were not gagged and bound when found.\n\nHowever there was reportedly evidence of ligature marks around their wrists and face, suggesting these had been removed. The source also said all three had injuries to their knees.\n\nDistraught neighbours have described what they heard that evening, with one resident hearing a piercing cry for help, which they initially mistook for a distressed child. The 46-year-old, who wished not to be named, said: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like, 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n\"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house'... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\" They said multiple ambulances, helicopters and \"at least 16 police cars\" arrived at the scene quickly, with armed police going from house to house to question locals, request doorbell camera footage and tell them to stay indoors.\n\nThey added: \"It's really, really stressful now to think that that happened in such a close vicinity and none of us were aware and none of us could help. It's just absolutely traumatic, I think, for the family involved, for everyone. I think that's the stressful thing, that it happened at peak family time between 6pm and 7pm, when people were probably cooking for their kids and getting their kids ready for bed, and all of us in a tight little road, completely unaware of the trauma and tragic circumstances that other people were going through at that particular time.\"\n\nThe following morning, police announced that three women had died at a property in Bushey, with the suspected killer still at large. Hertfordshire Police then held a press conference at lunchtime with more details, confirming the ages of the victims.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson confirmed they had been \"targeted\" and attacked with a crossbow and other weapons. Directly appealing to the suspect, Chief Sup Simpson said: \"Kyle if you are seeing or hearing this please make contact.\"\n\nThey appealed to the public for information and to ring 999 if anyone saw him, however warned not to approach him. They believed the suspect to be in Hertfordshire or closer to his home in Enfield.\n\nChief Supt Simpson also told reporters: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident.\n\n\"We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area. The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for the suspect to be picked up on a nearby door cam, where he was spotted wearing a black tracksuit and carrying what appeared to be a crossbow covered in a white sheet under his arm. The bearded figure also carried a black sports bag, which police feared may have contained a cache of weapons.\n\nChillingly, Clifford, who is understood to have served in the British Army for about a year, strode past a female neighbour who was stroking a cat on her drive at around 6.50pm. He was then seen getting into his car and placing the suspected weapons in the backseat.\n\nSchools in north London were put under lockdown as they continued to search for Clifford. Headteacher Jade-Simone Bacon, of St Michael's C.E. Primary School in Enfield, said: \"We've locked both buildings and just kept the children inside. So we've not had them on the field or the playground. It's not a lockdown as in under the desks or hidden or anything, it's just a lighter lockdown.\n\n\"We have just kept them within the building as though it were like a wet playday so we don't cause the children any distress and we keep everything as calm as possible.\" Speaking to Sky News, she said that police visited to reassure staff and students and that teachers were told to \"continue as normal as possible\".\n\nAfter finding Clifford's abandoned car in north London, dozens of armed officers from Scotland Yard and Hertfordshire Police flooded the area. One mother, who wished not to be named, told MailOnline: \"They had cordoned off the road and were ushering people away from the house they were going into. They had the full protective gear on, guns, shields and helmets - the kind you'd expect to see in riots.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a local mum-of-two told the Mirror: \"Armed police have been here since around 2.30pm today - it's terrifying.\" Their efforts then moved to a nearby cemetery near to Rendlesham Road - a five-minute walk from Clifford's address - and on Wednesday evening, the manhunt finally came to a close after he was found hiding among headstones. A swarm of armed police closed in at the site, with paramedics then seen rushing into the grounds with an air ambulance circling overhead.\n\nThe BBC reported that the air \"is thick with the sound of helicopters\" operated by police and press. Local Rae Cresswell, 26, who filmed the commotion, said: \"I saw about ten officers coming in. I was quite worried because they were armed and there were dogs with them. I asked them if they wanted me to leave but they said it was fine to stay. They started checking the area so I left shortly after and came back to see all these vehicles.\"\n\nAfter around 20 minutes, Clifford was seen stretchered away from the scene and taken by ambulance to Royal London Hospital, where he is receiving medical treatment after being discovered with injuries. Clifford had reportedly been hiding from police in a nearby church, according to one local, Adam, who claimed: \"He was hiding there all day and then came here. He was well known here, and was actually expelled from school for carrying a knife.\"\n\nDetective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: \"Following extensive enquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time.\"\n\nA London Ambulance Spokesperson said: \"Ambulance crews and London's air ambulance attended an incident in Lavender Hill Cemetery, Enfield, this afternoon (Tuesday 10). We treated a man at the scene and took him to a major trauma centre.\"\n\nClifford is believed to have been the ex-boyfriend of the youngest victim Louise. It has been reported that they split up just a week earlier, with their parting said to have left her so shaken that she recently crashed her car into a telegraph pole outside the family home.\n\nLouise, who had her own dog grooming business, reposted a tweet praising 'women who leave' for their 'strength' just days before she was fatally attacked alongside her loved ones in the family home. The post read: \"I admire women who leave, idgaf if you left after the 1st time or the 12th time I admire s***!\n\n\"Idgaf if ppl calling you dumb for 11 years but in the 12th year you decided you was done. It takes A LOT of strength to break a tie. It takes ALOT of self love to choose yo self.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "saffron_otter@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Saffron Otter",

The police advised people not to approach Clifford as \"he may still be in possession of a weapon.\"\n\nThe attack was carried out with a crossbow, Hertfordshire Police Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said later, adding that other weapons may also have been used.\n\nPolice did not say whether Clifford had been known to the women, who were 25, 28 and 61 years old, but they said it was believed to have been a targeted incident.\n\nSpeaking on live television, Simpson appealed directly to Clifford on Wednesday, saying: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact,\" and urging him to call the U.K. emergency services number 999.\n\nBritain's Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, the top government official in charge of law enforcement, said in a post on social media that she was being kept \"fully updated\" on the case, and she urged anyone with information to contact the police.\n\n\"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking.

The BBC said the women killed were the family of its main radio racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nHertfordshire Police said Kyle Clifford, 26, was being sought over the suspected triple murder, which potentially involved a crossbow and other weapons.\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been an horrific incident,\" Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said.\n\nPolice said the three women -- ages 25, 28 and 61 -- were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nBBC Radio 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel, said the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two of their daughters.\n\nJohn Hunt is BBC radio's main horse racing commentator, his voice known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby. British media say that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse, which is just south of London.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nPolice did not say whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters.\n\nLocal councillor Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, Simpson said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.", "source":

In a statement, Hertfordshire Police said 26-year-old Kyle Clifford has been found in the Enfield area of north London. The BBC has confirmed that the women killed were the family of its well-known radio racing commentator John Hunt. While the manhunt was underway, the public were urged not to approach Clifford, who is from the Enfield area in north London, around 52 kilometers (17 miles) to the east from the site of the killing. Armed police officers, forensic personnel and ambulance staff were seen at Hilly Fields Park in Enfield, which is popular with joggers and dog-walkers, and the adjacent Lavender Hill cemetery. The area has been closed off and an ambulance helicopter was also at the scene. Police have not confirmed whether the intense activity is connected to the manhunt as it is an ongoing investigation. Police said the three women - aged 25, 28 and 61 - were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene. The BBC confirmed the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two daughters, Louise Hunt and her older sister Hannah Hunt. John Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby. The Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London. As part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\u009d Police did not say whether Clifford was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022. Local council member Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area where the killings took place is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\u009d \"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC. Addressing the suspect directly, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\u009d Britain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\"\u009d about the \"truly shocking\"\u009d incident. People in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse. A spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\"\u009d the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.", "source":

I came early evening and I saw the cars and realised something tragic had happened.'\n\n'It's a serene, quiet road, but there was over a dozen cars here. It's quite disturbing, but any tragedy like this has a bearing on how you feel.\n\n'I don't think it's anything that we really should be overtly concerned about. Relationships go up and down, sometimes they end up like this.\n\n'This has been an awful situation and I can't even imagine what the family must be going through.\n\nAn aerial view of the scene of the suspected triple murder in Bushey, Hertfordshire\n\nTwo officers stand outside a police cordon at the scene of a triple murder in Ashlyn Close\n\nA lone police officers patrols the road at the scene of a triple murder in Ashlyn Close\n\n'My wife and I walk down that road often and it is quiet. It is surprising, especially in the magnitude. To have three individuals who have been tragically killed, it is tragic.'\n\nAnother resident living in the proximity of the attacks described the terrifying police response that descended on the quiet cul-de-sac.\n\nThey said: 'There were 11 police cars, an armed response unit, 4 ambulances and a fire engine.\n\n'We're not allowed to park on our driveway and have had to park round the corner. Whatever happened, it's really bad and everyone is shaken up.'\n\nTelecoms specialist Diaz Hussein, who is in his 50s, told The Telegraph he didn't recognise Clifford and had 'not noticed him around here before'.\n\nHe added: 'It's absolutely terrifying. Everyone around here is deeply shocked.\n\n'This is a lovely friendly street where everyone gets on. Lots of professionals live here and we all get on very well. I'm stunned at what's happened.'\n\nDetective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: 'This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\n\n'Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.\n\n'Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away.\n\n'He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\nSeveral police cars can also been seen parked on the road.

Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be in the area today so please do speak to them if you need to.'\n\nLocal councillors for the area Louise Nicolas, Alan Matthews and Paul Richards said: 'We are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic news that three women have lost their lives in a violent incident which took place in the heart of our local community.\n\n'As North Bushey councillors, we extend our thoughts and condolences to their families and all those affected.\n\n'We would encourage anyone who has information relevant to the inquiry to contact police.'\n\nAn East of England Ambulance Service spokesperson said: 'We were called around 7pm on Tuesday July 9 to a property in Ashlyn Close in Bushey.\n\n'Three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, an ambulance officer vehicle, the Hazardous Area Response Team, the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and London Air Ambulance were sent to the scene.\n\n'Sadly, despite the team's best efforts, three women were pronounced dead at the scene.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

My thoughts are with the family & friends of those who have been killed & with the community. I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support (Hertfordshire Police) with any information about this case.\"\n\nNeighbours expressed their shock after police, an ambulance crew and ground ambulances rushed to the \u00a3800,000 four-bed house. One neighbour, who gave his name as Riaz, said: \"They are a middle class family. It is tragic and horrifying.\n\n\"There was a lot of activity from the police and ambulance last night - there were over a dozen cars. There was an air ambulance. The road was closed way past midnight. There is no access into the road.\" Riaz, who is in his late 50s and works in Telecoms, said: \"It is a decent neighbourhood. It is mostly retired people and professionals living here.\"\n\nAnother neighbour of the family, who did not want to be named, said she did not know them well, but they were friendly. \"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nLocal councillor Louise Nicolas posted on Facebook that she is \"deeply saddened\" by the \"tragic news\", offering her \"heartfelt condolences to all those affected\". She invited anyone who may be affected by the news to get in touch for support - adding that people should not take to Facebook to speculate on the ongoing investigation.\n\nLaurence Brass, a local county councillor, told BBC News: \"This is not something that happens in Bushey.

The BBC has confirmed that the women killed were the family of its well-known radio racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nWhile the manhunt was underway, the public were urged not to approach Clifford, who is from the Enfield area in north London, around 52 kilometers (17 miles) to the east from the site of the killing.\n\nArmed police officers, forensic personnel and ambulance staff were seen at Hilly Fields Park in Enfield, which is popular with joggers and dog-walkers, and the adjacent Lavender Hill cemetery. The area has been closed off and an ambulance helicopter was also at the scene. Police have not confirmed whether the intense activity is connected to the manhunt as it is an ongoing investigation.\n\nPolice said the three women -- aged 25, 28 and 61 -- were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe BBC confirmed the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two daughters, Louise Hunt and her older sister Hannah Hunt.\n\nJohn Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nThe Daily Mail newspaper and others reported that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse south of London.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it will provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nPolice did not say whether Clifford was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters. The BBC reported that Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022.\n\nLocal council member Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area where the killings took place is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The BBC said the women killed were the family of its main radio racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nHertfordshire Police said Kyle Clifford, 26, was being sought over the suspected triple murder, which potentially involved a crossbow and other weapons.\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been an horrific incident,\" Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said.\n\nPolice said the three women -- ages 25, 28 and 61 -- were found seriously injured in a house in Bushey, northwest of London, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save them, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nBBC Radio 5 Live, the corporation's main news and sports radio channel, said the victims were Carol Hunt, wife of its commentator John Hunt, and two of their daughters.\n\nJohn Hunt is BBC radio's main horse racing commentator, his voice known to millions through his coverage of the world-famous Grand National and The Derby. British media say that he found the bodies early Tuesday evening after returning home from reporting at Lingfield Park racecourse, which is just south of London.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC staff, the broadcaster described the incident as \"utterly devastating\" and that it would provide Hunt \"with all the support we can.\"\n\nPolice did not say whether Clifford, who is from London, was connected to the women, but British media reported that he was an ex-boyfriend of one of the daughters.\n\nLocal councilor Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is \"a typical leafy British suburb.\"\n\n\"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, Simpson said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.", "source":

I came early evening and I saw the cars and realised something tragic had happened.\n\n'This has been an awful situation and I can't even imagine what the family must be going through.\n\n'My wife and I walk down that road often and it is quiet. It is surprising, especially in the magnitude. To have three individuals who have been tragically killed, it is tragic.'\n\nAnother resident living in the proximity of the attacks described the terrifying police response that descended on the quiet cul-de-sac.\n\nTwo armed police officers stand guard at the scene on a street in Bushey\n\nThey said: 'There were 11 police cars, an armed response unit, 4 ambulances and a fire engine.\n\n'We're not allowed to park on our driveway and have had to park round the corner. Whatever happened, it's really bad and everyone is shaken up.'\n\nTelecoms specialist Diaz Hussein, who is in his 50s, told The Telegraph he didn't recognise Clifford and had 'not noticed him around here before'.\n\nHe added: 'It's absolutely terrifying. Everyone around here is deeply shocked.\n\n'This is a lovely friendly street where everyone gets on. Lots of professionals live here and we all get on very well. I'm stunned at what's happened.'\n\nDetective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: 'This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\n\n'Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.\n\n'Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away.\n\n'He may still be in possession of a weapon.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

commentator were killed with a crossbow in a suspected \"targeted\" attack.\n\nKyle Clifford, 26, from Enfield in north London, was wanted in connection with the deaths of the three women in the town of Bushey, north of London, on Tuesday night.\n\nThe victims were Carol Hunt, the 61-year-old wife of BBC radio and Sky Sports racing commentator John Hunt, and their two daughters, Louise, 25, and Hannah, 28, the broadcasters said.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, police said Clifford, who was found by officers in Enfield, \"was known to the victims\" and no additional suspects were being sought.\n\nClifford was \"receiving medical treatment having been found with injuries,\" police said.\n\nLocal police previously said officers were called to a house in the leafy commuter town where the three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson called it \"a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used\".\n\nA primary school in nearby Enfield kept children indoors during the police search.\n\nThere is no licence required to own a crossbow in the UK, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nInterior minister Yvette Cooper called the deaths \"truly shocking\" and said she was being kept updated about the inquiry.\n\nA spokeswoman for her department said legislation was \"under constant review and a call for evidence was launched earlier this year to look at whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced\".\n\nShe said the minister would \"swiftly consider the findings to see if laws need to be tightened further\".\n\n'Shocking'\n\nBBC Radio Five Live sent a note to staff calling the incident \"utterly devastating\".\n\nSky Sports Racing said on X that the team was \"deeply saddened by the tragic deaths\" and \"our thoughts are with our colleague John Hunt, his family and friends at this awful time\".\n\nOne neighbour described hearing \"shrill\" screams from the home on Tuesday.\n\nThe 46-year-old who lives near the scene, said \"absolute chaos\" then broke out as armed police put the road into lockdown.\n\n\"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house',\" she added.\n\nAnother neighbour told reporters the victims were a friendly family.\n\n\"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. \"It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nIn March, a 47-year-old man was arrested after two people were injured in separate crossbow attacks in London's Shoreditch area.\n\nLast October Jaswant Singh Chail, 21, was jailed after being found in the grounds of Windsor Castle, west of London, with a loaded crossbow.\n\nHe broke into the royal

The deceased were the family members of BBC Racing radio commentator JohnHunt. 61-year-old Carol Hunt was his wife and Hannah, 28 and Louise, 25, were the couple's daughters. Reports suggest that Clifford was romantically involved Louise but they split up a week ago. The murder happened on July 9 in the house of Hunt family in Bushey, Hertfordshire, the UK.\n\nThe murder was termed shocking by police and the colleagues of John Hunt. The three women were murdered on their property and later were declared dead on the spot. Since then, the Hertfordshire police have been on an extensive manhunt and managed to trace down Clifford in the Hilly Fields area of Enfield on June 10. Clifford is believed to be a retired army officer after serving for a year.\n\nDetective inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: \"Following extensive enquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time\"\n\nEarlier also the police suspected that Clifford was behind the crime. Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said that the \"horrific\" attack was targeted and other than crossbow, more weapons might have been used.\n\nAfter Clifford was located, his body was injured even though police didn't fire any shots at him. So Clifford was sent to the hospital for treatment. After the treatment, he is supposed to go to a major trauma centre.\n\nThe police got several calls that were concerned about the three women. To keep the leads about the case private, the police urged anyone with any evidence to directly reach the police rather than posting on social media. Not only this, the police had set up an information portal where anyone with any lead can submit their evidence.\n\nOn investing, it was revealed that Louise was utterly disturbed by the breakup. She once rammed her car into a telegraph pole. Carol, Louise's mother has confided in a friend about her daughter's tumultuous breakup. Speaking BBC, Carol's friend said, \" She mentioned that her daughter's split with her boyfriend was messy. Carol didn't go into specifics, but you could tell she was worried.\"\n\nLoise was a dog groomer and Hannah was a beautician. According to neighbour Glyn Nicholas, 77, who has been living near Hunt's property for 50 years Hunt family was good and respected their privacy.\n\nHe told the media portal, \"They were a private family, all very nice, a private family. They all did their own things. Louise started a business a couple of years ago, and it was a thriving business - we all took our dogs there to be groomed. A very close-knit family and they used to love the street.\"\n\nLouise's friend said that she was \"always a positive person.\" He could not think of anything bad about her.\n\nMoreover, John Hunt's colleagues have also lamented Hunt's tragedy. BBC Radio 5 Live has said that it will provide every support to the family. It also sent a note to John Hunt saying that the murder was devastating.\n\nUK's Interior Minister Yvette Cooper also said that the murder was \"truly shocking\" She took to X and wrote, \"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family & friends of those who have been killed & with the community.\"", "source": {"uri": "shethepeople.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "SheThePeople"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rudrani_gupta@shethepeople.tv", "name": "Rudrani Gupta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crossbow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedfordshire,_Cambridgeshire_and_Hertfordshire_Major_Crime_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trauma center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_superintendent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief superintendent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inspector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraphy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telegraphy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/1200x675/filters:format(webp)/shethepeople/media/media_files/BxtS3HFwMFX9KvWDUuTl.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 460, "textEnd": 466}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 839, "textEnd": 846}], "sentiment": -0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

In the clip, a bearded man is seen emerging from an alleyway that leads to the property where the family lived.\n\nThe man, dressed in a black tracksuit, is captured pacing towards a vehicle armed with a large object underneath his right arm, thought to be a crossbow, covered in a white cloth. He was also filmed carrying a black sports bag that police fear could contain even more weapons, before climbing into a black seat of the vehicle to place them there.\n\nBut as the footage showed him pacing through the estate, he brushed past a neighbour who was standing just feet away. She bent down to stroke a black cat, while another resident stepped out of the same property. The black vehicle the suspect was seen driving off in was then found abandoned in Enfield.\n\nHorrific details from the attack emerged yesterday, with one of the three victims believed to have called 999 in a brave act before the perpetrator fled the scene, The Guardian reports. The paper also claims that one of the women sent a text to their partner urging them to call the police.\n\nThe mum, who shares a third daughter with John who lives in Birmingham, was reportedly found in the hallway of their home with a crossbow bolt in her chest. Previous reports suggested the alleged killer tied up his victims but a source told the Guardian that the women were not gagged and bound when found.\n\nHowever there was reportedly evidence of ligature marks around their wrists and face, suggesting these had been removed. The source also said all three had injuries to their knees.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday lunchtime, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson, of Hertfordshire Police, said the attack was a \"targeted incident\" and Clifford was \"wanted in connection with murder\". He said: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident.\n\n\"We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area. The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nAfter police located Clifford's car, their search efforts then shifted to a nearby cemetery close to Rendlesham Road - a five-minute walk from Clifford's address. By Wednesday evening, the manhunt finally came to a close after he was found hiding among headstones.\n\nA swarm of armed police closed in at the site, with paramedics then seen rushing into the grounds with an air ambulance circling overhead. The BBC reported that the air \"is thick with the sound of helicopters\" operated by police and press.\n\nLocal Rae Cresswell, 26, who filmed the commotion, said: \"I saw about ten officers coming in. I was quite worried because they were armed and there were dogs with them. I asked them if they wanted me to leave but they said it was fine to stay. They started checking the area so I left shortly after and came back to see all these vehicles.\"\n\nAfter around 20 minutes, Clifford was seen stretchered away from the scene and taken by ambulance to Royal London Hospital, where he is receiving medical treatment after being discovered with injuries. Clifford had reportedly been hiding from police in a nearby church, according to one local, Adam, who claimed: \"He was hiding there all day and then came here. He was well known here, and was actually expelled from school for carrying a knife.\"\n\nDetective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: \"Following extensive enquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time.\"\n\nA London Ambulance Spokesperson said: \"Ambulance crews and London's air ambulance attended an incident in Lavender Hill Cemetery, Enfield, this afternoon (Tuesday 10). We treated a man at the scene and took him to a major trauma centre.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "saffron_otter@mirror.co.uk",

Police emphasised no shots were fired.\n\nLondon Ambulance Service confirmed a man was treated at Lavender Hill Cemetery before being transported to a \"major trauma centre\", which could be one of four hospitals in the capital.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, there was a significant number of police officers at the cemetery, 16 miles from the crime scene and near a property that was searched earlier in the day as part of the manhunt.\n\nParamedics and ambulances were also at the location. Footage captured from a helicopter showed a man being stretchered out of the cemetery.\n\nPolice believe the suspect was known to the victims and no one else is being sought in connection with the investigation.\n\nSources said that Carol Hunt was found in the hallway of the house with a crossbow bolt in her chest, while evidence of ligatures were found near the victims. One of the victims is understood to have texted her partner, urging them to call the police.\n\nClifford is believed to have served in the British army for a year, sources have said. The Ministry of Defence has been contacted for comment.\n\nThe women are understood to be the family of the BBC's racing radio commentator, John Hunt. As part of a note sent to BBC 5 Live staff on Wednesday, the organisation described the incident as \"utterly devastating\".\n\nThe Hunts have another daughter, Amy, who is thought to live in Birmingham.\n\nPolice said a crossbow or other weapons may have been used in the attacks, and they are investigating what relationship any of the victims may have had to Clifford.\n\nThe home secretary, Yvette Cooper, is urgently considering the findings of a Home Office review launched in 2021 to see if tougher crossbow laws need to be introduced.\n\nA source said the victims were not gagged and bound when found, but there were ligature marks around their wrists and face, suggesting they had been and that these were removed. The source added that all of the victims had injuries to their knees.\n\nThe Guardian understands that one of the victims called 999 and alerted the police to the incident before the perpetrator fled.\n\nDetectives have appealed for information or video footage and asked the public to report anything suspicious they saw in Ashlyn Close from midday on Tuesday, about seven hours before they found the women.\n\nOne source said the women may have been held hostage for hours before police were called.\n\nOn Wednesday morning armed police raided a property not far from the cemetery in Rendlesham Road, Enfield, which is understood to have been linked to Clifford's brother, Bradley, who was jailed for life in 2018 for murder.\n\nSchools in Enfield were placed in lockdown.\n\nDI Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit said: \"This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims' family and we would ask that their

express our gratitude to the members of the public who have contacted us.\"\n\nCooper, said she is being kept fully updated on the inquiry into the \"truly shocking\" deaths.\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"We keep legislation under constant review and a call for evidence was launched earlier this year to look at whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.\n\n\"The

Kyle Clifford, 26, from Enfield in north London, is wanted in connection with the deaths of the three women in the town of Bushey, north of London, on Tuesday night.\n\nThe victims were Carol Hunt, the 61-year-old wife of BBC radio and Sky Sports racing commentator John Hunt, and their two daughters, Louise, 25, and Hannah, 28, the broadcasters said. Local police said officers were called to a house in the leafy commuter town where the three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson said armed officers and specialist search teams were involved in the manhunt, with the suspect believed to be in north London or around Bushey. Simpson also urged Clifford to contact police and warned the public not to approach the suspect. He called it \"a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used\".\n\nA primary school in nearby Enfield kept children indoors during the police search.

police detain crossbow attack suspect after three women killed", "body": "The three women were killed on Tuesday night in Bushey, near Watford, north of London\n\nUK police said Wednesday a 26-year-old man was in custody after the wife and two daughters of a radio racing commentator were killed with a crossbow in a suspected \"targeted\" attack.\n\nKyle Clifford, 26, from Enfield in north London, was wanted in connection with the deaths of the three women in the town of Bushey, north of London, on Tuesday night.\n\nThe victims were Carol Hunt, the 61-year-old wife of BBC radio and Sky Sports racing commentator John Hunt, and their two daughters, Louise, 25, and Hannah, 28, the broadcasters said.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, police said Clifford, who was found by officers in Enfield, \"was known to the victims\" and no additional suspects were being sought.\n\nClifford was \"receiving medical treatment having been found with injuries,\" police said.\n\nNo formal arrests have yet been made, police later said.\n\nLocal police previously said officers were called to a house in the leafy commuter town where the three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson called it \"a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used\".\n\nA primary school in nearby Enfield kept children indoors during the police search.\n\nThere is no licence required to own a crossbow in the UK, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nInterior minister Yvette Cooper called the deaths \"truly shocking\" and said she was being kept updated about the inquiry.\n\nA spokeswoman for her department said legislation was \"under constant review and a call for evidence was launched earlier this year to look at whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced\".\n\nShe said the minister would \"swiftly consider the findings to see if laws need to be tightened further\".\n\n- 'Shocking' -\n\nBBC Radio Five Live sent a note to staff calling the incident \"utterly devastating\".\n\nWednesday evening, Hunt's colleague presenter Mark Chapman offered tearful condolences on air, saying, \"This has been a heartbreaking day.\"\n\nSky Sports Racing said on X that the team was \"deeply saddened by the tragic deaths\" and \"our thoughts are with our colleague John Hunt, his family and friends at this awful time\".\n\nNear the Hunt home, neighbour Su Kehinde, 60, who came to lay flowers by the scene of the tragedy, said, \"They were the

nearby.\n\nNeighbours recalled hearing screaming on Tuesday, as the \"traumatic\" incident unfolded.\n\nIn a press conference before Clifford was found, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson, from Hertfordshire Police, told reporters the killings were believed to have been \"targeted\".\n\nDuring the hunt for Clifford, who is understood to have left the Army in 2022 after a short stint, the force said they believed he may have been armed with a crossbow and warned people not to approach him.\n\nHe was believed to have been known to the victims.\n\nRadio 5 Live presenter Mark Chapman paid an emotional tribute at the start of the Euro 2024 pre-match show.\n\nSpeaking through tears, he said: \"This has been a heart-breaking day.\n\n\"John Hunt is our colleague and our friend, not just to the current 5 Live sport team but to all of those who have worked here with him over the past 20 years and also to all of you who have enjoyed his superb commentaries.\n\n\"On behalf of everybody connected to 5 Live sport, our love and thoughts and support are with John and his family.\"\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper is urgently considering whether tougher crossbow laws are needed in the wake of the killings.\n\nShe will look at the findings of a Home Office review carried out earlier this year.\n\nA Home Office spokeswoman said: \"We keep legislation under constant review and a call for evidence was launched earlier this year to look at whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.\n\n\"The Home Secretary will swiftly consider the findings to see if laws need to be

The three victims have now been identified as Carol Hunt, 61, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25. They are the wife and daughters of BBC Five Live racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nHe was found in the Enfield area of north London and is receiving treatment for his injuries, Hertfordshire Police said. Police previously said they believe it was a \"targeted incident\" and urged members of the public not to approach Clifford if they see him.\n\nKyle Clifford is understood to be the ex-boyfriend of victim Louise Hunt. The BBC reported that Kyle Clifford left the British Army after a brief period of service in 2022. The Ministry of Defence confirmed on Wednesday that he had served briefly in the Armed Forces. A Whitehall source said: \"He didn't serve very long and he is no longer a serving member of the armed forces. We're not going to speculate which regiment or unit he was in, but look at his age. He didn't serve very long.\"\n\nIt has also emerged that his brother, Bradley Clifford, is currently serving a life sentence over the murder of a moped driver. Bradley, from Enfield, pursued and collided with Soban Khan, 18, and Jahshua Francis, 19, in his Ford Mustang after they hit his car with a bottle, the Old Bailey heard in 2018.\n\nBoth victims were thrown into flung into the air by the crash. Bradley Clifford then beat moped rider Mr Khan as he lay on the ground. Mr Khan later died, and a post-mortem gave his cause of death as multiple injuries. During the trial, the jury was told how Bradley Clifford became \"enraged\" when his Mustang EcoBoost's wing mirror was broken, beginning a \"rapid, brutal and unrelenting\" chase through the streets of Enfield in north London.\n\nJahshua Francis, 19, was found injured near the scene. He was rushed to hospital in ambulance and recovered from his injuries.\n\nBradley Clifford was found guilty of murder and attempted GBH with intent. He was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 23 years for the murder of Mr Khan and seven years for the attack on Mr Francis.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benedict_tetzlaff_deas@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Benedict Tetzlaff-Deas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Life imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(United_Kingdom)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moped", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regiment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regiment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bailey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autopsy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Mustang", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ford Mustang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievous_bodily_harm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grievous bodily harm"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33214764.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_MAIN-crossbow-brother.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

the graveyard in Hilly Fields in Enfield, North London, this afternoon after a major manhunt was launched.\n\nIt comes after a BBC star's wife and two daughters were allegedly murdered in Bushey, Hertfordshire.\n\nCarol Hunt, 61 - the wife of BBC racing commentar John Hunt - and their daughters Louise, 25, and Hannah, 28, were found dead inside their home last night.\n\nFootage shows a man emerging from an alleyway next to the property dressed all in black and carrying what appears to be a crossbow and a bag cops fear could be a cache of further weapons.\n\nThe man in the footage then climbs into a black Seat - the same car understood to have been found abandoned earlier today.\n\nThat discovery led cops to Enfield where armed officers were searching for the suspect.\n\nWhat we know so far...\n\nA full-size crossbow could shoot bolts accurately up to 250ft - raising the terrifying prospect victims may not even see their shooter before being hit.\n\nIn the clip - the man, believed to be Kyle Clifford - climbs into the black car and waits for 18 seconds before driving away West-bound on Bushey Grove Road.\n\nThe road is directly connected to the murder scene on Ashlyn Close by a pedestrian footpath.\n\nBBC Five Live racing commentator Hunt had been working at Lingfield Park Racecourse in Surrey yesterday before returning home in the evening to discover the horror that had unfolded, it is understood.\n\nMailOnline reports Clifford was the ex-boyfriend of one of Hunt's daughters.\n\nDramatic footage obtained exclusively by The Sun this afternoon showed cops storming a home in the hunt for the suspect.\n\nTwo helicopters were spotted circling the Hilly Fields area of Enfield, North London, as armed police stormed a home.\n\nOne officer can be heard screaming: \"Armed Police, come to the door and raise your hands\" as cops barrage through the front of the property.\n\nIt is unclear who or what cops discovered in the home but at least two officers are still at the scene of the raid.\n\nIn a press conference at 12.30pm Hertfordshire Police said they were still hunting for the suspect.\n\nThe force confirmed Clifford, who is from Enfield in North London, may still be armed and urged anyone who sees him to call 999 immediately.\n\nAppealing directly to Clifford today, Detective Superintendent Rob Hall said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this please make contact with police via 999.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_merrifield@thesun.ie", "name": "Ryan

This sparked a huge police search for Clifford, who is understood to have recently split from Louise.\n\nIn an update on Thursday, police said that a crossbow has been recovered and confirmed they had received no earlier reports after exploring whether there had been previous contact with Clifford or the victims.\n\nDetective Superintendent Rob Hall, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: \"Our thoughts remain with the victims' family and loved ones at this devastating and indescribable time.

Officers said the women were shot in an apparently \"targeted incident.\"\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident, involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used,\" said the Hertfordshire police chief, Superintendent Jon Simpson, at a news conference Wednesday.\n\nTwo helicopters were circling parts of the town of Enfield in North London, where Clifford is from, and armed police raided an Enfield property, according the Independent newspaper.\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper, who took office last week after the Labour Party's election victory, is considering tougher crossbow laws and will assess the findings of a Home Office review carried out earlier this year, British news outlets reported.\n\nThe previous government had considered tightening the laws involving crossbows after would-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail attempted to break into Windsor Castle and kill Queen Elizabeth II with such a weapon on Christmas morning in 2021.\n\nThe United Kingdom currently does not have a registration system or licensing requirement for crossbow ownership, though it is illegal for anyone under 18 to possess one.\n\nIn February, the Conservative government's Home Office launched an eight-week review to consider implementing a licensing system and tighter restrictions on buying and selling crossbows, similar to regulations already instated for firearms.\n\nThe office completed the review in April, but action was apparently stalled by the recent elections.\n\nIn a tweet on Wednesday, Cooper called the killings \"shocking\" and said she is being kept \"fully updated\" on the investigation.\n\nJohn Hunt's fellow sports journalists and other figures from the racing world took to social media to express their condolences for the Hunt family.\n\n\"Impossible to comprehend the pain,\" wrote ITV racing commentator Matt Chapman on X. \"Just know we are all here for you John.

night.\n\nThe victims were Carol Hunt, the 61-year-old wife of BBC radio and Sky Sports racing commentator John Hunt, and their two daughters, Louise, 25, and Hannah, 28, the broadcasters said.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, police said Clifford, who was found by officers in Enfield, \"was known to the victims\" and no additional suspects were being sought.\n\nClifford was \"receiving medical treatment having been found with injuries,\" police said.\n\nNo formal arrests have yet been made, police later said.\n\nLocal police previously said officers were called to a house in the leafy commuter town where the three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson called it \"a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used\".\n\nA primary school in nearby Enfield kept children indoors during the police search.\n\nThere is no licence required to own a crossbow in the UK, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nInterior minister Yvette Cooper called the deaths \"truly shocking\" and said she was being kept updated about the inquiry.\n\nA spokeswoman for her department said legislation was \"under constant review and a call for evidence was launched earlier this year to look at whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced\".\n\nShe said the minister would \"swiftly consider the findings to see if laws need to be tightened further\".\n\n- 'Shocking' -\n\nBBC Radio Five Live sent a note to staff calling the

Su Kehinde, 60, who came to lay flowers by the scene of the tragedy, said, \"They were the loveliest, gentlest family.\"\n\nAnother neighbour told reporters the victims were a friendly family.\n\n\"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. \"It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nIn March, a 47-year-old man was arrested after two people were

have yet been made, police later said.\n\nLocal police previously said officers were called to a house in the leafy commuter town where the three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson called it \"a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used\".\n\nA primary school in nearby Enfield kept children indoors during the police search.\n\nThere is no licence required to own a crossbow in the UK, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nInterior minister Yvette Cooper called the deaths \"truly shocking\" and said she was being kept updated about the inquiry.\n\nA spokeswoman for her department said legislation was \"under constant review and a call for evidence was launched earlier this year to look at whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced\".\n\nMore from this section Astronaut Exposes 'Enormous Lie' About Earth After

minister would \"swiftly consider the findings to see if laws need to be tightened further\".\n\n- 'Shocking' -\n\nBBC Radio Five Live sent a note to staff calling the incident \"utterly devastating\".\n\nWednesday evening, Hunt's colleague presenter Mark Chapman offered tearful condolences on air, saying, \"This has been a heartbreaking day.\"\n\nSky Sports Racing said on X that the team was \"deeply saddened by the tragic deaths\" and \"our thoughts are with our colleague John Hunt, his family and friends at this awful time\".\n\nNear the Hunt home, neighbour Su Kehinde, 60, who came to lay flowers by the scene of the tragedy, said, \"They were the loveliest, gentlest family.\"\n\nAnother neighbour told reporters the victims were a friendly family.\n\n\"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. \"It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nIn March, a 47-year-old man was arrested after two people were injured in separate crossbow attacks in London's Shoreditch area.\n\nLast October Jaswant Singh Chail, 21, was jailed after being found in the grounds of Windsor Castle, west of London, with a loaded crossbow.\n\nHe broke into the royal residence on Christmas Day 2021 and told police he was trying to kill Queen Elizabeth II.\n\naks/phz/giv/nro", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType":

The three women were victims of a harrowing attack, and despite best efforts from emergency services, they all died at the scene.\n\nThe mother and daughters were \"targeted\" in a brutal attack involving a crossbow in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson of Hertfordshire Police said yesterday. Officers located the suspected triple murderer, Kyle Clifford, 26, in an Enfield graveyard on Wednesday following a near day-long manhunt.\n\nIt is believed Clifford had at one point been in a relationship with Mr Hunt's younger daughter, Louise. He was eventually found hiding in headstones in the Lavender Hill Cemetery yesterday, near where the three women died. Officers are waiting to question their main suspect after he was taken to hospital last night with injuries.\n\nWith the search now concluded, disturbing new information has emerged about the circumstances in which the three women were found at their home in Hertfordshire. Sources have claimed that evidence from the scene suggests the mother and daughters may have been gagged and bound before they were killed.\n\nCiting a source, The Guardian reported that while the three members of the Hunt family were not found tied up, there were ligature marks visible on their wrists and faces that suggest they may have been at one point. It was also reported that Carol, a mother of three to Hannah, Louise, and a third daughter called Amy, was found in the hallway of the house with a crossbow bolt in her chest. The publication's source added that evidence of ligatures was found near their bodies.\n\nCarol, Hannah, and Lousie were all still alive when police and emergency services - including two air ambulances - were called to their home before 7pm on July 9. It's understood the trio made a brave attempt to get help in their final moments. The Guardian reports that one of the women called 999 and alerted officers to the attack before the perpetrator fled the scene. The publication has also reported that one of the victims texted her partner, urging them to call the police.\n\nRecalling the moment the quiet cul de sac suddenly turned into a major crime scene, a local resident, 46, said: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like, 'That's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n\"We had armed police running down, screaming 'Stay in your house'... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\" The neighbour said multiple ambulances, helicopters and \"at least 16 police cars\" arrived at the scene quickly, with armed police going from house to house to question locals, request doorbell camera footage and tell them to stay indoors.\n\nShe added that it \"happened at peak family time between 6pm and 7pm, when people were probably cooking for their kids and getting their kids ready for bed, and all of us in a tight little road, completely unaware of the trauma and tragic circumstances that other people were going through at that particular time\".\n\nDetective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said that, with Clifford now located, \"nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time\". She has asked people to come forward if they have information or footage relating to the incident.\n\nDet Insp Jenkins said: \"We have had an overwhelming number of calls and would like to express our gratitude to the members of the public who have contacted us. We would still appeal for anyone with information or footage to please contact police directly and refrain from commenting on social media as this could affect the progress of the case. We have set up an information portal where people can submit any information, photos or video footage which they feel could assist us with our investigation. This incident will of course be of concern to local residents.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nia_dalton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Nia Dalton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Crossbow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_Hill_Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lavender Hill Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(writing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ligature (writing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingfield_Park_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lingfield Park Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_superintendent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief superintendent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_medical_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Air medical services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedfordshire,_Cambridgeshire_and_Hertfordshire_Major_Crime_Unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_scene", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime scene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inspector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33219408.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_2MIRROR-main-1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 2114, "textEnd": 2120}], "sentiment": -0.6549019607843137, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Up to four black-clad officers - two carrying automatic rifles - stood guard at the cemetery gates, preventing members of the public from entering.\n\nMeanwhile, an ambulance rushed into the cemetery grounds with blue lights flashing and sirens on. It re-emerged about 20 minute later, still in emergency mode.\n\nTwo helicopters were also spotted hovering- one believed to be an air ambulance which landed in the cemetery grounds.\n\nLocal resident Rae Cresswell, 26, told how she was going for a walk in the cemetery when she saw armed officers.\n\n'They just said have you heard the news, said they were searching and asked if I wanted to leave,' she said.\n\n'I said \"no\", and stayed for a while and they were going around looking around the trees and the graves.\n\n'I wasn't scared, they said first thing this morning that it was a domestic so I didn't think I was in any danger.'\n\nEarlier, officers raided a house where Clifford is known to live, with dramatic footage from today showing officers storming the property.\n\nPolice have found the suspect's car and are now searching a nearby park. Members of the public have been told to immediately call 999 if they see Clifford but not approach him, describing him as dangerous and potentially still armed.\n\nNearby schools have gone into precautionary lockdowns, with teachers at one primary telling parents to collect their children at the end of the day and take them directly home.\n\nThe BBC has called the murders 'utterly devastating', adding in a note to staff: 'Our thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.'\n\nClifford's neighbours told today how police had put the road into lockdown as a house was searched by armed officers.\n\nThey spoke as two police helicopters hovered above the neighbourhood and two uniformed PCs stood guard at the door of the terraced home.\n\nOne local mother told how she arrived back from dropping her children off at school to find armed police at the house opposite hers.\n\n'They had cordoned off the road and were ushering people away from the house they were going into,' she told MailOnline. 'They had the full protective gear on, guns, shields and helmets - the kind you'd expect to see in riots.\n\n'They let me through to get home and they remained there for about an hour before they left. Then there was just the ordinary police there. 'I don't know the family at all. I know the father passed away some time ago but that's about it.'\n\nOne woman who lives across the road from the house said he had been working from home when she heard a commotion.\n\n'I was upstairs, when I heard cars honking and then looked out the window and realised that there were police there,' she said.\n\n'I came down and looked across. And they were saying \"armed police\" and then they went right in. There were dogs barking and everyone realised there was something big going on.'\n\nThe mother added: 'We've now been told that my daughter's school around the corner has gone into an amber lockdown. A few other schools have shut their doors as well. So we're just a little bit worried. I think everyone is really, really concerned.'\n\nThe BBC confirmed that Mr Hunt's wife and two daughters had died and messages of condolence have been posted on social media by figures from the racing world.\n\nITV racing commentator Matt Chapman wrote on X: 'No words needed for what has happened to @HuntyCaller and family today.\n\n'Impossible to comprehend the pain. Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal - racing loves you.'\n\nThe Amateur Jockeys Association of Great Britain and Beverley Racecourse were among others sending their sympathies.\n\nThis morning, the usually quiet cul-de-sac in Bushey where the killings took place was swarming with armed police and forensic officers.\n\nOne neighbour, who lives on the 'serene and quiet road' and did not want to be named, said she did not know the victims well but they were a 'friendly family'.\n\n'We would see them every day passing by and they would say 'good morning',' she said. 'It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.'\n\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper is being kept 'fully updated' on the killings and has urged anyone with information about the case to contact police.\n\nThe Labour MP said in a post on X: 'The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family & friends of those who have been killed & with the community.\n\n'I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support (Hertfordshire Police) with any information about this case.'\n\nOne local resident, who lives on a nearby street, told MailOnline that his friends went to school with some of the victims.\n\nHe said: 'From 7pm there were like 20 police cars coming down, four ambulances and then armed police came and they were here till midnight.\n\n'I know of them (the victims). So a few of them went to school with people that I know. That's all I know. I didn't know them personally.\n\n'I know they went to schools in the area. They didn't go to my school.'\n\nLocal councillor Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is 'a typical leafy British suburb'.\n\nHe told the BBC: 'At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run.\n\n'This is not something that happens in Bushey.\n\n'We can't remember a murder in our rather quiet neck of the woods, so (it's a) terrible shock and our sympathies and prayers and thoughts are with the families of the three women.\n\n'That really is a terrible thing to happen to anybody, and I've gathered they're all from the same family, which obviously makes it even more tragic, and we'll do everything we can as the local council to add our source of comfort where we can.'\n\nAnother man who lives close to the murder scene in Bushey said the incident was 'tragic' and claimed the victims were 'a middle class family'.\n\nRiaz, who is in his 50s and declined to give a second name, said: 'At 6 o'clock, my wife called me while I was at work, saying 'there are so many police cars down the road which I've never seen before', and she was distressed.\n\n'I didn't know (what had happened) at that point, then at that very moment my nephew phoned me saying something tragic had happened and was I OK. I came early evening and I saw the cars and realised something tragic had happened.\n\n'This has been an awful situation and I can't even imagine what the family must be going through.\n\n'My wife and I walk down that road often and it is quiet. It is surprising, especially in the magnitude. To have three individuals who have been tragically killed, it is tragic.'\n\nAnother resident living in the proximity of the attacks described the terrifying police response that descended on the quiet cul-de-sac.\n\nThey said: 'There were 11 police cars, an armed response unit, 4 ambulances and a fire engine.\n\n'We're not allowed to park on our driveway and have had to park round the corner. Whatever happened, it's really bad and everyone is shaken up.'\n\nTelecoms specialist Diaz Hussein, who is in his 50s, told The Telegraph he didn't recognise Clifford and had 'not noticed him around here before'.\n\nHe added: 'It's absolutely terrifying. Everyone around here is deeply shocked.\n\n'This is a lovely friendly street where everyone gets on. Lots of professionals live here and we all get on very well. I'm stunned at what's happened.'\n\nDetective Superintendent Rob Hall from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: 'This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\n\n'Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.\n\n'Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [],

His tweet came before his family were identified as the Bushey triple murder victims.\n\nOn Saturday, July 6, John tweeted: \"Watching England is like going to Las Vegas, getting a room with an airport view and deciding on an early night after a room service Carbonara and half a lager.\"\n\nShortly after his first post, he shared another which read: \"Can we just fast forward straight to penalties on Wednesday, please.\" Like the rest of the UK, John had been looking forward to seeing England play tonight, but sadly, he is now faced with indescribable tragedy following the loss of his beloved wife and two daughters.\n\nUnderneath John's last posts, his fans have flocked to share their sympathy with the BBC star after his family were identified as the victims. One wrote: \"Man I'm so sorry... I hope you can find some peace. Christ have mercy.\" Another echoed: \"If I can do anything for you in life, John, please tell me. I am so, so sorry for your loss.\"\n\nAnother replied: \"I'm so utterly sorry for this awful tragedy. May their memories be blessings.\" And someone else voiced: \"So sorry to hear the absolute awful news. Deep condolences to you and your family.\" Another one of John's followers wrote: \"I'm so terribly sorry for your loss. Words seem futile right now but in time I hope you can take comfort and strength from the kindness and love being shown towards you.\"\n\nPolice have made a direct appeal to the chief suspect in the \"horrific\" murders of the three women to give himself up. Kyle Clifford is being hunted following the discovery of the fatally-injured women aged 25, 28 and 61 - and police have warned he is believed to armed with a crossbow and other weapons.\n\nThe victims have now been reportedly identified as Carol Hunt, 61, Hannah Hunt, 28, and Louise Hunt, 25 - although official confirmation is still being awaited. John is understood to have been working for BBC Racing on Tuesday and may have raised the alarm when he returned home.\n\nFollowing the tragic news, tributes have flooded in for the family, including for John's daughter, Louise. According to MyLondon, one post on social media read: \"No words can describe the loss I feel after today's horrific news. You were so loved and Scooby adored you...you built up an amazing business and were always so kind and gentle. May you RIP with your sister and mum xxx.\"\n\nLouise reportedly launched a dog grooming service during Covid lockdown named Groom and Glow, while her sister Hannah owned a beauty business, the website reported.\n\nToday Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson said the attack last night in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Hertfordshire was a \"targeted incident \" and Clifford, 26, was \"wanted in connection with murder\".\n\nHe said: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident. We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area.\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\" Addressing Clifford directly, he said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nThe three women were found in the early evening after police and ambulance vehicles - including two air ambulances - were called to to a home in Hertfordshire before 7pm. The trio had suffered serious injuries, but were alive when discovered. However all three women tragically died a short time later.\n\nHunt, who is a former police officer, has worked for BBC Radio Five Live as a racing commentator for the last 20 years. ITV racing pundit Matt Chapman took to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday to share his condolences for his co-star. He wrote: \"No words needed for what has happened to @HuntyCaller and family today. Impossible to comprehend the pain. Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal - racing loves you.\"\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC 5 Live staff on Wednesday, the organisation described the incident which involved the deaths of the wife and daughters of racing commentator John Hunt as \"utterly devastating\". The note read: \"The news today about John Hunt's family is utterly devastating. Our thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.\"\n\nFollow Mirror Celebs on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter ,

phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run,\" he told the BBC.\n\nAddressing the suspect directly, Simpson said: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nBritain's new home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she is being kept \"fully informed\" about the \"truly shocking\" incident.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office said Cooper will \"swiftly consider\" the findings from a recently launched review into whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5,

Thank you for following our coverage.\n\nHere is a summary of today's events:\n\nA friend of Louise Hunt, who lives in Bushey, has said the usually \"pretty quiet\" local community is \"completely in shock\" at the triple murder.\n\nHe told BBC News: \"I've lived in Bushey pretty much my whole life, only a couple of roads away, and it is generally a pretty quiet community.\n\n\"We certainly don't hear about any kind of violence of this magnitude.\n\n\"A lot of working professionals, families, and everyone gets on with their day - so it's a pretty quiet community, and completely in shock tonight.\"\n\nThe friend also described Louise as \"always a positive person\" and that he could not think of \"anything bad to say about her\".\n\nHe added: \"I couldn't believe what had happened at first. I'd heard the news from my sister early in the morning before I'd figured out who the victims were and, once I found out, it's been a massive shock, (I've) been in denial.\n\n\"I haven't processed it yet and I feel also angry towards the murder and I can't even begin to imagine what the father's going through - so, mixture of emotions - angry, sad and in shock.\"\n\nA London Ambulance spokesman said ambulance crews and the air ambulance attended an incident in Lavender Hill cemetery this afternoon.\n\nThey said a man was treated at the scene and later taken to a major trauma centre.\n\nPolice said they believe triple murder suspect Kyle Clifford was known to the victims.\n\nHertfordshire Police confirmed Clifford is receiving medical treatment and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time.\n\nIn a press conference before Clifford was located, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson told reporters the murders are believed to be \"targeted\".\n\nA friend of the women who were killed in Bushey has remembered them as \"beautiful souls\".\n\nSu Kehinde, 60, who lives nearby, spoke after laying some flowers at a makeshift tribute at the end of the police cordon.\n\nMs Kehinde said: \"They were the loveliest, gentlest family. They were the meekest human beings. They did not deserve this. They were beautiful souls.\"\n\nHer daughter April, 32, said that Hannah Hunt \"always had a smile\", adding: \"She was hard-working, a hard grafter and really gentle.\"\n\nDetective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: \"Following extensive inquiries, the suspect has been located and nobody else is being sought in connection with the investigation at this time.\n\n\"We have had an overwhelming number of calls and would like to express our gratitude to the members of the public who have contacted us. We would still appeal for anyone with information or footage to please contact police directly and refrain from commenting on social media as this could affect the progress of the case.\n\n\"We have set up an information portal where people can submit any information, photos or video footage which they feel could assist us with our investigation.\n\n\"This incident will of course be of concern to local residents. Additional local officers will be in the area today so please do speak to them if you need to.\"\n\nThe force also said: \"This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\"\n\nRae Cresswell, 26, a local resident who filmed police sweeping into Lavender Hill cemetery in Enfield earlier, said: \"I saw about 10 officers coming in, it was around 3pm I'd say. I was quite worried because they were armed and there were dogs with them.\"\n\nHe added: \"I asked them if they wanted me to leave but they said it was fine to stay. They started checking the area so I left shortly after and came back to see all these vehicles.\"\n\nIn a post on Facebook, the Parish of Bushey invited people to offer prayers and light candles at two churches in Bushey after expressing \"deep sadness\" as the \"people of Bushey mourn the tragic loss of three members of our community\".\n\nThey wrote: \"This has made the national news and attention will be focused on where we live. Both the Parish Church of St James on the High Street of Bushey and St Pauls on Bushey Hall Road are open for people to offer prayers and light a candle for those who have died, the family of the victims and those helping with this terrible crime. We also remember the perpetrator who committed this act, that he may come forward to the police.\"\n\nGlyn Nicholas, 77, retired, who has lived on the same road as the victims for 50 years said: \"I know one of the daughters because she's our dog groomer. All our daughters had their dogs groomed with Louise. She knew my wife, but the other daughter I didn't know at all.\"\n\nHe added: \"They were a private family, all very nice, a private family. They all did their own things. Louise started a business a couple of years ago, and it was a thriving business - we all took our dogs there to be groomed.\n\n\"They used to have a dog themselves and they used to be out and about walking their dog. I'd just say hello, never stopped and talked.\n\n\"A very close-knit family and they used to love the street. With his job they probably could have found a more salubrious house but they'd had a lot of work done on their house over the years. They had a groomer's hut built for the dogs in the garden. I believe they had another daughter who lives away.\n\nHe said that the girls \"were quite young when they came here - they were just young girls when they came here so they've probably been nearer 20 years here\".\n\nThe man being hunted by police on suspicion of a triple crossbow murder has a brother who is serving life in prison for beating a man to death, The Telegraph can disclose.\n\nSix years ago, Clifford's older brother, Bradley, was convicted of murder after a trial at the Old Bailey.\n\nBradley Clifford, a plumber, was 23 when he chased and deliberately mowed down Soban Khan, 18, and Jahshua Francis, 19, on their moped after they struck his prized Ford Mustang car with a bottle.\n\nThe Telegraph's Crime Editor, Martin Evans, has the full story here.\n\nA Metropolitan Police forensics van has just pulled up at the entrance to Lavender Hill cemetery in Enfield, the focus of the search for suspected crossbow killer Kyle Clifford.\n\nMeanwhile, the air ambulance has just taken off.\n\nAlthough shielded from view by a thick evergreen hedge, the cemetery is just yards from the residential housing on Cedar Road, which runs adjacent.\n\nThe cemetery is on the northern edge of London, between central Enfield and the M25 motorway.\n\nIn footage from LBC posted on X, dozens of paramedics and police can be seen racing into the cemetery in Hilly Fields, Enfield where the search has been centred.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police have confirmed they are assisting their colleagues in Hertfordshire with the search for Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the triple crossbow murder in Bushey.\n\nA Hertfordshire Constabulary spokesman said: \"Whilst we are asking the public to remain vigilant, people should go about their business as normal at this time. At this stage there is no explicit wider threat to members of the public and no children have been involved.\"\n\nJulie Harrington, the chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority has shared a message of condolence for John Hunt, who she describes as a \"great friend of many in our sport\".\n\nIn a statement, she said: \"The thoughts of everyone at the BHA are with John Hunt, his family and friends at this shocking and tragic time. It is impossible to comprehend the horror that has been inflicted upon them by this dreadful event.\n\n\"John is a great friend to many in our sport and I am sure that in this time of unimaginable grief for him, the racing family will rally around as we have seen many times before when one of our number is faced with great trauma.\"\n\nThe Home Secretary is urgently considering the findings of a Home Office review to see if tougher crossbow laws need to be introduced in the wake of the deaths of the wife and two daughters of racing commentator John Hunt.\n\nA department spokesman said: \"This is an appalling incident and the Home Secretary is being kept updated by the police.\n\n\"We keep legislation under constant review and a call for evidence was launched earlier this year to look at whether further controls on crossbows should be introduced.\n\n\"The Home Secretary will swiftly consider the findings to see if laws need to be tightened further.\"\n\nChildren at a primary school in Enfield have been kept indoors as police search for a triple murder suspect.\n\nJade-Simone Bacon, headteacher of St Michael's CofE Primary School in Brigadier Hill, in Enfield, said pupils have not been allowed to go outside.\n\nBut parents will be able to pick up their children at \"the normal time\" at the end of the school day, Mrs Bacon confirmed.\n\nShe said \"We've locked both buildings and just kept the children inside. So we've not had them on the field or the playground. It's not a lockdown as in under the desks or hidden or anything, it's just a lighter lockdown.\n\n\"We have just kept them within the building as though it were like a wet playday so we don't cause the children any distress and we keep everything as calm as possible.\"\n\nMrs Bacon said the police carried out a \"reassurance visit\" to the primary school on Wednesday.\n\nThe Ministry of Defence confirmed on Wednesday that the man wanted in connection with the triple murder in Bushey had served briefly in the Armed Forces.\n\nA Whitehall source said: \"He didn't serve very long and he is no longer a serving member of the armed forces. We're not going to speculate which regiment or unit he was in, but look at his age. He didn't serve very long.\"\n\nA near neighbour of the murdered women said Louise Hunt had been left so upset by a recent break up with her boyfriend she had crashed her car into a telegraph pole outside the family home.\n\nGlyn Nicholas, 77, suggested that Louise had been in a relationship with the man now wanted in connection with the murders of the three women and that the relationship had ended badly.\n\nHe said: \"Louise split up with her boyfriend a few days ago and she crashed her car into a telegraph pole because she was so upset coming home. She's a lovely, caring girl. She runs a dog grooming business in Bushey.\n\n\"Her sister Hannah and mother Carol are lovely as well. It's all so sad. Louise was a sweet, lovely girl. They all were. This is so sad for everyone,\" he said.\n\nAs part of a note sent to BBC 5 Live staff on Wednesday, the organisation described the incident which involved the deaths of the wife and daughters of racing commentator John Hunt as \"utterly devastating\".\n\nThe note read: \"The news today about John Hunt's family is utterly devastating. Our thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.\"\n\nKillings involving a crossbow are typically rare but ministers had considered tightening laws in a bid to stop the weapons being used in violent attacks.\n\nCurrently, there is no requirement to have a licence for a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nThe previous government looked at bringing in firearms licensing-style rules in the wake of an attempt to kill the late Queen with a crossbow.\n\nWould-be assassin Jaswant Singh Chail was encouraged by an AI chatbot to break into Windsor Castle on Christmas Day 2021 with a loaded crossbow to kill the late Queen.\n\nPlans for crossbow owners to face police checks were mooted as part of efforts to \"step up action to prevent violence on our streets\", the Home Office said earlier this year.\n\nThe department launched an eight-week consultation in February to see if there should be a licensing system to control the use, ownership and supply of crossbows, with anyone looking to buy one facing police checks - similar to regulations already in place for firearms.\n\nMessages of condolence have been posted on social media by figures from the racing world.\n\nITV racing commentator Matt Chapman wrote in a post on X: \"Impossible to comprehend the pain. Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal - racing loves you.\"\n\nThe Amateur Jockeys Association of Great Britain and Beverley Racecourse were among others sending their sympathies.\n\nArmed police have searched an address in Rendlesham Road, Enfield, as the manhunt for Kyle Clifford continues.\n\nThe house, close to Gordon Hill railway station, was swarmed by officers on Wednesday morning, according to neighbours.\n\nTwo officers stood guard outside the property at 1.30pm, after a cordon was removed.\n\nOne neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said: \"They kept going in and out of the property carrying guns, the whole road was taped off.\n\n\"It was over quite quickly but there's been helicopters flying around the area all day.\n\n\"I don't recognise the suspect at all, as far as I'm concerned he didn't live in the house.\"\n\nAnother Rendlesham Road resident said: \"It was quite the shock seeing all the guns and dogs, the road went from quiet to manic out of nowhere.\n\n\"They were shouting 'armed police' and pointing their guns so it was clearly quite a serious matter.\n\nSt Michael's Primary School in Enfield is reportedly under lockdown as police search for a suspected crossbow killer.\n\nPupils at the school are being kept inside as the hunt for Kyle Clifford continues, according to its headteacher.\n\nPolice are said to have carried out \"a reassurance visit\", according to Sky News.\n\nTwo helicopters have been seen circling the Hilly Fields Park near Enfield opposite Clifford's home.\n\nA \"co-ordinated search\" is reportedly taking place and a car of possible interest has been found.\n\nOliver Dowden, the Member of Parliament for Hertsmere, has said he is\"deeply concerned\" about the triple murder in Bushey.\n\nPosting on X, formerly Twitter, he said:\n\nJonathan Ash-Edwards, Hertfordshire police and crime commissioner, said: \"My thoughts are with the family and friends of the women who have been shockingly killed in this terrible incident in Bushey.\n\n\"It will no doubt send shockwaves through the local community and across Hertfordshire.\n\n\"I am being kept updated by the police and I urge the public to support the police with any information about the whereabouts of the named suspect.\"\n\nThe wife of BBC 5 Live racing commentator John Hunt, who was the victim of a crossbow attack, has been pictured.\n\nShe and her two daughters were found dead in their family home in Bushey on Tuesday.\n\nMr Hunt is thought to have raised the alarm at around 7pm upon returning to the property on Ashlyn Close.\n\nPolice gave an update on the search for a suspected triple murderer who is thought to be in possession of a crossbow.\n\nJon Simpson, Chief Superintendent, of Hertfordshire Police, spoke at a press conference shortly after 12.30pm on Wednesday.\n\nHe revealed the ages of the victims and made a personal plea to Kyle Clifford to hand himself in.\n\nThe wife and two daughters of the BBC Five Live racing commentator John Hunt are thought to be the victims of the triple crossbow murder in Bushey.\n\nEmergency Services were called to the Hunt family home on Tuesday evening following reports that three women had been found with serious injuries.\n\nIt is believed Mr Hunt, who is married with three daughters, had been working for the BBC racing on Tuesday and may have raised the alarm when he returned to the home in Hertfordshire at around 7pm.\n\nThe three women died at the scene shortly after paramedics arrived.\n\nHertfordshire Police has issued an urgent appeal for Clifford, 26, from the Enfield area who is wanted in connection with the incident.\n\nMr Hunt, 58, who is a former police officer, has worked for BBC Radio Five Live for the last 20-years.\n\nJon Simpson, Chief Superintendent, addressed Clifford personally in the press conference.\n\nHe said: \"Kyle, if you're seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nKyle Clifford is believed to be carrying a crossbow but other weapons may also have been used, police said.\n\nJon Simpson, Chief Superintendent, said: \"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been an horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nManhunt involves armed police officers and specialist search teams who are responding \"at pace\" to the \"horrific incident\", Jon Simpson, Chief Superintendent said.\n\nHe said: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident.\n\n\"We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area.\n\n\"The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nJon Simpson, Chief Superintendent, said the victims of the Bushey murders were aged 25, 28 and 61-years-old.\n\nA press conference is set to start following the triple murder in Bushey.\n\nJon Simpson, Chief Superintendent of Hertfordshire Police is set to speak.\n\nLocal councillor Lawrence Brass, who lives close by the scene in Bushey, said: \"I didn't know them personally but I knocked on their door, I was canvassing a few days ago for the General Election.\n\n\"I'm sure that their friends will be comforting the remains of the family that are left. These are all my representatives, I know them all.\n\n\"At 7pm last night a helicopter landed on the lawn in the development I live in which is 100 yards away from here, but it was an air ambulance, I'm told, and then rumours started circulating about a crossbow.\n\n\"The worst thing that's ever happened in this part of Bushey is a bit of illegal flytipping and then suddenly we get three murders and we're all a bit shellshocked.\n\n\"This is a very traditional, quiet, leafy suburb, we don't get this sort of thing in this area and I want residents to know that the council will be ensuring that the liaison team is down here and doing everything they can to comfort them and make sure that they are reassured that everything is being done.\n\n\"But we're worried that this guy is still floating around somewhere.\"\n\nA resident of Ashlyn Close in Bushey where police are investigating the murders of three women said they heard screaming on Tuesday evening as the \"absolutely traumatic\" incident unfolded.\n\nThe 46-year-old, who did not wish to share their name but works in the media, told the PA news agency: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody, screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like, 'that's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n\"We had armed police running down, screaming 'stay in your house'.... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\"\n\nThe resident said multiple ambulances, helicopters and \"at least 16 police cars\" arrived at the scene quickly, with armed police going from house to house to question locals, request doorbell camera footage and tell them to stay indoors.\n\nThe woman said she was upset and stressed to know a man sought in connection with the triple murder is still at large, adding: \"It's really, really stressful now to think that that happened in such a close vicinity and none of us were aware and none of us could help.\n\n\"It's just absolutely traumatic, I think, for the family involved, for everyone.\n\n\"I think that's the stressful thing, that it happened at peak family time between 6pm and 7pm, when people were probably cooking for their kids and getting their kids ready for bed, and all of us in a tight little road, completely unaware of the trauma and tragic circumstances that other people were going through at that particular time.\"\n\nPolice are expected to hold a press conference at 12.30pm.\n\nWe'll be bringing you live updates and a stream of the conference.\n\nThe Home Secretary is being kept \"fully updated\" on the killings of the three women who were found in Bushey, Hertfordshire, and has urged anyone with information about the case to contact police.\n\nYvette Cooper said in a post on X, formerly Twitter: \"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family & friends of those who have been killed & with the community.\n\n\"I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support [Hertfordshire Police] with any information about this case.\"\n\nAerial footage of the scene show a blue and white forensic tent in the front garden of one of the homes in the cul de sac, with a police officer on guard and several police vehicles parked nearby.\n\nLocal councillor Laurence Brass, who lives nearby, said the area is \"a typical leafy British suburb\".\n\nHe told the BBC: \"At about eight o'clock last night, I was watching the football on television, and suddenly a helicopter landed in the lawn outside my flat, which is at the top of this road, and then my phone started going, and I was told that there was a major incident here in Bushey and we should all keep away because there was somebody apparently on the run.\n\n\"This is not something that happens in Bushey.\n\n\"We can't remember a murder in our rather quiet neck of the woods, so [it's a] terrible shock and our sympathies and prayers and thoughts are with the families of the three women.\n\n\"That really is a terrible thing to happen to anybody, and I've gathered they're all from the same family, which obviously makes it even more tragic, and we'll do everything we can as the local council to add our source of comfort where we can.\"\n\nSarah Fernandez, 52, arrived back home just after 7.30pm to find Ashlyn Close swarming with armed police.\n\nShe said: \" I was the last car allowed into the street before the police closed off access. There were about 15 armed police vehicles parked up. It's really frightening. We've never had anything like this before here.\"\n\nAerial footage of Ashlyn Close in Bushey where three women died on Tuesday.\n\nPolice officers have been pictured at the scene of the crime with a cordon in place on Ashlyn Close.\n\nResidents are \"deeply shocked\" after three women were found dead at a home in Bushey.\n\nRiaz Hussein, a telecoms specialist in his late 50s, told The Telegraph: \"It's absolutely terrifying. Everyone around here is deeply shocked.\n\n\"This is a lovely friendly street where everyone gets on. Lots of professionals live here and we all get on very well. I'm stunned at what's happened.\"\n\nMr Hussein added: \"I don't recognise the man wanted in connection with this from the picture police have released. I've not noticed him around here before.\"\n\nCounty Councillor Laurence Brass echoed the dismay felt by local residents.\n\n\"It's a shock for everyone on the street,\" he said. \"The worst thing that usually happens around here is fly tipping and now we've got three people dead. Utterly shocking.\"\n\nPolice are searching for Kyle Clifford in Enfield, north London, where he lives and Bushey, Hertfordshire, where the three women were found seriously injured and later died.\n\nAn East of England Ambulance Service spokesperson said: \"We were called around 7pm on Tuesday July 9 to a property in Ashlyn Close in Bushey.\n\n\"Three ambulances, a rapid response vehicle, an ambulance officer vehicle, the Hazardous Area Response Team, the Essex and Herts Air Ambulance and London Air Ambulance were sent to the scene.\n\n\"Sadly, despite the team's best efforts, three women were pronounced dead at the scene.\"\n\nA neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she did not know the victims well but they were a friendly family.\n\n\"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said.\n\n\"It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nLocal councillors have paid tribute to the three women, adding they are \"deeply shocked and saddened\" by the incident.\n\nThey called the deaths \"tragic\" and extended their condolences to those affected.\n\nLouise Nicolas, Alan Matthews and Paul Richards, who are local councillors for the area, said: \"We are deeply shocked and saddened by the tragic news that three women have lost their lives in a violent incident which took place in the heart of our local community.\n\n\"As North Bushey councillors, we extend our thoughts and condolences to their families and all those affected.\n\n\"We would encourage anyone who has information relevant to the inquiry to contact police.\"\n\nPolice were called to a property in Ashlyn Close at around 7pm on Tuesday.\n\nOfficers attended the scene alongside the East of England Ambulance Service.\n\nOfficers from Enfield Metropolitan Police are appealing for witnesses following a suspected triple murder.\n\nLocal residents reported a \"huge police presence\" in Bushey overnight and into the morning, with a force helicopter seen in the grounds of the former American University.\n\nOne X user posted: \"It's on my road, Ashlyn Close - It's cordoned off. There were 11 police cars, an armed response unit, 4 ambulances and a fire engine.\n\n\"We're not allowed to park on our driveway and have had to park round the corner. Whatever happened, it's really bad and everyone is shaken up.\"\n\nAnother social media user, called Stu, added before details of the attacks emerged: \"Huge police presence in Bushey tonight, and a chopper at the old American University, hope it's nothing too serious.\"\n\nA helicopter has been photographed nearby Ashlyn Close following a suspected triple murder on Tuesday.\n\nRob Hall Detective Superintendent from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: \"This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\n\n\"Whilst we are still in the early stages of this investigation, we are actively seeking Kyle Clifford who we believe could be in the areas of Hertfordshire or North London.\n\n\"Given the serious nature of the incident, I would ask anyone who knows where he is to contact police immediately. If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away. He may still be in possession of a weapon.\n\n\"Our enquires will continue over the coming days to ascertain the full circumstances of what happened but I would also like to take this opportunity appeal to anyone who was in the area around Ashlyn Close from around lunchtime on Tuesday until 7pm, and believes they may have seen anything that could assist the investigation, to contact us.\n\n\"This incident will of course be of concern to local residents. Officers from the Neighbourhood Policing Team will be in the area today so please do speak to them if you need to.\"\n\nOfficers have been searching overnight for Clifford, of Enfield, north London. Hertfordshire Police urged anyone with information to come forward and said the suspect is likely in Hertfordshire or north London.\n\nMembers of the public have been told not to approach Clifford.\n\nA neighbourhood policing team has been deployed in the local area to reassure residents.\n\nWe're bringing you the latest updates as police launch a manhunt after three women were found

He also made a direct appeal to Clifford to contact them.\n\nHunt is a BBC horseracing commentator who has worked for BBC Radio 5 Live for many years.\n\nFellow racing commentator Matt Chapman posted on X: \"No words needed for what has happened to Hunt and family today.

The women, aged 25, 28 and 61, are believed to have been related, he said.\n\nThe BBC identified the victims as Carol Hunt, wife of BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt, and two of their daughters.\n\n\"Extensive police resources\" -- including armed police, a relative rarity in largely-unarmed Britain -- have been deployed across the local county of Hertfordshire and adjacent north London, he added.\n\nEarlier police had urged the public to avoid approaching the suspect, warning that he may still be carrying the crossbow. They said other weapons may have been used in the killings which happened at 7 p.m. local time Tuesday (2 p.m. ET) in the small town of Bushey, northwest of London,\n\nThese types of incidents are rare and shocking in Britain, where the murder rate is more than six times lower than in the United States, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nThat's largely due to Britain's far stricter gun laws, although knife crime and stabbings have risen in recent years and become a hot-button issue in British politics.\n\nCrossbow killings are very uncommon, with fewer than 10 in the U.K. between 2011 and 2021, the government says. There are no laws on who can buy or own one so long as they are aged 18 or over. But anyone carrying one of these weapons in public without a reasonable excuse can face four years in jail.\n\nIn February, the government said it was exploring toughening those restrictions, citing an incident on Christmas Day 2021 when Jaswant Singh Chail, aged 19, arrived at Windsor Castle with a crossbow and planned to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nBritain's newly elected interior minister Yvette Cooper called this week's incident \"truly shocking\" and that she was being kept updated.\n\nOfficers were called to a suburban street lined with generous, detached houses to find three women with serious injuries, police said in a statement. Despite efforts by paramedics to save the women, all three died at the scene.\n\n\"This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened,\" Det.

A defenceless mother and her two daughters tied up in their own home and shot dead with a 3ft-long crossbow in a bloody rampage.\n\nAround 6.30pm on Tuesday, neighbours of a \u00a3800,000 suburban home in a quiet cul-de-sac in Bushey, Hertfordshire, heard piercing screams which were initially mistaken for that of a distressed child.\n\nLater they were to realise that it was a woman's desperate cries for help coming from the home where Louise Hunt, 25, her sister Hannah, 28, and mother Carol, 61, were ambushed by a crossbow-wielding killer.\n\nSoon after the screams fell silent, the assailant fled the property, by which time the police had been alerted and were on their way.\n\nIt is believed that on finding his wife and daughters fatally wounded, officers were able to contact BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt, a voice known to millions, who was returning from working at Lingfield Park course.\n\nLouise Hunt, 25, (pictured) was the ex-girlfriend of suspect Kyle Clifford and was one of the three women found dead in the family home\n\nHannah Hunt, 28, and her mother Carol Hunt, 61, were also found dead in the family home\n\nBBC horse racing commentator John Hunt (pictured) is a voice known to millions\n\nAlthough police and ambulance had rushed to the house, they were unable to save the three victims who died at the scene.\n\nBut it wasn't long before detectives were on the trail of a suspect after a figure was seen darting out of an alleyway directly behind the murder scene. Clad in black, the man was captured on camera calmly striding away with what appeared to be a crossbow tucked under his arm hidden beneath a white sheet.\n\nFootage from a nearby doorcam showed the bearded figure carrying a heavy bag, which police feared may be a cache of weapons he used to carry out the brutal attack.\n\nChillingly, he passed within feet of a female neighbour, who stood alone on her driveway stroking a cat and seemed startled by the sight of the barely concealed weapon at 6.50pm.\n\nWithin hours, a national manhunt was under way for former soldier Kyle Clifford, who was named by police in a highly unusual step. The 26-year-old had previously served in the Queen's Dragoon Guards for a short time before dropping out having failed to impress superiors, it was said last night.\n\nYesterday neighbours revealed that Clifford had been in a relationship with the Hunts' youngest daughter, Louise, but she split up with him a week ago.\n\nTheir parting is said to have left her so shaken that she recently crashed her car into a telegraph pole outside the family home.\n\nHannah, 28, who worked nearby as a beautician, 'always had a smile'\n\nYesterday neighbours revealed that Clifford had been in a relationship with the Hunts' youngest daughter, Louise, but she split up with him a week ago\n\nA huge manhunt is underway to find suspect Kyle Clifford, 26, who is the ex-boyfriend of John's daughter Louise\n\nA police car is parked by Ashley Close in Bushey in the borough of Hertfordshire, north of London\n\nNeighbour Glyn Nicholas, 77, said: 'Louise was a very nice girl. She ran a dog grooming business from the house. I heard that she split from a boyfriend last week and was very upset about it.\n\n'A friend of Louise's told me that her car door had caved in because of the crash.'\n\nHe added: 'Carol was a nice, polite and quiet lady. She was at home a lot of the time.\n\n'They were all very nice, a private family. They all did their own things. Louise started a business a couple of years ago, and it was a thriving business - we all took our dogs there to be groomed.\n\n'A very close-knit family and they used to love the street. They'd had a lot of work done on their house over the years.'\n\nMrs Hunt, a mother of three, had recently told friends at her local gym that her youngest daughter was involved in a 'messy break-up' with her boyfriend.\n\nOne suggested her daughter's relationship had turned nasty.\n\nA friend said: 'She said her daughter's split with her boyfriend was messy. Carol did not go into too much detail, but you could see she was concerned.'\n\nPolice yesterday warned the public not to approach the suspect, who was last seen driving off from the cul-de sac in a grey vehicle the previous evening.\n\nTheir parting is said to have left Louise so shaken that she recently crashed her car into a telegraph pole outside the family home\n\nThe man received medical assistance before being taken to Royal London Hospital\n\nKyle Clifford dropped out of the army weeks before he is alleged to have murder three people\n\nArmed police searching Lavender Hill cemetery in Enfield as the hunt for fugitive Kyle Clifford took a new turn\n\nOne neighbour said 'absolute chaos' broke out as armed police arrived. She said: 'It was between 6.30pm and 7pm and it sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like, 'That's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n'We had armed police running down, screaming, 'Stay in your house'... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.' Police searches predominantly focused yesterday on Hertfordshire and North London because the police did not believe their suspect had the time to get much further.\n\nPassengers arriving at London Victoria railway station during the morning rush hour, before news of the tragedy became public, found their exit slowed as they were unusually marshalled through the barriers, allowing ranks of police on the opposite side to scan the crowd, checking every face.\n\nLater, local schools were put into lockdown when armed police raided the suspect's home in Enfield, North London, some 14 miles from the crime scene.\n\nOne mother said: 'They had cordoned off the road and were ushering people away from the house they were going into. They had the full protective gear on, guns, shields and helmets - the kind you'd expect to see in riots.'\n\nDozens of officers from Scotland Yard and Hertfordshire Police flooded the area a short time later after finding Clifford's abandoned car. But within hours, the hunt had moved to a nearby cemetery just a few minutes' walk away. The former security guard was later found with self-inflicted injuries at Lavender Hill Cemetery just after 4.30pm after seemingly shooting himself with the crossbow.\n\nIn a burst of intense activity, armed police closed down the cemetery, as eyewitnesses saw paramedics running into the grounds.\n\nRae Cresswell, 26, a local who filmed the commotion, said: 'I saw about ten officers coming in. I was quite worried because they were armed and there were dogs with them.\n\n'I asked them if they wanted me to leave but they said it was fine to stay. They started checking the area so I left shortly after and came back to see all these vehicles.'\n\nAround 20 minutes later Clifford was stretchered from the scene and taken by ambulance to Royal London Hospital, where he was receiving medical treatment last night.\n\nPolice confirmed no shots had been fired by officers and nobody else was being sought.\n\nMr Hunt, himself a former police officer before he took up radio and became a much-loved personality on the horse racing circuit, was said to be inconsolable last night. In a note to staff, the BBC said: 'The news today about John Hunt's family is utterly devastating.\n\n'Our thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.'\n\nJulie Harrington, chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, said: 'The thoughts of everyone at the BHA are with John Hunt, his family and friends. It is impossible to comprehend the horror that has been inflicted upon them by this dreadful event.\n\n'John is a great friend to many in our sport and I am sure that in this time of unimaginable grief for him, the racing family will rally around as we have seen many times before when one of our number is faced with great trauma.'\n\nLast night neighbours and friends continued to lay flowers at the scene. One friend, Su Kehinde, 60, who lives nearby, said she would remember them as 'beautiful souls'. She said: 'They were the loveliest, gentlest family. They did not deserve this. They were beautiful souls.'\n\nHer daughter April, 32, said that Hannah, who worked nearby as a beautician, 'always had a smile'.\n\nShe added: 'She was hard-working, a hard grafter and really gentle.'\n\nSix years ago, Clifford's older brother was convicted of murder after a trial at the Old Bailey.\n\nBradley Clifford, a plumber, was 23 when he mowed down Soban Khan, 18, and Jahshua Francis, 19, on their moped after they struck his 'prized' Ford Mustang car with a bottle.\n\nBoth teenagers were flung from the moped by the impact, and Bradley Clifford beat Mr Khan as he lay on the ground injured.\n\nThe incident followed a row outside a bar in Enfield in which Clifford's car received superficial damage. He flew into a rage and pursued the pair in a 20-minute high speed chase before crashing into the moped.\n\nClifford was jailed for life and told to serve at least 23 years for the murder of Mr Khan and attempted GBH with intent on Mr Francis.", "source": {"uri": "expressdigest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "expressdigest.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crossbow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manhunt (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingfield_Park_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lingfield Park Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dragoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_pole", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utility pole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_London_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Royal London Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fugitive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_Hill_Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lavender Hill Cemetery"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 90}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.6392156862745098, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

No shots were fired when he was apprehended.\n\n\"This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened,\" Major Crime Unit Detective Inspector Justine Jenkins said.\n\n\"This investigation is moving at pace and formal identification of the victims is yet to take place. The premature naming of potential victims has caused great upset to the family when they should've been given the space to come to terms with their sudden loss.\"\n\nThe three women were killed in the attack around 7 p.m. local time Tuesday night in Bushey, a town north of London, spurring a manhunt. They have only been officially identified by their ages, 25, 28 and 61, but police described the incident as \"targeted.\"\n\nAccording to Sky News, those ages match the ages of Hunt's wife, Carol, and daughters Hannah and Louise.\n\nThe BBC reported Hunt's wife, Carol, and two daughters were slain, while a third daughter was not harmed.\n\nClifford was found at Lavender Hill Cemetery in Enfield and carried away in a stretcher, Sky News reported. Enfield is about 20 miles east of Bushey, where the murders occurred.\n\nPrior to locating Clifford, a large police presence descended on the area, including several officers in tactical gear carrying long guns.\n\nPolice had earlier warned the public to stay away from Clifford if they came into contact with him as the British Army vet was believed to still have the weapon used in the killings.\n\nCrossbows are legal in the U.K., albeit with strict stipulations for use and display. In the wake of the murders, the Home Office is now weighing whether tougher crossbow laws should be enacted, the BBC reported. The office had started considering new laws earlier this year in response to a spate of other crimes committed with crossbows.\n\n\"The home secretary will swiftly consider the findings to see if laws need to be tightened further,\" a spokesperson said Wednesday.\n\nJohn Hunt is a radio horse racing commentator for BBC Racing and for Sky Sports Racing.\n\n\"The news today about John Hunt's family is utterly devastating,\" the BBC said. \"Our thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.\"", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_matthews@nydailynews.com", "name": "David Matthews", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crossbow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inspector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_Hill_Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lavender Hill Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24192606420551.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Chief superintendent Jon Simpson described the event as \"a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nDuring the police search, a primary school in nearby Enfield kept children indoors.\n\nIn the UK, there is no licence required to own a crossbow, but carrying one in public without a reasonable excuse is illegal. Interior minister Yvette Cooper called the deaths \"truly shocking\" and said she was being kept updated on the investigation.\n\nA spokeswoman for Cooper's department said that legislation is \"under constant review\" and noted that a call for evidence was initiated earlier this year to consider whether additional controls on crossbows should be implemented.

Supt. Rob Hall, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, in a statement.\n\n\"If you believe you see him, please do not approach him and dial 999 straight away,\" he added, referring to the United Kingdom's emergency number. \"He may still be in possession of a weapon.\"\n\nThese types of incidents are rare and shocking in Britain, where the murder rate is more than six times lower than in the United States, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.\n\nThat's largely due to Britain's far stricter gun laws, although knife crime and stabbings have risen in recent years and become a hot-button issue in British politics.\n\nCrossbow killings are very uncommon, with fewer than 10 in the U.K. between 2011 and 2021, the government says. There are no laws on who can buy or own one so long as they are aged 18 or over. But anyone carrying one of these weapons in public without a reasonable excuse can face four years in jail.\n\nIn February, the government said it was exploring toughening those restrictions, citing an incident on Christmas Day 2021 when Jaswant Singh Chail, aged 19, arrived at Windsor Castle with a crossbow and planned to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nBritain's newly elected interior minister Yvette Cooper called this week's incident \"truly shocking\" and that she was being kept updated.\n\nThe triple murder happened at 7 p.m. local time Tuesday (2 p.m. ET) in the small town of Bushey, northwest of London, according to the Hertfordshire Constabulary, the local police force.\n\nOfficers were called to a suburban street lined with generous, detached houses to find three women with serious injuries, police said in a statement. Despite efforts to save the women, who are believed to be related, all three died at the scene, it said.\n\n\"This is an incredibly difficult incident for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened,\" Hall, the detective superintendent, said.\n\nPolice are now hunting for Clifford, who they say may be in north London or Hertfordshire, the county where the incident happened.\n\nThe Hertfordshire Constabulary confirmed to NBC News that the suspect was armed with a crossbow at the time of the incident, and that he may still have the weapon on him.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alexander_smith@aol.com", "name": "Alexander Smith", "type": "author",

Detectives said the 26-year-old was found with injuries and was receiving medical treatment after he was apprehended in the Enfield area of north London on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nBBC racing commentator John Hunt - husband of Carol and father to beautician Hannah and Louise, a dog groomer - has been left behind to grapple with the devastating loss of three family members, whose identities were confirmed by the broadcaster. He and Carol are understood to have a third daughter.\n\nShocked and distraught local residents paid tribute to the three victims as \"beautiful souls\" and told The Independent of often seeing the family out walking their dogs together in the local area.\n\nAmong them are Simon and Tracey Bowler, who described the Hunts as \"nice and friendly\" neighbours who would always wave and say \"hello\" as they walked their dogs past the Bowler family's house.\n\nFighting back tears, Ms Bowler, who has lived in Bushey for more than a decade and knows Mr Hunt through the local gym, spoke of how \"emotional\" and \"overwhelming\" it has been. Describing the area as \"quiet and residential\", Mr Bowler said: \"The neighbourhood hasn't stopped being a neighbourhood - it's just really sad.\"\n\nNeighbour Su Kehinde, 60, who laid flowers at a makeshift tribute in the area on Wednesday, said: \"They were the loveliest, gentlest family. They were the meekest human beings. They did not deserve this. They were beautiful souls.\"\n\nHer daughter April, 32, said that Hannah \"always had a smile\" and was \"hard-working, a hard grafter and really gentle\".\n\nA friend of Louise Hunt, who knew her from their time at school, praised her as \"really sweet, very kind, always a positive person\". He told BBC News: \"I can't think of anything bad to say about her - a really lovely person all round, a super hard-working person.\"\n\nDerek Turner, a neighbour on Ashlyn Close, described the three women's deaths as a \"tremendous tragedy\".\n\nAfter having lived in \"peaceful and quiet\" Bushey for more than 30 years, Mr Turner said the incident has sparked concern. \"We don't really have things like this happen round here,\" he said, describing the area as one with a tight-knit community, beloved by residents, many of whom have lived in the town for years. \"You can never imagine that would happen in your street,\" he said.\n\nAnother neighbour said she grew up with the Hunt family and played with Louise and Hannah when they were all children. Describing the family as \"super nice and friendly\", the 22-year-old woman, who did not want to be named, added that, more recently, she would see John and Carol out dog-walking. \"I feel so bad for the dad,\" said the family friend. \"I saw him just two weeks ago.\"\n\nFloral tributes were piling up by the Ashlyn Close road sign on Wednesday, as mourners arrived crying and holding hands before placing their bouquets and messages at the scene. One tribute addressed to the three women read: \"I wish none of this was real. I wish I could hug you all, and tell you how much you meant to me. I wish you could hug each other. Love you forever.\" Another message said: \"Words cannot express how devastated I am that you're gone. The most gentle beautiful family. Forever loved.\"\n\nPolice officers looked on from the edge of the cordon at the top of the victims' road, with one also seen leaving a flower tribute. Police cars and vans were parked along Ashlyn Close as the triple murder investigation continues.\n\nOfficers were called to the cul-de-sac just before 7pm on Tuesday after neighbours heard screams from the four-bedroom detached family home. The three women were found seriously injured and later pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nA man walking close to the scene with his two young children on Wednesday said: \"It's just devastating. It's shocking to hear in an area where you just want to raise your children and have a nice, happy life.\"\n\nDescribing Bushey as \"so peaceful and quiet\", another local resident said: \"It's just heartbreaking. It's frightening to have it at the doorstep.\"\n\nHertfordshire Constabulary hunted overnight for Clifford, from the Enfield area. Detectives had issued a direct plea to Clifford to contact police on Wednesday as they warned members of the public not to approach him and dial 999.\n\nArmed officers were seen raiding a flat in Enfield and swarming a cemetery, with a nearby primary school put on lockdown, before police confirmed he had been located that afternoon.

A defenceless mother and her two daughters tied up in their own home and shot dead with a 3ft-long crossbow in a bloody rampage.\n\nAround 6.30pm on Tuesday, neighbours of a \u00a3800,000 suburban home in a quiet cul-de-sac in Bushey, Hertfordshire, heard piercing screams which were initially mistaken for that of a distressed child.\n\nLater they were to realise that it was a woman's desperate cries for help coming from the home where Louise Hunt, 25, her sister Hannah, 28, and mother Carol, 61, were ambushed by a crossbow-wielding killer.\n\nSoon after the screams fell silent, the assailant fled the property, by which time the police had been alerted and were on their way.\n\nIt is believed that on finding his wife and daughters fatally wounded, officers were able to contact BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt, a voice known to millions, who was returning from working at Lingfield Park course.\n\nLouise Hunt, 25, (pictured) was the ex-girlfriend of suspect Kyle Clifford and was one of the three women found dead in the family home\n\nHannah Hunt, 28, and her mother Carol Hunt, 61, were also found dead in the family home\n\nBBC horse racing commentator John Hunt (pictured) is a voice known to millions\n\nAlthough police and ambulance had rushed to the house, they were unable to save the three victims who died at the scene.\n\nBut it wasn't long before detectives were on the trail of a suspect after a figure was seen darting out of an alleyway directly behind the murder scene. Clad in black, the man was captured on camera calmly striding away with what appeared to be a crossbow tucked under his arm hidden beneath a white sheet.\n\nFootage from a nearby doorcam showed the bearded figure carrying a heavy bag, which police feared may be a cache of weapons he used to carry out the brutal attack.\n\nChillingly, he passed within feet of a female neighbour, who stood alone on her driveway stroking a cat and seemed startled by the sight of the barely concealed weapon at 6.50pm.\n\nWithin hours, a national manhunt was under way for former soldier Kyle Clifford, who was named by police in a highly unusual step. The 26-year-old had previously served in the Queen's Dragoon Guards for a short time before dropping out having failed to impress superiors, it was said last night.\n\nYesterday neighbours revealed that Clifford had been in a relationship with the Hunts' youngest daughter, Louise, but she split up with him a week ago.\n\nTheir parting is said to have left her so shaken that she recently crashed her car into a telegraph pole outside the family home.\n\nHannah, 28, who worked nearby as a beautician, 'always had a smile'\n\nYesterday neighbours revealed that Clifford had been in a relationship with the Hunts' youngest daughter, Louise, but she split up with him a week ago\n\nA police car is parked by Ashley Close in Bushey in the borough of Hertfordshire, north of London\n\nNeighbour Glyn Nicholas, 77, said: 'Louise was a very nice girl. She ran a dog grooming business from the house. I heard that she split from a boyfriend last week and was very upset about it.\n\n'A friend of Louise's told me that her car door had caved in because of the crash.'\n\nHe added: 'Carol was a nice, polite and quiet lady. She was at home a lot of the time.\n\n'They were all very nice, a private family. They all did their own things. Louise started a business a couple of years ago, and it was a thriving business - we all took our dogs there to be groomed.\n\n'A very close-knit family and they used to love the street. They'd had a lot of work done on their house over the years.'\n\nMrs Hunt, a mother of three, had recently told friends at her local gym that her youngest daughter was involved in a 'messy break-up' with her boyfriend.\n\nOne suggested her daughter's relationship had turned nasty.\n\nA friend said: 'She said her daughter's split with her boyfriend was messy. Carol did not go into too much detail, but you could see she was concerned.'\n\nPolice yesterday warned the public not to approach the suspect, who was last seen driving off from the cul-de sac in a grey vehicle the previous evening.\n\nTheir parting is said to have left Louise so shaken that she recently crashed her car into a telegraph pole outside the family home\n\nOne neighbour said 'absolute chaos' broke out as armed police arrived. She said: 'It was between 6.30pm and 7pm and it sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like, 'That's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n'We had armed police running down, screaming, 'Stay in your house'... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.' Police searches predominantly focused yesterday on Hertfordshire and North London because the police did not believe their suspect had the time to get much further.\n\nPassengers arriving at London Victoria railway station during the morning rush hour, before news of the tragedy became public, found their exit slowed as they were unusually marshalled through the barriers, allowing ranks of police on the opposite side to scan the crowd, checking every face.\n\nLater, local schools were put into lockdown when armed police raided the suspect's home in Enfield, North London, some 14 miles from the crime scene.\n\nOne mother said: 'They had cordoned off the road and were ushering people away from the house they were going into. They had the full protective gear on, guns, shields and helmets - the kind you'd expect to see in riots.'\n\nDozens of officers from Scotland Yard and Hertfordshire Police flooded the area a short time later after finding Clifford's abandoned car. But within hours, the hunt had moved to a nearby cemetery just a few minutes' walk away. The former security guard was later found with self-inflicted injuries at Lavender Hill Cemetery just after 4.30pm after seemingly shooting himself with the crossbow.\n\nIn a burst of intense activity, armed police closed down the cemetery, as eyewitnesses saw paramedics running into the grounds.\n\nRae Cresswell, 26, a local who filmed the commotion, said: 'I saw about ten officers coming in. I was quite worried because they were armed and there were dogs with them.\n\n'I asked them if they wanted me to leave but they said it was fine to stay. They started checking the area so I left shortly after and came back to see all these vehicles.'\n\nAround 20 minutes later Clifford was stretchered from the scene and taken by ambulance to Royal London Hospital, where he was receiving medical treatment last night.\n\nPolice confirmed no shots had been fired by officers and nobody else was being sought.\n\nMr Hunt, himself a former police officer before he took up radio and became a much-loved personality on the horse racing circuit, was said to be inconsolable last night. In a note to staff, the BBC said: 'The news today about John Hunt's family is utterly devastating.\n\n'Our thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.'\n\nJulie Harrington, chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, said: 'The thoughts of everyone at the BHA are with John Hunt, his family and friends. It is impossible to comprehend the horror that has been inflicted upon them by this dreadful event.\n\n'John is a great friend to many in our sport and I am sure that in this time of unimaginable grief for him, the racing family will rally around as we have seen many times before when one of our number is faced with great trauma.'\n\nLast night neighbours and friends continued to lay flowers at the scene. One friend, Su Kehinde, 60, who lives nearby, said she would remember them as 'beautiful souls'. She said: 'They were the loveliest, gentlest family. They did not deserve this. They were beautiful souls.'\n\nHer daughter April, 32, said that Hannah, who worked nearby as a beautician, 'always had a smile'.\n\nShe added: 'She was hard-working, a hard grafter and really gentle.'\n\nSix years ago, Clifford's older brother was convicted of murder after a trial at the Old Bailey.\n\nBradley Clifford, a plumber, was 23 when he mowed down Soban Khan, 18, and Jahshua Francis, 19, on their moped after they struck his 'prized' Ford Mustang car with a bottle.\n\nBoth teenagers were flung from the moped by the impact, and Bradley Clifford beat Mr Khan as he lay on the ground injured.\n\nThe incident followed a row outside a bar in Enfield in which Clifford's car received superficial damage. He flew into a rage and pursued the pair in a 20-minute high speed chase before crashing into the moped.\n\nClifford was jailed for life and told to serve at least 23 years for the murder of Mr Khan and attempted GBH with intent on Mr Francis.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crossbow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingfield_Park_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lingfield Park Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhunt (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_pole", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utility pole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child grooming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borough", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borough"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cosmetology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_Hill_Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lavender Hill Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_London_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal London Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/10/21/87178743-0-image-m-30_1720644170839.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.6392156862745098, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

The woman said she was upset and stressed to know a man sought in connection with the triple murder is still at large, adding: \"It's really, really stressful now to think that that happened in such a close vicinity and none of us were aware and none of us could help.\n\n\"It's just absolutely traumatic, I think, for the family involved, for everyone.

He and Carol are understood to have a third daughter.\n\nShocked and distraught local residents paid tribute to the three victims as \"beautiful souls\" and told The Independent of often seeing the family out walking their dogs together in the local area.\n\nAmong them are Simon and Tracey Bowler, who described the Hunts as \"nice and friendly\" neighbours who would always wave and say \"hello\" as they walked their dogs past the Bowler family's house.\n\nFighting back tears, Ms Bowler, who has lived in Bushey for more than a decade and knows Mr Hunt through the local gym, spoke of how \"emotional\" and \"overwhelming\" it has been. Describing the area as \"quiet and residential\", Mr Bowler said: \"The neighbourhood hasn't stopped being a neighbourhood - it's just really sad.\"\n\nNeighbour Su Kehinde, 60, who laid flowers at a makeshift tribute in the area on Wednesday, said: \"They were the loveliest, gentlest family. They were the meekest human beings. They did not deserve this. They were beautiful souls.\"\n\nHer daughter April, 32, said that Hannah \"always had a smile\" and was \"hard-working, a hard grafter and really gentle\".\n\nA friend of Louise Hunt, who knew her from their time at school, praised her as \"really sweet, very kind, always a positive person\". He told BBC News: \"I can't think of anything bad to say about her - a really lovely person all round, a super hard-working person.\"\n\nDerek Turner, a neighbour on Ashlyn Close, described the three women's deaths as a \"tremendous tragedy\".\n\nAfter having lived in \"peaceful and quiet\" Bushey for more than 30 years, Mr Turner said the incident has sparked concern. \"We don't really have things like this happen round here,\" he said, describing the area as one with a tight-knit community, beloved by residents, many of whom have lived in the town for years. \"You can never imagine that would happen in your street,\" he said.\n\nAnother neighbour said she grew up with the Hunt family and played with Louise and Hannah when they were all children. Describing the family as \"super nice and friendly\", the 22-year-old woman, who did not want to be named, added that, more recently, she would see John and Carol out dog-walking. \"I feel so bad for the dad,\" said the family friend. \"I saw him just two weeks ago.\"\n\nFloral tributes were piling up by the Ashlyn Close road sign on Wednesday, as mourners arrived crying and holding hands before placing their bouquets and messages at the scene. One tribute addressed to the three women read: \"I wish none of this was real. I wish I could hug you all, and tell you how much you meant to me. I wish you could hug each other. Love you forever.\" Another message said: \"Words cannot express how devastated I am that you're gone. The most gentle beautiful family. Forever loved.\"\n\nPolice officers looked on from the edge of the cordon at the top of the victims' road, with one also seen leaving a flower tribute. Police cars and vans were parked along Ashlyn Close as the triple murder investigation continues.\n\nOfficers were called to the cul-de-sac just before 7pm on Tuesday after neighbours heard screams from the four-bedroom detached family home. The three women were found seriously injured and later pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nA man walking close to the scene with his two young children on Wednesday said: \"It's just devastating. It's shocking to hear in an area where you just want to raise your children and have a nice, happy life.\"\n\nDescribing Bushey as \"so peaceful and quiet\", another local resident said: \"It's just heartbreaking. It's frightening to have it at the doorstep.\"\n\nHertfordshire Constabulary hunted overnight for Clifford, from the Enfield area. Detectives had issued a direct plea to Clifford to contact police on Wednesday as they warned members of the public not to approach him and dial 999.\n\nArmed officers were seen raiding a flat in Enfield and swarming a cemetery, with a nearby primary school put on lockdown, before police confirmed he had been located that afternoon. The force said no shots were fired by police in the search for Clifford, who was feared to be armed with a crossbow.\n\nFootage captured by Sky News appeared to show him being stretchered out of Lavender Hill cemetery before being loaded into an ambulance.\n\nClifford, who is said to be known to the Hunt family, left the British Army in 2022 following a brief period of service, The Independent understands.\n\nA former army boss told The Sun that he was \"immature for his age and had a bit of a chip on his shoulder\", adding that he worked in private security after leaving the force.\n\nIn a note to Mr Hunt's colleagues at BBC 5 Live, the broadcaster offered its condolences and described the tragedy as \"utterly devastating\".", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_end_(street)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dead end (street)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

A defenceless mother and her two daughters tied up in their own home and shot dead with a 3ft-long crossbow in a bloody rampage.\n\nAround 6.30pm on Tuesday, neighbours of a \u00a3800,000 suburban home in a quiet cul-de-sac in Bushey, Hertfordshire, heard piercing screams which were initially mistaken for that of a distressed child.\n\nLater they were to realise that it was a woman's desperate cries for help coming from the home where Louise Hunt, 25, her sister Hannah, 28, and mother Carol, 61, were ambushed by a crossbow-wielding killer.\n\nSoon after the screams fell silent, the assailant fled the property, by which time the police had been alerted and were on their way.\n\nIt is believed that on finding his wife and daughters fatally wounded, officers were able to contact BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt, a voice known to millions, who was returning from working at Lingfield Park course.\n\nAlthough police and ambulance had rushed to the house, they were unable to save the three victims who died at the scene.\n\nBut it wasn't long before detectives were on the trail of a suspect after a figure was seen darting out of an alleyway directly behind the murder scene. Clad in black, the man was captured on camera calmly striding away with what appeared to be a crossbow tucked under his arm hidden beneath a white sheet.\n\nFootage from a nearby doorcam showed the bearded figure carrying a heavy bag, which police feared may be a cache of weapons he used to carry out the brutal attack.\n\nChillingly, he passed within feet of a female neighbour, who stood alone on her driveway stroking a cat and seemed startled by the sight of the barely concealed weapon at 6.50pm.\n\nWithin hours, a national manhunt was under way for former soldier Kyle Clifford, who was named by police in a highly unusual step. The 26-year-old had previously served in the Queen's Dragoon Guards for a short time before dropping out having failed to impress superiors, it was said last night.\n\nYesterday neighbours revealed that Clifford had been in a relationship with the Hunts' youngest daughter, Louise, but she split up with him a week ago.\n\nTheir parting is said to have left her so shaken that she recently crashed her car into a telegraph pole outside the family home.\n\nNeighbour Glyn Nicholas, 77, said: 'Louise was a very nice girl. She ran a dog grooming business from the house. I heard that she split from a boyfriend last week and was very upset about it.\n\n'A friend of Louise's told me that her car door had caved in because of the crash.'\n\nHe added: 'Carol was a nice, polite and quiet lady. She was at home a lot of the time.\n\n'They were all very nice, a private family. They all did their own things. Louise started a business a couple of years ago, and it was a thriving business - we all took our dogs there to be groomed.\n\n'A very close-knit family and they used to love the street. They'd had a lot of work done on their house over the years.'\n\nMrs Hunt, a mother of three, had recently told friends at her local gym that her youngest daughter was involved in a 'messy break-up' with her boyfriend.\n\nOne suggested her daughter's relationship had turned nasty.\n\nA friend said: 'She said her daughter's split with her boyfriend was messy. Carol did not go into too much detail, but you could see she was concerned.'\n\nPolice yesterday warned the public not to approach the suspect, who was last seen driving off from the cul-de sac in a grey vehicle the previous evening.\n\nOne neighbour said 'absolute chaos' broke out as armed police arrived. She said: 'It was between 6.30pm and 7pm and it sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like, 'That's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n'We had armed police running down, screaming, 'Stay in your house'... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.' Police searches predominantly focused yesterday on Hertfordshire and North London because the police did not believe their suspect had the time to get much further.\n\nPassengers arriving at London Victoria railway station during the morning rush hour, before news of the tragedy became public, found their exit slowed as they were unusually marshalled through the barriers, allowing ranks of police on the opposite side to scan the crowd, checking every face.\n\nLater, local schools were put into lockdown when armed police raided the suspect's home in Enfield, North London, some 14 miles from the crime scene.\n\nOne mother said: 'They had cordoned off the road and were ushering people away from the house they were going into. They had the full protective gear on, guns, shields and helmets - the kind you'd expect to see in riots.'\n\nDozens of officers from Scotland Yard and Hertfordshire Police flooded the area a short time later after finding Clifford's abandoned car. But within hours, the hunt had moved to a nearby cemetery just a few minutes' walk away. The former security guard was later found with self-inflicted injuries at Lavender Hill Cemetery just after 4.30pm after seemingly shooting himself with the crossbow.\n\nIn a burst of intense activity, armed police closed down the cemetery, as eyewitnesses saw paramedics running into the grounds.\n\nRae Cresswell, 26, a local who filmed the commotion, said: 'I saw about ten officers coming in. I was quite worried because they were armed and there were dogs with them.\n\n'I asked them if they wanted me to leave but they said it was fine to stay. They started checking the area so I left shortly after and came back to see all these vehicles.'\n\nAround 20 minutes later Clifford was stretchered from the scene and taken by ambulance to Royal London Hospital, where he was receiving medical treatment last night.\n\nPolice confirmed no shots had been fired by officers and nobody else was being sought.\n\nMr Hunt, himself a former police officer before he took up radio and became a much-loved personality on the horse racing circuit, was said to be inconsolable last night. In a note to staff, the BBC said: 'The news today about John Hunt's family is utterly devastating.\n\n'Our thoughts are with John and his family at this incredibly difficult time and we will provide him with all the support we can.'\n\nJulie Harrington, chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, said: 'The thoughts of everyone at the BHA are with John Hunt, his family and friends. It is impossible to comprehend the horror that has been inflicted upon them by this dreadful event.\n\n'John is a great friend to many in our sport and I am sure that in this time of unimaginable grief for him, the racing family will rally around as we have seen many times before when one of our number is faced with great trauma.'\n\nLast night neighbours and friends continued to lay flowers at the scene. One friend, Su Kehinde, 60, who lives nearby, said she would remember them as 'beautiful souls'. She said: 'They were the loveliest, gentlest family. They did not deserve this. They were beautiful souls.'\n\nHer daughter April, 32, said that Hannah, who worked nearby as a beautician, 'always had a smile'.\n\nShe added: 'She was hard-working, a hard grafter and really gentle.'\n\nSix years ago, Clifford's older brother was convicted of murder after a trial at the Old Bailey.\n\nBradley Clifford, a plumber, was 23 when he mowed down Soban Khan, 18, and Jahshua Francis, 19, on their moped after they struck his 'prized' Ford Mustang car with a bottle.\n\nBoth teenagers were flung from the moped by the impact, and Bradley Clifford beat Mr Khan as he lay on the ground injured.\n\nThe incident followed a row outside a bar in Enfield in which Clifford's car received superficial damage. He flew into a rage and pursued the pair in a 20-minute high speed chase before crashing into the moped.\n\nClifford was jailed for life and told to serve at least 23 years for the murder of Mr Khan and attempted GBH with intent on Mr Francis.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crossbow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingfield_Park_Racecourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lingfield Park Racecourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunt_(law_enforcement)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhunt (law enforcement)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horror fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yesterday_(TV_channel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yesterday (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Victoria_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London Victoria station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_grooming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Child grooming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_pole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Utility pole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rush hour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_Hill_Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lavender Hill Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_London_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal London Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Hunting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family_Resources_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Family Resources and Support", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-How-Bushey-crossbow-killer-Kyle-Clifford-terrorised.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.6, "wgt": 131, "relevance": 1}

Police have warned members of the public that Clifford, who is still at large, 'may be in possession of a crossbow' and other weapons.\n\nIn the weeks before the triple murder, which occurred yesterday evening (June 9), dog grooming business owner Louise had reportedly been dealing with the painful aftermath of a break-up.\n\nNeighbour Glyn Nicholas, 77, told the Mail Online that Louise had been left so distraught by the recent split that she ended up crashing her car in the week before her tragic death.\n\nGlyn said: \"Louise was a very nice girl. She ran a dog grooming business from the house. I heard that she split from a boyfriend last week and was very upset about it. So much so that she was driving home at some point last week and drove into a wooden telegraph pole not far from the house.\n\n\"Another dog groomer - who is a friend of Louise's - told me that her car door had caved in because of the crash. Who the boyfriend was, I don't know, I never saw him. I believe Hannah, Louise's sister, was also killed along with their mother Carol.\"\n\nThis comes as Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson calls upon Clifford to come forward, addressing him during during a press conference. Simpson said: \"Our overarching objective today is to protect public safety and to locate Kyle Clifford, who is wanted in connection with the murder of the three women in what we believe is a targeted incident.\n\n\"We have extensive police resources deployed to various locations in north London and also the Bushey area. The manhunt also involves armed police officers and specialist search teams responding at pace in the wake of what has been a horrific incident involving what is currently believed to be a crossbow, but other weapons may also have been used.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Kyle, if you are seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nCarol, Hannah, and Lousie were discovered in the early evening after police and ambulance vehicles - including two air ambulances - were called to their home before 7pm. The mother and daughters had suffered severe injuries but were alive at the time they were found. All three women died a short time later.\n\nIt's understood John has been working for the BBC racing that day, and may have raised the alarm after returning to the family home.\n\nDo you have a story to share?

The three women were fatally wounded by an assailant at a home in Bushey, Hertfordshire, with their killer believed to have fled the property soon after the attack on Tuesday evening.\n\nInvestigators identified Clifford as a suspect and after a several-hour-long manhunt on Wednesday, tracked him to the Lavender Hill Cemetery in Enfield. Armed officers rounded on the location, with the new footage showing them walking alongside paramedics before he was carted to a trauma centre for treatment.\n\nThe brief video, taken by Sky News cameras from a helicopter, shows the small group of emergency responders walking alongside a man, who can be seen lying on a stretcher. Three paramedics clad in orange hi-vis jumpsuits walk out in front, with police officers in black combat gear pass alongside, flanking them en route out of the cemetery.\n\nThe group is then seen trudging onto the tarmac, where they load the stretcher into the back of an ambulance. Police remained in the area as the vehicle drove off the cemetery property - which is reportedly near his home - and Clifford was taken to hospital.\n\nIt has been reported that the suspected murderer was taken to the Royal London Hospital, where he has remained since he was located yesterday.

We treated a man at the scene and took him to a major trauma centre.\" Additional pictures taken of the cemetery from above show the area where the 26-year-old was found, with debris seen scattered in a corner of the cemetery's surrounding greenery.\n\nPolice said Clifford was found with injuries that were not inflicted by officers, as \"no shots were fired\" when they located him in Enfield. Investigators are yet to issue an update on the suspected killer, but searches are continuing at a property in the Enfield area today, with police seen wearing gloves and facemasks outside a property in Rendlesham Road.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_doyle@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Liam Doyle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavender_Hill_Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lavender Hill Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trauma center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stretcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cemetery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cemetery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ambulance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emergency service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_London_Hospital", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal London Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Ambulance_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London Ambulance Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_medical_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Air medical services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glove", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33220661.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Kyle-Clifford-manhunt-latest-Armed-police-search-cemetery-after-crossbow-attack-kills-wife-and-two.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3960784313725491, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

found guilty of murdering Mr Khan and of attempted GBH with intent on Mr Francis.\n\nHe was jailed for life, and the judge told him he would have to serve at least 23 years before he would be eligible

There were about 15 armed police vehicles parked up. It's really frightening. We've never had anything like this before here.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning, police issued the name of a man they wanted to speak to in connection with the grisly discovery.\n\nOfficers said the man in question, Kyle Clifford, a 26-year-old former serviceman from Enfield, north London, was armed and dangerous.\n\nClifford was believed to be carrying a crossbow but officers said other weapons may also have been used.\n\nArmed police officers and specialist search teams were \"responding at pace\", police said.\n\nAt a press conference held at 12.30pm at Hertfordshire Police HQ in Hatfield, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson, addressed Clifford personally, urging him to hand himself in.\n\nAddressing the assembled TV cameras he said: \"Kyle, if you're seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nAs the police manhunt spread across Hertfordshire and north London, with officers focusing their searches on properties in Enfield, details began to emerge that threw a potentially troubling light on one of Louise Hunt's recent relationships.\n\nA near neighbour of the Hunts said Louise had been left so upset by a recent break-up with her boyfriend she had crashed her car into a telegraph pole outside the family home.\n\nHe suggested that Louise had been in a relationship with the man now wanted in connection with the murders of the three women and that the relationship had ended badly.\n\nIn a telling gesture, just days before the incident, Louise had shared a tweet in which the author praised \"women who leave\" for having the \"strength\" to choose themselves.\n\nIt stated: \"I admire women who leave. IDGAF if you left after the 1st time or the 12th time I admire that s---! IDGAF if ppl were calling you d\u00fcmb for 11 years but in the 12th year you decided you was done.\n\n\"It takes a lot of strength to break a tie. It takes a lot of self-love to choose yourself.\"\n\nNeighbour Glyn Nicholas, 77, said: \"Louise split up with her boyfriend a few days ago and she crashed her car into a telegraph pole because she was so upset coming home. She's a lovely, caring girl. She runs a dog grooming business in Bushey.\n\n\"Her sister Hannah and mother Carol are lovely as well. It's all so sad. Louise was a sweet, lovely girl. They all were. This is so sad for everyone,\" he said. \"And to think I only heard John's voice on the radio yesterday morning, commentating from Lingfield, a few hours before all this happened.\"\n\nLocal councillor Lawrence Brass, who lives close by the scene, echoed the shock felt by those living nearby. He said: \"The worst thing that's ever happened in this part of Bushey is a bit of illegal fly tipping and then suddenly we get three murders and we're all a bit shellshocked.\n\n\"This is a very traditional, quiet, leafy suburb, we don't get this sort of thing in this area and I want residents to know that the council will be ensuring that the liaison team is down here and doing everything they can to comfort them and make sure that they are reassured that everything is being done.\n\n\"But we're worried that this guy is still floating around somewhere.\"\n\nPolice were worried too - and as the hours ticked by it became increasingly clear that a peaceful suburb of Enfield was the focus of their manhunt.\n\nFootage emerged from earlier in the day of armed officers raiding a house close to Gordon Hill railway station, the last address of Clifford's older brother Bradley, who is currently serving a life sentence for murder.\n\nHelicopters buzzed overhead and larger and larger numbers of officers could be seen patrolling the streets.\n\nA \"coordinated search\" was being undertaken, police said, with a car of possible interest found.\n\nAt least one primary school, St Michael's, went into a form of lockdown, according to reports.\n\nAs the day wore on they appeared to be increasingly interested in the Hilly Fields Park area, a bucolic haven just to the north of the residential area popular with dog walkers.\n\nOfficers could be seen teaming up with the London Fire Brigade to use a drone to search the area.\n\nAll at once, the search for the former soldier seemed to narrow - activity was seen in and around Lavender Hill cemetery on the edge of the park.\n\nRae Cresswell, 26, a local resident who filmed police sweeping into the graveyard, said: \"I saw about 10 officers coming in, it was around 3pm I'd say.\n\n\"I was quite worried because they were armed and there were dogs with them.\"\n\nAbout an hour later, police abruptly started moving back the members of the public and press who had gathered near the cemetery.\n\nThen aerial footage emerged appearing to show a person being stretchered through the graveyard, accompanied by multiple armed officers.\n\nPolice announced that the suspect had been found alive but injured. No shots had been fired and police said he was receiving medical treatment. No one else is being sought in connection with the case.\n\nDetective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: \"This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\n\n\"This investigation is moving at pace and formal identification of the victims is yet to take place.\"\n\nShe added: \"We have had an overwhelming number of calls and would like to express our gratitude to the members of the public who have contacted us. We would still appeal for anyone with information or footage to please contact police directly and refrain from commenting on social media as this could affect the progress of the case.\n\n\"We have set up an information portal where people can submit any information, photos or video footage which they feel could assist us with our investigation.\n\n\"This incident will of course be of concern to local residents. Additional local officers will be in the area today so please do speak to them if you need to.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

He pursued the moped down a straight stretch of road at speed. Not to apprehend the two people on it, but to mow them down for daring to damage his prized vehicle.\n\n'As Soban Khan lay virtually motionless, totally defenceless and fatally injured, such was this defendant's rage that he went over to him and beat him.'\n\nPolice and paramedics rushed to the scene and found the two moped riders seriously hurt.\n\nVictim Louise Hunt is the ex-girlfriend of crossbow suspect Kyle Clifford\n\nHannah Hunt, sister of Louise and daughter of John, also died after being shot with a crossbow at the family's \u00a3800,000 home\n\nCarol Hunt, who was married to BBC horse racing commentator John Hunt (pictured together), was found fatally injured along with her two daughters at her home last night\n\nMr Khan was pronounced dead at 4.38am while Mr Francis 'miraculously survived' and was taken to hospital for treatment.\n\nThe incident began when Clifford got into a row with one of Mr Khan's friends in a dispute over his girlfriend.\n\nThe two men agreed to go to a car park for a fist fight, but as Clifford loitered in his Mustang his rival instead drove away from the scene.\n\nMr Jafferjee said Mr Khan then 'stupidly, and indeed criminally' smashed a bottle on the side of the car, provoking a 'rapid, brutal, and unrelenting' response from Clifford.\n\nIn an emotional impact statement Mr Khan's father Najam, said: 'Soban Khan was a very sensible, friendly and popular individual in both school and later in college.\n\n'We all had such high hopes for Soban for his life and what was proving to be a very promising future.\n\n'Soban's younger sister is still at school and comes home asking to see her big brother every day.\n\n'He was a great son and a great brother. Unfortunately with boundless pain we will never see him become anything more, not a husband, not a father and the successful man he wanted to be.'\n\nMr Khan's death was the 'end of a generation', his father said.\n\nA paramedic can be seen talking into his radio at the crime scene while a police officer stands guard at one of the houses\n\nPolice in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Hertfordshire, where three women, who police believe to be related, died last night\n\n'We will continue to grieve for the rest of our lives. His smile and words will never leave us.'\n\nJudge Sarah Munro KC said: 'In the early hours of 5 August last year having worked your way up into a rage at the words and actions of a group of teenagers you made a decision to drive your powerful Ford Mustang car into Jahshua Francis intending that he and his pillion passenger Soban Khan would be seriously injured.\n\n'Soban was a rising star with a promising future. As Mr Khan says no parent should have to bury their child.'\n\nThe court heard how, on July 31, Clifford sent a WhatsApp message to a 18-year-old woman in which he said: 'Your boyfriend say he is gonna go after my car! I'll put a f***ing knife down the c***'s throat.'\n\nThis showed how seriously he took any threats made to his vehicle, the judge said.\n\n'Six days after you sent that message your car was threatened,' she told him.\n\n'The two young teenagers who got onto the moped didn't know how enraged you were or what you were capable of. Your actions thereafter were a gross overreaction.\n\n'You were already in a violent temper and the actions by those teenagers on the moped turned you into a murderer.'\n\nClifford had become 'determined' that Mr Khan should die as he 'rained blows' upon him as he lay by a lamppost, the judge said.\n\nAfter attacking Mr Khan in an 'intense rage', Clifford had the presence of mind to lie to police about what happened, she said.\n\nBut the jury was shown 'compelling' CCTV footage and saw through his 'false defence', in which he claimed it was an accident.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Clifford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Clifford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crossbow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moped", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moped"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Mustang", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ford Mustang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scooter (motorcycle)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London Borough of Enfield"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "King's Counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bailey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Old Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North London"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fugitive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_conditioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Air conditioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_car", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports car"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_limit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speed limit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_light", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Street light"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/10/16/87156139-0-image-a-9_1720627026120.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 4572, "textEnd": 4580}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-05", "textStart": 708, "textEnd": 721}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 4978, "textEnd": 4985}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-05-", "textStart": 1359, "textEnd": 1367}], "sentiment": -0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Mr Hunt, 58, is said to have been working for the BBC at Lingfield Park race course on Tuesday when he returned home around 7pm to discover the three of them seriously injured.\n\nEmergency services, including two air ambulances, were sent to the property, and despite their best efforts to save the women, they all died at the scene. The mother and daughters were \"targeted\" and attacked with a crossbow and other weapons in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson of Hertfordshire Police has said.\n\nPolice are looking for 26-year-old Kyle Clifford, from Enfield, north London, in connection with the deaths, and have warned he is believed to be armed. It is believed that victim Louise was his ex-girlfriend. Directly appealing to the main suspect, Chief Sup Simpson said: \"Kyle if you are seeing or hearing this please make contact.\" Investigators believe he could also be in Hertfordshire or around his home in north London.\n\nA heartbreaking tribute to Louise on social media reads, according to MyLondon: \"No words can describe the loss I feel after today's horrific news. You were so loved and Scooby adored you...you built up an amazing business and were always so kind and gentle. May you RIP with your sister and mum xxx.\"\n\nThe youngest of the sisters, Louise, reportedly launched a dog grooming service during Covid lockdown named Groom and Glow - which was run out of the family home - while her sister Hannah owned a beauty business called Hannah Grace Aesthetics. One comment on Louise's business Instagram account was written by her supportive sister Hannah, who said: \"The best dog groomer ever.\"\n\nNeighbour Glyn Nicholas, 77, told the Daily Mail that he believed Louise had split from Clifford just a week prior and had crashed her car in a state of distress. \"I heard that she split from a boyfriend last week and was very upset about it. So much so that she was driving home at some point last week and drove into a wooden telegraph pole not far from the house,\" he said.\n\n\"Another dog groomer - who is a friend of Louise's - told me that her car door had caved in because of the crash.\"\n\nA neighbour, who didn't want to be named, said she didn't know the victims well but said they were a friendly family. \"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. \"It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nSpeaking about Louise, local resident William Nourallah told the Daily Mail: \"She was a gorgeous girl. She really was a young, hardworking girl. I met the mum once or twice because she opened the door for me. I met the father. She was happy every time I saw her. We would have a laugh and a joke. She was a beautiful young girl. It's a waste of a life.'\n\nJohn's wife Carol was the one who helped him get into journalism. Over two decades ago, she pointed out an advert in the evening Harrow Observer for a trainee broadcaster at Ladbrokes. According to The Telegraph, Carol's casual suggestion to apply for the job, paired with his interest in horseracing, led to his racing reporting.\n\nFormer police officer John was in Snaresbrook Crown Court on the Friday, and started at Ladbrokes on the Monday, a day before Royal Ascot, the publication reports. For the last 20 years, he has worked for BBC Radio 5 Live as a racing commentator and is beloved by fans and colleagues alike.\n\nSpeaking about Carol, another neighbour Glyn Nicholas, 77, described her as a 'quaint, a nice, polite and quiet lady' who was 'at home a lot of the time'.\n\nITV racing pundit Matt Chapman took to X, formerly known as Twitter, on Wednesday to share his condolences for his co-star. He wrote: \"No words needed for what has happened to @HuntyCaller and family today. Impossible to comprehend the pain. Just know we are all here for you John. We love you pal - racing loves you.\"\n\nAnother resident living near the family said they heard screams from the house located in the quiet cul de sac where three women died. The 46-year-old said: \"It was between 6.30pm and 7pm last night and it literally just sounded like kids, somebody screaming, and then it was more shrill and I was like, 'That's definitely a woman screaming', and within 15 minutes, it was absolute chaos.\n\n\"We had armed police running down, screaming 'Stay in your house'... they shut us off and basically put us into lockdown.\" They said multiple ambulances, helicopters and \"at least 16 police cars\" arrived at the scene quickly, with armed police going from house to house to question locals, request doorbell camera footage and tell them to stay indoors.", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nia_dalton@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Nia Dalton", "type": "author", "isAgency":

There were about 15 armed police vehicles parked up. It's really frightening. We've never had anything like this before here.\"\n\nOn Wednesday morning, police issued the name of a man they wanted to speak to in connection with the grisly discovery.\n\nOfficers said the man in question, Kyle Clifford, a 26-year-old former serviceman from Enfield, north London, was armed and dangerous.\n\nClifford was believed to be carrying a crossbow but officers said other weapons may also have been used.\n\nArmed police officers and specialist search teams were \"responding at pace\", police said.\n\nAt a press conference held at 12.30pm at Hertfordshire Police HQ in Hatfield, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson, addressed Clifford personally, urging him to hand himself in.\n\nAddressing the assembled TV cameras he said: \"Kyle, if you're seeing or hearing this, please make contact with the police.\"\n\nAs the police manhunt spread across Hertfordshire and north London, with officers focusing their searches on properties in Enfield, details began to emerge that threw a potentially troubling light on one of Louise Hunt's recent relationships.\n\nA near neighbour of the Hunts said Louise had been left so upset by a recent break-up with her boyfriend she had crashed her car into a telegraph pole outside the family home.\n\nHe suggested that Louise had been in a relationship with the man now wanted in connection with the murders of the three women and that the relationship had ended badly.\n\nIn a telling gesture, just days before the incident, Louise had shared a tweet in which the author praised \"women who leave\" for having the \"strength\" to choose themselves.\n\nIt stated: \"I admire women who leave. IDGAF if you left after the 1st time or the 12th time I admire that s---! IDGAF if ppl were calling you d\u00fcmb for 11 years but in the 12th year you decided you was done.\n\n\"It takes a lot of strength to break a tie. It takes a lot of self-love to choose yourself.\"\n\nNeighbour Glyn Nicholas, 77, said: \"Louise split up with her boyfriend a few days ago and she crashed her car into a telegraph pole because she was so upset coming home. She's a lovely, caring girl. She runs a dog grooming business in Bushey.\n\n\"Her sister Hannah and mother Carol are lovely as well. It's all so sad. Louise was a sweet, lovely girl. They all were. This is so sad for everyone,\" he said. \"And to think I only heard John's voice on the radio yesterday morning, commentating from Lingfield, a few hours before all this happened.\"\n\nLocal councillor Lawrence Brass, who lives close by the scene, echoed the shock felt by those living nearby. He said: \"The worst thing that's ever happened in this part of Bushey is a bit of illegal fly tipping and then suddenly we get three murders and we're all a bit shellshocked.\n\n\"This is a very traditional, quiet, leafy suburb, we don't get this sort of thing in this area and I want residents to know that the council will be ensuring that the liaison team is down here and doing everything they can to comfort them and make sure that they are reassured that everything is being done.\n\n\"But we're worried that this guy is still floating around somewhere.\"\n\nPolice were worried too - and as the hours ticked by it became increasingly clear that a peaceful suburb of Enfield was the focus of their manhunt.\n\nFootage emerged from earlier in the day of armed officers raiding a house close to Gordon Hill railway station, the last address of Clifford's older brother Bradley, who is currently serving a life sentence for murder.\n\nHelicopters buzzed overhead and larger and larger numbers of officers could be seen patrolling the streets.\n\nA \"coordinated search\" was being undertaken, police said, with a car of possible interest found.\n\nAt least one primary school, St Michael's, went into a form of lockdown, according to reports.\n\nAs the day wore on they appeared to be increasingly interested in the Hilly Fields Park area, a bucolic haven just to the north of the residential area popular with dog walkers.\n\nOfficers could be seen teaming up with the London Fire Brigade to use a drone to search the area.\n\nAll at once, the search for the former soldier seemed to narrow - activity was seen in and around Lavender Hill cemetery on the edge of the park.\n\nRae Cresswell, 26, a local resident who filmed police sweeping into the graveyard, said: \"I saw about 10 officers coming in, it was around 3pm I'd say.\n\n\"I was quite worried because they were armed and there were dogs with them.\"\n\nAbout an hour later, police abruptly started moving back the members of the public and press who had gathered near the cemetery.\n\nThen aerial footage emerged appearing to show a person being stretchered through the graveyard, accompanied by multiple armed officers.\n\nPolice announced that the suspect had been found alive but injured. No shots had been fired and police said he was receiving medical treatment. No one else is being sought in connection with the case.\n\nDetective Inspector Justine Jenkins from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit said: \"This continues to be an incredibly difficult time for the victims' family and we would ask that their privacy is respected as they come to terms with what has happened.\n\n\"This investigation is moving at pace and formal identification of the victims is yet to take place.\"\n\nShe added: \"We have had an overwhelming number of calls and would like to express our gratitude to the members of the public who have contacted us. We would still appeal for anyone with information or footage to please contact police directly and refrain from commenting on social media as this could affect the progress of the case.\n\n\"We have set up an information portal where people can submit any information, photos or video footage which they feel could assist us with our investigation.\n\n\"This incident will of course be of concern to local residents. Additional local officers will be in the area today so please do speak to them if you need to.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

People have also been warned not to approach the crossbow-wielding suspect while he is at large, as police attend the scene of the killings on a \"serene, quiet\" road.\n\nAs police investigate, Labour's newly minted Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has spoken out on Twitter, stating that she is being kept updated on the situation as it progresses. In a Tweet, she said that her thoughts were with the family and friends of the victims, and urged people to support investigating police.\n\nShe wrote: \"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been killed and with the community. I am being kept fully updated. I urge people to support [Hertfordshire Police] with any information about this case.\"\n\nAre crossbows illegal in the UK?\n\nLabour's Conservative predecessors were responsible for updating guidance on crossbow possession in the UK. While it is acknowledged as a weapon, the item is not severely restricted in the same way as other tools, like guns, that can shoot projectiles.\n\nIn a note issued under then-Home Secretary James Cleverly in February this year, the Home Office specified that adults over the age of 18 can legally own crossbows. Even if people meet the age requirements, the guidance adds that they cannot carry the weapon \"without reasonable excuse\", with penalties including prison terms of up to four years.\n\nAre crossbows allowed for hunting?\n\nHunting any live quarry in the UK with either a bow and arrow, or crossbow and arrow is illegal under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Section 5(1)(c)(i) for wild birds and s 11(1)(b) for wild animals. However, no licence or registration is required to own a crossbow in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhat has the government said about the use of crossbows?\n\nAt the time, the government said it was \"considering going further\" and had launched a call for evidence to ask whether the rules are \"tough enough\". Officials proposed that strengthened laws could eventually reflect those in place for guns, including a \"licensing scheme to protect public safety police checks for anyone looking to purchase a crossbow\".\n\nLaura Farris, the government's then Safeguarding Minister, said that, while crossbows are \"used rarely\" in violent crime, they \"can be highly dangerous\". She said: \"Crossbows are used rarely in violent crime in this country but they can be highly dangerous.\"\n\n\"We're doing all we can to ensure we have the appropriate measures in place against any risks these potentially dangerous weapons may pose. I encourage the public and those in the industry to come forward to share their views so we can have the most accurate picture and take any necessary action to keep our streets safe.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "liam_doyle@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Liam Doyle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertfordshire_Constabulary", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hertfordshire Constabulary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Crossbow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bushey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bushey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enfield_North_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enfield North (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvette_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yvette Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cleverly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Cleverly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Farris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Laura Farris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife_and_Countryside_Act_1981", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_and_arrow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bow and arrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shootout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shootout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33210216.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_MAIN-crossbow.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720580", "eventUri": "eng-9720580", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Mr Hunt, 58, is said to have been working for the BBC at Lingfield Park race course on Tuesday when he returned home around 7pm to discover the three of them seriously injured.\n\nEmergency services, including two air ambulances, were sent to the property, and despite their best efforts to save the women, they all died at the scene. The mother and daughters were \"targeted\" and attacked with a crossbow and other weapons in Ashlyn Close, Bushey, Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson of Hertfordshire Police has said.\n\nREAD MORE:BBC issue heartbreaking statement after colleague's wife and daughters found dead at home\n\nREAD MORE: 'Crossbow-armed suspect' wanted after murder of 'BBC star's wife and daughters'\n\nPolice are looking for 26-year-old Kyle Clifford, from Enfield, north London, in connection with the deaths, and have warned he is believed to be armed. It is believed that victim Louise was his ex-girlfriend. Directly appealing to the main suspect, Chief Sup Simpson said: \"Kyle if you are seeing or hearing this please make contact.\" Investigators believe he could also be in Hertfordshire or around his home in north London.\n\nA heartbreaking tribute to Louise on social media reads, according to MyLondon: \"No words can describe the loss I feel after today's horrific news. You were so loved and Scooby adored you...you built up an amazing business and were always so kind and gentle. May you RIP with your sister and mum xxx.\"\n\nThe youngest of the sisters, Louise, reportedly launched a dog grooming service during Covid lockdown named Groom and Glow - which was run out of the family home - while her sister Hannah owned a beauty business called Hannah Grace Aesthetics. One comment on Louise's business Instagram account was written by her supportive sister Hannah, who said: \"The best dog groomer ever.\"\n\nNeighbour Glyn Nicholas, 77, told the Daily Mail that he believed Louise had split from Clifford just a week prior and had crashed her car in a state of distress. \"I heard that she split from a boyfriend last week and was very upset about it. So much so that she was driving home at some point last week and drove into a wooden telegraph pole not far from the house,\" he said.\n\n\"Another dog groomer - who is a friend of Louise's - told me that her car door had caved in because of the crash.\"\n\nA neighbour, who didn't want to be named, said she didn't know the victims well but said they were a friendly family. \"We would see them every day passing by and they would say good morning,\" she said. \"It's really sad what's happened, very shocking.\"\n\nSpeaking about Louise, local resident William Nourallah told the Daily Mail: \"She was a gorgeous girl. She really was a young, hardworking girl. I met the mum once or twice because she opened the door for me. I met the father. She was happy every time I saw her. We would have a laugh and a joke. She was a beautiful young girl. It's a waste of a life.'\n\nJohn's wife Carol was the one who helped him get into journalism. Over two decades ago, she pointed out an advert in the evening Harrow Observer for a trainee broadcaster at Ladbrokes. According to The Telegraph, Carol's casual suggestion to apply for the job, paired with his interest in horseracing, led to his racing reporting.\n\nFormer police officer John was in Snaresbrook Crown Court on the Friday, and started at Ladbrokes on the Monday, a day before Royal Ascot, the publication reports. For the last 20 years, he has worked for BBC Radio 5 Live as a racing commentator and is beloved by fans and colleagues alike.\n\nSpeaking about Carol, another neighbour Glyn Nicholas, 77, described her as a 'quaint, a nice, polite and quiet lady' who was 'at home a lot of the time'.\n\nJoin the Irish Mirror's breaking news service on WhatsApp. Click this link to receive breaking news and the latest headlines direct to your phone.

The women were killed at the family's home in Bushey, a leafy London suburb.\n\nMr. Hunt is a well-known racing commentator on the BBC and Sky Sports. He was working at the Lingfield Park Racecourse in Surrey on Tuesday.\n\nA manhunt covering much of north London has been under way since Tuesday night and police are looking for 26-year-old Kyle Clifford who lives in nearby Enfield. He is believed to have been the ex-boyfriend of Louise.\n\nChief Superintendent Jon Simpson described the attack as a \"horrific incident\" and he confirmed that it involved a crossbow and possibly other weapons.\n\n\"Kyle, if you are hearing or seeing this, please make contact with police,\" Ch. Supt. Simpson said in a direct appeal to Mr. Clifford on Wednesday.\n\nEnfield council said that there was no perceived threat to the public and that residents should carry on as normal. \"There will be an enhanced police presence in the area and around some schools to provide reassurance to pupils and parents,\" the council said in a statement.\n\nThe case has raised questions about the easy access to crossbows in the U.K.\n\nThere are no restrictions on the purchase of crossbows by adults and owners don't have to register the weapons with police. Crossbows can be bought online for as little as \u00a350 pounds, with the only requirement that the buyer prove they are over 18.\n\nThere have been calls for tighter regulations ever since the death of Shane Gilmer in 2021.\n\nMr. Gilmer, 30, was killed after he was shot with a crossbow by his neighbour Anthony Lawrence in North Yorkshire. Mr. Gilmer's partner, Laura Sugden, was also shot but she survived along with their unborn child.\n\nPaul Marks, the coroner who oversaw an inquest into Mr. Gilmer's death, said in his report to the Home Secretary \"that there was a risk that future deaths would occur because the possession of crossbows was not recorded, unlike the use and possession of shotguns and other firearms.\"\n\nMr. Marks called on the government to introduce tougher regulations on crossbows.\n\nAt the time, Home Secretary Priti Patel said that while the misuse of crossbows was tragic, \"these incidents are fortunately very rare.\" She added that existing laws were sufficient to cover any crimes committed with crossbows.\n\nThe Labour government, which took office last week, has vowed to tighten the laws governing crossbows.\n\n\"The loss of three women's lives in Bushey last night is truly shocking. My thoughts are with the family and friends of those who have been killed and with the community,\" the new Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said on X.\n\nA spokesperson for the department added that Ms. Cooper would be considering possible changes to the regulations as soon as possible.\n\nMr. Hunt has worked at the BBC and Sky for 20 years, covering mainly horse racing but also the Olympics and soccer. \"The news today about John Hunt's family is utterly devastating,\" the BBC said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nSky Sports said: \"Everyone at Sky Sports Racing is deeply saddened by the tragic deaths in Hertfordshire and our thoughts are with our colleague John Hunt, his family and friends at this awful time.\"\n\nBBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght said he was speechless at the news.\n\n\"Like everyone else I feel numb and sick on John's behalf at such incomprehensible evil,\" Mr. Lysaght said in a statement. \"Everyone who knows John knows he is the absolute archetypal family man, so proud of them, so it's impossible to know what he can be going through.", "source": {"uri": "theglobeandmail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Globe and Mail"}, "authors": [],

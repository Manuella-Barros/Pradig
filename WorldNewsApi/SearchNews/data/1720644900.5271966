The T employees discovered a rabbit nest near a Blue Line rail yard on Tuesday and pulled about eight baby bunnies to safety, according to a WBUR report. The bunnies were relocated to a safer area away from the stretch of T tracks. The agency shared a photo of one of the bunnies nestled in the hands of a T worker. \u201cEvery life is precious, and we\u2019re glad they were able to act quickly,\u201d the T told WBUR. The rabbit rescue comes a week after T workers relocated a turtle found on the Green Line D branch tracks at Chestnut Hill. In March, T workers helped a baby duck that was seen on the Green Line tracks between North Station and Science Park. The turtle and duck rescues both caused minor delays of between 10 and 15 minutes, the T said.", "summary": "<p>MBTA workers pulled the baby bunnies from harm\u2019s way on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/06/08/baby-bunnies-rescued-from-blue-line-tracks/\">Baby bunnies rescued from Blue Line tracks</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2024/06/08/baby-bunnies-rescued-from-blue-line-tracks/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/BDC_Logo_2020_256x256-60d0abc34135e.png", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:02:23", "author": "Rosemary Ford", "authors": ["Rosemary Ford"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.616}

He will continue to play ODIs and Tests.\n\n\"With a heart full of gratitude, I bid farewell to T20 internationals,\" Jadeja wrote underneath a picture of him holding the trophy.\n\n\"Like a steadfast horse galloping with pride, I've always given my best for my country and will continue to do so in other formats,\" added Jadeja, who has a deep passion for horse riding, often spending time riding his mounts, Kesar, Dhanraj and Ganga.\n\nBorn on December 6, 1988, in Jamnagar, Gujarat, Jadeja, who is affectionately nicknamed \"Jaddu\" and \"Sir Jadeja\", carved a niche for himself in the slam-bang world of T20 cricket, after making his India debut against Sri Lanka in 2009 ahead of the T20 World Cup in the same year.\n\nBut his rise in the format came with the historic IPL triumph of Rajasthan Royals in 2008 when as a young all-rounder, he made significant contributions with both the bat and ball, while also pulling off some great fielding efforts throughout the tournament.\n\nIt also earned him the nickname \"Rockstar\" by his then franchise captain, the late captain Shane Warne.\n\nIn 2012, Jadeja was bought by Chennai Super Kings for approximately Rs 9.8 Crore, making him the most expensive player of the year's players' auction.\n\nJadeja went on to win three more IPL titles with CSK including earning the player of the match in 2023 after he hit a four off the last ball of the final against Gujarat Titans.\n\nFor India, Jadeja was an integral part of six T20 World Cup campaigns, tasting success in his final one. It was the side's second T20 World Cup trophy and first in 17 years.\n\n\"Winning the T20 World Cup was a dream come true, a pinnacle of my T20 International career. Thank you for the memories, the cheers, and the unwavering support. Jai hind,\" Jadeja said.\n\nOverall, Jadeja played 74 matches, scoring 515 runs and taking 54 wickets in his international career in the shortest format.\n\nHis unerring accuracy and subtle variations made him a formidable opponent for batters looking to score freely especially in the middle overs.\n\nThroughout his T20I career, Jadeja consistently delivered breakthroughs for his team in crucial moments, turning matches in India's favour with timely strikes.\n\nBeyond his bowling, Jadeja's fielding set him apart as one of the finest all-rounders of his generation renowned for his lightning fast reflexes and athletic prowess.\n\nHis exceptional catches, direct hits, and game-changing run-outs would be major part of his T20I legacy.\n\nHis all-round abilities were further showcased in the 2014 World T20, where his economical bowling (five wickets at an economy of 7.36) and crucial lower-order contributions helped India reach the final.\n\nThe retirement of Rohit, Kohli and Jadeja marks the end of an era in T20Is for India with BCCI President Roger Binny acknowledging that it would take at least two years from now for the side to settle down.

It was the side's second T20 World Cup trophy and first in 17 years.\n\n\"Winning the T20 World Cup was a dream come true, a pinnacle of my T20 International career. Thank you for the memories, the cheers, and the unwavering support. Jai hind,\" Jadeja said.\n\nOverall, Jajdeja played 74 matches, scoring 515 runs and taking 54 wickets in his international career in the shortest format.\n\nHis unerring accuracy and subtle variations made him a formidable opponent for batters looking to score freely especially in the middle overs.\n\nThroughout his T20I career, Jadeja consistently delivered breakthroughs for his team in crucial moments, turning matches in India's favour with timely strikes.\n\nBeyond his bowling, Jadeja's fielding set him apart as one of the finest all-rounders of his generation renowned for his lightning fast reflexes and athletic prowess.\n\nHis exceptional catches, direct hits, and game-changing run-outs would be major part of his T20I legacy.\n\nHis all-round abilities were further showcased in the 2014 World T20, where his economical bowling (five wickets at an economy of 7.36) and crucial lower-order contributions helped India reach the final.\n\nThe retirement of Roohit, Kohli and jadeja marks the end of an era in T20Is for India with BCCI President Roger Binny acknowledging that it would take at least two years from now for the side to settle down.

At the post-final press conference, Sharma, who is 37, declared that the game was his last in the T20 format, marking an end to his illustrious T20 career.\n\nSharma is the highest scorer in the format, with 4,231 runs in 159 matches for India, including five centuries. The victory was his second T20 World Cup win, following the inaugural tournament in 2007. Sharma, alongside Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan, has played in every T20 World Cup since its inception.\n\nRohit Sharma expressed his love for the format, recalling how he began his international career with T20s and achieved his dream of winning the World Cup. Despite Kohli's struggles during the tournament, he ended on a high note with a man-of-the-match performance in the final, scoring 76 off 59 balls. Sharma finished as the second-highest run-scorer in the tournament, amassing 257 runs with a strike rate of over 156, including pivotal half-centuries against Australia and England.\n\nRohit Sharma indicated he would continue to play in Test and One-Day Internationals for India. India's last significant tournament success was the ODI World Cup in 2011. Since then, they have faced several near misses, including the loss in the 50-over final on home soil in Ahmedabad to Australia and the World Test Championship final defeat to the same opponent at The Oval last summer.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ravindra Jadeja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shami", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shami"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Africa national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_World_Test_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC World Test Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakib_Al_Hasan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shakib Al Hasan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oval", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Oval"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111381886,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-1281788,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694600", "eventUri": "eng-9694600", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

With the ball, his best bowling performance was up against Scotland in the 2021 T20 World Cup where he picked up figures of 3/15 in Dubai.\n\nThe most notable feature about Jadeja has been his fielding. During a time when we had the likes of Suresh Raina and Yuvraj Singh, the all-rounder from Saurashtra managed to stand out even more with his ability to hit the target on multiple occasions across his career.\n\nWith the likes of Axar Patel and Hardik Pandya in the side as the designated all-rounders, Jadeja can safely hand over the reins to the pair as he will now look to focus on the ODI and Test

Prime Minister Narendra Modi praised his performances and wished him luck for the future.Prime Minister Narendra Modi today heaped praises on all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja who announced his retirement from T20 Internationals on Sunday.\n\n\"You have performed exceptionally as an all-rounder. Cricket lovers admire your stylish stroke play, spin and superb fielding,\" PM Modi said in a tweet.\n\nModi thanked Jadeja for 'the enthralling T20 performances over the years'. \"My best wishes for your endeavours ahead,\" he added.\n\nReplying to Modi's tweet, Jadeja said, \"Thanks a lot sir.\"\n\nEarlier today, Jadeja announced his retirement joining his illustrious teammates Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in bidding adieu to the format a day after winning the World Cup.\n\nBorn on December 6, 1988, in Jamnagar, Gujarat, Ravindra Jadeja, affectionately known as \"Jaddu\" and \"Sir Jadeja,\" made his mark in T20 cricket after debuting for India against Sri Lanka in 2009. Jadeja's T20 journey rose to prominence with Rajasthan Royals' IPL triumph in 2008, and he later became a key player for Chennai Super Kings, achieving significant success, including a Player of the Match title in the 2023 IPL final.\n\nOver his career, Jadeja played 74 T20I matches, scoring 515 runs and taking 54 wickets, and was a crucial participant in India's T20 World Cup campaigns, achieving success with the team in his final tournament.\n\nJadeja's rise in T20 cricket began with Rajasthan Royals' IPL victory in 2008. As a young all-rounder, he made notable contributions with both bat and ball and impressed with his fielding efforts. His performances led to his then captain, the late Shane Warne, nicknaming him \"Rockstar.\"\n\nIn 2012, Chennai Super Kings acquired Jadeja for approximately Rs 9.8 Crore, making him the most expensive player of that year's auction. Throughout his tenure with CSK, Jadeja won three more IPL titles, culminating in a memorable 2023 final against Gujarat Titans, where he hit a four off the last ball to secure victory.\n\nFor India, Jadeja played an integral role in six T20 World Cup campaigns, with the team achieving success in his final tournament, securing their second T20 World Cup trophy and first in 17 years.\n\n\"Winning the T20 World Cup was a dream come true, a pinnacle of my T20 International career. Thank you for the memories, the cheers, and the unwavering support. Jai hind,\" Jadeja said.\n\nOver his international T20 career, Jadeja played 74 matches, amassing 515 runs and taking 54 wickets. His pinpoint accuracy and subtle variations made him a challenging opponent, especially in the middle overs. Consistently delivering crucial breakthroughs, Jadeja often turned matches in India's favor with timely strikes.\n\nBeyond his bowling, Jadeja's fielding prowess set him apart. Renowned for his lightning-quick reflexes and athletic prowess, he was known for exceptional catches, direct hits, and game-changing run-outs, all of which are significant aspects of his T20I legacy.\n\nJadeja's all-round abilities were prominently showcased in the 2014 World T20, where his economical bowling and crucial lower-order contributions helped India reach the final. He took five wickets at an economy rate of 7.36 in the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jadeja", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jadeja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ravindra Jadeja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajasthan_Royals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rajasthan Royals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_cricket_team_in_Sri_Lanka_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladeshi cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Warne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shane Warne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamnagar", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamnagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jamnagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caught", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caught"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111383579,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-94588,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694600", "eventUri": "eng-9694600", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.584313725490196, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

If judged by it, Ravindra Jadeja ended his T20I career on the perfect note as India won the T20 World Cup after 17 years.\n\nThe all-rounder announced his retirement from the 20-over format a day after India's T20 World Cup triumph, becoming the third senior cricketer to quit after Virat Kohli and skipper Rohit Sharma.\n\nThe 35-year-old has been one of the key players across formats for the Indian team but an ordinary T20 World Cup campaign showed that his efforts were on the wane.\n\nHe could only take one wicket in seven innings at an economy rate of 7.57 and an average of 106 and could only play bit part role as a batter in the tournament.\n\nIn the final in Bridgetown, Barbados, on Saturday, he was dismissed for only two runs in as many balls, getting caught out in the last ball of India's innings as they scored 176/7.\n\nIndia restricted South Africa to 169/8 to win by seven runs as Jadeja was called up to bowl only an over, in which he conceded 12 runs.\n\nHe must have been the first to realise that age is against him to meet the demands of the fast-paced T20 format. As Kohli mentioned while announcing his retirement that it was an open secret that the final was his last T20I match in Indian colours, Jadeja too must have made up his mind a while ago.\n\nWhen India announced their 15-member squad, Jadeja was picked as one of the four spinners with he and Axar Patel being the two spin-bowling all-rounders.\n\nThroughout the tournament Patel grew in stature, earning the trust of skipper Rohit to be brought into the attack ahead of Jadeja. Now as he leaves the stage after 15 years and six T20 World Cups, Jadeja would only be happy to pass on the baton to a worthy successor in Patel.\n\nSince debuting against Sri Lanka in February 2009 in Colombo, Jadeja played in 74 T20I matches, scoring 515 runs, averaging 21.45 with a strike rate of 127.16.\n\nThe left-arm spinner claimed 54 wickets at an average of 29.85, cinceding at an economy rate of 7.13 and signs off making 130 runs and picking up 22 wickets in six editions of the T20 World Cup.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors":

The veteran allrounder announced his retirement from the shortest format of the game on Sunday (June 30), just hours after India won the ICC T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nHe became the third player from the India team to retire from T20Is after the victory in the ninth edition of the T20 World Cup. Before him, Virat Kohli and captain Rohit Sharma had announced their retirement as well. While Kohli and Rohit confirmed their retirement at the post-match presentation ceremony and press conference respectively, Ravindra Jadeja took to social media to announce his decision.\n\nTributes have been pouring in from all around ever since Ravindra Jadeja announced his retirement and PM Modi also wished him on a successful career. Taking to X, PM Modi stated that cricket lovers have enjoyed the allrounder's display on the field and thanked him for his performances in T20Is as he wrote:\n\n\"You have performed exceptionally as an all-rounder. Cricket lovers admire your stylish stroke play, spin and superb fielding. Thank you for the enthralling T20 performances over the years. My best wishes for your endeavours ahead.\"\n\nRavindra Jadeja was also quick to acknowledge the message from the PM as he replied: \"Thanks a lot sir \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb.\"\n\nMonths after helping India win the Under-19 World Cup in 2008, Ravindra Jadeja made his T20I debut for Team India in 2009 against Sri Lanka. He has ended his T20I career after playing 74 games over the years. Jadeja scored 515 runs and picked up 55 wickets in the shortest format of the game. He also featured in six T20 World Cups for Team India - 2009, 2010, 2014, 2016, 2021, and 2024.\n\nTalking about the T20 World Cup 2024, India defeated South Africa by 7 runs in a thrilling final.

It was a tad underwhelming for a player who always prided on his ability to hustle through the overs without losing control over his own craft or over the batters.\n\nIn this World Cup, in fact, Axar Patel stamped himself as the vital cog in India's campaign, as the left-arm spinner got more overs and a chance to bat up the order, often the schtick of Jadeja.\n\nIt was certainly not a reflection of the team management's estimation of Jadeja's abilities.\n\nHe perhaps, was withheld as an insurance cover for a spectacular top and middle-order collapse which eventually did not happen.\n\nBut then under Rahul Dravid, whose tenure ended with the World Cup, this Indian side's metric to include a player in the squad was not dependent on numbers alone.\n\nThe possibilities that he brings to the table made Jadeja a near-indispensable force across the three formats.\n\nAnd those possibilities were, in fact, more everyday-natured compared to others.\n\nKuldeep can produce those stunning balls like the one that cleaned up Babar Azam in the 2019 50-over World Cup, while Ashwin has a wowing and endless bag of tricks.\n\nBut Jadeja never really bowls those magic deliveries, but he generally does those little things correctly and relentlessly.\n\nHe hardly gives batters a breathing space, control over line and length are his forte. It made Jadeja a bankable option for the team in all conditions.\n\nDravid explained the rationale.\n\n\"If you look at the numbers, we look at stats, we look at data, we look at it quite a lot, and Jadeja has been exceptional.\n\n\"Our seamers are often fantastic upfront, so, the performances of people like Jaddu and Kuldeep (Yadav) have probably gone slightly unnoticed,\" Dravid had said.\n\nJadeja, the batsman, too suffered a similar fate in the T20Is. He was often asked to bat No. 7 and it's a tough position to come out for a batter who is not a natural hitter from ball one like Hardik Pandya.\n\nBut he could make those vital runs down the order, like he showed against England in the semifinal at Guyana.\n\nFrom 146 for six, Jadeja made an unbeaten 17 off 9 balls that helped India reach a stronger 171 for seven, the foundation of their facile 68-run win.\n\nBut none really noticed it as Rohit made a fluent 57 off 39 balls.\n\nJadeja was economical in his three overs - giving just 16 runs away. But Axar bagged the player of the match award for his three for 23.\n\nThat was a typical Jadeja match - he did everything he was asked for but others hogged the headlines.\n\n\"As an allrounder, my role is to make an impact in tough situations. When you need the crucial 30-40 runs or when there is a partnership going on and you need a wicket. Change the game,\" he had said.\n\nJadeja indeed changes the complexion of the game. But his magic was in the mathematics and angles of cricket.

He never really grumbled over it or, as is the trend these days, never put out a cryptic one-line post on his social media accounts.\n\nEven while bringing the curtains down on his T20I stint, Jadeja was in the shadows of the icons. Perhaps, the 35-year-old all-rounder had already made up his mind, as reported by PTI on June 28, but knew that a retirement announcement alongside Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma would end up as a mere footnote.\n\nIn the Americas too, Jadeja was a part of India's eight matches, but his contribution was sparse 35 runs and one wicket across 14 overs. Perhaps, he attracted more camera time during India's victory parade at the Kensington Oval after their epochal win over South Africa in the final. It may be that his numbers in the ultra-abridged version did not match those in other two formats.\n\nJadeja has played 74 T20Is, making 515 runs without ever reaching fifty and 54 wickets at an economy of 7.1. It was a tad underwhelming for a player who always prided on his ability to hustle through the overs without losing control over his own craft or over the batters. In this World Cup, in fact, Axar Patel stamped himself as the vital cog in India's campaign, as the left-arm spinner got more overs and a chance to bat up the order, often the shtick of Jadeja.\n\nIt was certainly not a reflection of the team management's estimation of Jadeja's abilities. He perhaps was withheld as an insurance cover for a spectacular top and middle-order collapse, which eventually did not happen. But then under Rahul Dravid, whose tenure ended with the World Cup, this Indian side's metric to include a player in the squad was not dependent on numbers alone.", "source": {"uri": "etvbharat.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ETV Bharat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "etv_bharat@etvbharat.com", "name": "Etv Bharat", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravindra_Jadeja", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ravindra Jadeja"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravichandran_Ashwin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ravichandran Ashwin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spin bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_overs_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Limited overs cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuldeep_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kuldeep Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzvendra_Chahal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yuzvendra Chahal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Oval", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Oval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-rounder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-rounder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axar Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-arm_orthodox_spin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-arm orthodox spin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Dravid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://etvbharatimages.akamaized.net/etvbharat/prod-images/30-06-2024/1200-675-21834233-117-21834233-1719755253417.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694600", "eventUri": "eng-9694600", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 720, "textEnd": 727}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

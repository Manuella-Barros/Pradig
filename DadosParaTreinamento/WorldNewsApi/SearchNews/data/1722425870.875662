The Limerick southpaw will finally make the ring walk when trades leather on the Dennis Hobson New Dawn in Durham card, although at one stage his team feared they may not be able to secure him a fight. It was getting so hard to match the former Elite Champion and first fighter ever to win a European Games bout, that the matchmaker wondered if trying to secure an opponent for Vasiliy Lomachenko. \u201cIt was a nightmare getting him matched and one opponent even asked for five grand to fight him over four rounds \u2013 the matchmaker Jack Gladman is almost tempted to put his nickname in on BoxRec as \u2018The Irish Lomachenko\u2019, because it was getting ridiculous,\u201d Ian Gaughran explained when speaking to Irish-boxing.com. The Loma\u2019 comparisons may be made for different reasons moving forward. Not quite a world title fight in his third fight, ala the Ukranian legend, but the IGB boss does plan to move the Munster fighter fast. View this post on Instagram \u201cThankfully, we got him sorted. He\u2019ll go in and get his rounds done and we\u2019ll go straight into six next with a view to moving fast. He spars with the highest-level fighters and hopefully, that will translate under the lights. \u201cWe all know what he did as an amateur, winning Elite titles and representing his country at Europeans \u2013 and as it turns out so did six or seven potential opponents for this! The former St Francis amateur, who debuts against Mohammed Wako with Gugu Donovan in his corner, has been talking about turning over for quite some time and Gaughran is delighted to finally help him climb through the ropes. View this post on Instagram \u201cI\u2019m really pleased that Myles is finally up and running as a pro and I can\u2019t wait to see what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d said Gaughran. \u201cHe\u2019s a great lad, so easy going, and nothing fazes him, but I really wanted to get him out and into the pros so we can get him into the title picture \u2013 that starts this weekend!\u201d", "summary": "<p>Myles Casey may just find himself with very unique ring moniker by the time he debuts in Durham tonight.

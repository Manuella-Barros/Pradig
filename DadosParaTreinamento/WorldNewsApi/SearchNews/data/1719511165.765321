Former glamour model Kate, 46, has expressed her excitement to vacate the mansion, located in Horsham, West Sussex, which she purchased in October 2014 for \u00a31.35million. Ever since Katie moved in, the property has made headlines, most recently when she was allegedly handed an eviction notice amid her second bankruptcy. Taking to Instagram on Sunday (May 26), the reality star shared a video of her pink Range Rover doused in acid. This isn\u2019t the first time the house has been targeted by vandals, as she\u2019s also had her fences graffitied in the past. \u2018It\u2019s nice to know someone, in the night, has come to throw acid all over my car,\u2019 Katie began in the video.

Thank you, whoever that was.\u2019 Katie also wrote alongside the video: \u2018Scumbags outside my house on my private property I can\u2019t wait to get out this house in a few months time [sic]\u2019. The mum-of-five has made no secret of her disdain for her Mucky Mansion in recent weeks. Speaking at a live show of The Katie Price Podcast in London on Friday night (May 24), Katie told the audience: \u2018No, I am still in my mansion! And guess what? I absolutely have hated my mansion.\u2019 She added in quotes from The Sun: \u2018I tell you why, nine years of hell I\u2019ve had there. \u2018Fly-tipping, it\u2019s haunted\u2026 and I am living with it. And whoever buys that house, good luck! I hate it.\u2019 While she has confirmed she\u2019s moving out and moving on, Katie has made it known that she hasn\u2019t been formally evicted, despite previous reports that she had days to get out. Initially, according to The Mirror, Katie was sent a letter, dated April 24, 2024, stating that \u2018the eviction will take place on May 29, 2024, at 10am\u2019. She shared a video of her car covered in acid (Picture: Instagram) Katie hit out at the vandals (Picture: Instagram) The letter also stated that the court had \u2018issued a warrant or writ for the possession of the property\u2019. Furious, Katie hit back, with her team releasing a statement reading: \u2018Katie will not be evicted from her property on 29th May. \u2018All paperwork regarding this has been obtained, opened, and shared with media illegally by a local resident. The police have been notified and will be investigating.\u2019 Katie herself later shut down rumours that she was \u2018moving into a caravan\u2019. She added on her Katie Price Show podcast: \u2018My house isn\u2019t being repossessed, I\u2019m not being evicted and I\u2019m not moving into a caravan. \u2018Although, if I had to live in a caravan, you know what the travellers have, I would love that.\u2019 Those who follow the turbulent life of the Pricey will know that she has been declared bankrupt twice.

Katie also failed to show up to court to give evidence about her finances, citing \u2018health issues\u2019 as the reason why and saying she was not \u2018strong enough\u2019 to be cross-examined. She stressed that she is \u2018taking [her] bankruptcy so seriously\u2019, though, despite being slated for holidaying with boyfriend JJ Slater, 31, at the time of the hearing. Katie justified her actions by arguing that she \u2018needed a break\u2019. Got a story?

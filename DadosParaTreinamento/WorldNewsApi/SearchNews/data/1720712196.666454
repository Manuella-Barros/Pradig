Asked why she thinks people who have tickets are not always using them, Mauresmo replied: \u201cWho knows? I\u2019m not in their heads.\u201d Added French tennis federation president Gilles Moretton: \u201cWe can\u2019t force people to go to the stands.\u201d Mauresmo and Moretton said at the annual end-of-tournament news conference that more than 650,000 spectators came to Roland Garros over the past three weeks, including the qualifying rounds before main-draw action began on May 26. Moretton said a review of the whole event will start in a couple of weeks. \u201cNot everything was perfect. We want to improve,\u201d he said. One topic that arose last year, too, but did not see any change this time is the way scheduling is handled, particularly with regard to the imbalance between women\u2019s and men\u2019s matches in the one-match night sessions, which have been used for the first 1 1/2 weeks of the singles brackets each of the past three years. There were zero women\u2019s matches and 11 men\u2019s matches at night during European prime time this year. There was only one women\u2019s night match apiece in 2022 and 2023. \u201cThe generation and depth of talent we are currently witnessing in the sport is incredible. Fans want to see the excitement and thrill of women\u2019s tennis on the biggest stages and in the premium time slots,\u201d the women\u2019s professional tennis tour, the WTA, said in a statement issued by a spokesperson. \u201cTo continue building the value of our combined product, a balanced match schedule that features both the best in men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis is critical.\u201d Mauresmo, a former No. 1-ranked player who won two Grand Slam singles titles, said someone from the WTA is among those \u201cin the room,\u201d when each day\u2019s program is determined, and, \u201cI did not see any push also to have (a) women\u2019s match in the evening.\u201d Mauresmo said her biggest concern about having women\u2019s matches at night is that, in part because they use a best-of-three-set format \u2014 as opposed to the best-of-five used for men\u2019s Grand Slam contests \u2014 they might be too short to be considered worth the price of admission. She said she does not want to schedule two matches at night \u2014 one women\u2019s and one men\u2019s \u2014 because then play will continue too late. Moving up the start of the night session from its current 8:15 p.m. local time is not an option because fans wouldn\u2019t get there at, say, 7 p.m., \u201cgiven the culture we have in Paris,\u201d Mauresmo said. French tennis federation director general Stephane Morel added that the time required to clear the stadium after the day session ends, then allow those with tickets for the night session in, takes too long for an earlier start. \u201cNothing\u2019s engraved in stone. Things can change,\u201d Mauresmo said. \u201cIt\u2019s one single match that we play at night, and therefore we have to make choices. That\u2019s why this year we wanted to have only men playing at night.\u201d ___ AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2ZyZW5jaC1vcGVuLTIwMjQtbWF1cmVzbW8tM2I0ZjI0ODQ0Mjc2YTYyNzEwYTgyY2NkYWI0OTcwN2TSAQA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">French Open director Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo says she has some ideas to help avoid so many empty seats</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/french-open-2024-mauresmo-3b4f24844276a62710a82ccdab49707d", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/39e87ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5616x3159+0+293/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fa1%2Fe8%2Fad14ed3e6e55be2934e8494434c9%2F1236730407c348bea44fc947ed03a575", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:52:34", "author": "Howard Fendrich", "authors": ["Howard Fendrich"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.139}

If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.\n\nHis parents said he died by suicide on May 25, one day after he walked off the course at Colonial with two holes remaining in the second round of the Charles Schwab Challenge.\n\nAmong those who spoke at the celebration was Masters champion Scottie Scheffler, who came to know Murray better in the early part of the year, as Murray was trying to get his fianc\u00e9e more involved with some of the players' wives.\n\nThey played a nine-hole practice round at The Players Championship, Murray and Chesson Hadley against Scheffler and Sam Burns.\n\n\"The look on his face when I gave him $100 on the ninth green is something I'll remember for a long time because you couldn't wipe that smile off his face,\" Scheffler said. \"Without a doubt, he loved being out here inside the ropes.\"\n\nScheffler referred to him as a \"sweet man\" on more than one occasion, and he was weeping when he walked away from the podium, then buried his head in his wife's shoulder.\n\nMurray's death was a shock to players, caddies and everyone involved in the tour. He was a prodigious talent as a junior, won the Barbasol Championship in Kentucky as a rookie and struggled with alcoholism and tour discipline and anxiety. He spoke at the Sony Open about feeling like a failure for not living up to expectations.\n\nWebb Simpson, who first met an 8-year-old Murray in their home state of North Carolina, is not at the Memorial this year. He had another close friend, Russell Henley, read his thoughts.\n\nJay Green, who began caddying for him the week of the Sony Open, told of his hopes to buy a Rolex watch if they had a good year. Murray won the Sony Open and bought a Rolex.\n\nFor Monahan, Murray's death was personal.\n\nThis week marks one year since the PGA Tour did a secretive and shocking deal with the Saudi backers of LIV Golf, and Murray was front and center at a player meeting the afternoon of June 6 to hammer Monahan for doing the deal and not telling anyone.\n\nMonahan a week later stepped away for more than a month with anxiety-induced physical and mental issues. During that time away, Monahan turned off his cellphone for a month.\n\n\"We had a player meeting in Canada that all of you know was intense and heated. Grayson and others were extremely vocal about their displeasure about my decision to keep the membership in the heart. The criticism, it was 100% warranted,\" Monahan said.\n\nHe said when he finally turned his phone back on during his leave, one of the first text messages he saw was from Murray.\n\n\"A line in that text will always stay with me -- 'Jay I just want you to get healthy. I know everything is doing to work out for our tour and for the better,'\" Monahan said. \"He offered not condemnation but compassion. Instead of walking away from me, he offered to walk with me.\n\n\"I'll always be thankful for this act of kindness, and I'm not alone.\"\n\nMonahan said similar stories were shared in a private service for Murray and his family on Monday.\n\nPlayers, along with Memorial founder Jack Nicklaus and wife Barbara, filled the seats. Tour officials stood flanked to the left, with dozens of other players, caddies, equipment representatives and agents filling the ground to the right. More than a hundred spectators watched from a hill above the garden as a bagpipe played \"Amazing Grace\" at the end.\n\n\"I can only offer the assurance that Grayson's memory will serve as a continual reminder that the PGA Tour is a brotherhood that transcends competition,\" Monahan said. \"And our foremost responsibility is to care for each other and be kind. I can't imagine a prouder legacy.\"\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.\n\n___\n\nHis parents said he died by suicide on May 25, one day after he walked off the course at Colonial with two holes remaining in the second round of the Charles Schwab Challenge.\n\nAmong those who spoke at the celebration was Masters champion Scottie Scheffler, who came to know Murray better in the early part of the year, as Murray was trying to get his fianc\u00e9e more involved with some of the players' wives.\n\nThey played a nine-hole practice round at The Players Championship, Murray and Chesson Hadley against Scheffler and Sam Burns.\n\n\"The look on his face when I gave him $100 on the ninth green is something I'll remember for a long time because you couldn't wipe that smile off his face,\" Scheffler said. \"Without a doubt, he loved being out here inside the ropes.\"\n\nScheffler referred to him as a \"sweet man\" on more than one occasion, and he was weeping when he walked away from the podium, then buried his head in his wife's shoulder.\n\nMurray's death was a shock to players, caddies and everyone involved in the tour. He was a prodigious talent as a junior, won the Barbasol Championship in Kentucky as a rookie and struggled with alcoholism and tour discipline and anxiety. He spoke at the Sony Open about feeling like a failure for not living up to expectations.\n\nWebb Simpson, who first met an 8-year-old Murray in their home state of North Carolina, is not at the Memorial this year. He had another close friend, Russell Henley, read his thoughts.\n\nJay Green, who began caddying for him the week of the Sony Open, told of his hopes to buy a Rolex watch if they had a good year. Murray won the Sony Open and bought a Rolex.\n\nFor Monahan, Murray's death was personal.\n\nThis week marks one year since the PGA Tour did a secretive and shocking deal with the Saudi backers of LIV Golf, and Murray was front and center at a player meeting the afternoon of June 6 to hammer Monahan for doing the deal and not telling anyone.\n\nMonahan a week later stepped away for more than a month with anxiety-induced physical and mental issues. During that time away, Monahan turned off his cellphone for a month.\n\n\"We had a player meeting in Canada that all of you know was intense and heated. Grayson and others were extremely vocal about their displeasure about my decision to keep the membership in the heart. The criticism, it was 100% warranted,\" Monahan said.\n\nHe said when he finally turned his phone back on during his leave, one of the first text messages he saw was from Murray.\n\n\"A line in that text will always stay with me -- 'Jay I just want you to get healthy. I know everything is doing to work out for our tour and for the better,'\" Monahan said. \"He offered not condemnation but compassion. Instead of walking away from me, he offered to walk with me.\n\n\"I'll always be thankful for this act of kindness, and I'm not alone.\"\n\nMonahan said similar stories were shared in a private service for Murray and his family on Monday.\n\nPlayers, along with Memorial founder Jack Nicklaus and wife Barbara, filled the seats. Tour officials stood flanked to the left, with dozens of other players, caddies, equipment representatives and agents filling the ground to the right. More than a hundred spectators watched from a hill above the garden as a bagpipe played \"Amazing Grace\" at the end.\n\n\"I can only offer the assurance that Grayson's memory will serve as a continual reminder that the PGA Tour is a brotherhood that transcends competition,\" Monahan said. \"And our foremost responsibility is to care for each other and be kind. I can't imagine a prouder legacy.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

He was a prodigious talent as a junior, won the Barbasol Championship in Kentucky as a rookie and struggled with alcoholism and tour discipline and anxiety. He spoke at the Sony Open about feeling like a failure for not living up to expectations.\n\nWebb Simpson, who first met an 8-year-old Murray in their home state of North Carolina, is not at the Memorial this year. He had another close friend, Russell Henley, read his thoughts.\n\nJay Green, who began caddying for him the week of the Sony Open, told of his hopes to buy a Rolex watch if they had a good year. Murray won the Sony Open and bought a Rolex.\n\nFor Monahan, Murray's death was personal.\n\nThis week marks one year since the PGA Tour did a secretive and shocking deal with the Saudi backers of LIV Golf, and Murray was front and center at a player meeting the afternoon of June 6 to hammer Monahan for doing the deal and not telling anyone.\n\nMonahan a week later stepped away for more than a month with anxiety-induced physical and mental issues. During that time away, Monahan turned off his cellphone for a month.\n\n\"We had a player meeting in Canada that all of you know was intense and heated. Grayson and others were extremely vocal about their displeasure about my decision to keep the membership in the heart. The criticism, it was 100% warranted,\" Monahan said.\n\nHe said when he finally turned his phone back on during his leave, one of the first text messages he saw was from Murray.\n\n\"A line in that text will always stay with me -- 'Jay I just want you to get healthy. I know everything is doing to work out for our tour and for the better,'\" Monahan said. \"He offered not condemnation but compassion. Instead of walking away from me, he offered to walk with me.\n\n\"I'll always be thankful for this act of kindness, and I'm not alone.\"\n\nMonahan said similar stories were shared in a private service for Murray and his family on Monday.\n\nPlayers, along with Memorial founder Jack Nicklaus and wife Barbara, filled the seats. Tour officials stood flanked to the left, with dozens of other players, caddies, equipment representatives and agents filling the ground to the right. More than a hundred spectators watched from a hill above the garden as a bagpipe played \"Amazing Grace\" at the end.\n\n\"I can only offer the assurance that Grayson's memory will serve as a continual reminder that the PGA Tour is a brotherhood that transcends competition,\" Monahan said. \"And our foremost responsibility is to care for each other and be kind.

If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.\n\nA golf television broadcast is played at the broadcast tent showing a photo of Grayson Murray during the third round of the Charles Schwab Challenge golf tournament at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth, Texas, Saturday, May 25, 2024. Two-time PGA Tour winner Murray died Saturday morning at age 30, one day after he withdrew from the tournament. (AP Photo/LM Otero)\n\nHis parents said he died by suicide on May 25, one day after he walked off the course at Colonial with two holes remaining in the second round of the Charles Schwab Challenge.\n\nAmong those who spoke at the celebration was Masters champion Scottie Scheffler, who came to know Murray better in the early part of the year, as Murray was trying to get his fianc\u00e9e more involved with some of the players' wives.\n\nThey played a nine-hole practice round at The Players Championship, Murray and Chesson Hadley against Scheffler and Sam Burns.\n\n\"The look on his face when I gave him $100 on the ninth green is something I'll remember for a long time because you couldn't wipe that smile off his face,\" Scheffler said. \"Without a doubt, he loved being out here inside the ropes.\"\n\nScheffler referred to him as a \"sweet man\" on more than one occasion, and he was weeping when he walked away from the podium, then buried his head in his wife's shoulder.\n\nMurray's death was a shock to players, caddies and everyone involved in the tour. He was a prodigious talent as a junior, won the Barbasol Championship in Kentucky as a rookie and struggled with alcoholism and tour discipline and anxiety. He spoke at the Sony Open about feeling like a failure for not living up to expectations.\n\nWebb Simpson, who first met an 8-year-old Murray in their home state of North Carolina, is not at the Memorial this year. He had another close friend, Russell Henley, read his thoughts.\n\nJay Green, who began caddying for him the week of the Sony Open, told of his hopes to buy a Rolex watch if they had a good year. Murray won the Sony Open and bought a Rolex.\n\nFor Monahan, Murray's death was personal.\n\nThis week marks one year since the PGA Tour did a secretive and shocking deal with the Saudi backers of LIV Golf, and Murray was front and center at a player meeting the afternoon of June 6 to hammer Monahan for doing the deal and not telling anyone.\n\nMonahan a week later stepped away for more than a month with anxiety-induced physical and mental issues. During that time away, Monahan turned off his cellphone for a month.\n\n\"We had a player meeting in Canada that all of you know was intense and heated. Grayson and others were extremely vocal about their displeasure about my decision to keep the membership in the heart. The criticism, it was 100% warranted,\" Monahan said.\n\nHe said when he finally turned his phone back on during his leave, one of the first text messages he saw was from Murray.\n\n\"A line in that text will always stay with me - 'Jay I just want you to get healthy. I know everything is doing to work out for our tour and for the better,'\" Monahan said. \"He offered not condemnation but compassion. Instead of walking away from me, he offered to walk with me.\n\n\"I'll always be thankful for this act of kindness, and I'm not alone.\"\n\nMonahan said similar stories were shared in a private service for Murray and his family on Monday.\n\nPlayers, along with Memorial founder Jack Nicklaus and wife Barbara, filled the seats. Tour officials stood flanked to the left, with dozens of other players, caddies, equipment representatives and agents filling the ground to the right. More than a hundred spectators watched from a hill above the garden as a bagpipe played \"Amazing Grace\" at the end.\n\n\"I can only offer the assurance that Grayson's memory will serve as a continual reminder that the PGA Tour is a brotherhood that transcends competition,\" Monahan said. \"And our foremost responsibility is to care for each other and be kind. I can't imagine a prouder legacy.\"\n\nAP golf: https://apnews.com/hub/golf\n\nFILE -Grayson Murray celebrates winning the Sony Open golf event, Sunday, Jan. 14, 2024, at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu.

He was a prodigious talent as a junior, won the Barbasol Championship in Kentucky as a rookie and struggled with alcoholism and tour discipline and anxiety. He spoke at the Sony Open about feeling like a failure for not living up to expectations.\n\nWebb Simpson, who first met an 8-year-old Murray in their home state of North Carolina, is not at the Memorial this year. He had another close friend, Russell Henley, read his thoughts.\n\nJay Green, who began caddying for him the week of the Sony Open, told of his hopes to buy a Rolex watch if they had a good year. Murray won the Sony Open and bought a Rolex.\n\nFor Monahan, Murray's death was personal.\n\nThis week marks one year since the PGA Tour did a secretive and shocking deal with the Saudi backers of LIV Golf, and Murray was front and center at a player meeting the afternoon of June 6 to hammer Monahan for doing the deal and not telling anyone.\n\nMonahan a week later stepped away for more than a month with anxiety-induced physical and mental issues. During that time away, Monahan turned off his cellphone for a month.\n\n\"We had a player meeting in Canada that all of you know was intense and heated. Grayson and others were extremely vocal about their displeasure about my decision to keep the membership in the heart. The criticism, it was 100% warranted,\" Monahan said.\n\nHe said when he finally turned his phone back on during his leave, one of the first text messages he saw was from Murray.\n\n\"A line in that text will always stay with me -- 'Jay I just want you to get healthy. I know everything is doing to work out for our tour and for the better,'\" Monahan said. \"He offered not condemnation but compassion. Instead of walking away from me, he offered to walk with me.\n\n\"I'll always be thankful for this act of kindness, and I'm not alone.\"\n\nMonahan said similar stories were shared in a private service for Murray and his family on Monday.\n\nPlayers, along with Memorial founder Jack Nicklaus and wife Barbara, filled the seats. Tour officials stood flanked to the left, with dozens of other players, caddies, equipment representatives and agents filling the ground to the right. More than a hundred spectators watched from a hill above the garden as a bagpipe played \"Amazing Grace\" at the end.\n\n\"I can only offer the assurance that Grayson's memory will serve as a continual reminder that the PGA Tour is a brotherhood that transcends competition,\" Monahan said. \"And our foremost responsibility is to care for each other and be kind. I can't imagine a prouder legacy.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

Murray won the Sony Open and bought a Rolex.\n\nFor Monahan, Murray's death was personal.\n\nThis week marks one year since the PGA Tour did a secretive and shocking deal with the Saudi backers of LIV Golf, and Murray was front and center at a player meeting the afternoon of June 6 to hammer Monahan for doing the deal and not telling anyone.\n\nMonahan a week later stepped away for more than a month with anxiety-induced physical and mental issues. During that time away, Monahan turned off his cellphone for a month.\n\n\"We had a player meeting in Canada that all of you know was intense and heated.

I know everything is doing to work out for our tour and for the better,'\" Monahan said. \"He offered not condemnation but compassion.

(WTVD) -- Two-time PGA Tour winner and Raleigh native Grayson Murray died Saturday, May 26 at age 30.\n\nMurray's family has confirmed the golfer died by suicide.\n\nMurray had been public about his mental health struggles and alcohol addiction.\n\nAs his family, friends and the golf world still mourn losing him, some took time to honor him a week after his passing.\n\nSunday, the UNC Health Championship had an honorary tee time in memory of Murray. The event was held at the Raleigh Country Club.\n\n\"It means everything. You know, he is going to be a legend. Legendary status here in Raleigh is and to have this, you know, this time here today at Raleigh Country Club is important for that. It's important for the family and all of us have been around Grayson for so long,\" Murray's friend Jeff Maynus said.\n\nAttendees were offered a chance to share memories of Murray.\n\nInstead of flowers, the family prefers a memorial contribution to PGA TOUR Charities, Inc. and mailed to P.O. Box 1065, Ponte Vedra Beach, FL 32004. In the memo field note \"In Memory of Grayson Murray.\" If you prefer to make your contribution electronically click here.\n\nThe family says the donations will be used to promote addiction awareness and enhance mental health services and research.\n\nRELATED | Grayson Murray's death felt throughout the Raleigh golf community\n\nEarlier this year, Murray won the Sony Open in a playoff against former PGA Championship winner Keegan Bradley and South Korea's An Byeong-hun, ending a six-and-a-half-year winless streak during which he admitted to struggling with mental health and physical issues.\n\nHailing from Raleigh, Murray was regarded as one of the world's best junior players, capturing three IMG Junior World titles in 2006, '07 and '08.\n\nAt age 16, he became the second youngest to make the cut on the PGA's developmental Korn Ferry Tour, and at age 19 he played in the 2013 US Open, according to the PGA. He went on to win the 2017 Barbasol Championship at just 23 years old.\n\nIf you are experiencing suicidal, substance use or other mental health crises please call or text the new three-digit code at 988.

The tribute to the late Raleigh-area golfer was quite an emotional scene at Raleigh Country Club.\n\nJay Green, Murray's caddie, put on a caddie bib and all before taking Murray's golf bag to the first tee before a minute of silence being held for the 30-year-old who passed away a little over a week ago. Green, along with friends, family, and the many fans in attendance were understandably emotional as Murray was honored with his lone tee time.\n\nMurray's family has announced its plans to launch the Grayson Murray Foundation to promote addiction awareness and enhancing mental health services and research.\n\nMurray had been open about dealing with addiction, anxiety, and depression throughout his adult life. In January, after winning the Sony Open in a playoff, he reported that he was eight months sober at the time.\n\nMurray withdrew from the Charles Schwab Challenge during the second round of play, citing an illness. The next day, he was gone.\n\nHis parents confirmed in a statement that Murray had committed suicide. It was later reported that the two-time PGA Tour winner died from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning inside of his Palm Beach Gardens townhouse.\n\n\"We have spent the last 24 hours trying to come to terms with the fact that our son is gone. It's surreal that we not only have to admit it to ourselves, but that we also have to acknowledge it to the world. It's a nightmare,\" the statement from Murray's parents read.\n\n\"We would like to thank the PGA TOUR and the entire world of golf for the outpouring of support. Life wasn't always easy for Grayson, and although he took his own life, we know he rests peacefully now.\"\n\nRory McIlroy, the No. 3 player in the world, spoke about the passing of Murray ahead of this past week's RBC Canadian Open.\n\n\"It's a cliche, but it puts everything in perspective,\" McIlroy said. \"At the end of the day golf is golf and, yeah, we play it for a living, but it pales in comparison to the things that actually matter in life.\"", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_harris@outkick.com", "name": "Mark Harris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grayson Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Country music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raleigh,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Raleigh, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_National_Invitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colonial National Invitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Open_in_Hawaii", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sony Open in Hawaii"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Depression (mood)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Open_(golf)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Open (golf)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_poisoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon monoxide poisoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rory_McIlroy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rory McIlroy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach_Gardens,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach Gardens, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palm Beach Gardens, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community_and_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Community and Clubs", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-2155741725.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624130", "eventUri": "eng-9624130", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

He was a prodigious talent as a junior, won the Barbasol Championship in Kentucky as a rookie and struggled with alcoholism and tour discipline and anxiety. He spoke at the Sony Open about feeling like a failure for not living up to expectations.\n\nWebb Simpson, who first met an 8-year-old Murray in their home state of North Carolina, is not at the Memorial this year. He had another close friend, Russell Henley, read his thoughts.\n\nJay Green, who began caddying for him the week of the Sony Open, told of his hopes to buy a Rolex watch if they had a good year. Murray won the Sony Open and bought a Rolex.\n\nFor Monahan, Murray's death was personal.\n\nThis week marks one year since the PGA Tour did a secretive and shocking deal with the Saudi backers of LIV Golf, and Murray was front and center at a player meeting the afternoon of June 6 to hammer Monahan for doing the deal and not telling anyone.\n\nMonahan a week later stepped away for more than a month with anxiety-induced physical and mental issues. During that time away, Monahan turned off his cellphone for a month.\n\n\"We had a player meeting in Canada that all of you know was intense and heated. Grayson and others were extremely vocal about their displeasure about my decision to keep the membership in the heart. The criticism, it was 100% warranted,\" Monahan said.\n\nHe said when he finally turned his phone back on during his leave, one of the first text messages he saw was from Murray.\n\n\"A line in that text will always stay with me -- 'Jay I just want you to get healthy. I know everything is doing to work out for our tour and for the better,'\" Monahan said. \"He offered not condemnation but compassion. Instead of walking away from me, he offered to walk with me.\n\n\"I'll always be thankful for this act of kindness, and I'm not alone.\"\n\nMonahan said similar stories were shared in a private service for Murray and his family on Monday.\n\nPlayers, along with Memorial founder Jack Nicklaus and wife Barbara, filled the seats. Tour officials stood flanked to the left, with dozens of other players, caddies, equipment representatives and agents filling the ground to the right. More than a hundred spectators watched from a hill above the garden as a bagpipe played \"Amazing Grace\" at the end.\n\n\"I can only offer the assurance that Grayson's memory will serve as a continual reminder that the PGA Tour is a brotherhood that transcends competition,\" Monahan said. \"And our foremost responsibility is to care for each other and be kind. I can't imagine a prouder legacy.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

He loved this place,\" Murray family friend Jeff Maness said.\n\nThe UNC Health Championship held an honorary tee time for Murray and a moment of silence in Murray's honor.\n\n\"Our hearts are broken, and we all grieve deeply for our beloved Grayson,\" Maness said.\n\nManess recalled the two-time PGA Tour winner honing his game at the Raleigh Country Club.\n\n\"He hit a million golf balls on that practice tee,\" Maness said.\n\nHe added it means everything to honor Murray in the place he called home.\n\n\"He recently was looking for a house here again and he was ready to call Raleigh home and settle down,\" Maness said.\n\nThe owner of the country club, John McConnell also spoke at the ceremony.\n\nMcConnell also started the McConnell Golf Scholarship, and Murray was one of the first recipients. He presented Murray's family with a plaque that will go up on the club's wall of champions.\n\n\"I think all of you that have met Grayson know that he truly is a champion and deserves to be on the wall,\" McConnell said.\n\nManess said Murray was open about his struggles with mental health and alcohol in his life, and the family hopes from out of this tragedy they can help someone else.\n\n\"Sometimes it prevails in the short term,\" Maness said. \"But our goal really from the vision of Eric and Terry, is to harness all this energy, begin to raise money and try to make a difference, to save, you know, at least one person's life and maybe hundreds or thousands of people's lives.\"\n\nMurray's family is asking for charitable donations to be made in their son's memory.

He was a prodigious talent as a junior, won the Barbasol Championship in Kentucky as a rookie and struggled with alcoholism and tour discipline and anxiety. He spoke at the Sony Open about feeling like a failure for not living up to expectations.\n\nWebb Simpson, who first met an 8-year-old Murray in their home state of North Carolina, is not at the Memorial this year. He had another close friend, Russell Henley, read his thoughts.\n\nJay Green, who began caddying for him the week of the Sony Open, told of his hopes to buy a Rolex watch if they had a good year. Murray won the Sony Open and bought a Rolex.\n\nFor Monahan, Murray's death was personal.\n\nThis week marks one year since the PGA Tour did a secretive and shocking deal with the Saudi backers of LIV Golf, and Murray was front and center at a player meeting the afternoon of June 6 to hammer Monahan for doing the deal and not telling anyone.\n\nMonahan a week later stepped away for more than a month with anxiety-induced physical and mental issues. During that time away, Monahan turned off his cellphone for a month.\n\n\"We had a player meeting in Canada that all of you know was intense and heated. Grayson and others were extremely vocal about their displeasure about my decision to keep the membership in the heart. The criticism, it was 100% warranted,\" Monahan said.\n\nHe said when he finally turned his phone back on during his leave, one of the first text messages he saw was from Murray.\n\n\"A line in that text will always stay with me -- 'Jay I just want you to get healthy. I know everything is doing to work out for our tour and for the better,'\" Monahan said. \"He offered not condemnation but compassion. Instead of walking away from me, he offered to walk with me.\n\n\"I'll always be thankful for this act of kindness, and I'm not alone.\"\n\nMonahan said similar stories were shared in a private service for Murray and his family on Monday.\n\nPlayers, along with Memorial founder Jack Nicklaus and wife Barbara, filled the seats. Tour officials stood flanked to the left, with dozens of other players, caddies, equipment representatives and agents filling the ground to the right. More than a hundred spectators watched from a hill above the garden as a bagpipe played \"Amazing Grace\" at the end.\n\n\"I can only offer the assurance that Grayson's memory will serve as a continual reminder that the PGA Tour is a brotherhood that transcends competition,\" Monahan said. \"And our foremost responsibility is to care for each other and be kind. I can't imagine a prouder legacy.\"", "source": {"uri": "chicagotribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chicago Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_ferguson@chicagotribune.com", "name": "Doug Ferguson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Open_in_Hawaii", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sony Open in Hawaii"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_National_Invitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colonial National Invitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muirfield_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muirfield Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major depressive disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grayson Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Burns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Burns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbasol_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbasol Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesson_Hadley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chesson Hadley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Henley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Henley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolex", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Grace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazing Grace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Nicklaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cycling/Travel", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Death_Care/Online_Memorials", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Death Care/Online Memorials", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Colonial_Golf_14863.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624130", "eventUri": "eng-9624130", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 949, "textEnd": 955}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 2772, "textEnd": 2778}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Murray won the Sony Open and bought a Rolex.\n\nFor Monahan, Murray's death was personal.\n\nThis week marks one year since the PGA Tour did a secretive and shocking deal with the Saudi backers of LIV Golf, and Murray was front and center at a player meeting the afternoon of June 6 to hammer Monahan for doing the deal and not telling anyone.\n\nMonahan a week later stepped away for more than a month with anxiety-induced physical and mental issues. During that time away, Monahan turned off his cellphone for a month.\n\n\"We had a player meeting in Canada that all of you know was intense and heated. Grayson and others were extremely vocal about their displeasure about my decision to keep the membership in the heart. The criticism, it was 100% warranted,\" Monahan said.\n\nHe said when he finally turned his phone back on during his leave, one of the first text messages he saw was from Murray.\n\n\"A line in that text will always stay with me -- 'Jay I just want you to get healthy. I know everything is doing to work out for our tour and for the better,'\" Monahan said. \"He offered not condemnation but compassion. Instead of walking away from me, he offered to walk with me.\n\n\"I'll always be thankful for this act of kindness, and I'm not alone.\"\n\nMonahan said similar stories were shared in a private service for Murray and his family on Monday.\n\nPlayers, along with Memorial founder Jack Nicklaus and wife Barbara, filled the seats. Tour officials stood flanked to the left, with dozens of other players, caddies, equipment representatives and agents filling the ground to the right. More than a hundred spectators watched from a hill above the garden as a bagpipe played \"Amazing Grace\" at the end.\n\n\"I can only offer the assurance that Grayson's memory will serve as a continual reminder that the PGA Tour is a brotherhood that transcends competition,\" Monahan said. \"And our foremost responsibility is to care for each other and be kind. I can't imagine a prouder legacy.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of

What could I have said? Could I have in some way prevented this tragedy?\n\nThis is what PGA Tour professional and Jupiter resident Daniel Berger is feeling today, since learning fellow professional golfer Grayson Murray died by suicide May 25.\n\nBerger had lunch with Murray at Colonial Country Club on the Tuesday before the Charles Schwab Challenge. Two days later, they each played their first round of the tournament in Texas.\n\nOn the following Saturday, Murray was back at his home in Palm Beach Gardens after withdrawing from the event the day before. That morning, he took his life.\n\nNow Berger, who is 31 and was born the same year as Murray, wonders if there is anything he could have done to help Murray.\n\n\"What if I could have said one thing,\" Berger said Monday at the Bear's Club after qualifying for next week's U.S. Open.\n\n\"If I asked him is there anything you needed. Maybe that could have made a difference.\"\n\nMurray was a member at Dye Preserve Golf Club in Jupiter. Dye's roster includes several professionals who live in the area, like Berger.\n\nSeveral of Murray's peers from Dye and from the area played Monday's final qualifying at Jack Nicklaus' Bear's Club and remembered their friend.\n\nLuke Donald, who lives in Jupiter, was one of the first to react to the news on social media, saying how devastated he was and how Murray recently asked him for advice on how to play Augusta National, site of the Masters.\n\nDonald said Monday that conversation was at Dye Preserve.\n\n\"He came over and just started asking me,\" Donald said. \"It was his first Masters and it was a few week before Augusta. He wanted to know a lot about how I prepared and what I did, what's the secret to be successful around there. I shared some of the stuff I thought was helpful.\n\nDean Burmester, the LIV golfer who lives in Jupiter, met Murray at Torrey Pines when they were playing on the Korn Ferry Tour. He describes Murray as \"a grinder.\"\n\n\"It's tough,\" said Burmester, a Dye Preserve member who also qualified Monday for the U.S. Open. \"You miss seeing him on the range. He was a grinder. He found a way to practice pretty often. I know the whole club is hurting. I know all the members are going to miss him and all the pros are going to miss him a lot.\"\n\nDye member Joaquin Niemann from North Palm Beach had not practiced with Murray at the course, but spoke with him a few weeks ago at the PGA Championship in Louisville.\n\n\"It's a big loss,\" Niemann said. \"It's kind of like a weird feeling. You know someone, you saw him there, you competed against him and all of a sudden you see the news. It's super sad.\"\n\nMurray was open about his mental health issues, revealing in 2021 his struggles with anxiety, depression and alcohol. His peers were aware of his past but some said he appeared to have overcome those issues in recent months.\n\n\"Everybody is fighting their demons,\" Niemann said. \"He was obviously fighting his demons and he was able to stand up to them. He was able to play good golf and win a golf tournament.\"\n\nMurray won his second PGA Tour event in January at the Sony Open in Hawaii.\n\n\"It looked like he was on a good path,\" Donald said.\n\nMore: PGA Tour-LIV Golf Timeline: One year has passed and golf fans still are waiting for a deal\n\nAndrew Kozan got to know Murray while on the Korn Ferry Tour. The two then started playing rounds together at Dye.\n\n\"He was always fantastic to me, always checking to see how I was playing, always wanting me to play if we were in town,\" said Kozan, who lives in Jupiter. \"I felt like he really cared about me, always cared about others.\n\n\"It's definitely tough. He was a great guy, great friend, great person. Definitely made everyone better around him.\"\n\nYou are not alone. Help is available for people experiencing domestic violence or suicidal thoughts.

What could I have said? Could I have in some way prevented this tragedy?\n\nThis is what PGA Tour professional and Jupiter resident Daniel Berger is feeling today, since learning fellow professional golfer Grayson Murray died by suicide May 25.\n\nBerger had lunch with Murray at Colonial Country Club on the Tuesday before the Charles Schwab Challenge. Two days later, they each played their first round of the tournament in Texas.\n\nOn the following Saturday, Murray was back at his home in Palm Beach Gardens after withdrawing from the event the day before. That morning, he took his life.\n\nNow Berger, who is 31 and was born the same year as Murray, wonders if there is anything he could have done to help Murray.\n\n\"What if I could have said one thing,\" Berger said Monday at the Bear's Club after qualifying for next week's U.S. Open.\n\n\"If I asked him is there anything you needed. Maybe that could have made a difference.\"\n\nMurray was a member at Dye Preserve Golf Club in Jupiter. Dye's roster includes several professionals who live in the area, like Berger.\n\nSeveral of Murray's peers from Dye and from the area played Monday's final qualifying at Jack Nicklaus' Bear's Club and remembered their friend.\n\nLuke Donald, who lives in Jupiter, was one of the first to react to the news on social media, saying how devastated he was and how Murray recently asked him for advice on how to play Augusta National, site of the Masters.\n\nDonald said Monday that conversation was at Dye Preserve.\n\n\"He came over and just started asking me,\" Donald said. \"It was his first Masters and it was a few week before Augusta. He wanted to know a lot about how I prepared and what I did, what's the secret to be successful around there. I shared some of the stuff I thought was helpful.\n\n\"He looked like he was in a good spot.\"\n\nDean Burmester, the LIV golfer who lives in Jupiter, met Murray at Torrey Pines when they were playing on the Korn Ferry Tour. He describes Murray as \"a grinder.\"\n\n\"It's tough,\" said Burmester, a Dye Preserve member who also qualified Monday for the U.S. Open. \"You miss seeing him on the range. He was a grinder. He found a way to practice pretty often. I know the whole club is hurting. I know all the members are going to miss him and all the pros are going to miss him a lot.\"\n\nDye member Joaquin Niemann from North Palm Beach had not practiced with Murray at the course, but spoke with him a few weeks ago at the PGA Championship in Louisville.\n\n\"It's a big loss,\" Niemann said. \"It's kind of like a weird feeling. You know someone, you saw him there, you competed against him and all of a sudden you see the news. It's super sad.\"\n\nMurray was open about his mental health issues, revealing in 2021 his struggles with anxiety, depression and alcohol. His peers were aware of his past but some said he appeared to have overcome those issues in recent months.\n\n\"Everybody is fighting their demons,\" Niemann said. \"He was obviously fighting his demons and he was able to stand up to them. He was able to play good golf and win a golf tournament.\"\n\nMurray won his second PGA Tour event in January at the Sony Open in Hawaii.\n\n\"It looked like he was on a good path,\" Donald said.\n\nMore: PGA Tour-LIV Golf Timeline: One year has passed and golf fans still are waiting for a deal\n\nAndrew Kozan got to know Murray while on the Korn Ferry Tour. The two then started playing rounds together at Dye.\n\n\"He was always fantastic to me, always checking to see how I was playing, always wanting me to play if we were in town,\" said Kozan, who lives in Jupiter. \"I felt like he really cared about me, always cared about others.\n\n\"It's definitely tough. He was a great guy, great friend, great person. Definitely made everyone better around him.\"\n\nYou are not alone. Help is available for people experiencing domestic violence or suicidal thoughts.

He was a prodigious talent as a junior, won the Barbasol Championship in Kentucky as a rookie and struggled with alcoholism and tour discipline and anxiety. He spoke at the Sony Open about feeling like a failure for not living up to expectations.\n\nWebb Simpson, who first met an 8-year-old Murray in their home state of North Carolina, is not at the Memorial this year. He had another close friend, Russell Henley, read his thoughts.\n\nJay Green, who began caddying for him the week of the Sony Open, told of his hopes to buy a Rolex watch if they had a good year. Murray won the Sony Open and bought a Rolex.\n\nFor Monahan, Murray's death was personal.\n\nThis week marks one year since the PGA Tour did a secretive and shocking deal with the Saudi backers of LIV Golf, and Murray was front and center at a player meeting the afternoon of June 6 to hammer Monahan for doing the deal and not telling anyone.\n\nMonahan a week later stepped away for more than a month with anxiety-induced physical and mental issues. During that time away, Monahan turned off his cellphone for a month.\n\n\"We had a player meeting in Canada that all of you know was intense and heated. Grayson and others were extremely vocal about their displeasure about my decision to keep the membership in the heart. The criticism, it was 100% warranted,\" Monahan said.\n\nHe said when he finally turned his phone back on during his leave, one of the first text messages he saw was from Murray.\n\n\"A line in that text will always stay with me -- 'Jay I just want you to get healthy. I know everything is doing to work out for our tour and for the better,'\" Monahan said. \"He offered not condemnation but compassion. Instead of walking away from me, he offered to walk with me.\n\n\"I'll always be thankful for this act of kindness, and I'm not alone.\"\n\nMonahan said similar stories were shared in a private service for Murray and his family on Monday.\n\nPlayers, along with Memorial founder Jack Nicklaus and wife Barbara, filled the seats. Tour officials stood flanked to the left, with dozens of other players, caddies, equipment representatives and agents filling the ground to the right. More than a hundred spectators watched from a hill above the garden as a bagpipe played \"Amazing Grace\" at the end.\n\n\"I can only offer the assurance that Grayson's memory will serve as a continual reminder that the PGA Tour is a brotherhood that transcends competition,\" Monahan said. \"And our foremost responsibility is to care for each other and be kind. I can't imagine a prouder legacy.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcdfw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Monahan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jay Monahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Open_in_Hawaii", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sony Open in Hawaii"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGA_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PGA Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Grayson Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottie_Scheffler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scottie Scheffler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alcoholism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caddie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muirfield_Village", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muirfield Village"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dublin, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_National_Invitation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colonial National Invitation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Burns", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam Burns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbasol_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barbasol Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesson_Hadley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chesson Hadley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webb_Simpson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Webb Simpson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Players_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Players Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Henley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Henley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolex", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIV_Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LIV Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicklaus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Nicklaus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments_and_Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Tournaments and Events", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Golf/Golfers", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Death_Care/Online_Memorials", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Death Care/Online Memorials", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.nbcdfw.com/2024/06/AP24146812014863.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9624130", "eventUri": "eng-9624130", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 1078, "textEnd": 1084}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 2901, "textEnd": 2907}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 455220880, "relevance": 2}

Pep Guardiola's side will play a handful of friendlies across the pond, including clashes with Barcelona, Milan and Chelsea.\n\nCeltic are closer to full fitness than their upcoming English opponents having played three friendlies already. Their most recent was a convincing 4-0 victory over Major League Soccer side D.C. United in their first US outing.\n\nHere is 90min's guide to Man City vs Celtic.\n\nMan City may still be without goalkeeper Ederson for their pre-season opener, although he has travelled to the US. The Brazilian missed the Copa America this summer after fracturing his eye socket at the end of last season, with Stefan Ortega likely to start in his place.\n\nKasper Schmeichel is Brendan Rodgers' latest signing at Celtic, with the former Man City goalkeeper potentially making his debut against his former club. His fellow stopper and another summer recruit Viljami Sinisalo could also feature having made the \u00a31m move from Aston Villa.\n\nRodgers fielded a strong side against D.C. United several nights ago and should do the same against Man City. Despite being the subject of significant Atalanta interest, Matt O'Riley featured and scored twice in the 4-0 victory.\n\nCeltic predicted lineup vs Man City (4-3-3): Sinisalo; Ralston, Lagerbielke, Scales, Taylor; O'Riley, McGregor, Hatate; Forrest, Furuhashi, Palma.\n\nMan City should taste victory in their opening pre-season friendly but have been forced into choosing a youthful squad for their trip to the United States. That will give Celtic hope of causing something of an upset - if that's even possible in pre-season.\n\nHowever, while their defence is very inexperienced, City still have the likes of Erling Haaland, Oscar Bobb and Jack Grealish in the final third. It could be a high-scoring affair.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.C._United", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D.C.

He played the first half for the Hoops.\n\nGerman right wing Kuhn netted a first-half brace for Celtic, playing in a fourth pre-season match.\n\nDown 3-1 at half-time, City answered seconds into the second half on just-inserted 21-year-old Argentine substitute Maximo Perrone's goal, a left-footed shot from the right side into the far corner on his first touch of the ball.\n\nHaaland headed in a centering pass from countryman Oscar Bobb in the 57th minute to lift City level.\n\nALSO READ | Paris 2024 Olympics: New Zealand football team complains after Canadian team drone flown over its training session\n\nBut Celtic scored the winner in the 68th minute as Palma, who entered three minutes earlier, finished a three-man breakaway as City's defenders were caught flat-footed near midfield after pressing with the backline.\n\nCity substitute Ben Knight was denied an equalizer in the 76th minute when second-half Celtic keeper Viljami Sinisalo of Finland knocked the ball over the crossbar.\n\nKuhn, Schmeichel shine\n\nKuhn opened the scoring in the 13th minute, taking a pass on the right side and charging in on City starting goalkeeper Stefan Ortega, then firing a left-footed shot just inside the far post.\n\nSchmeichel denied Haaland in the 23rd minute with a right-hand save on a left-footed shot off a feed from James McAtee.\n\nIn the 31st, Schmeichel again denied Haaland, from the right side on a left-footed shot that Schmeichel swatted away with his left hand.\n\nBut Man City equalized in the 33rd minute as Haaland flicked the ball left to onrushing Bobb, who blasted a shot that deflected off Schmeichel and bounced into the goal.\n\nKuhn answered for Celtic in the 36th minute, rushing in from the right wing then pulling back the ball to evade a defender and curling a left-footed blast high into the goal.\n\nCeltic stretched the edge to 3-1 in the 44th minute when Kuhn delivered a perfect centering pass to Japan's fast-rushing Kyogo Furuhashi, who split two defenders, evaded Ortega and fired in a left-footed shot from a steep angle.\n\nMan City's US tour continues Saturday against AC Milan at New York's Yankee Stadium, with other matches next week against Barcelona at Orlando and Chelsea in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nCeltic will face Chelsea on Saturday in South Bend, Indiana.\n\nLatest on SportstarCeltic edges Manchester City 4-3 in US pre-season

He played the first half for the Hoops.\n\nGerman right wing Kuhn netted a first-half brace for Celtic, playing in a fourth pre-season match.\n\nDown 3-1 at half-time, City answered seconds into the second half on just-inserted 21-year-old Argentine substitute Maximo Perrone's goal, a left-footed shot from the right side into the far corner on his first touch of the ball.\n\nHaaland headed in a centering pass from countryman Oscar Bobb in the 57th minute to lift City level.\n\nBut Celtic scored the winner in the 68th minute as Palma, who entered three minutes earlier, finished a three-man breakaway as City's defenders were caught flat-footed near midfield after pressing with the backline.\n\nCity substitute Ben Knight was denied an equalizer in the 76th minute when second-half Celtic keeper Viljami Sinisalo of Finland knocked the ball over the crossbar.\n\n- Kuhn, Schmeichel shine -\n\nKuhn opened the scoring in the 13th minute, taking a pass on the right side and charging in on City starting goalkeeper Stefan Ortega, then firing a left-footed shot just inside the far post.\n\nSchmeichel denied Haaland in the 23rd minute with a right-hand save on a left-footed shot off a feed from James McAtee.\n\nIn the 31st, Schmeichel again denied Haaland, from the right side on a left-footed shot that Schmeichel swatted away with his left hand.\n\nBut Man City equalized in the 33rd minute as Haaland flicked the ball left to onrushing Bobb, who blasted a shot that deflected off Schmeichel and bounced into the goal.\n\nKuhn answered for Celtic in the 36th minute, rushing in from the right wing then pulling back the ball to evade a defender and curling a left-footed blast high into the goal.\n\nCeltic stretched the edge to 3-1 in the 44th minute when Kuhn delivered a perfect centering pass to Japan's fast-rushing Kyogo Furuhashi, who split two defenders, evaded Ortega and fired in a left-footed shot from a steep angle.\n\nMan City's US tour continues Saturday against AC Milan at New York's Yankee Stadium, with other matches next week against Barcelona at Orlando and Chelsea in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nCeltic will face Chelsea on Saturday in South Bend, Indiana.\n\njs/mlm\n\nMore from this section\n\nFederal funds fuel quarterly growth in U.S. down payment assistance programs, which now number 2,415\n\nOptimal Blue Launches New Generative AI

The goals were class and we attacked and showed how much we wanted to attack.\n\n\"It was a really good night and the supporters were amazing once again.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rico Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Bobb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Bobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyogo_Furuhashi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyogo Furuhashi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VD2c.V1PYf75rPwsWPBxhA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/0f8b13c178d24ea6bc91c02310b21cde", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756591", "eventUri": "eng-9756591", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4745098039215687, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

He played the first half for the Hoops.\n\nGerman right wing Kuhn netted a first-half brace for Celtic, playing in a fourth pre-season match.\n\nDown 3-1 at half-time, City answered seconds into the second half on just-inserted 21-year-old Argentine substitute Maximo Perrone's goal, a left-footed shot from the right side into the far corner on his first touch of the ball.\n\nHaaland headed in a centering pass from countryman Oscar Bobb in the 57th minute to lift City level.\n\nBut Celtic scored the winner in the 68th minute as Palma, who entered three minutes earlier, finished a three-man breakaway as City's defenders were caught flat-footed near midfield after pressing with the backline.\n\nCity substitute Ben Knight was denied an equalizer in the 76th minute when second-half Celtic keeper Viljami Sinisalo of Finland knocked the ball over the crossbar.\n\nMore from this section 'Sexist' falsehoods target Kamala Harris after Biden drops out One in Nine Americans Consider This Room

charging in on City starting goalkeeper Stefan Ortega, then firing a left-footed shot just inside the far post.\n\nSchmeichel denied Haaland in the 23rd minute with a right-hand save on a left-footed shot off a feed from James McAtee.\n\nIn the 31st, Schmeichel again denied Haaland, from the right side on a left-footed shot that Schmeichel swatted away with his left hand.\n\nBut Man City equalized in the 33rd minute as Haaland flicked the ball left to onrushing Bobb, who blasted a shot that deflected off Schmeichel and bounced into the goal.\n\nKuhn answered for Celtic in the 36th minute, rushing in from the right wing then pulling back the ball to evade a defender and curling a left-footed blast high into the goal.\n\nCeltic stretched the edge to 3-1 in the 44th minute when Kuhn delivered a perfect centering pass to Japan's fast-rushing Kyogo Furuhashi, who split two defenders, evaded Ortega and fired in a left-footed shot from a steep angle.\n\nMan City's US tour continues

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA \"top team\" is Pep Guardiola's glowing assessment of Celtic ahead of going head-to-head with the Hoops across The Pond.\n\nMan City take on Brendan Rodgers' Premiership champions in North Carolina, with the Citizens set to field a young side as Guardiola ramps up preparations to defend the Premier League title he claimed yet again last season. The clash with Celtic kicks off a run of glamour friendlies against European big guns with AC Milan, Barcelona and Chelsea to come before a derby clash with Manchester United in the Community shield at Wembley.\n\nGuardiola is eager to see how his young charges respond to the tests in front of them, starting with the Scottish champions. However, the priority is getting through unscathed as well as soaking in the experience of playing genuine heavyweights in the United States, while Guardiola singled out one City player he's keen to assess following a bruising loan at Sheffield United last term.\n\n\"No injuries,\" was the Spaniard's key message. \"That would be a big success we can have. We don't come here for the four trophies, we come here to have no injuries, to step up where we are. 80 or 85 per cent of the team is from the young academy players - the experience will be good.\n\n\"We get to play against of course, Celtic, in Scotland a top team. After it's Milan, come on, Barcelona and Chelsea. These guys playing against these teams, it's a good experience to see how they can compete. It's massively important for all of us, for them.\n\n\"I want to see all of them. I'm curious to see James McAtee especially, coming back from Sheffield. I have a high opinion of him. I would love to have him and keep him next season with us. He's a special guy who can play in space in the pockets. I think he grew up in terms of physicality and mentality, when you play in the Premier League fighting for relegation you get something special.\"\n\nRodgers' aims aren't dissimilar as he played down the existence of any rivalry between the clubs when quizzed by US media. The Celtic boss added: \"There's no rivalry, it's just a fantastic game for us to play. There's a friendship there between both clubs that has been there for many years.

Pep Guardiola's side will play a handful of friendlies across the pond, including clashes with Barcelona, Milan and Chelsea.\n\nCeltic are closer to full fitness than their upcoming English opponents having played three friendlies already. Their most recent was a convincing 4-0 victory over Major League Soccer side D.C. United in their first US outing.\n\nHere is 90min's guide to Man City vs Celtic.\n\nMan City may still be without goalkeeper Ederson for their pre-season opener, although he has travelled to the US. The Brazilian missed the Copa America this summer after fracturing his eye socket at the end of last season, with Stefan Ortega likely to start in his place.\n\nThe Cityzens are still missing a number of their players after recent international action, with the likes of Julian Alvarez, Phil Foden, John Stones, Kyle Walker, Nathan Ake and Rodri unavailable.\n\nMan City predicted lineup vs Celtic (4-3-3): Ortega; Lewis, Katongo, Mbete, Wilson-Esbrand; Perrone, Phillips, Wright; Bobb, Haaland, Grealish.\n\nKasper Schmeichel is Brendan Rodgers' latest signing at Celtic, with the former Man City goalkeeper potentially making his debut against his former club. His fellow stopper and another summer recruit Viljami Sinisalo could also feature having made the \u00c2\u00a31m move from Aston Villa.\n\nRodgers fielded a strong side against D.C. United several nights ago and should do the same against Man City. Despite being the subject of significant Atalanta interest, Matt O'Riley featured and scored twice in the 4-0 victory.\n\nCeltic predicted lineup vs Man City (4-3-3): Sinisalo; Ralston, Lagerbielke, Scales, Taylor; O'Riley, McGregor, Hatate; Forrest, Furuhashi, Palma.\n\nMan City should taste victory in their opening pre-season friendly but have been forced into choosing a youthful squad for their trip to the United States. That will give Celtic hope of causing something of an upset - if that's even possible in pre-season.\n\nHowever, while their defence is very inexperienced, City still have the likes of Erling Haaland, Oscar Bobb and Jack Grealish in the final third. It could be a high-scoring affair.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup_Final", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup Final"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Ortega", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stefan Ortega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.C._United", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D.C.

Just absolutely box office really.\"\n\nA second added: \"Looks like Kasper is trying his hardest not to burst out laughing.\"\n\nA third commented: \"A world famous rivalry - Celtic v Manchester City.\"\n\nAnother posted: \"The rivalry between Celtic and City?

add \"if there is one\" onto his question - so he wasn't absolutely suggesting there WAS an existing rivalry between the clubs.\n\nRodgers also fielded a question on Matt O'Riley's future amid

The Premier League title favourites have been involved in a relatively busy summer.\n\nBoss Pep Guardiola has seen Savinho arrive from Troyes, while young trio Taylor Harwood-Bellis, Tommy Doyle and Sergio Gomez have all departed on permanent deals. Guardiola is stepping up his side's preparation with a trip over the Atlantic.\n\nBut things have not started well for the champions, with a team captained by Erling Haaland and including Jack Grealish beaten by Celtic. Even before the game kicked off, it was shrouded in drama.\n\nAn hour before the game was due to start, supporters were told to evacuate the stadium after a severe weather warning. Bizarrely despite reports of storms, there wasn't actually any rain, with fans invited back in and the game kicking off only a few minutes late, though it was also delayed when some supporers invaded the pitch before being cleared by security.\n\nThings got worse for City fans when Brendan Rodgers side took the lead through Nicolas-Gerrit Kuhn. Oscar Bobb levelled things up for City when Haaland dummied a shot from Nico O'Reilly's cutback to allow the Norwegian to sweep the ball home.\n\nBut the game swung back into Celtic's favour when Kalvin Phillips was caught pressing too high up the pitch to allow Kuhn to net his second of the night. Phillips was hooked at half-time, with City pushing for him to leave the Etihad this summer.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY! Who should be Manchester City's top target? Comment below.\n\nThe midfielder was still on the pitch for Celtic to take a two-goal lead though, with Kyogo Furuhashi netting before the break. The Scots' intense pressing and incisive play caused major problems for City, with Guardiola making a raft of changes at the break.\n\nBut in a sign of his current squad's weakness, three of them - Callum Doyle, Yan Couto and Issa Kabore - are on their way out this summer. Despite the trio being on the verge of departing the club, they did help City get back into the game.\n\nBobb proved to be keep, with the youngster sending in a smart cross for Haaland to power a header home. City then equalised through Maximo Perrone before Luis Palma netted the final goal of a breathless game with 23 minutes left to hand Celtic the win.\n\nEven in the aftermath of the game, City have continued to be gripped by drama, with Guardiola admitting first-choice keeper Ederson could leave this summer. But the boss was happy with his side's performance.\n\n\"I saw many good things from the new and old players It wasn't easy, we have senior players up front and back four eight or nine who are so young. It's difficult in one department when so many are young but many good things, Oscar and Rico [Lewis] always in a high level,\" he said.\n\n\"Many things I saw were nice. We created chances, but they are so good with the pace and quality they have. You have to live these situations in pre-season and we'll do it from here. It was a good test, no injuries so far which are the main things.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

K\u00fchn grabbed his second of the game in the 36th minute, and Kyogo Furuhashi rounded Ortega for a tap in just before half-time.\n\nAfter an understandably rusty first-half performance, Pep Guardiola elected to bring on Ederson, Callum Doyle, Maximo Perrone, Mahamadou Susoho and Joel Ndala for Stefan Ortega, Luke Mbete, Kalvin Phillips, Nico O'Reilly and James McAtee.\n\nWith a slew of fresh faces on the pitch, City came alive. Maximo Perrone scored to make it 2-3 in the 46th minute when Oscar Bobb split a pair of defenders to set-up the Argentine. It was a wonderful goal set-up by the Norwegian winger, who carried the ball from the halfway line and into the box.\n\nThe Sky Blues equalised in the 57th minute when Erling Haaland found the back of the net from a close range header. The goal was set-up by Oscar Bobb once again, who lofted a cross in from the left by-line.\n\nHowever, Celtic able to respond themselves. Following another slew of substitutions, the Scottish side found themselves in behind Manchester City's defence and Kwon Hyeok-Kyu found Luis Palma at the far post for a tap-in for the winner.\n\nManchester City were unable to respond to Celtic's fourth goal, and lost their first match of the summer pre-season tour. The Premier League champions will now travel to New York City this weekend to take face AC Milan on Saturday July 27th at 11PM BST.\n\nHere are the Five Things We Learned from Manchester City's defeat to Celtic!\n\nManchester City have a history of starting slow, and this year is likely to be no different. Oscar Bobb however has a golden opportunity to shine with most of the squad needing extra rest from summer international tournaments.\n\nThe Norwegian international was directly responsible for all three Manchester City goals against Celtic, and will look to continue to shine throughout the rest of the pre-season tour. Let's just hope it translates to minutes during matches that count.\n\nThe 21-year-old Argentine midfielder made an instant impact with a great finish to try and claw Manchester City back into the match, and followed it up by completing all 15 of his passes in the second-half.\n\nYes, it is a pre-season friendly fixture against a significantly inferior side during a domestic competitive season, but Pep Guardiola has almost always rewarded good performances in pre-season.\n\nMidfield depth is a bit of a question mark, but Maximo Perrone appears to be a much better fit than Matheus Nunes, despite costing the club significantly less when he was recruited from Velez Sarsfield in January 2023.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen what other players are brought into the Manchester City midfield this summer, and unfortunately a big summer signing could once again knock Maximo Perrone out of the pecking order.\n\nAfter a rollercoaster season that saw him struggle to regain form when on loan at West Ham United, the former Leeds midfielder continued to look far from the standard required to feature consistently in Pep Guardiola's side during the meeting with Celtic.\n\nPhillips appeared to be a perfect squad player when he was first signed two seasons ago, yet it appears Manchester City might struggle to even find a team for him at this rate, and could have to settle for a second successive loan agreement.\n\nWith another temporary deal potentially on the cards for the 28-year-old midfielder, it just depends on if another squad will view him and decide he is worth taking on some of his wages in exchange for potentially lacklustre performances.\n\nPep Guardiola admitted that he is not sure whether Ederson will stay at Manchester City this summer, telling reporters after the meeting with Celtic that \"he has to make a decision\" in regards to his future.\n\nHowever, the Catalan's comments appeared to indicate that there has not been any recent contact between clubs in Saudi Arabia and Manchester City, amid growing reports of interest from Al-Ittihad.\n\nWhile Ederson has sometimes drawn the ire of Manchester City fans during his career, he remains one of the most unique players in Pep Guardiola's squad and finding a replacement with even a remotely similar distribution ability will prove to be quite the task.\n\nThere are seven senior players in the Manchester City squad for the summer pre-season tour, and eight if you want to count Oscar Bobb. Aside from Jack Grealish and Erling Haaland, three of them are goalkeepers, with Kalvin Phillips and Maximo Perrone joining them.\n\nThat leaves only two outfield players who had significant minutes last season.

Kuhn and Kyogo Furuhashi each scored before halftime to push Celtic's lead to 3-1. Bobb would later pick up an assist on a Haaland goal, and M\u00e1ximo Perrone added a goal of his own. Celtic's Luis Palma would ultimately score the go-ahead goal in the 68th minute.\n\nJACK GAUGHAN was in Chapel Hill North Carolina, where he picked out five things he learned from the match.\n\nErling Haaland celebrates scoring his team's third goal during on Tuesday evening\n\nManchester City trails Celtics, fitness-wise\n\nCeltic initially took City by surprise with their intense pressing and incisive play through the thirds. This was the fourth friendly Brendan Rodgers has overseen - having already faced Ayr, Queen's Park and DC United - and the Scottish champions appeared far sharper.\n\nThat is perhaps understandable given Guardiola's depleted squad didn't link up until last week, although the City boss did appear agitated at the space afforded in the middle third.\n\nKalvin Phillips - who is likely to leave on loan this summer - was caught pressing too high up the pitch in the build-up to Nicolas Kuhn's second goal, a good 25 yards ahead of play inside Celtic's half.\n\nKuhn's first had also come after oceans of space in central midfield, which won't have thrilled Guardiola. Phillips was taken off at half-time.\n\nThe Premier League champions were 3-1 down at that point before rallying to bring it back to 3-3 on an entertaining night. Honduran Luis Palma netted the winner with 23 minutes left.\n\nCity finished the evening with nine academy graduates on the pitch with an average age of 20.5 years - skewed by Al-Ittihad target Ederson, 31 next month.\n\nHaaland up and running\n\nKasper Schmeichel came through City's academy and turned out on 10 occasions for them before Joe Hart and Shay Given blocked his path. Now 37, the veteran had a bit of a point to prove on his Celtic debut - ironically, replacing the retired Hart as No 1.\n\nThe Dane relished the battle with Erling Haaland - who was sharp after a decent break owing to Norway not making the European Championship.\n\nTwice Haaland was thwarted when through on goal, more to do with strong goalkeeping than wayward finishing. Celtic have found themselves a highly motivated goalkeeper in Schmeichel.\n\nCaptain for the night, Haaland showed a nice dummy from Nico O'Reilly's cutback to allow Oscar Bobb to net City's first-half equaliser and dropped into space intelligently.\n\nHaaland was up and running in pre-season later, powering home a header from Bobb's smart cross before being withdrawn just after the hour. Schmeichel had been replaced by that point.\n\nBobb flashes potential\n\nSome interesting body language from Bobb, who finished the night with a goal and two assists - underlining his serious potential again.\n\nDespite the positive output, the Norwegian wasn't giving off the air of somebody who was overly satisfied by his own performance.\n\nThat can only be a good thing for Guardiola and Bobb made clear ahead of this game where he wants to improve over the coming season.\n\nThe 21-year-old revealed that he's willing to remain patient and not look for a temporary switch and doesn't necessarily judge his progression on bettering the 26 appearances in his breakthrough term.\n\n'I look at the players in my position, Bernardo Silva or Phil Foden,' Bobb said. 'They're consistent every session, every game. I can work and become a lot better. It's about constantly raising my level and becoming more consistent.'\n\nBobb added: 'Playing for this manager has always been a dream. If I have to wait a bit longer to get more playing time I don't mind.'\n\nCity supporters told to evacuate due to weather\n\nIt wouldn't be a City pre-season tour without the risk of a friendly falling foul to inclement weather and storms were brewing around Chapel Hill an hour before kick off.\n\nGrumbling supporters were told to evacuate Kenan Stadium, the university's college football arena, with a severe weather warning surrounding the area.\n\nThe scenes brought back memories to each of the last two trips, in the United States and then Asia. Two years to the day, City's game against Bayern Munich in Green Bay was hampered by horrific weather and the length of game cut short.\n\nAnd then in Seoul, the pitch seemed completely unplayable after a deluge ahead of a clash against Atletico Madrid.\n\nBizarrely here there wasn't even a drop of rain, fans invited back in and this starting just a few minutes late in front of 31,000 supporters.\n\nDoyle gives brief show before loan\n\nCallum Doyle was among the youngsters who came on at the break with City 3-1 down and is expected to join Norwich City on a season-long loan once the American tour is over. That will be a third consecutive Championship stint for the talented England Under-21 international - having impressed at Coventry City and Leicester City - as he continues to develop.\n\nDoyle won't be the only one to leave, with two others - who aren't on this trip - attracting interest from elsewhere. Borussia Dortmund are haggling over a fee for right back Yan Couto, with City valuing the Brazilian at around \u00a330million.\n\nAnd Issa Kabore, at Luton Town during their Premier League campaign, is on the market for \u00a315m and a target for Galatasaray.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Bobb", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Bobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Hill,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_de_Mallorca", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palma de Mallorca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyogo_Furuhashi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyogo Furuhashi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_celebration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal celebration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.C._United", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D.C.

The town hosted Premier League powerhouse Manchester City and 54-time Scottish Premiership champion Celtic FC as part of the FC Series, which offers international friendlies as part of the soccer preseason.\n\nStorefronts and restaurants shifting on Franklin Street to welcome fans traveling from all over, including a Manchester City pop-up shop on the corner of West Franklin and Church Street. Inside of it you'll find plenty of gear and posters pointing to the team's four-straight seasons finishing at the top of the Premier League standings. Outside of it, Man City fans stop and debate going inside, like North Carolina native Justin Ness.\n\n\"It's extremely exciting,\" Ness said of having his favorite team play a match at the home of his other favorite team (UNC). \"I'm glad that they got to bring some of their actual team players, (Erling) Haaland, (Jack) Grealish, people are actually going to be here, it's not just a B team, it's not somebody that nobody cares about, so it's very exciting that you actually get to see the team play.\"\n\nNess has been following Man City in earnest for the past five years. To say he's enjoyed the rise of the footballer going into his third year with the club is a bit of an understatement.\n\n\"I mean, the best player in the world right now, it's pretty exciting that he's going to be here in Kenan Memorial Stadium in the middle of North Carolina, it's not something that you really get to see unless you're traveling abroad,\" Ness said.\n\nThe 24-year-old Norweigan striker broke the record for most goals scored in a season his first year in the Premier League.\n\nIt's the second-ever international match at Kenan Stadium. Last July, Chelsea defeated Wrexham 5-0 in front of a sold-out crowd of 50,596. Proceeds from the match benefit UNC Children's Hospital. Last year, the University says $150,000 was donated. Last year, the match was estimated to bring in $15 million to the surrounding areas. This year, the crowds weren't as large, but representatives from the Chapel Hill/Orange County Visitors Bureau still estimate about a $10 million boost to the Triangle during what is normally a slow tourist month.\n\nOn the opposite side of the pitch is Celtic FC. While Manchester City might be the larger product on the world stage, this group of champions from Glasgow, Scotland aren't to be trifled with. They're one of only a handful of clubs to win more than 100 trophies. They've won Scottish football championships, in all of its forms, 54 times which is second only to its arch-rival the Rangers. They even call their stadium, Celtic Park, Paradise. Muray McArthur, a 19-year-old from Columbia, South Carolina has been there before with his family. The whole group are die hard supporters of Celtic FC.\n\n\"I was just born into a Celtic family, we have little baby Celtic kits,\" McArthur laughed.\n\nHe wasn't concerned about the blue kits playing for the Premier League. The green and white stripes of the Celtic is all that can catch his eye.\n\n\"This is a dream come true, honestly. Yesterday we saw the training, I got a signature from almost all the players,\" McArthur said.\n\nMcArthur and the Celtic faithful were rewarded: Celtic FC finished on top of Manchester City in the friendly, final score 4-3. Oscar Bobb, Maximo Perrone and Erling Haaland all scored for the Man City side, while Nicolar-Gerrit Kuhn finished with a brace and Kyogo Furuhashi and Luis Palma added two more.", "source": {"uri":

Haaland led the line in attack while prominent first-team members Grealish, Stefan Ortega, Oscar Bobb, Kalvin Phillips and Rico Lewis were also included.\n\nPerhaps with a lack of clear alternatives, Norwegian striker Haaland took the captain's armband and was in the thick of the action, dueling Celtic goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel throughout the contest.\n\nHaaland eventually got on the scoresheet in the 57th minute, being withdrawn a little over ten minutes later.\n\nIt's been a tough couple of years for Kalvin Phillips since he switched Leeds United for Man City. His manager has publicly declared he isn't keen on the midfielder, who couldn't turn things around during a brief loan at West Ham United in the second half of last season.\n\nWith the likes of Rodri, Kevin De Bruyne, Mateo Kovacic, John Stones and Matheus Nunes not yet available after their international excursions earlier in the summer, Phillips started alongside 19-year-old Nico O'Reilly in central midfield.\n\nThe England international completed 22 of his 26 passes and anticipated a couple of interceptions but made no tackles and was substituted at half-time. His future lies away from the Etihad Stadium, but which club will pick him up remains to be seen.\n\nBobb has already showed City fans glimpses of his undeniable talent, with one coming when he immaculately controlled De Bruyne's pass and tucked in a late winner against Newcastle United back in January.\n\nHe'll have to bide his time before getting regular competitive starts, but the 21-year-old showed he is ready for the step up with a starring role in the defeat to Celtic.\n\nThe Norway international equalised at 1-1 with a strike Schmeichel couldn't keep out and provided a brilliant assist consisting of sharp dribbling up the wing and a precise pass to Maximo Perrone. He then delivered the cross which Haaland nodded in at the back post to make it 3-3.\n\nThe international schedule means a number of City players are yet to link up with the squad ahead of the new season.\n\nDefenders Kyle Walker, Ruben Dias and Manuel Akanji were among those missing on Wednesday, meaning starts were handed to Josh Wilson-Esbrand, Luke Mbete-Tabu and Jahmai Simpson-Pusey. Midfielder Perrone - one of a number of City youngsters to look out for over the summer - also bagged a goal following his introduction in the second half.\n\nO'Reilly and Simpson-Pusey enjoyed their senior debuts and will hope for more minutes in City's next pre-season outing which comes against AC Milan on Saturday night.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Bobb", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Bobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Stadium_(Bristol)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Stadium (Bristol)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rico Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matheus_Nunes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matheus Nunes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodri_(footballer,_born_1996)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodri (footballer, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leeds United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Ortega", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefan Ortega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Ham United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wilson-Esbrand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Wilson-Esbrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R\u00faben_Dias", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "R\u00faben Dias"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Manchester_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City of Manchester Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dribbling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dribbling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Bobb's second assist was a looping cross the Erling Haaland powered in, showing what he can do with headers.\n\nWe've rounded up a list of things that may have gone under the radar as everyone tried to keep track of what was going on in North Carolina.\n\nALSO READ: Man City ratings with Bobb brilliant but Phillips poor\n\nALSO READ: Fans evacuated before Man City vs Celtic friendly amid 'severe warning'\n\nHaaland takes the captaincy\n\nHaaland has not shied away from speaking his mind in the dressing room since joining City but it was still worth noting that he was handed the captain's armband against Celtic. There weren't many other senior players on show but Stefan Ortega and Jack Grealish could both have laid claims to it.\n\nGuardiola clearly didn't think having the captaincy would burden Haaland in any way and the Norwegian kept it even when Ederson came on in the second half in another show of strength. The Norwegian passed it onto the goalkeeper when he was substituted in the second half. Could Haaland be an outside bet to join the leadership group this season?\n\nLewis must wait for wish\n\nRico Lewis made it plain last week when he sat down with reporters that he sees his future as a No.8 midfielder, but he may not get much time there on this tour. Lewis started against Celtic as a right-back and stayed there when a handful of changes were made at the start of the second half.\n\nWith no Kyle Walker, John Stones or Manu Akanji on tour, there aren't many other options for right-back other than Lewis so he may have to carry on playing there for now even if he has ambitions to be further forward.\n\nCrowd far from full\n\nCity played in a stadium able to host 50,000 people but there looked to be tens of thousands who had stayed away. Expectations for the Blues were high given their gains in the United States and the way their matches sold out in Korea and Japan last year, but playing in a student-heavy city at a time when the students weren't there always looked like an odd choice. City CEO Ferran Soriano will hope that there is more money to be made from the New York, Florida, and Ohio legs.\n\nDeja vu for Phillips\n\nKalvin Phillips had started last summer full of energy to prove Pep Guardiola and everyone else wrong from his first season at the Etihad and earn a pace in the starting XI. It went about as far from what he had planned as possible.\n\nThere may be little chance of him staying at the Etihad, but it was still wincing to see him look so far out of his comfort zone while others - such as Maximo Perrone - instantly settled in.", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "simon_bajkowski@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Simon Bajkowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Bobb", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Bobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Header (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rico Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ederson_(footballer,_born_1993)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ederson (footballer, born 1993)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Ortega", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefan Ortega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017\u201318_Manchester_City_F.C._season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2017\u201318 Manchester City F.C. season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferran_Soriano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferran Soriano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Stones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etihad_Airways", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Etihad Airways"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Akanji", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Akanji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article29600128.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2162584090jpgn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756591", "eventUri": "eng-9756591", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nA severe weather warning forced the Kenan Stadium to be evacuated before kick-off. But it was Celtic who brought the storm on the pitch.\n\nIt might only be pre-season but Brendan Rodgers's men produced a thunderous show against a Manchester City skippered by superstar Erling Haaland to send out a severe warning of their own to the rest of Scottish football. Rodgers rolled out a strong side - and they delivered a strong message. Celts mean business again.\n\nLightning quick Nicolas Kuhn bagged a stunning double before a subline assist for Kyogo to leave the European champions stunned at the break. And to top it off there was a brilliant debut from Kasper Schmeichel - who made a couple of cracking stops to keep out Haaland.\n\nThe second period was slightly different story with all the usual pre-season subs but while City got back level, Luis Palma pounced again to ensure a morale boosting win. Even though City were behind in pre-season and not fully flexing their squad, it's clear Celtic are looking sharp ahead of the new season - and that's before Rodgers properly gets going in the transfer market.\n\nThe Hoops boss rolled out a strong starting line-up in Chapel Hill - with only really Cameron Carter-Vickers and Alistair Johnston missing. And while Pep Guardiola started a lot of youngsters, he still had a few heavy hitters and top prospects.\n\nCeltic survived an early scare but they were not intimidated though. Rodgers's men pressed high and pinged the ball around. Kyogo wasn't far off when he blasted wide from Daizen Maeda's cutback but the Scottish champs did go ahead inside 14 minute with a superb opener after Matt O'Riley picked out Kuhn's run and the Germany raced though and slotted into the bottom corner.\n\nThe Hoops were playing some slick stuff but danger lurked. Schmeichel made a sensational block to deny Haaland - and then roasted O'Riley for the careless ball out from the back. And there was an even better stop soon after when the big Norwegian tried to clip would around him, only for the no.1 to throw up a giant paw to bat the ball away.\n\nHe nearly managed to miraculously keep out the City leveller after 32 minutes as well, when he hurled himself in front of Oscar Bobb's drive, only for effort to eventually sneak over the line.\n\nCelts stormed back though - with Kuhn again torturing City right back Josh Wilson-Esbrand when he sped on to Reo Hatate's ball, then slashing inside and curling high past Stefan Ortega.\n\nIt got even better before the break with more Kuhn magic, this time sensationally sending Kyogo scampering with a curling pass with the outside of his boot and the striker went round the keeper to tuck away the third.\n\nThe second period was always going to be a different story with so many subs and it took City less than two minutes after the restart to pull one back when Max Perrone cut inside and slotted past sub keeper Viljami Sinisalo.\n\nThe Finn made a couple of smart stops in the second half with Pep's side pushing before Haaland did a decent impression of local hero Michael Jordon when he leapt high at the back post to nod in an equaliser. Celts were not done though and Palma pounced on Kwon Hyeok-Kyu's square ball to go ahead again and round off a thrilling night.\n\nKuhn a new man\n\nCeltic fans are getting anxious about the lack of new outfield recruits this summer. But Nicolas Kuhn has come back looking like a new signing.\n\nThe former Rapid Vienna winger showed in flashes last term but he's been like a different player this pre-season. He impressed against DC United at the weekend but this was another level as he absolutely destroyed England under 21 full back Josh Wilson-Esbrand.\n\nHis two goals were down to sheer pace then composure, then his pass for Kyogo to bag the third was sheer class. Hoops fans might be soon seeing the 'quality' that Rodgers promised when he signed.\n\nCeltic in safe hands\n\nKasper Schmeichel might only have had one training session with the Hoops squad since arriving at the weekend. But it already looks like the keeper has been at the club for years. Even after just one appeared the Dane is clearly the real deal.\n\nAnd it is also obvious he's a top keeper and is going to be a massive presence. Shmeichel made a couple of sensational saves to keep out Erling Haaland.\n\nBut it was his reaction to one of them that spoke volumes. He let Matt O'Riley have it in no uncertain terms after the playmaker got caught on the ball. Celtic are in safe hands with their new no.1.\n\nMaeda up and running\n\nCeltic fans will have been thrilled to see Daizen Maeda back in business - and back to his usual tireless best. The Japan star looked especially energetic as he relentlessly pressed the City back line.\n\nHe superbly teed up Kyogo early on and was Celtic's main attacking outlet. He never stopped for a second. Goodness knows how he managed it with the temperature still up at nearly 90 degrees at kick-off. Maeda has England cap Rico Lewis on toast at times and he looks ready to torment Scottish defences again this season.\n\nHigh im-pressing\n\nIt was a bold strategy, and it led to a couple of anxious moments at the back, but this was exactly how Brendan Rodgers wants his Celtic side to play. Regardless of the opposition.\n\nCelts - led by running machines Maeda and Kyogo - pressed City right on the edge of their own box. And it made them uncomfortable. They were arguably surprised by the intensity of the Hoops in a preseason friendly.\n\nBut this was the Rodgers vision. The big question is if they can do it in the Champions League, but it will certainly be interesting - and entertaining - to find out.\n\nGlobal player\n\nThe sight of so many Man City 'fans' was a real eye-opener out in North Carolina. Pep Guardiola admitted before the game that when he first came to the US with the club there was barely one man and his dog watching.\n\nNow there are thousands. It's a sign of the marketing machine that is the English Premier League. But it also shows the strength of Celtic's global brand. There were plenty of Hoops fans at the Kenan Stadium but it was more than just backsides on seats.\n\nThis friendly game was shown in 130 countries around the world. Sure, most might have been interested in the modern powerhouse in sky blue. But Celtic have thrilled their own supporters and perhaps won over a few new ones on this lucrative trip to the States.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_gannon@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Michael Gannon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_O'Riley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Matt O'Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wilson-Esbrand", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Wilson-Esbrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Johnston", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alistair Johnston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daizen_Maeda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daizen Maeda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_de_Mallorca", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palma de Mallorca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenan_Memorial_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kenan Memorial Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football in Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Carter-Vickers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Carter-Vickers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Bobb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Bobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reo_Hatate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reo Hatate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Ortega", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefan Ortega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SK_Rapid_Wien", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SK Rapid Wien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rico Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.C._United", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D.C.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nManchester City stars Joleon Lescott and Steve Howey are in agreement that Celtic's performance in Tuesday's pre-season friendly was far superior to the current Premier League champions.\n\nThe Bhoys defeated City 4-3 in a competitive friendly that saw the debut of Kasper Schmeichel and a stellar performance from Nicolas Kuhn, which had the Glasgow side 3-1 up by half-time. Kuhn was on the scoresheet twice, with striker Kyogo Furuhashi and Luis Palma adding to the tally.\n\nLescott admitted that his former side were \"taught a lesson\" by Brendan Rodgers' Celtic and the \"experience\" will be good for the younger squad members. He told Man City TV: \"It's not about them doing well it's about them learning and you sometimes learn more from bad experiences.\n\n\"So that's important the fact that they've been able to experience different players and for a lot of them this will be the highest level of competitive opponent that they have faced.\n\n\"Whether it's pace, tactical ability or the understanding of the game, they wouldn't have experienced all them components in one game so far. So it's a massive learning curve and hopefully something then they'll cherish and realise there's still a long way to go for them as individuals.\"\n\nFormer City hero Howey was also full of praise for Kuhn's performance. He said: \"You've got to say that Celtic just look quicker, look stronger, look fitter and I think it was a little bit of an eye-opener, especially on the left-hand side, the lad who got the two goals.\n\n\"He's dangerous and he gives anybody a hard time. I think if he comes across fullbacks, week in week out, who's fit he would still give them a hard time and give players a hard time in the Premier League. He's a good player and also he's obviously caused some problems.\"\n\nThe friendly consisted primarily of younger and less experienced players on both sides, but Erling Haaland and Jack Grealish got a run out against the Scottish champions, with Oscar Bobb and Kalvin Phillips also making an appearance.\n\nRodgers expressed his delight at his team's five-star performance and quelled fans' worries over the club's transfer activity. \"I think whenever you play Pep's teams they're so complex in how they play,\" said the Celtic boss.\n\n\"Physically it was a step up for us but also tactically because you've got to be so concentrated and press in the right moments because you can't always press or else you end up running more.\n\n\"I thought the players dealt with that so well. Some of the football we played was excellent. The goals again were attacking and showed how much we want to attack. I think it's a big testament to the players, how hard they're training and working. We're pushing to be defensively strong and you've got to be aggressive.\n\n\"What I've been really impressed with in the games is that we're making the last step much better. The guys are starting to get in and make the last step, win the ball and disrupt to bring a bit of chaos to the game.\"\n\nOn transfers, he added: \"I had a long meeting with Michael [Nicholson] and Chris [McKay], so we know the targets we want to bring in. There's still a long way to go in the window.\n\n\"I think my concentration is that we know what we want to do, we know the priority positions that we want to improve. Whilst the club gets on with that, myself and the coaches are really focused on the improvement of this team.\n\n\"So at some point before the end of August, I would expect us to have the players we want in. I'll make it clear to the Celtic supporters, we know we want to improve the squad and by the end of the window shuts, I expect us to be that.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abbie_meehan@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Abbie Meehan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joleon_Lescott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joleon Lescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Howey_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Steve Howey (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyogo_Furuhashi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyogo Furuhashi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Glasgow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Bobb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Bobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32580956.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/21_GettyImages-2146698561.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756591", "eventUri": "eng-9756591", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

That is not to say that there won't be a signing made in midfield, though.\n\nThere was a bid for Anthony Gordon and interest in Leny Yoro. We've seen Riccardo Calafiori rumored, with Takefusa Kubo strongly linked. But there have also been whispers that Celtic's central midfielder Matt O'Riley is on the Reds' radar.\n\nHe reportedly carries a $34m (\u00a326m/\u20ac31m) price tag, relatively modest by Liverpool standards. His manager, former Reds boss Brendan Rodgers, has commented on O'Riley's future having been asked about it on Celtic's pre-season tour of the United States.\n\nREAD MORE: Matt O'Riley 'increased offer' made as Liverpool competition ramps up for Celtic midfielder\n\nREAD MORE: Liverpool given record fee demand for Matt O'Riley transfer as Celtic responds to interest\n\n\"There's no update, we're fairly relaxed,\" Rodgers said (via The Standard). \"You saw him in the game the other night. He's working well and is very focused.\"\n\nThe game in question was a 4-0 friendly win against DC United. O'Riley captained the side and scored the first two goals.\n\n\"Naturally, when you're a really good young player who's committed and professional as he is, he will acquire attention,\" Rodgers continued. \"He's working so well, there's nothing to report on him.\"\n\nWhile keeping his cards close to his chest, the Bhoys' boss conceded that the player may leave. \"I think we all understand, the people close to Celtic understand the model Celtic works to,\" he said. \"Matt's been at the club for three years. He's developed into the player he has and he knows the privilege it is to play for Celtic. Of course, naturally, how it works is the player gets that opportunity to move on.\"\n\n\"Celtic is a club where you can move on but you don't have to and it's a very difficult club to move on from. Naturally with the wages that are on offer for players, then that makes it a real challenge for Celtic to compete at that level,\" Rodgers admitted.\n\n\"But what I've seen with Matt is he's a first-class professional. He's a really humble guy who's very devoted to his profession and he knows what he has here so we're all quite relaxed with it. Every player has a value but we see him as a really important player for us and whilst he is here, we'll continue to develop him and help him improve.\"\n\nLiverpool.com says: O'Riley faced Feyenoord twice in the Champions League last season so Arne Slot will know what he can deliver, not least as he assisted Celtic's winner in December. Similarly, he played with Fabio Carvalho and Harvey Elliott at youth team level with Fulham if Liverpool need a player opinion or two.

been learned by some players in Pep Guardiola's side.\n\nThe 4-3 win left the Celtic fans raving about Nicolas Kuhn as the German winger gave the Man City defence a torrid time in the first half.\n\nMatt O'Riley also put in a quality performance with his involvement in three of Celtic's goals and Kyogo Furuhashi did what he does best with a piercing run to beat the City backline for his first goal in the US Tour.\n\nIt was a great performance from the Bhoys that left Pep Guardiola praising Celtic's 'quality' but it was also an 'experience' for some of City's players that former defender, Joleon Lescott, says will never have had before.\n\nMan City faced 'highest level' of performance vs Celtic\n\nThe former England defender wasn't too despondent about City's loss to Celtic but did say that some of their players will have learned from Celtic's 'tactical ability' in the game.\n\nLescott said [Man City TV], \"It's not about them doing well it's about them learning and you sometimes learn more from bad experiences.\n\n\"So that's important the fact that they've been able to experience different players and for a lot of them this will be the highest level of competitive opponent that they have faced.\n\n\"Whether it's pace, tactical ability or the understanding of the game, they wouldn't have experienced all them components in one game so far.\n\n\"So it's a massive learning curve and hopefully something then they'll cherish and realise there's still a long way to go for them as individuals.\"\n\nEven though it was a pre-season friendly, winning against a team that possesses the quality that Man City does should not be understated either.\n\nOscar Bobb is one of the most highly-rated players to come out of Norway after Erling Haaland who also took part in the game.\n\nCity also started Kalvin Phillips and Jack Grealish as Pep Guardiola gave important first-team players a run out alongside some of their young academy players.\n\nBrendan Rodgers was delighted with Celtic's performance against the Premier League giants and will be hoping for a repeat against Chelsea when both teams meet in Indiana in a few days time.", "source": {"uri":

The former Leicester City shot-stopper has seen plenty of world-class forwards in his glittering career.\n\nSo his words carry significant weight when he gushed over Man City striker Erling Haaland in North Carolina on Tuesday night.\n\n\"He's a beast,\" Schmeichel said of Haaland when asked by The Sporting News what it is that makes the Man City star so formidable. \"He's an absolute beast. He is one of the best strikers in the world without question. He has everything you want -- he has pace, he has power, he has good movement, he has intelligence, he has incredible leap as you saw on his goal, so...he's the complete package.\"\n\nSchmeichel could say that all with a smile, because he made two incredible saves on Haaland efforts through the first half of the pre-season friendly, helping Celtic to a 4-3 win at Kenan Stadium. The 37-year-old Dane was playing in his first match for the Scottish club, having just signed this summer as a free agent after his release from Belgian club Anderlecht.\n\nHaaland would make his mark on the match in the second half, towering over a defender to head home his first goal of the new season against substitute goalkeeper Viljami Sinisalo.\n\nCity fans hope that it's an indication of Haaland's intent to crack on and get going early. The 24-year-old won the Premier League Golden Boot award for the second straight season last year, but did so in significantly less emphatic fashion than the previous campaign when he set the league's single-season goal scoring record.\n\nThe Norwegian ate Celtic center-backs for lunch throughout his 68 minutes of action in Chapel Hill, making scything runs between the partnership while also showing his aerial prowess. He played a significant role in City's first goal as well, producing a brilliant dummy to latch onto the ball all alone for a 33rd-minute equalizer.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leicester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leicester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Hill,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viljami_Sinisalo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viljami Sinisalo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Golden_Boot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Golden Boot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.S.C._Anderlecht", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "R.S.C.

The US is a big commercial market for City, and they will be back in the country next summer for the expanded FIFA Club World Cup tournament.\n\nSo while the club become accustomed to the summer heat of locations like New York and Orlando, fans back in the UK will have to stay up until the early hours to follow their side during pre-season.\n\nALSO READ: Man City vs Celtic live Haaland captains side as Phillips starts amid weather warning\n\nALSO READ: Man City to hold Kevin De Bruyne talks after Pep Guardiola admission and transfer interest\n\nEach of the four locations City are playing in this summer are five hours behind the UK, meaning a typical evening kick-off in North Carolina or Ohio is a midnight game back home. City's opening friendly vs Celtic in Chapel Hill, NC, is an 12.30am kick-off in the UK, before the clash with AC Milan at Yankee Stadium in New York is slightly earlier at 11pm BST.\n\nFans following from home will have to tune in at midnight for the clash against Barcelona in Orlando, before the earliest kick-off of the lot in Columbus for the final friendly - a relatively-sociable 10.30pm start against Chelsea. But before fans start planning their nights to follow City, it may help to know that the games may kick off later than advertised, resulting in slightly later finishes.\n\nAs City outlined their broadcast schedule for the tour games, they reminded fans that 'all matches in the US kick off around 10 minutes later than advertised due to the cultural convention of the country.'\n\nAnother factor to consider is that summer in the USA can often see sudden inclement weather impact games - with sports stadia often pausing or delaying fixtures if thunderstorms hit the area or lightning is detected within a certain radius of the game.\n\nIndeed fans were evacuated prior to City's friendly vs Celtic around 90 minutes before kick off in North Carolina. Spectators were told to evacuate the stadium due to a 'severe weather' warning, and those already taking their seats promptly left. The area had been subject to sporadic storms in the days leading up to the fixture and there had been a flash flood warning the day before.\n\nFans were told to leave the stadium completely, but ground staff continued to water the pitch and there were blue skies overhead with the game not in doubt.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nManchester City began their pre-season campaign with a high-scoring affair against Celtic - with Oscar Bobb the standout for Pep Guardiola's men.\n\nBobb ended the game with two assists and a goal, with Erling Haaland also on the mark with a powerful header. City went in at half-time 3-1 down after some poor defending, with Bobb's opener briefly drawing them level at 1-1 as he squeezed a shot under Kasper Schmeichel.\n\nSubstitute Maximo Perrone pulled one back immediately after half time with Haaland's header making it 3-3, both set up by Bobb. But Luis Palma had the easiest finish to win the game for Celtic as City's inexperienced high line was caught out.\n\nALSO READ: Fans evacuated before Man City vs Celtic friendly amid 'severe weather warning'\n\nALSO READ: Man City vs Celtic highlights and reaction as Haaland and Bobb score\n\nThis is how we rated the City players at the Kenan Memorial Stadium:\n\nStefan Ortega\n\nHelpless for the three goals that went past him, with fault lying ahead of him. But perhaps significant that he started ahead of Ederson. 6.\n\nRico Lewis\n\nSmart in and out of possession, inverting into midfield in the new-look system that saw both full-backs pushing inside. 7\n\nLuke Mbete\n\nPushed up needlessly for the first goal and slightly out of position for the second and third. Replaced at half-time. 5\n\nJahmai Simpson-Pusey\n\nThe Youth Cup-winning captain looked a little nervy on his first senior outing, and perhaps a little naive out of possession. But a great experience and one he will learn from. 6\n\nJosh Wilson-Esbrand\n\nAsked to invert inside, he looked fine with the ball but Celtic targeted him without it and all three first half goals came on his side. Improved in the second half. 5\n\nKalvin Phillips\n\nStarted the game by playing Ortega into trouble and was replaced at half-time having allowed Celtic to run through the midfield with ease. Often far to high up, leaving plenty of space in the position he should be in. 4\n\nJames McAtee\n\nBacked by Guardiola to shine this season, he struggled to influence the game on his first outing and was replaced at the break. Not a bad performance, but not a great one. 6\n\nNico O'Reilly\n\nA first senior game saw flashes of brilliance with an effort that hit the side netting, but also some moments where he took too long on the ball. Like Simpson-Pusey, a solid-enough start with the first team. 6\n\nOscar Bobb\n\nA goal he celebrated reluctantly, but he collected two fine assists - one mazy run to set up Perrone and another clipped cross for Haaland. He backed up his statement pre-match that he is in the right place and is ready to take his chance. 8\n\nJack Grealish\n\nNo goals or assists, but played the decisive ball for the first and was involved in most attacks. A mature performance and one Guardiola will be pleased with. 7\n\nErling Haaland\n\nWould have had a hat-trick but for Kasper Schmeichel's heroics. Powered in a second-half header to delight the crowd. He looks ready to go this season after a summer off. 7\n\nSubs\n\nMaximo Perrone (on 45)\n\nA smart finish for the goal immediately after half-time to build on his loan in La Liga last season. 7\n\nEderson (on 45)\n\nVery little to do and no chance for Celtic's fourth. 6\n\nMahamadou Susoho (on 45)\n\nMidfield looked much more secure in the second half. 6\n\nJoel Ndala (on 45)\n\nKept the full-back busy, one shot that was saved. 7\n\nJacob Wright (on 63)\n\nSome good touches. 6\n\nJadel Katongo (on 63)\n\nDecent defending but caught out for winner. 6\n\nBen Knight (on 66)\n\nLooked bright on the left. 6\n\nMicah Hamilton (on 66)\n\nPlayed up front and looked lively. 6", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_bray@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "Joe Bray", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Bobb", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Bobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Ortega", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stefan Ortega"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasper_Schmeichel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kasper Schmeichel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rico Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wilson-Esbrand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Wilson-Esbrand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Mbete", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Mbete"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ederson_(footballer,_born_1993)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ederson (footballer, born 1993)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalvin_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kalvin Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Stadium_(Bristol)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Stadium (Bristol)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Knight_(footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Knight (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McAtee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James McAtee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilton_Academical_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamilton Academical F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life_Balance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Work-Life Balance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/article29600093.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2162583844.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756591", "eventUri": "eng-9756591", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 135, "relevance": 1}

More info\n\nStateside Celtic fans lapped up the chance to see their heroes in America - and couldn't resist the chance at a dig at their rivals Rangers during their thrilling pre-season friendly win over Manchester City.\n\nThe Hoops might have been taking on Pep Guardiola's superstars almost 4000 miles away across the Big Pond but when you are one half of one of the fiercest rivalries in world football then you will take any opportunity to have a dig at your local foes and the champions are emboldened after a season where they finished undefeated against their eternal foes.\n\nAnd after a storming start from Celtic which saw them take the lead through Nicolas Kuhn, the fans inside the Kenan Memorial Stadium at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, could be heard chanting \"Are you Rangers in disguise\". Kuhn went on to add another with Kyogo Furuhashi and Luis Palma also on target in a 4-3 victory over the English Premier League champions.\n\nSupporters watching the action on Celtic TV picked up on the chant with one saying on social media: \"The American Bhoys are some laugh.\"\n\nSupporters of both sides had to be evacuated around 90 minutes before the game due to a '\"severe weather\" warning, and those already taking their seats promptly left. The area had been subject to sporadic storms in the days leading up to the fixture and there had been a flash flood warning the day before.\n\nFollow Record Sport on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram for all of the up-to-the minute breaking news, video and audio on the SPFL, the Scotland national team and beyond.\n\nYou can also follow our dedicated Celtic podcast page and sign up to our newsletters to make sure you never miss a beat throughout the season.\n\nWe've also entered the world of WhatsApp with our Celtic community up and running.

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nImpressed Pep Guardiola went out his way to talk up Celtic's ability to punish his Manchester City side on the break as the Scottish champions defeated his side 4-3.\n\nThe footballing icon was probed post-match in Chapel Hill, North Carolina as a Nicolas Kuhn brace, a Kyogo strike and a Luis Palma winner downed a City side that fielded the likes of Erling Haaland and Jack Grealish. And while the 53-year-old was upbeat about several aspects of his own team, he was keen to shower Brendan Rodgers' side with praise.\n\nSpeaking after the thriller Stateside, Guardiola said: \"Many things I saw were nice. We created a lot of chances, we scored, we could not control the transitions well, because they are really good with the pace and quality they have. They had a better rhythm than us. You have lived through these kinds of situations in the pre-season and we are going to build from here. They (Celtic) linked really well inside. We didn't cover much well. But it is what it is. Sometimes it happens. I give credit for the quality of the opponents.\"\n\nAnd Guardiola was effusive in his praise of rising stars Oscar Bobb and Rico Lewis with both impressing against Rodgers' side as both aim to become regulars under City.\n\nHe said: \"I saw many good things from the new and old players. It wasn't easy, we have senior players up front and back four eight or nine who are so young. It's difficult in one department when so many are young but many good things, Oscar and Rico are always at a high level.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Record"}, "authors": [{"uri": "graeme_young@dailyrecord.co.uk", "name": "Graeme Young", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapel_Hill,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chapel Hill, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erling_Haaland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erling Haaland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_de_Mallorca", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palma de Mallorca"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Grealish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Grealish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rico_Lewis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rico Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Bobb", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar Bobb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_(footballer,_born_1991)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oscar (footballer, born 1991)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/article33311550.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2024-07-24-at-074800.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9756591", "eventUri": "eng-9756591", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4274509803921569, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

While this sparked confusion on social media, some fans believe they have the answer. Grealish represented the Republic of Ireland at youth level before switching allegiances to England at senior level.\n\nJack Grealish was subjected to loud boos during Manchester City's 4-3 pre-season loss against Celtic in North Carolina. Fans believe they have figured out the reason behind the jeers being directed towards the England international.\n\nThe goal-heavy fixture at the Kenan Memorial Stadium was the first of Pep Guardiola's side's games ahead of the 2024-25 season. Grealish was the biggest name player in the Citizens' team, alongside Erling Haaland, as the majority of their stars are still on holiday after their Euro 2024 and Copa America exploits.\n\nYoungster Oscar Bobb put in an impressive display despite the loss as the Norwegian wonderkid netted City's opening goal before setting up both Maximo Perrone and Haaland. Brendan Rodgers' side emerged victorious from the affair thanks to goals from Nicolas-Gerrit Kuhn (x2), Kyogo Furihashi, and Luis Palma. The Scottish champions got one over the English juggernaut while their fans made their feelings clear to one of City's star men.\n\nRelated 14 Premier League Players Whose Value Dropped Most (2023/24)\n\nThe 2023/24 season was one to forget for the likes of Marcus Rashford and Raheem Sterling, and their transfer values prove that.\n\nWhy Celtic Fans Were Booing Supporters believe they've figured it out\n\nCeltic have a long history and connection with Ireland and fans think this is the reason behind the boos towards Grealish. Despite now being capped by England 36 times, the winger initially represented the Irish youth sides before switching allegiances to the Three Lions.\n\nOne supporter asked on social media: \"Grealish getting booed in a random pre-season friendly in America,\" while another replied: \"He ditched Ireland for England - Celtic fans won't forget that easily.\" When another fan asked why Celtic fans would be upset by this, another supporter replied: \"Need to know your history of Celtic and Ireland to understand the betrayal Grealish done changing to England national team.\"\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Jack Grealish has scored just 14 times in his 125 appearances for Manchester City.\n\nCeltic have been linked to Ireland ever since the club's foundation in 1887. Brother Walfrid - an Irishman - founded the Scottish football club, with his main goal being to help improve the living conditions of Irish immigrants in Glasgow. Ever since, there has been a strong connection between the club and the country.\n\nGrealish isn't the only player to make the switch from the Republic of Ireland to England, as current Three Lions star Declan Rice made the same move shortly after his international colleague. Should Arsenal ever play against the Glasgow-based club, he can likely expect similar treatment from the opposing fan base.\n\nRelated 15 players in England's Euro 2024 Squad Could've Represented Other Nations\n\nEngland's cosmopolitan identity has led to high EURO 2024 hopes.\n\nGrealish's Make or Break Pre-Season The 28-year-old could be set for an exit\n\nGrealish struggled to live up to expectations during the 2023-24 season as Pep Guardiola appeared to lose faith in the former Aston Villa man's abilities on the left flank, instead favouring the energetic Jeremy Doku in most instances. He also faced his fair share of injury problems as he fell down the pecking order as the attacker found the net just three times in all competitions.\n\nGareth Southgate opted against including Grealish in his England squad for Euro 2024 due to his lack of involvement at club level. As a result, the ex-Ireland youth international could be scrambling to save his career at the Etihad Stadium in the build-up to the new campaign. There would likely be a host of clubs interested in acquiring his services if Guardiola decided the \u00a3300,000-per-week star needed to be moved on.\n\nRelated 6 Players Who Could Leave Manchester City Before Pep Guardiola's Exit\n\nJack Grealish and Kevin De Bruyne are just two of the star-studded names that could be set for the Manchester City exit door", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com",

Jack Grealish started too after his England snub and was quickly into his stride.\n\nHis pass teed up Nico O'Reilly who somehow managed to skew his shot wide of Schmeichel's goal.\n\nSchmeichel was making his Hoops debut against the side where he came through the ranks after jetting in on Saturday.\n\nThe Hoops quickly hit back and Kyogo should have fired them in front when he was picked out by Daizen Maeda but drilled wide.\n\nStephen Welsh crunched into a challenge on Grealish to send out a signal that Celtic wouldn't be overawed by City.\n\nThen in the 14th minute they took a deserved lead. Reo Hatate started the move, then found Matt O'Riley.\n\nHis quick pass into the feet of Kuhn sent the German scampering in on goal and he slotted beyond Stefan Ortega.\n\nCity threatened and after James McAtee was denied by Schmeichel from a close angle, the goalie then made a brilliant save in trademark style as he spread himself to block Haaland's goalmouth strike.\n\nMoments later he pulled off an even better stop from the Norwegian.\n\nHe came so close to stopping City grabbing their 33rd-minute equaliser too. When Haaland dummied O'Reilly's pass it left Bobb standing free inside the box.\n\nThis time Schmeichel got his body in the way but agonisingly saw the ball squirm under him and into the net.\n\nBut the Hoops took just four minutes to regain the lead as Kuhn finished again in devastating fashion.\n\nHatate found him in an inside right position and he cut inside before drilling home a left-foot finish.\n\nHatate and Maeda both thrashed chances wide before Kuhn was involved again as the Hoops went further in front on the stroke of half-time.\n\nThis time he was the provider with a stunning pass to Kyogo, whose touch to take him wide of Ortega then finish beyond the goalie was even better.\n\nKuhn and Schmeichel were among four changes at the break - and replacement goalie Viljami Sinisalo was picking the ball out of the net inside sixty seconds of the restart.\n\nBobb found City sub Perrone who steered the ball past the Finn with his first touch.\n\nSinisalo did well to thwart Joel Ndala soon after but was powerless to deny Haaland in the 58th minute when he climbed highest at the back post to nod home Bobb's cross.\n\nIncredibly the Hoops took the lead again when sub Hyeok-Kyu Kwon was sent scampering clear then kept his cool to draw replacement keeper Ederson before slotting across to Palma to finish.\n\nBen Knight stung Sinisalo's gloves before there were three pitch invaders later in the game - two of whom ran up and hugged Palma.\n\nBut at full-time it was all smiles for the Hoops, who have now not lost to City in three clashes after their Champions League

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nDelighted Brendan Rodgers saluted red-hot Nicolas Kuhn for his all-action role in Celtic's thrilling 4-3 win over Manchester City in America.\n\nFans inside Chapel Hill's Kenan Stadium were treated to a seven-goal thriller with the German bagging a brace and producing a sumptuous assist for Kyogo to put the Scottish Premiership champions up 3-1 at the break. And Rodgers was keen to talk up a player who is itching to build on his first six months where he showed glimpses of his full potential.\n\nSpeaking to Celtic TV, the Parkhead boss said: \"Hopefully, in the first year, he was adapting and he has come back looking really sharp. The moves for the goals were outstanding. Some of the football to play through City's press was excellent. We built it up really well despite their pressure. He finished his two goals really well. His pass for the third goal was magical. The outside of the right foot and it had to travel a long distance, so two goals and an assist for him was great. We wanted to play him a little bit longer but he just felt a little bit on his knee but he was very good.\n\nAnd Rodgers was equally thrilled with how his side punished Pep Guardiola's pass masters on a number of occasions. Celtic were ruthless when stripping City of possession and the Parkhead boss believes his team showed how to disrupt one of the best teams on the planet.\n\nHe added: \"Yes, it was. Whenever you play Pep (Guardiola) teams it is so complex how they play. I said before the game that it would be another step up for us physically but also tactically as you have got to be so concentrated and press in the right moments. You can't always press or else you end up running more. I thought the players dealt with that so well. The football we played was excellent. The goals were class and we attacked and showed how much we wanted to attack. It was a really good night and the supporters were amazing once again.\n\n\"That is a big testament to the players and how hard they are training and working. We are pushing them to be defensively strong and that means you've got to be aggressive. What I have been really impressed with in the games, especially against DC United and Manchester City is that we are making the last step much better. I see teams in the press and they don't get there. The guys are starting to make the last step, get in and win the ball and disrupt and have that little bit of chaos in the game to win it back and then go and play your football. Both teams and all the players did that really well.\"\n\nAnd new signing Kasper Schmeichel proved an instant hit with a clutch of vital saves to deny Erling Haaland and Co in a madcap first half with both teams going at each other.\n\nRodgers said: \"I think everyone expects him to do that. He is one of the best in that one-on-one moment. He is so good and he makes himself so big, his timing, everything is so good. That was a lovely introduction for him to come in.

The Reds have been credited with an interest in signing the Bhoys midfielder as the summer transfer window rolls on.\n\nLiverpool are yet to complete their first signing of the summer, but that has not stopped the rumour mill from being in full swing. O'Riley is one of the latest players to be linked with a move to Anfield, although the Reds are not alone.\n\nReports in recent days have claimed that Celtic have rejected a second bid from Atalanta for the in-demand O'Riley. It was claimed by Sky Sports that the improved offer consisted of a \u00a314.3m initial fee, plus add-ons.\n\nHowever, the same report also claimed that talks between the two clubs remain ongoing, but there is still a gap in valuation. As well as the Reds, Juventus and Roma, plus the likes of Atletico Madrid, have also been linked with a move for the Denmark international.\n\nBut speaking during Celtic's pre-season tour of America, Rodgers has outlined Celtic's determination to keep O'Riley at the club this summer. However, the former Liverpool boss did acknowledge the challenge that the Scottish Premiership faces in keeping their star names at Celtic Park.\n\nHe said: \"We're all quite relaxed about it [O'Riley's future]. Every player has a value but we see him as a really important player, and while he's here, we'll continue to develop him and improve.\n\n\"There's no update. We're fairly relaxed, you saw him in the game the other night.\"\n\nRodgers then added: \"He's working so well, but there's nothing to report on him. I think we all understand the people close to Celtic understand the model Celtic works.\n\n\"Matt's been at the club for three years; he's developed into the player he has and he knows the privilege it is to play for Celtic, and of course, naturally, how it works is the player gets that opportunity to move on.\n\n\"Celtic is a club where you can move on but you don't have to, and it's a very difficult club to move on from. But naturally, with the wages that are on offer for players, then that makes it a real challenge for Celtic to compete at that level.\"", "source": {"uri": "liverpoolecho.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liverpool Echo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_wakefield@liverpoolecho.co.uk", "name": "Mark Wakefield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_O'Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matt O'Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Celtic F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

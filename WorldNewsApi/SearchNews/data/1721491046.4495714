Halo Glow Liquid Filter Rave Review: \"I always get compliments when I use it. My face looks fresh and glowing. I even got a compliment from a Sephora employee. They thought it's the Charlotte Tilbury one!\" e.l.f. Camo Color Corrector Rave Review: \"I have invested in every brand to try to hide the genetic dark circles under my eyes and to provide a good base prior to applying concealer. I've used Becca, Huda Beauty, Tarte, etc. this seems to work better.\" e.l.f. SKIN Suntouchable Invisible SPF 35 Rave Review: \"I can't afford the super goop sunscreen, but I really like the invisible and primer-like finish, so this is a great alternative (TJ is another one). It works well, does not irritate skin, and looks good with the slight blurring and glowing effect.\" e.l.f. Clear Brow & Lash Mascara Rave Review: \"Way better than Benefit's $26 brow fluff wax. I'm shocked, this is sooooo much better. I should've switched to this product 6 months ago. Holds WAY better and is actually clear. A new must have for me. e.l.f. Power Grip Primer Rave Review: \"This primer really does live up to the hype- I am a redhead with very sensitive, acne-prone skin, and this formula didn't break me out. The product lathers on the skin in a smooth, cooling gel, and dries very tacky (in a sensible way). I've used Milk Hydro Grip primer, and I didn't notice any difference in my finished makeup looks.\" This primer has been recommended by Lisa Rinna, Paige DeSorbo, and Nita Danielle. e.l.f. Holy Hydration! Face Cream Rave Review: \"So hydrating. The best dupe for Tatcha Water Cream if you're on a budget! It doesn't smell as good, but it'll make your skin feel so smooth and hydrated.\" e.l.f. Monochromatic Multi Stick Rave Review: \"This might be better than the milk I've been searching for. Love using it as a quick blush and lipgloss on the go.\" Real Housewives of Atlanta alum Kandi Burruss has recommended this multi-tasking product. e.l.f. Halo Glow Contour Beauty Wand Rave Review: \"Has all of the upsides of the Charlotte Tilbury Beauty Light Wand\u2014easily blendable, rich in pigment, long-lasting\u2014without any of the downfalls. What makes this better than Charlotte Tilbury is the diverse shade ranges, the fact that it's easy to blend but does not blend away, and it has an amazing price point.\" e.l.f. Complexion Duo Brush Rave review: \"Wow, this brush is amazing! So soft, dense but not too dense, and handle is great quality. It ranks up there with my favorite foundation brush from IT Cosmetics, which is 4x the price.\" e.l.f. Poreless Putty Primer Rave Review: \"I am pleasantly surprised with this product. I have been a longtime user of Tatcha, but heard that this is a great dupe. Got it, tested it, loved it. This is an excellent dupe for Tatcha and great for my wallet\" e.l.f. Cosmetics Brow Lift Rave Review: \"After trying the ABH brow freeze I gave up on high end and decided to try a drug store product and I have NEVER been more SATISFIED with a product. Application is easy, my brows stay put all day, and the price is amazing. 10/10 ranking, and I am now loyal to this product\" e.l.f. 16HR Camo Concealer Rave Review: \"This stuff is practically an exact Shape Tape dupe. I bought this because it had such rave reviews and I am totally impressed. It covers and blends just as well as Shape Tape. It also works well as an eyeshadow base. I like this product so much that I immediately bought another one. Btw, dark circles are totally covered!\" e.l.f. Glow Reviver Lip Oil Rave Review: \"The glow reviver lip oil can easily hold up against Dior, Haus Labs, etc. other sorts of high end lip oils. It's hydrating, it's pretty\u2026 not very opaque in colour at all but it feels great and is [long]lasting\" e.l.f. Camo Liquid Blush Rave Review: \"Have been using Rare Beauty in Joy and loved it, but decided to try this new product. Got Gorg Orange which is exactly the same as the Rare Beauty. The ELF is at a MUCH better price. One drop provides all the blush for your entire face and it lasts all day\" e.l.f. Holy Hydration! Makeup Melting Cleansing Balm Rave Review: \"AMAZING DUPE for expensive cleansing balms I am OBSESSED with the Elemis cleansing balm. However, to get a decent sized bottle you pay over $100 bucks. This ELF cleaning balm is comparable in creamy silky texture and a fraction of the price & does everything the Elemis balm does. Everyone's skin is different but I am sensitive and prone to breakouts and I have no issues with this.\" Olivia Culpo recommended this cleansing balm to E! shoppers. e.l.f. Bronzing Drops Rave Review: \"I've tried a lot of bronzing drops and these are top tier. Great shade range, blends easily, gives a great bronze to the skin. I mix mine into foundation and it's perfect!\" Still shopping?

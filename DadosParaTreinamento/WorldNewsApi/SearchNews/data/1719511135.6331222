Instead of three days of glorious sunshine and balmy temperatures, we\u2019ve been hit with grey skies and showers, leaving us feeling rather lacklustre to say the least. This is likely even more disappointing if you\u2019d made plans to have friends and family over for a BBQ \u2014 but you don\u2019t have to let the rain ruin your fun, as it turns out there\u2019s a simple alternative that many Brits are opting to use this weekend instead. According to research by Iceland Foods, 72% of Brits are switching to cook their favourite BBQ items in an air fryer instead this summer. Not only does this method mean the unpredictable weather can\u2019t spoil the party, almost a third claim that it takes less time to cook this way, and there\u2019s much less risk of burning your food in an air fryer than there is when grilling it. 72% of Brits are swapping the traditional BBQ for an air fryer.

While 25% think it\u2019s less stressful cooking in the air fryer as opposed to on the BBQ, and 23% say it allows them to cook more food. Andrew Staniland, Group Buying Director at Iceland Foods, added: \u2018The nation has spoken, we\u2019re fed up with the classic unpredictable weather ruining our traditional summer BBQs. \u2018A huge percentage of the population will now be using their air fryer to BBQ this bank holiday and this summer. Who can blame them? It\u2019s quicker, less stressful and there\u2019s no chance of ending up with a wash out event.\u2019 You can cook all your favourite BBQ foods in the kitchen gadget.

Foodie experts from Getir recently shared their top tips for achieving maximum flavour in the air fryer with T3.com. They first urged home cooks to preheat their air fryer before cooking any of their BBQ food. They recommended doing this for three to five minutes before you plan to start cooking, at a temperature around 175 to 200C. Are you switching to cooking your BBQ items in an air fryer?Comment Now But the real trick is to \u2018season\u2019 the air fryer basket you\u2019ll be putting the meat into, and they advise doing so with a common vegetable. They said: \u2018Cut an onion in half and rub it on the basket grates before you start grilling. Not only does this add extra seasoning to your food, but the natural enzymes and acidity from the onion prevents food from sticking to your air fryer\u2019s basket, making clean-up a lot easier.\u2019 Finally, if you\u2019re still concerned about flavour, you could always marinade your meat or vegetables before cooking to add spice or tang. And once they\u2019re cooked, a selection of your favourite condiments can also help jazz up the meal. Do you have a story to share?

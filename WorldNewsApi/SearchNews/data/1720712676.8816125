Pradhan, popularly known as \u2018Ujjwala Man\u2019, steered the Modi government\u2019s flagship social programme, the Pradhan Mantri Ujjawla Yojana, providing free cooking gas (LPG) connections to poor women. He was considered a top contender for the post of first BJP Chief Minister of Odisha. Pradhan was also elected to Odisha state legislative assembly during 2000-2004. Pradhan is expected to get some important portfolio in Modi 3.0 as well. Veteran BJP leader and a major tribal face of the party, Jual Oram also took oath as the Cabinet minister in the Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government.

He was the Tribal Affairs Minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government from October 1999 to May 2004 and the Modi government between 2014 and 2019.

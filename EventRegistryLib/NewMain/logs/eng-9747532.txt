Comperatore, a former fire chief, was shot and killed while attending a weekend rally for former President Donald Trump.\n\nCABOT, Pa. (AP) -- A fire truck carried Corey Comperatore's flag-draped casket to a Pennsylvania church on Friday for the funeral of the former fire chief, who was shot and killed when a gunman tried to assassinate former President Donald Trump last weekend.\n\nHundreds of firefighters arrived at the church in a procession of over 100 trucks in a show of support for Comperatore's grieving relatives and friends. Outside the church, a massive American flag hung from the ladder of a fire truck.\n\nA sharpshooter team mounted on a nearby rooftop served as a reminder of last weekend's bloodshed. Officials have said that Comperatore spent his final moments shielding his wife and daughter from gunfire at Trump's rally last Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump, who suffered an ear injury in the shooting but was not seriously hurt, is not going to the funeral because of Secret Service concerns, according to a person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAnnette Locke, a member of the West Deer Township Volunteer Fire Department, stood across the road from the church and lightly touched her heart as she spoke about the horrific toll from the \"totally senseless\" shooting.\n\n\"He was with his family on a beautiful sunny day, and now he's gone,\" Locke said.\n\nJoe and Jen Brose stood at the edge of their driveway with their three young boys, all dressed in T-shirts celebrating the USA, watching the long procession of fire and emergency trucks go by.\n\n\"The community comes together at times like this,\" Joe Brose said.\n\n\"I thought it was very heartwarming, it was very humbling to see it,\" said Jen Brose, whose sister had attended the Trump rally.\n\nTrump honored Comperatore during his speech Thursday night at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. He displayed Comperatore's firefighting gear on the convention stage, kissing his helmet and heralding the ex-chief as \"an unbelievable person.\"\n\nComperatore, 50, worked as a project and tooling engineer, was an Army reservist and spent many years as a volunteer firefighter after serving as chief, according to his obituary.\n\nOn Thursday, thousands of mourners filed into a banquet hall to pay their respects to Comperatore and his family. Hundreds of people gathered Wednesday at a vigil for him at an auto racing track.\n\nGuests at Thursday's visitation for Comperatore saw a slideshow of photos from his life -- his wedding, a recent 50th birthday party, time with his daughters, firefighting, fishing, and palling around with his Dobermans. Also on display was a framed copy of a note to Comperatore's wife signed by Trump and former first lady Melania Trump.\n\n\"Corey will forever be remembered as a True American Hero,\" the Trumps wrote.\n\nA statement issued Thursday by Comperatore's family described him as a \"beloved father and husband, and a friend to so many throughout the Butler region.\"\n\n\"Our family is finding comfort and peace through the heartfelt messages of encouragement from people around the world, through the support of our church and community, and most of all through the strength of God,\" the statement said.\n\nTwo other people were wounded at Trump's rally: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township. As of Wednesday night, both had been upgraded to serious but stable condition, according to a spokesperson with Allegheny Health Network.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "maryclaire_dale@eagletribune.com", "name": "Maryclaire Dale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@eagletribune.com", "name": "Michael R.

(AP) -- The keen of bagpipes, a three-volley gun salute and a bugle sounding taps pierced the air of a small Pennsylvania town on Friday as hundreds gathered to honor an ex-fire chief who was shot and killed at a rally for former President Donald Trump.\n\nMerri Cambo, left, of Saxonburg, Pa., and her friend, Jane Wesolosky, of Buffalo, Pa., react as the funeral procession for Corey Comperatore passes by, Friday, July 19, 2024, in Sarver, Pa. Comperatore, a former fire chief, was shot and killed while attending a weekend rally for former President Donald Trump. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)\n\nFollowing funeral services for Corey Comperatore, large crowds of mourners waiting outside the Cabot Methodist Church fell silent as firefighters loaded his flag-draped casket onto a fire truck draped in black bunting.\n\nThree firefighters stood sentry on the back of the truck, trailed by more than 100 other emergency vehicles from fire departments across the region as it rolled slowly toward Comperatore's hometown of Freeport, where he was to be laid to rest.\n\nA sharpshooter team mounted on a nearby rooftop served as a reminder of last weekend's bloodshed. Officials have said that Comperatore spent his final moments shielding his wife and daughter from gunfire at Trump's rally last Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump, who suffered an ear injury in the shooting but was not seriously hurt, did not attend the funeral because of Secret Service concerns, according to a person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAnnette Locke, a member of the West Deer Township Volunteer Fire Department, stood across the road from the church and lightly touched her heart as she spoke about the horrific toll from the \"totally senseless\" shooting.\n\n\"He was with his family on a beautiful sunny day, and now he's gone,\" Locke said.\n\nJoe and Jen Brose stood at the edge of their driveway with their three young boys, all dressed in T-shirts celebrating the USA, watching the long procession, which took a full half-hour to pass.\n\n\"The community comes together at times like this,\" Joe Brose said.\n\n\"I thought it was very heartwarming, it was very humbling to see it,\" said Jen Brose, whose sister had attended the Trump rally.\n\nTrump honored Comperatore during his speech Thursday night at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. He displayed Comperatore's firefighting gear on the convention stage, kissing his helmet and heralding the ex-chief as \"an unbelievable person.\"\n\nMike Drane, who lives near the church where the funeral was held, said he was overwhelmed by Trump's tribute.\n\n\"Trump knew that that bullet was for him, not for Corey,\" Drane said.\n\nNancy Macurdy, who lives across the street from the church, was away camping when the shooting happened but wanted to be back home for the funeral.\n\n\"We're a very close community here,\" she said.\n\nA woman who was inside the church for the funeral service said Comperatore's wife and daughters delivered testimonies, and the church's pastor read a eulogy written by one of Comperatore's siblings. The woman, who declined to be quoted by name, said she did not recognize any politicians or Trump representatives among the crowd, which included country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. The service was closed to the news media.\n\nIn nearby Sarver, the town where Comperatore lived, families took the day off from work or changed other plans to gather along the community's main artery. Bands of young boys stood by the roadway, signaling for trucks to honk their horns. Five-year-old Ryder Presutti, dressed in a red firefighter's outfit, waved a small American flag as the fire trucks passed by.\n\nOthers congregated at Andy's House of Cars or Cabot Archery to await the funeral procession. Outside the Dollar General store, at least a dozen SUVs were lined up tailgate style, with their trunks open. One resident expressed her feelings with a front yard sign made of giant black letters that read, \"American Hero Corey Comperatore.\"\n\n\"It's a very heartbreaking situation,\" said Daneene Wimer, 44, of Evans City, near where the shooting took place. She and her sisters came with their families to honor \"somebody who put their life in their hands for their family.\"\n\n\"I will definitely be shedding tears (when the procession passes),\" she said.\n\nComperatore, 50, worked as a project and tooling engineer, was an Army reservist and spent many years as a volunteer firefighter after serving as chief, according to his obituary. He and his family attended the Cabot Methodist Church, where their pastor, Jonathan Fehl, presided over the funeral.\n\nOn Thursday, thousands of mourners filed into a banquet hall to pay their respects to Comperatore and his family. Hundreds of people gathered Wednesday at a vigil for him at an auto racing track.\n\nGuests at Thursday's visitation for Comperatore saw a slideshow of photos from his life -- his wedding, a recent 50th birthday party, time with his daughters, firefighting, fishing, and palling around with his Dobermans. Also on display was a framed copy of a note to Comperatore's wife signed by Trump and former first lady Melania Trump.\n\n\"Corey will forever be remembered as a True American Hero,\" the Trumps wrote.\n\nA statement issued Thursday by Comperatore's family described him as a \"beloved father and husband, and a friend to so many throughout the Butler region.\"\n\n\"Our family is finding comfort and peace through the heartfelt messages of encouragement from people around the world, through the support of our church and community, and most of all through the strength of God,\" the statement said.\n\nTwo other people were wounded at Trump's rally: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township. As of Wednesday night, both had been upgraded to serious but stable condition, according to a spokesperson with Allegheny Health Network.\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin", "source": {"uri":

(AP) -- The keen of bagpipes, a three-volley gun salute and a bugle sounding taps pierced the air of a small Pennsylvania town on Friday as hundreds gathered to honor an ex-fire chief who was shot and killed at a rally for former President Donald Trump.\n\nFollowing funeral services for Corey Comperatore, large crowds of mourners waiting outside the Cabot Methodist Church fell silent as firefighters loaded his flag-draped casket onto a fire truck draped in black bunting.\n\nThree firefighters stood sentry on the back of the truck, trailed by more than 100 other emergency vehicles from fire departments across the region as it rolled slowly toward Comperatore's hometown of Freeport, where he was to be laid to rest.\n\nA sharpshooter team mounted on a nearby rooftop served as a reminder of last weekend's bloodshed. Officials have said that Comperatore spent his final moments shielding his wife and daughter from gunfire at Trump's rally last Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump, who suffered an ear injury in the shooting but was not seriously hurt, did not attend the funeral because of Secret Service concerns, according to a person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAnnette Locke, a member of the West Deer Township Volunteer Fire Department, stood across the road from the church and lightly touched her heart as she spoke about the horrific toll from the \"totally senseless\" shooting.\n\nHe was with his family on a beautiful sunny day, and now he's gone,\" Locke said.\n\nJoe and Jen Brose stood at the edge of their driveway with their three young boys, all dressed in T-shirts celebrating the USA, watching the long procession, which took a full half-hour to pass.\n\n\"The community comes together at times like this,\" Joe Brose said.\n\n\"I thought it was very heartwarming, it was very humbling to see it,\" said Jen Brose, whose sister had attended the Trump rally.\n\nTrump honored Comperatore during his speech Thursday night at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. He displayed Comperatore's firefighting gear on the convention stage, kissing his helmet and heralding the ex-chief as \"an unbelievable person.\"\n\nMike Drane, who lives near the church where the funeral was held, said he was overwhelmed by Trump's tribute.\n\nTrump knew that that bullet was for him, not for Corey,\" Drane said.\n\nNancy Macurdy, who lives across the street from the church, was away camping when the shooting happened but wanted to be back home for the funeral.\n\n\"We're a very close community here,\" she said.\n\nA woman who was inside the church for the funeral service said Comperatore's wife and daughters delivered testimonies, and the church's pastor read a eulogy written by one of Comperatore's siblings. The woman, who declined to be quoted by name, said she did not recognize any politicians or Trump representatives among the crowd, which included country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. The service was closed to the news media.\n\nIn nearby Sarver, the town where Comperatore lived, families took the day off from work or changed other plans to gather along the community's main artery. Bands of young boys stood by the roadway, signaling for trucks to honk their horns. Five-year-old Ryder Presutti, dressed in a red firefighter's outfit, waved a small American flag as the fire trucks passed by.\n\nOthers congregated at Andy's House of Cars or Cabot Archery to await the funeral procession. Outside the Dollar General store, at least a dozen SUVs were lined up tailgate style, with their trunks open.\n\n\"It's a very heartbreaking situation,\" said Daneene Wimer, 44, of Evans City, near where the shooting took place. She and her sisters came with their families to honor \"somebody who put their life in their hands for their family.\"\n\n\"I will definitely be shedding tears (when the procession passes),\" she said.\n\nComperatore, 50, worked as a project and tooling engineer, was an Army reservist and spent many years as a volunteer firefighter after serving as chief, according to his obituary. He and his family attended the Cabot Methodist Church, where their pastor, Jonathan Fehl, presided over the funeral.\n\nOn Thursday, thousands of mourners filed into a banquet hall to pay their respects to Comperatore and his family. Hundreds of people gathered Wednesday at a vigil for him at an auto racing track.\n\nGuests at Thursday's visitation for Comperatore saw a slideshow of photos from his life -- his wedding, a recent 50th birthday party, time with his daughters, firefighting, fishing, and palling around with his Dobermans. Also on display was a framed copy of a note to Comperatore's wife signed by Trump and former first lady Melania Trump.\n\nCorey will forever be remembered as a True American Hero,\" the Trumps wrote.\n\nA statement issued Thursday by Comperatore's family described him as a \"beloved father and husband, and a friend to so many throughout the Butler region.\"\n\n\"Our family is finding comfort and peace through the heartfelt messages of encouragement from people around the world, through the support of our church and community, and most of all through the strength of God,\" the statement said.\n\nTwo other people were wounded at Trump's rally: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township.

Joe and Jen Brose stood at the edge of their driveway with their three young boys, all dressed in T-shirts celebrating the USA, watching the long procession of fire and emergency trucks go by. \"The community comes together at times like this,\" Joe Brose said.\n\nComperatore, 50, worked as a project and tooling engineer, was an Army reservist and spent many years as a volunteer firefighter after serving as chief. On Thursday, thousands of mourners filed into a banquet hall to pay their respects to Comperatore and his family. Guests saw a slideshow of photos from his life -- his wedding, a recent 50th birthday party, time with his daughters, firefighting, fishing, and palling around with his Dobermans. Also on display was a framed copy of a note to Comperatore's wife signed by Trump and former first lady Melania Trump. \"Corey will forever be remembered as a True American Hero,\" the Trumps wrote.\n\nA statement issued Thursday by Comperatore's family described him as a \"beloved father and husband, and a friend to so many throughout the Butler region.\" \"Our family is finding comfort and peace through the heartfelt messages of encouragement from people around the world, through the support of our church and community, and most of all through the strength of God,\" the statement said.

(AP) -- The keen of bagpipes, a three-volley gun salute and a bugle sounding taps pierced the air of a small Pennsylvania town on Friday as hundreds gathered to honor an ex-fire chief who was shot and killed at a rally for former President Donald Trump.\n\nFollowing funeral services for Corey Comperatore, large crowds of mourners waiting outside the Cabot Methodist Church fell silent as firefighters loaded his flag-draped casket onto a fire truck draped in black bunting.\n\nThree firefighters stood sentry on the back of the truck, trailed by more than 100 other emergency vehicles from fire departments across the region as it rolled slowly toward Comperatore's hometown of Freeport, where he was to be buried.\n\nA sharpshooter team mounted on a nearby rooftop served as a reminder of last weekend's bloodshed. Officials have said that Comperatore spent his final moments shielding his wife and daughter from gunfire at Trump's rally last Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump, who suffered an ear injury in the shooting but was not seriously hurt, did not attend the funeral because of Secret Service concerns, according to a person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAnnette Locke, a member of the West Deer Township Volunteer Fire Department, stood across the road from the church and lightly touched her heart as she spoke about the horrific toll from the \"totally senseless\" shooting.\n\n\"He was with his family on a beautiful sunny day, and now he's gone,\" Locke said.\n\nJoe and Jen Brose stood at the edge of their driveway with their three young boys, all dressed in T-shirts celebrating the USA, watching the long procession, which took a full half-hour to pass.\n\n\"The community comes together at times like this,\" Joe Brose said.\n\n\"I thought it was very heartwarming, it was very humbling to see it,\" said Jen Brose, whose sister had attended the Trump rally.\n\nTrump honored Comperatore during his speech Thursday night at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. He displayed Comperatore's firefighting gear on the convention stage, kissing his helmet and heralding the ex-chief as \"an unbelievable person.\"\n\nMike Drane, who lives near the church where the funeral was held, said he was overwhelmed by Trump's tribute.\n\n\"Trump knew that that bullet was for him, not for Corey,\" Drane said.\n\nNancy Macurdy, who lives across the street from the church, was away camping when the shooting happened but wanted to be back home for the funeral.\n\n\"We're a very close community here,\" she said.\n\nA woman who was inside the church for the funeral service said Comperatore's wife and daughters delivered testimonies, and the church's pastor read a eulogy written by one of Comperatore's siblings. The woman, who declined to be quoted by name, said she did not recognize any politicians, notable people or Trump representatives inside the church. The service was closed to the news media.\n\nIn nearby Sarver, the town where Comperatore lived, families took the day off from work or changed other plans to gather along the community's main artery. Bands of young boys stood by the roadway, signaling for trucks to honk their horns. One small boy dressed in a red firefighter's outfit stood waving an American flag as the fire trucks passed by.\n\nOthers congregated at Andy's House of Cars, Cabot Archery and Advance Auto Parts and Dollar General to await the funeral procession. About a half-dozen people lined up their SUVs tailgate style, with their trunks open.\n\n\"It's a very heartbreaking situation,\" said Daneene Wimer, 44, of Evans City, near where the shooting took place. She and her sisters came with their families to honor \"somebody who put their life in their hands for their family.\"\n\n\"I will definitely be shedding tears (when the procession passes),\" she said.\n\nComperatore, 50, worked as a project and tooling engineer, was an Army reservist and spent many years as a volunteer firefighter after serving as chief, according to his obituary. He and his family attended the Cabot Methodist Church, where their pastor, Jonathan Fehl, presided over the funeral.\n\nOn Thursday, thousands of mourners filed into a banquet hall to pay their respects to Comperatore and his family.

Officials have said that Comperatore spent his final moments shielding his wife and daughter from gunfire at Trump's rally last Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump, who suffered an ear injury in the shooting but was not seriously hurt, did not attend the funeral because of Secret Service concerns, according to a person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAnnette Locke, a member of the West Deer Township Volunteer Fire Department, stood across the road from the church and lightly touched her heart as she spoke about the horrific toll from the \"totally senseless\" shooting.\n\n\"He was with his family on a beautiful sunny day, and now he's gone,\" Locke said.\n\nJoe and Jen Brose stood at the edge of their driveway with their three young boys, all dressed in T-shirts celebrating the USA, watching the long procession, which took a full half-hour to pass.\n\n\"The community comes together at times like this,\" Joe Brose said.\n\n\"I thought it was very heartwarming, it was very humbling to see it,\" said Jen Brose, whose sister had attended the Trump rally.\n\nTrump honored Comperatore during his speech Thursday night at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. He displayed Comperatore's firefighting gear on the convention stage, kissing his helmet and heralding the ex-chief as \"an unbelievable person.\"\n\nMike Drane, who lives near the church where the funeral was held, said he was overwhelmed by Trump's tribute.\n\n\"Trump knew that that bullet was for him, not for Corey,\" Drane said.\n\nNancy Macurdy, who lives across the street from the church, was away camping when the shooting happened but wanted to be back home for the funeral.\n\n\"We're a very close community here,\" she said.\n\nA woman who was inside the church for the funeral service said Comperatore's wife and daughters delivered testimonies, and the church's pastor read a eulogy written by one of Comperatore's siblings. The woman, who declined to be quoted by name, said she did not recognize any politicians or Trump representatives among the crowd, which included country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. The service was closed to the news media.\n\nIn nearby Sarver, the town where Comperatore lived, families took the day off from work or changed other plans to gather along the community's main artery. Bands of young boys stood by the roadway, signaling for trucks to honk their horns. Five-year-old Ryder Presutti, dressed in a red firefighter's outfit, waved a small American flag as the fire trucks passed by.\n\nOthers congregated at Andy's House of Cars or Cabot Archery to await the funeral procession. Outside the Dollar General store, at least a dozen SUVs were lined up tailgate style, with their trunks open. One resident expressed her feelings with a front yard sign made of giant black letters that read, \"American Hero Corey Comperatore.\"\n\n\"It's a very heartbreaking situation,\" said Daneene Wimer, 44, of Evans City, near where the shooting took place. She and her sisters came with their families to honor \"somebody who put their life in their hands for their family.\"\n\n\"I will definitely be shedding tears (when the procession passes),\" she said.\n\nComperatore, 50, worked as a project and tooling engineer, was an Army reservist and spent many years as a volunteer firefighter after serving as chief, according to his obituary. He and his family attended the Cabot Methodist Church, where their pastor, Jonathan Fehl, presided over the funeral.\n\nOn Thursday, thousands of mourners filed into a banquet hall to pay their respects to Comperatore and his family. Hundreds of people gathered Wednesday at a vigil for him at an auto racing track.\n\nGuests at Thursday's visitation for Comperatore saw a slideshow of photos from his life -- his wedding, a recent 50th birthday party, time with his daughters, firefighting, fishing, and palling around with his Dobermans. Also on display was a framed copy of a note to Comperatore's wife signed by Trump and former first lady Melania Trump.\n\n\"Corey will forever be remembered as a True American Hero,\" the Trumps wrote.\n\nA statement issued Thursday by Comperatore's family described him as a \"beloved father and husband, and a friend to so many throughout the Butler region.\"\n\n\"Our family is finding comfort and peace through the heartfelt messages of encouragement from people around the world, through the support of our church and community, and most of all through the strength of God,\" the statement said.\n\nTwo other people were wounded at Trump's rally: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township. As of Wednesday night, both had been upgraded to serious but stable condition, according to a spokesperson with Allegheny Health Network.\n\n___\n\nThe third paragraph has been edited to reflect that it was unclear if Comperatore was to be buried.

SISAK, MARYCLAIRE DALE, GARY FIELDS and MICHAEL KUNZELMAN - Associated Press\n\nCABOT, Pa. (AP) -- The keen of bagpipes, a three-volley gun salute and a bugle sounding taps pierced the air of a small Pennsylvania town on Friday as hundreds gathered to honor an ex-fire chief who was shot and killed at a rally for former President Donald Trump.\n\nFollowing funeral services for Corey Comperatore, large crowds of mourners waiting outside the Cabot Methodist Church fell silent as firefighters loaded his flag-draped casket onto a fire truck draped in black bunting. Three firefighters stood sentry on the back of the truck as a parade of vehicles lined up behind it.\n\nA sharpshooter team mounted on a nearby rooftop served as a reminder of last weekend's bloodshed. Officials have said that Comperatore spent his final moments shielding his wife and daughter from gunfire at Trump's rally last Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump, who suffered an ear injury in the shooting but was not seriously hurt, is not going to the funeral because of Secret Service concerns, according to a person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nAnnette Locke, a member of the West Deer Township Volunteer Fire Department, stood across the road from the church and lightly touched her heart as she spoke about the horrific toll from the \"totally senseless\" shooting.\n\n\"He was with his family on a beautiful sunny day, and now he's gone,\" Locke said.\n\nJoe and Jen Brose stood at the edge of their driveway with their three young boys, all dressed in T-shirts celebrating the USA, watching the long procession of fire and emergency trucks go by.\n\n\"The community comes together at times like this,\" Joe Brose said.\n\n\"I thought it was very heartwarming, it was very humbling to see it,\" said Jen Brose, whose sister had attended the Trump rally.\n\nTrump honored Comperatore during his speech Thursday night at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. He displayed Comperatore's firefighting gear on the convention stage, kissing his helmet and heralding the ex-chief as \"an unbelievable person.\"\n\nMike Drane, who lives near the church where the funeral was held, said he was overwhelmed by Trump's tribute.\n\n\"Trump knew that that bullet was for him, not for Corey,\" Drane said.\n\nNancy Macurdy, who lives across the street from the church, was away camping when the shooting happened but wanted to be back home for the funeral.\n\n\"We're a very close community here,\" she said.\n\nComperatore, 50, worked as a project and tooling engineer, was an Army reservist and spent many years as a volunteer firefighter after serving as chief, according to his obituary. He and his family attended the Cabot Methodist Church, where their pastor, Jonathan Fehl, presided over the funeral services. Comperatore was to be buried in the city of Freeport, where he grew up.\n\nOn Thursday, thousands of mourners filed into a banquet hall to pay their respects to Comperatore and his family. Hundreds of people gathered Wednesday at a vigil for him at an auto racing track.\n\nGuests at Thursday's visitation for Comperatore saw a slideshow of photos from his life -- his wedding, a recent 50th birthday party, time with his daughters, firefighting, fishing, and palling around with his Dobermans. Also on display was a framed copy of a note to Comperatore's wife signed by Trump and former first lady Melania Trump.\n\n\"Corey will forever be remembered as a True American Hero,\" the Trumps wrote.\n\nA statement issued Thursday by Comperatore's family described him as a \"beloved father and husband, and a friend to so many throughout the Butler region.\"\n\n\"Our family is finding comfort and peace through the heartfelt messages of encouragement from people around the world, through the support of our church and community, and most of all through the strength of God,\" the statement said.\n\nTwo other people were wounded at Trump's rally: David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township. As of Wednesday night, both had been upgraded to serious but stable condition, according to a spokesperson with Allegheny Health Network.\n\nMore from this section\n\nModern Foot & Ankle Expands Reconstructive Surgery Services in Celebration, Winter Garden with New Podiatrist\n\n[Updated!] Pokemon GO Failed to Detect Location 12 Fixed by using Tenorshare iAnyGo\n\nNational Nonprofit Petco Love Invests in Sacramento SPCA to Save and Improve the Lives of Pets in the Sacramento Region", "source": {"uri": "kulr8.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KULR-8 Local News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@kulr8.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "michael_r_sisak@kulr8.com", "name": "Michael R.

The woman, who declined to be quoted by name, said she did not recognize any politicians or Trump representatives among the crowd, which included country singer Billy Ray Cyrus. The service was closed to the news media.\n\nIn nearby Sarver, the town where Comperatore lived, families took the day off from work or changed other plans to gather along the community's main artery. Bands of young boys stood by the roadway, signaling for trucks to honk their horns. Five-year-old Ryder Presutti, dressed in a red firefighter's outfit, waved a small American flag as the fire trucks passed by.\n\n\"It's a very heartbreaking situation,\" said Daneene Wimer, 44, of Evans City, near where the shooting took place.

A fire truck draped in black bunting brought Comperatore's coffin, wrapped in an American flag, to Cabot Church, a Methodist congregation where Comperatore, 50, was a longtime member.\n\nComperatore's life revolved around this pocket of Pennsylvania: He grew up in Sarver and still lived there with his high school sweetheart and two daughters. He attended church in Cabot and graduated from high school in nearby Freeport.\n\nPeople here are not accustomed to crowds, but Comperatore's death has put the community into the national spotlight.\n\n\"You couldn't comprehend that happened,\" said Michael Drane, 66, who stood across the street from the church Friday morning to pay tribute to a man he had only known as a familiar face in the neighborhood. He blinked back tears as he recalled the violence Saturday. \"Not here. Not home.\"\n\nRelated Story: Former Fire Chief Who Died at Trump Rally Used His Body to Shield Family From ...\n\nNearby, a gentle breeze blew against a giant American flag hanging from a fire truck parked next to the church. A sign outside the church read, \"Our hearts are broken for the Comperatores.\"\n\nAfter the funeral, a line of fire trucks and other emergency vehicles, some from as far away as Florida and Texas, joined the procession leaving the church.\n\nMakeshift tributes and memorials have popped up across the small communities here. A large electronic billboard above a road in nearby Freeport displayed a photo of Comperatore, who Gov. Josh Shapiro said dived in front of his family to protect them as shots rang out. Next to his photo was a phrase that has been uttered by the governor and residents across Pennsylvania: \"A Real Hero.\"\n\nDuring his speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on Thursday night, Trump singled out Comperatore, saying that he had \"lost his life selflessly.\" Comperatore's firefighter uniform was displayed onstage near Trump as he spoke. At one point, the former president kissed the helmet and asked the crowd to observe a moment of silence for \"our friend, Corey.\"\n\n\"This is one of those things that's a once-in-a-century situation,\" said Gary Risch Jr., a longtime friend and fellow volunteer firefighter involved in the funeral preparations.\n\nQuestions have continued to mount over how the Secret Service allowed a would-be assassin to scale a building within a rifle's range of the former president and open fire, killing Comperatore and seriously wounding two other rally attendees in Butler, Pennsylvania, last Saturday.\n\nThe agency's director, Kimberly Cheatle, has faced calls to resign. On Thursday, Speaker Mike Johnson called on President Joe Biden to fire her.\n\nNearly a week after the attack, investigators are still unsure of the gunman's motive, and much about his life remains a mystery.\n\nOn Wednesday, FBI officials told lawmakers they had found no indication that the gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, held strong partisan or ideological views. They said he had searched for images of both Trump and Biden, looked up the dates of the Democratic National Convention and Trump's public appearances, and sought information about \"major depressive disorder.\"\n\nThe two men who were wounded at the rally -- James Copenhaver, 74, and David Dutch, 57 -- were in serious but stable condition Thursday, said Bill Toland, a spokesperson for Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh, where the men are being treated.\n\nCopenhaver, from Moon Township, Pennsylvania, was a retiree who once worked at the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board and who played in a band. Dutch, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania, was a Marine Corps veteran and a leader in his local chapter of the Marine Corps League, a service and advocacy organization.\n\nDutch was also a member of the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 92 in Lower Burrell, Pennsylvania. Rich Ratajczak, a Vietnam veteran, said he had been watching the rally on TV and saw someone get shot. But it was only when he went to the club later that he learned it was his friend.\n\n\"I said, 'Oh, my God, I saw what happened, but I didn't realize who it was,'\" he said.\n\nThe club held a prayer for Dutch during bingo Tuesday night, and Ratajczak said that members had signed a giant \"Get well\" card for him.\n\nServices for Comperatore began Thursday with a public visitation at a banquet hall in Freeport. Hundreds of people, many wearing black dresses and suits, stood outside the building in the afternoon in a line that stretched at least a quarter-mile, waiting to pay their respects. Two snipers were stationed on the roof, and two more on an adjacent building.\n\nInside, more officers scanned the line of mourners. Snapshots of the family were projected onto a large screen. One showed a black Doberman resting on Comperatore's shoulder. Another showed his wife and daughters at a graduation ceremony.\n\nA third pictured him holding a birthday cake with two candles. It appeared to be a recent photograph: Comperatore had turned 50 a month before he was killed.", "source": {"uri": "gvwire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GV Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

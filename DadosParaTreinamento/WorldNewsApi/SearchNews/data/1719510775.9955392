Speaking before the final game of the season, he said: \"We are going to try to individually analyse each situation and try to take the best decision with every player. \"When we finish the season completely on Sunday we are going to sit with the club, Monchi, Damian (Vidagany), with myself, with Wes Edens and we are going to take decisions. We haven't decided yet about each one, whether they will be with us in the future or not.\" Do you agree with Wyness?

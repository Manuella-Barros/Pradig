The entire right side of his face swelled up like a balloon, making it impossible for him to open his right eye.\n\nDespite the mishap, Matthew McConaughey kept his cool, sharing the nasty snap with his followers who simply can't get over it!\n\nOn Wednesday, the \"Sing\" voice actor shared a selfie on his Instagram and X social media accounts, and fans were left with their jaws on the floor.\n\nWhile McConaughey managed to smile, it was hard to ignore the pain he must have been in, with the entire right side of his face puffed up.\n\nBut what caused the swelling? His caption seemingly told the entire story in just two words.\n\nThe snap was captured with two simple words, \"Bee Swell,\" indicating that he had been stung by a bee (or bees).\n\nAfter fans saw the post, comments poured in, as many couldn't believe what they saw. \"At least you're still smiling. Stay away from the bees!!! They appear to be out to get you!\" one follower said.\n\n\"That looks bad, bro!\" one X user replied. \"Bee sure to take Benadryl and bee well soon, Matt!\" another advised.\n\n\"Keep on, smiling on there, McConaughey!! Legends last longer than bee stings! Remember that!\" another wrote.\n\nThousands more comments poured in from the actor's fans and followers, including one user who said, \"Wow, that's a swelling to bee sure (sorry). Hope it gets better soon.\"\n\n\"To Bee or not to Bee... that's the question,\" a second wrote.\n\n\"At least it was your all right, all right, all right, all right eye!\" another chimed in while one X user simply said, \"Beehave!\"\n\nIt is unclear if McConaughey got the bee sting while he was on set filming, but considering his love for road trips, it wouldn't be too far-fetched that he had a run-in while traveling.\n\n\"I'm on the road every weekend now,\" he told Pursuitist last month. \"I'm on set in Louisiana for my new movie, but I drive home every weekend to be with my family. I got my new Navigator in January and I've already put 13,000 miles on it. Man, that's a lot of miles, but I love it. I love the solitude. It's great to have some time to myself.\"\n\nAs he spends so many hours in the car, what does the actor do to bypass time? \"I start out the morning with my NPR, then I'll ease into some other stuff, and then who knows, around 2 AM, I'll probably be listening to Pink Floyd,\" he told the outlet.\n\nThe actor admitted that he is more of a spontaneous type and doesn't usually plan out his travel.\n\n\"I only pick one thing; North, South, East or West. I just get on the road and go. That's the point,\" he said. \"The only other governor I give myself is what's the time limit. Alright I got two months, we'll just head out and after I get going I'll figure out where I'm going.\"\n\n\"You know, you travel, you're not free right when you walk out the door. You've got to get out and get your separation before you can settle down and go, 'Ah, now I'm on time.' When I leave business, when I leave L.A. the clock's moving too fast,\" he added.\n\nMatthew McConaughey is best known for his rom-coms such as \"The Wedding Planner,\" \"How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days,\" \"Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,\" and more, but he wanted to try and head down a different path, leading him to step away from Hollywood for two years.\n\n\"I've usually zigged when I felt like Hollywood wanted me to zag,\" McConaughey told Interview Magazine. \"When I had my rom-com years, there was only so much bandwidth I could give to those and those were some solid hits for me. But I wanted to try some other stuff. Of course I wasn't getting it, so I had to leave Hollywood for two years.\"\n\n\"Dude, it was scary. I had long talks with my wife about needing to find a new vocation,\" he continued. \"I think I'm going to teach high school classes. I think I'm going to study to be a conductor. I think I'm going to go be a wildlife guide.\"\n\nThe actor eventually returned to acting, and when he did, he wowed Hollywood as he won the Oscar for best actor for his performance in \"Dallas Buyers Club.\"", "source": {"uri": "theblast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Blast"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kelly_coffey_behrens@theblast.com", "name": "Kelly Coffey-Behrens", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Balloon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_acting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voice acting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benadryl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benadryl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Navigator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romantic comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interview (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ghost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conducting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conducting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NPR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pink Floyd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/2048x947/2024/07/10141610/Matthew-McConaughey--scaled-e1720635407113.jpg?", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722691", "eventUri": "eng-9722691", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The beloved actor recently posted a photo of his swollen face after getting stung by the flying insect, and overall, fans and friends - including Cole Hauser and Bear Grylls - are reacting with sympathy and jokes.\n\nTo be clear, this tone of silliness was set by Matthew McConaughey himself. When he took to Instagram to post an intense photo of his face all swollen, he capped it off with the caption \"bee swell.\" Over on his Instagram story, he also added a nice GIF of the phrase to go with the photo. All around, while this injury looks terrible, the beloved actor seems to be in good spirits, as you can see by his smile below:\n\nListen, Matthew McConaughey and his wife Camila Alves have been in some serious situations. From Alves having a fashion mishap that led to a neck brace to McConaughey being in a plane that dropped 4,000 feet mid-flight, they've seen some scary stuff. However, they've always handled it well. Now, the Ture Detective star is enduring this potentially bad injury with heart and a dash of comedy.\n\nThose who commented on his post are taking a similar tone when it comes to this situation, which is cautious and caring humor. The comment that captures the energy of the reactions to this whole situation best came from @marina_yama_moto who used McConaughey's iconic line from Dazed and Confused to ask how he was doing:\n\nNotably, some very famous folks also reached out to the Interstellar actor to poke fun at him while also making sure he was OK.\n\nAnother appropriate and funny comment came from Bear Grylls. The survival expert and TV host noted that he's been in the Oscar winner's shoes before, writing:\n\nBee stings really are no joke, however, like Bear Grylls, it seems like McConaughey is handling it well. If it was worse, or if he was truly injured, I'd assume the actor would not have been smiling in this photo or even posting about it in the first place.\n\nMany other comments showed their love for the Dallas Buyers Club actor and wished him well, take a look:\n\nOverall, most people commenting on this post, including Matthew McConaughey himself, were keeping things light.\n\nIf there are more updates about McConaughey's gnarly bee sting, we'll be sure to let you know. We'll also be sure to keep you posted on the actor's next projects, especially if anything Yellowstone-related pops up on the 2024 TV schedule with his name on it.\n\nAll-in-all, we hope the actor is healing up OK and that the swelling has gone down. I'm sure he'll turn that \"bee swell\" into a \"be swell\" soon, and it seems like he's on the road to doing just that.", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "riley_utley@cinemablend.com", "name": "Riley Utley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Grylls", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bear Grylls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GIF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Hauser", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cole Hauser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dazed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Alves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dani Alves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camila_Alves", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Camila Alves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interstellar (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Television presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/83x4wgFia7oMvTAeNaHhcT-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722691", "eventUri": "eng-9722691", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Stings aren't an uncommon experience for many people, including A-list actors like Matthew McConaughey.\n\nOn July 10, the Texas-bred actor shared a scary-looking selfie on social media that seemingly showed the aftermath of a well-placed bee sting. In the photo, the right side of his face was completely swollen, with his eye socket growing so large it completely covered his eye. As for the message he wanted to send his fans, he had two simple words: \"Bee swell.\"\n\nMcConaughey seemingly took the sting in stride as he was all smiles in the photo. It remains unclear what he was doing when he sustained the injury.\n\nWhile oftentimes harmless (aside from a painful pinch), bee stings can cause a bevy of health problems depending on where you're stung, what kind of bee it was, and if you have any health predispositions like allergies. They can cause issues like severe inflammation, and if you're stung near the eye, you can develop other complications like keratitis, optic neuritis, and glaucoma.\n\nIf you're worried after being stung by a bee, wasp, or hornet, be sure to follow the correct steps to avoid further injury. According to the American Academy of Dermatology Association, this means staying calm, removing the stinger, washing the stung area with soap and water, applying a cold pack to reduce swelling, and, if necessary, take some over-the-counter medication. And if the swelling moves to other parts of your body like your face or neck, go to the emergency room immediately as you could be having an allergic reaction to the sting. Difficulty breathing, nausea, hives, or dizziness are also signs of an allergic reaction.", "source": {"uri": "mensjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Men's Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_malone_mendez@mensjournal.com", "name": "Chris Malone M\u00e9ndez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_McConaughey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew McConaughey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_(anatomy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orbit (anatomy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Keratitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_neuritis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Optic neuritis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hornet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hornet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stinger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dizziness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wasp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaucoma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glaucoma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dermatology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflammation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflammation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-counter drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Science/Agriculture/Animals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Vision", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Vision", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Insects", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Apitherapy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Apitherapy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.mensjournal.com/.image/ar_1.91%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1200/MjA3NzU3NTc2MTg2NjM1NzUw/2024-mack-jack--mcconaughey-gala.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722691", "eventUri": "eng-9722691", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 197, "textEnd": 204}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

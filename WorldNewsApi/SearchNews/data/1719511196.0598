Ticketholders, some of whom spent more than \u00a32,000 getting into the Manchester venue, have raised questions about its handling of the situation and branded it 'ridiculous' that they were left waiting in their seats for hours before being told to go home. The event on Saturday night was cancelled hours after it was due to start following the 41-year-old's arrest at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam on suspicion of drugs offenses that afternoon - something which she live-streamed on social media. Fans claim that despite seeing Minaj had been detained 500 miles from her destination, security staff at the Co-Op Live arena tried to put them at ease by telling them 'she had arrived and that everyone was going to dance tonight'. Instead there would be boos and shouts of anger in the auditorium when more than 23,000 attendees were told the event was being shelved as the rapper wouldn't make it on time. The decision sparked a furious backlash from some Minaj fans, who go by the collective name the Barbz, who claim bosses at the newly-built arena should have told them sooner the show was not going to go ahead. Representatives for the beleaguered \u00a3365million arena, which belatedly opened this month after being plagued by setbacks, said they allowed people to enter to 'ensure the safety and welfare of fans while awaiting updates'. Alvin Christie, 29, from Liverpool, said he waited from 9am to attend the concert and criticised the mixed messages from staff at the venue. He said: 'I would say it was very poorly managed. When we arrived into the event, they were actively telling fans that she had arrived and that everyone was going to dance tonight. 'For a lot of people that were asking those questions, that's obviously (keeping) people's hopes up. I understand that maybe they wanted to get people into the arena for health and safety risks to stop people being outside. 'But I think most importantly, they maybe could have advised people as soon as they've known that the show was postponed and we should be turned away when we're outside the arena, rather than holding loads of people in the arena.' Mr Christie did not blame Minaj after her arrest in Amsterdam, and says fans wanted for her to be 'in a good place'. 'We completely understood the situation that was in hand and with her being transparent, and showing everyone what was going on, we were just more concerned that she was okay and if the show didn't go on and was rescheduled, then we fully understood that,' he added. Minaj's supporters, who go by the collective name Barbz, have voiced slammed bosses at the 'cursed' music venue for letting them go inside and spend money despite the show going ahead. Eileen Allardyce, 32, a hotel manager from Edinburgh, spent around \u00a32,500 on tickets, travel and hotel costs and says she will not be able to make a rescheduled date. Ms Allardyce said that since Co-op Live announced a delay in April to its opening event, where comedian Peter Kay was due to perform, she has been 'on eggshells' along with her friends who also had tickets for Minaj. The rapper was arrested at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport on Saturday and says she spent six hours in custody before being allowed to go. 'Obviously, it's not Co-op's fault what happened in Amsterdam, and it's not Nicki's fault either, like, obviously, no blame for her at all,' she said. 'But as I say, I just feel like the way they (the venue) handled it was just absolutely ridiculous. They have no clue, like absolutely no clue. I don't think they were prepared for anything, to be honest.' Ms Allardyce claimed that there were 'no toilets' at the Co-Op Live arena on Saturday while she queued outside the venue from 4pm. She also maintained that several security guards told her that Nicki Minaj was in the building, despite still being detained in Amsterdam. 'I'm very disappointed, more so (towards) the venue because, obviously, everyone was unravelling on social media, everyone knew what the situation was and the venue completely let us down,' Ms Allardyce said. In Manchester fans of the singer gathered outside her hotel this morning to show their support for the artist after she arrived in the early hours of the morning. Hope Brown, from Blackburn, revealed that last night's concert was the second one that's been cancelled on her this month at the Co-op Live arena. 'I was meant to go to the Olivia Rodrigo concert earlier this month but that didn't go ahead because the Co-op arena wasn't ready,' the 20-year-old said. 'I'm beginning to think I'm jinked! 'We'd booked a hotel so made the best of a bad situation. 'When she was still in Amsterdam in the early evening, the concert should have been cancelled then. 'It was never the ideal preparation for a concert going straight from a police station to a concert venue!' Sophie Pearce, who had also been at the venue on Saturday night, said the organisation had been a 'shambles'. 'I'm so disappointed because I've been looking forward to the concert for so long,' the 19-year-old said. 'How it was handled was a bit of a shambles because all the fans were hanging around for hours when there was very little chance it would go ahead. 'People have spent a lot of money to get here and it's been for nothing.' Olivia Wilkinson, 22, said: 'It has been an expensive trip for nothing. 'I'm really disappointed. The concert should have been cancelled sooner as it must have been obvious she was never going to get to Manchester on time. 'I've spent around \u00a3200 on tickets and accommodation and am hoping to salvage something from it by seeing her today.' Laura Williams, 24, who travelled down from Lancaster, added: 'It's obvious that Nicki really wanted to perform last night because she still came to Manchester even though the concert had been cancelled. 'I'm not sure whose fault it is but I don't blame Nicki Minaj. I just hope the concert can be rescheduled soon.' Minaj had live-streamed her arrest in the Netherlands at around 4pm after police detained her on suspicion of exporting soft drugs as she prepared to fly to Britain after 'weed' was allegedly found in her luggage. The singer denied it belonged to her and claimed the items were the property of her security team. An hour and a half later Co-op Live tweeted that doors for her Manchester show would open at 7pm and fans entered, despite the R&B star not being released from custody until around 8.55pm. She was later seen arriving at Manchester late on Saturday night after devastated fans were sent home. She later tweeted that she had been 'sitting in a jail cell for 5-6hours' and asked her fans to 'please please please accept my deepest & most sincere apologies'. One fan told MailOnline last night that she was 'absolutely heartbroken' at Saturday's concert being called off. 'It's not exactly like the tickets were cheap,' said Alesha. 'We spent an absolute fortune to be there tonight, let alone the travel and outfits we got for it.' 'Absolute shambles that the Co-op live didn't just let us let us know beforehand that the show was going to be postponed,' she added, a sentiment shared by many other ticketholders. One supporter wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter: 'Co-op Live you are a f****** joke. You knew hours ago that the show wouldn't go ahead yet you still allowed everyone to come and spend money at your venue to then cancel last minute. Absolute joke. Love Nicki, f*** Co-op Live!!!' Comedian Mark Grimshaw said: 'I'm not sure what's crazier - the fact Co-op Live let ticket-holders into the venue whilst Nicki Minaj had literally been arrested in a different country, or the fact that this somehow isn't the most incompetent thing Co-op Live have ever done.' He added: 'The actual arrest, and the reason behind it, is obviously down to Nicki Minaj and her team. They aren't responsible for Co-op Live opening the venue hours after that happened, when she was still detained, and the gig clearly wasn't going to be going ahead. Both are at fault.' Kian Young, 23, who had travelled from Scunthorpe, said that he was 'confused as to why the Co-op arena hasn't spoken to its fans' and asked why the venue hadn't cancelled the event when news emerged of Minaj's arrest. 'Everyone's come - my missus is crying,' he told the BBC. 'Why not tell us it's cancelled before bringing us in?' But others blamed the singer for the chaos. Olivia Gibson from Newcastle said she was now an 'ex fan' of Minaj. 'I feel appalled. But also, in a way, I'm not shocked,' the 21-year-old said, referring to the singer's track record of running late and saying she should have allowed more time to get to Manchester from Amsterdam. 'It's not the Co-op Live's fault. It's Nicki Minaj's fault,' she added. 'She's just let all her fans down.' A spokesperson for Co-op Live told MailOnline today: 'To ensure the safety and welfare of fans while awaiting updates, the joint decision was made by venue and promoter to open our doors. 'Despite Nicki's best efforts to explore every possible avenue to make the show happen, the events of yesterday made it impossible.' In a statement released on her X account at 1am on Sunday morning, Minaj wrote: 'Thank you to everyone who prayed for me today. May God cover you & all that is connected to you. May you be blessed beyond your imagination. 'I arrived a little over an hour ago. After sitting in a jail cell for 5-6 hours, my plane still didn't take off for another 20 mins once I boarded. The flight was 50 mins. 50 mins. 'That's why they had to do the big song & dance b/c they knew I'd still find a way to perform even if it came down to my last 90 mins in the building which would have been until 1130pm. The building was willing to go past 11pm. So grateful to them for that.' She added: 'Please please please accept my deepest & most sincere apologies. They sure did know exactly how to hurt me today but this too, shall pass. 'We will have another date for tonight's show shortly & I'll probably be able to share it tmrw. One July option & one June option is currently being discussed. 'I'll find a way to not only make up the date with the performance but I'm going to create an added bonus for everyone that had a tkt for this show. Promise. 'I'll STILL be performing at the 2nd #Manchester show on the 30th. 5 days away. I'll STILL be performing in #Birmingham tmrw.' The American singer, known for the songs Starships, Super Bass and Anaconda, had been due to take to the stage at 6.30pm, but this was initially pushed back to 7pm. Footage emerged of supporters queuing up in the hours before the scheduled gig, chanting 'Free Nicki Minaj' as they held onto hope that the star would be allowed to fly to perform at the Manchester arena. Fans in the packed venue were devastated when they were informed that the show would not be going ahead, with many slamming the decision. In the wake of the latest drama to impact the venue, many concertgoers have also defended Co-op Live. One wrote on X that Minaj's lateness was 'genuinely not their fault', adding that organisers 'cannot catch a break'. Another suggested that it would have been worse not to let fans into the arena. 'Why is everyone blaming co-op live? They let everyone in when the doors opened they could have left everyone outside, saying, 'we're not letting anyone in yet..'' And one said that the blame should be shared by organisers and Minaj. 'Co-op Live can take accountability for letting people in before confirming she was in the country. 'But Nicki Minaj, I love u but you shoulda travelled yesterday, not 3 hours before doors open,' the fan added. Many have said they are unsure if they would be able to make the rescheduled performance, dates for which have not been announced yet. Frankie Harper, 20, from Andover, Hampshire, said: '(I'm) distraught to say the least. It definitely hurts more that it was on my birthday. Not sure what happens with the \u00a3100s that you spend on a train and hotel.' Nord Herida, 23, who lives in Barnsley and travelled an hour to attend the concert, said he had felt before the postponement that his time was 'being wasted' inside the arena. He added that his friend had travelled four hours from Ipswich to get to the gig and that they had been waiting since 1pm at the arena. '(I'm) p***** not (going to) lie, they have taken this long to tell us,' Mr Herida said. 'Like I work, I can't just take a day off.' Super fan Connor Wynne told Sky that he had been queueing since before 8am this morning to get a front row position for the show. He said he and his friends were holding out hope of seeing the star after they 'heard a helicopter go over'. But soon after, fans' hopes of seeing their favourite singer were dashed when organisers announced the show was being postponed. 'Nicki Minaj's scheduled performance at Manchester's Co-op Live on Saturday 25th May has been postponed,' a statement online said. 'Tickets will remain valid for the rescheduled performance which will be announced ASAP. 'Despite Nicki's best efforts to explore every possible avenue to make tonight's show happen, the events of today have made it impossible.' It added: 'We are deeply disappointed by the inconvenience this has caused. More information will be available at your point of purchase.' Minaj went silent on social media at around 4pm this evening following a series of social media posts on X, formerly Twitter, and Instagram. In them, she said that police had told her they found drugs in her luggage after items were checked by customs. She wrote that 'they found weed' and her security 'already advised them' that items belong to them, and not her. Minaj also claimed that her bags had been taken by 'customs', with someone who looked like he worked for Schiphol Airport saying that the fact she filmed security checks prompted her luggage to be searched again, in a video shared on Instagram. She alleged: 'They've been trying to stop me from coming to every show. They took my bags before I could see them. Put it on the plane. Now saying they're waiting on customs.' Minaj also live-streamed what appeared to be a conversation with an officer, who asked her to get into a van so she could go to a police station. 'I'm not carrying drugs, I'm not going in there,' she says in the clip. She then asks the officer if she is 'under arrest' to which the the Dutch policeman replies 'yes'. The star is told by another policeman that she will get a 'lawyer' and to stop filming, and then gets inside the van. A statement from Amsterdam's Royal Military Constabulary read: 'We have just released a 41-year-old American woman who we arrested this afternoon at Schiphol on suspicion of exporting soft drugs. 'After consultation with the Public Prosecution Service, the suspect was fined and can continue her journey.' Speaking to Sky News at around 9.15pm, Major Robert van Kapel of the military police said that she had been released from their custody around 20 minutes earlier. He added that he believed she had set off on her onward journey, though would not disclose further details. It was unclear at this point whether she would make the show, and there were few updates given throughout the saga. It comes after the venue postponed its first official show several times after safety concerns. The opening concert by rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie was cancelled three times, while shows by bands Take That, Keane and The Black Keys and comedian Peter Kay were also postponed. However, the arena finally had live music on May 14, when British rock band Elbow took to the stage. Elbow frontman Guy Garvey appeared to quip about Co-Op Live's previous woes last night as he took to the stage for the crisis-ridden music venue's first gig. Structural issues with the building were among a host of issues previously raised, with reports suggesting its ventilation system was falling from the ceiling. One worker said 'there were loads of wires hanging down' with exposed lighting on the floor which looked 'very messy'. In an apparent nod to those woes, Garvey welcomed the audience by quipping: 'There was already electricity in the air before you lot got in here... and now it's fully amped up. I hope you can feel it.' The rocker added that those who had been working on the building had been 'so excited today, so nervous and so excited'.", "summary": "Ticketholders have raised questions about its handling of the situation and branded it 'ridiculous' that they were left waiting in their seats for hours before being told to go home.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13461521/co-op-live-security-guards-Nicki-Minaj-fans-Amsterdam-arrest.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/26/16/85353107-0-image-a-14_1716737202623.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:51:39", "author": "Editor,Matthew Lodge", "authors": ["Editor", "Matthew Lodge"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.557}

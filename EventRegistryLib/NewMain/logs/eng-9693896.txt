At least 18 people were killed and 30 injured, including 19 seriously, in coordinated attacks by suspected female suicide bombers in Nigeria's northeastern city of Gwoza on Saturday, local authorities said, raising security concerns in a region which has been at a center of Islamist insurgency. (AP Photo/Joshua Omiri)MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (AP) - At least 18 people were killed and 30 injured, including 19 seriously, in coordinated attacks by suspected female suicide bombers in the northeastern Nigerian town of Gwoza on Saturday, local authorities said. The first suicide bomber detonated an explosive device during a marriage celebration at about 3 p.m., Barkindo Saidu, director-general of Borno State Emergency Management Agency, told reporters. \"Minutes later, another blast occurred near General Hospital,\"\u009d Saidu said, and then there was a third attack at a funeral service by a female bomber disguised as a mourner. Children and pregnant women were among those killed. No one has so far claimed responsibility for the the attacks, but Gwoza is in Borno state, which has been heavily impacted by an insurgency launched in 2009 by Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist group. The violence, which has spilled across borders around Lake Chad, has killed over 35,000 people, displaced over 2.6 million and created a massive humanitarian crisis. Boko Haram, which has one branch allied to the Islamic State group, wants to install an Islamic state in Nigeria, West Africa's oil giant of 170 million people divided almost equally between a mainly Christian south and a predominantly Muslim north. In the past, Boko Haram has used women and girls in suicide bombings, prompting suspicions that some from the many thousands that they have kidnapped over the years. The resurgence of suicide bombings in Borno raises significant concerns about the security situation in the region. Saidu said the degree of injuries ranged from abdominal ruptures to skull and limb fractures. \"I am now coordinating for a chopper tonight,\"\u009d Saidu said.\"\u009d I have mobilized emergency drugs to complement the shortage of drugs in Gwoza.\"\u009d Authorities imposed a curfew in the city, and the community remained on a high alert following reports of another suspected bomber in Pulka, a town about 2 kilometers (just over a mile) away from Gwoza.

According to the state's emergency services, the first blast ripped through a wedding ceremony.\n\nThe first explosion erupted at 3 pm (local time) on Saturday. Shortly after that, the second blast occurred at General Hospital Gwoza. Things became even more concerning after the third blast took place during a funeral procession.\n\nAccording to CNN, immediately after the news broke out, the director general of Borno State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) Dr Barkindo Muhammad Saidu visited the site of the blast in Gwoza Town.\n\nAs per the preliminary reports from SEMA, the victims of the deadly blast included men, women and children.\n\nThe state has been at the center of conflict for over a decade\n\nIt is pertinent to note that the state of Borno has been at the centre of a 15-year insurgency by Boko Haram, the militants who have already displaced more than two million people and killed over 40,000 people over the years.\n\nThe militant group gained international notoriety in 2014 when it kidnapped more than 270 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok which is also located in Borno state.\n\nThe state agency stated that the blast that ripped through a wedding ceremony killed at least six people. The authorities are referring to them as suicide bombing incidents.\n\nWhile authorities have confirmed the death of 18 people some local news outlets such as Nigeria's Vanguard and This Day newspapers stated that at least 30 people have lost their lives in these blasts.\n\nCurfew in place\n\nShortly after the blasts were reported the Nigerian military imposed a curfew.

Children and pregnant women were among those killed.\n\nNo one has so far claimed responsibility for the the attacks, but Gwoza is in Borno state, which has been heavily impacted by an insurgency launched in 2009 by Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist group.\n\nThe violence, which has spilled across borders around Lake Chad, has killed over 35,000 people, displaced over 2.6 million and created a massive humanitarian crisis.\n\nBoko Haram, which has one branch allied to the Islamic State group, wants to install an Islamic state in Nigeria, West Africa's oil giant of 170 million people divided almost equally between a mainly Christian south and a predominantly Muslim north.\n\nIn the past, Boko Haram has used women and girls in suicide bombings, prompting suspicions that some from the many thousands that they have kidnapped over the years. The resurgence of suicide bombings in Borno raises significant concerns about the security situation in the region.\n\nSaidu said the degree of injuries ranged from abdominal ruptures to skull and limb fractures.\n\n\"I am now coordinating for a chopper tonight,\" Saidu said.\" I have mobilized emergency drugs to complement the shortage of drugs in Gwoza.\"\n\nAuthorities imposed a curfew in the city, and the community remained on a high alert following reports of another suspected bomber in Pulka, a town about 2 kilometers (just over a mile) away from Gwoza.\n\nGwoza is located a few kilometers from Chibok, in southern Borno, where 276 schoolgirls were abducted in 2014.

It frequently uses women and younger people as bombers in the attack.\n\nThe group also uses female suicide bombers with babies to avoid detection before carrying out attacks.\n\nSome of the women and children carrying out suicide attacks are believed to be among the many thousands kidnapped by the group over the years.\n\nMilitants have killed thousands, displaced millions, and continue to carry out deadly attacks against civilians, despite the Nigerian military's claims that the insurgency has weakened.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_suicide_bomber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Female suicide bomber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwoza", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gwoza"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gwoza"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borno_State", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_\u2013_West_Africa_Province", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State \u2013 West Africa Province"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanguard_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vanguard (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curfew", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curfew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boko_Haram", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boko Haram"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suicide attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiduguri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maiduguri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maiduguri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boko_Haram_insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boko Haram insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Support_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Society/Support Groups", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/30/06/449455828_815386347384754_2044557960882257127_n.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693896", "eventUri": "eng-9693896", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.6784313725490196, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Additionally, a militia member assisting the military in Gwoza stated that two of his colleagues and a soldier were killed in a separate assault on a security outpost.\n\nWhat is Boko Haram?\n\nBoko Haram, formed in 2002 under Mohammed Yusuf, is a jihadist terrorist organization based in Nigeria. It launched an insurgency in 2009, targeting the Nigerian Government, security forces, and civilians. By 2015, it controlled territory in northeastern Nigeria, roughly the size of Belgium. Despite military efforts to reclaim most territory, Boko Haram persists in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and Niger. Affiliated with ISIS in 2015 as ISIS in West Africa (ISIS-WA), it split in 2016 into factions led by Abubakar Shekau (Boko Haram) and ISIS-WA. Conflict with ISIS-WA, Nigerian military, and regional forces has caused casualties and displacement.\n\nAlso Read: Why Did China Spend Billions To Bring 2KG Of Moon Soil? What's In It That Could Make Them Rich?\n\nWho funds Boko Haram?\n\nBoko Haram funds itself primarily through criminal activities such as looting, extortion, kidnapping for ransom, bank robberies, cattle theft, and hired assassinations. The group also seizes vehicles, weapons, ammunition, and supplies from Nigerian military forces and obtains additional arms from local black markets. Despite losing territory in recent years, Boko Haram jihadists continue to launch frequent attacks on rural Nigerian communities. They deploy young women and girls for suicide missions and conduct raids, targeting men and kidnapping women gathering firewood and acacia fruits outside towns.", "source": {"uri": "news24online.com",

Some Nigerian news outlets reported that at least 30 people had been killed.\n\nAs of Sunday morning, no group had claimed responsibility for the bombings. The blasts resembled previous attacks carried out by Boko Haram, whose fighters have killed tens of thousands in Nigeria and whose aggression in the region has led to the displacement of more than two million people.\n\nThe first attacker on Saturday detonated a bomb that she was wearing at a wedding celebration, Mr. Saidu said in a preliminary report seen by The New York Times. Eight people died in that explosion, including the attacker and a baby she had with her, according to Kenneth Daso, a public relations officer with the police in Borno. Two attackers struck later near a hospital and at the funeral services of a victim of the earlier blast, Mr. Saidu said.\n\nNigeria, Africa's most populous country, has been battling multiple security crises for years, including mass kidnappings of people of all ages and classes.\n\nBoko Haram insurgents have abducted thousands of teenage girls and coerced them into forced marriages. They have also forced many to carry out suicide attacks at schools, markets, religious buildings and large gatherings.\n\nIn 2014, Boko Haram fighters kidnapped 276 schoolgirls in the village of Chibok. The Chibok Girls, as they came to be known, received global attention after condemnation by Michelle Obama and because of activism by campaigners who popularized the slogan \"Bring Back Our Girls.\"\n\nA decade later, dozens are still missing.\n\nAlso in 2014, Boko Haram's leader at the time, Abubakar Shekau, declared a caliphate in Gwoza after his fighters seized the city.

Although the Nigerian military dislodged Boko Haram from most of its controlled territory since 2015, the group continued to operate in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and Niger.\n\nIn 2015, Boko Haram declared allegiance to the Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and began calling itself ISIS in West Africa (ISIS-WA). After a leadership change decision by ISIS in 2016, Boko Haram split into two factions: one led by Abubakar Shekau, continuing as Boko Haram, and the other as ISIS-WA.\n\nIn recent years, Boko Haram has been engaged in fighting with ISIS-WA, the Nigerian military, and regional forces under the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF). This conflict has led to the loss of territory, casualties, defections, desertions, and surrenders. Despite these challenges, Boko Haram has maintained a limited safe haven in northeast Nigeria into 2024.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2023, violence associated with Boko Haram and ISIS-WA has resulted in an estimated 40,000 deaths, mostly civilians, and displaced as many as 3 million people.\n\nThe conflict has spread to neighbouring Niger, Cameroon and Chad, prompting the formation of a regional military coalition to fight the militants.\n\nAdditionally, it has acquired other arms from the local black market.\n\nAlthough Boko Haram has lost ground in recent years, jihadists continue to attack rural communities in Nigeria on a regular basis. Over the course of the insurgency, Boko Haram has repeatedly deployed young women and girls to carry out suicide attacks. It has carried out raids, killing men and kidnapping women who venture outside the town in search of firewood and acacia fruits.", "source": {"uri": "livemint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mint"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mausam_jha@livemint.com", "name": "Mausam Jha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boko_Haram", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boko Haram"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwoza", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gwoza"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gwoza"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvised_explosive_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Improvised explosive device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suicide attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jihadism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jihadism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borno_State", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borno State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cameroon"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Cameroon"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Militia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiduguri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maiduguri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maiduguri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chad"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chad"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Niger"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Niger"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belgium"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinational_Joint_Task_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multinational Joint Task Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurgency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurgency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abubakar_Shekau", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abubakar Shekau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic State of Iraq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Africa"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.livemint.com/lm-img/img/2024/06/30/600x338/Nigeria-Hostages-Freed-9_1719721098291_1719721121245.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9693896", "eventUri": "eng-9693896", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

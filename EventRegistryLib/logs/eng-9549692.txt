Senate unveiled plans for free community college for all students", "body": "Senate Democrats on Monday unveiled plans to make community college free for all students in Massachusetts, starting in the fall semester of 2024.\n\nThe \"MassEducate\" plan, which will be part of the Senate's fiscal 2025 budget to be fully unveiled on Tuesday, would invest $75.5 million to cover tuition and fees for all residents, and offer a stipend to some students of up to $1,200 for books, supplies and other costs.\n\nThe Senate budget will also recommend continuing fiscal 2024 higher education investments, such as $18 million in free nursing programs at community colleges and $24 million that the state is currently investing in free community college for residents over 25. In total, the forthcoming budget invests $117.5 million to make community college free for all.\n\n\"I'm thrilled that we have taken access to higher education to the next level, as this initiative will bolster our educated workforce and lay the foundation for generations to come,\" Senate Ways and Means Chair Michael Rodrigues said in a statement. \"Tuition free community college impacts individuals most in need and whom otherwise would not be afforded this opportunity. It will greatly help to keep our workforce graduates stand ready to meet the challenges of a global economy.\"\n\nRodrigues called the plan affordable, sustainable and equitable.\n\nFree community college would be funded with surtax money, a spokesperson for Senate President Karen Spilka said, and the state just experienced a jolt in tax collections in April that beat projections by more than $1 billion. The bulk of the overage comes from capital gains tax and surtax revenues, a potentially promising sign for education investments linked to the surtax.\n\nSenators did not attach any income restrictions to the plan to make tuition and fees cost-free, though the $1,200 book stipends will only be available for students who make, or whose families earn, 125 percent or less of the state's median income.\n\nSpilka's office said community colleges attract a different demographic than four-year colleges in the commonwealth, including more diversity in age and minority backgrounds.\n\n\"We know if we want a generation of students to benefit from the terrific programs at our many community colleges across our state, we must remove the barriers to entry -- as many or all of them, if possible,\" Spilka said Monday morning at Middlesex Community College in Lowell.\n\nExecutive director of the Massachusetts Association of Community Colleges Nate Mackinnon, who supports the proposal, previously said making community college free for all is a simple message, and one that would lead to higher enrollment across income brackets. Spilka offered a similar argument on Monday.\n\n\"I think you would all agree that free is a lot easier to understand than, 'It will be free if there is the time, support of adults, (and) language capabilities needed to fill out these many complicated forms,'\" Spilka said. \"Making it simply free will break down the barrier that exists. That is why our plan will cover tuition and fees of every community college student in Massachusetts.\"\n\nWhen the Senate president first rolled out the idea in January, reporters asked if the promise of free community college would divert students who otherwise would have gone to four-year institutions to community colleges instead.\n\n\"I think in the long term this is going to absolutely be a benefit to the four-year institutions, both state universities and UMass, I think because of that transfer factor,\" replied Mount Wachusett Community College President James Vander Hooven, who was also at Monday's press conference.\n\nHe continued, \"We're already seeing a significant increase in students over 25 whose other alternative was to not go to college at all. So there's a pipeline. I'll just speak for myself, the relationship that we have with Fitchburg State at Mount Wachusett Community College -- we're at the table all of the time, putting together these transfer pathways for students between community college and state university.\"\n\nIn Lowell on Monday, Francesca Purcell, a senior lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said that similar free community college programs in Oregon, Tennessee and Texas initially diverted a \"small percentage\" of students away from four-year institutions. Still, Purcell said the programs also cause a \"larger percentage of students who would not have otherwise considered attending to actually go to college for the first time.\"\n\n\"Our 15 community colleges educate the highest percentage of low-income students in our state's public higher education system, while students who are fortunate enough to come from wealthy families are already mostly going to four-year colleges and universities,\" she said. \"I don't believe there'll be a significant amount of students from wealthy families opting to attend community colleges, but even if some do, the big goal here is to make sure that we are increasing college access and completion, especially for students from low-income backgrounds.\"\n\nSenate Democrats' higher education proposal marks a departure from the House budget, which allocates $24 million for MassReconnect but does not fund universal free community college. Gov. Maura Healey had also recommended funding MassReconnect at $24 million, a $4 million increase over the current fiscal year for the nascent program.\n\nThe funding discrepancy is likely to be hashed out in closed-door budget negotiations this summer, as lawmakers determine the best way to deploy $1.3 billion in surtax revenues on education and transportation investments. A spokesperson for House Speaker Ron Mariano, asked whether the House is open to considering the Senate's community college pitch, told the News Service, \"We'll review.\"\n\nSpilka signaled her branch's approach could be a boon for growing the state's workforce and preventing residents from leaving Massachusetts.\n\n\"By partnering with businesses, community college provides the kinds of hands-on, real-world training that creates the workforce that we so desperately need,\" Spilka said. \"We will be opening the floodgates to employers who are starved for a skilled workforce so Massachusetts keeps the competitive edge that we so very much pride ourselves in. It will help us train the next generation of health care workers, personal care attendants, lab technicians, clean tech workers, early educators and so many others.\"\n\nThe Senate recommends installing annual caps on tuition increases at community colleges, set to an inflation index, with the goal of ensuring \"the long-term fiscal sustainability\" of MassEducate, Spilka's office said. Lawmakers also want to create a working group tasked with overhauling how funding is awarded to community colleges based on their performance; direct the the Department of Higher Education to improve the process for transferring credits from community colleges to four-year colleges; and establish a commission to analyze financial aid offered to individuals attending state universities and the UMass system.\n\nThe Senate's proposal could help grow an existing transfer program between community colleges and four-year institutions, said Rob McCarron, CEO of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts.\n\n\"Nearly two-dozen independent colleges and universities in Massachusetts work with community colleges to provide a seamless and affordable transition to a four-year degree under the Transfer Guarantee Program,\" McCarron said in a statement to the News Service. \"However, as these students graduate from community college and wish to continue their studies at a four-year institution, it's absolutely critical that the state supports their choice to find the school - whether public or private - that best fits their talents, interests and learning styles, and ensure that state financial aid can go with them.\"\n\nUMass spokespeople did not immediately respond to News Service questions about the Senate's plan, including whether university officials are concerned about any enrollment impacts across the UMass system.\n\nFor months, senators have weighed different models to provide free community college, including a $170 million approach favored by the Massachusetts Association of Community Colleges to steer more funding to low-income students.\n\nPaul Craney, spokesperson for the conservative leaning research group Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, told the News Service he cautioned against the investment.\n\n\"There is nothing as expensive as making something free,\" he said. \"The cost will inevitably balloon and the taxpayers will forever be obligated to pay for this irresponsible decision. There is nothing more irresponsible than a politician making something 'free' and implying to people that someone else will pay for it. Everyone should have some skin in the game. The Senate would be irresponsible to pursue this.\"\n\nBeyond MassEducate, Senate budget-writers are proposing $10 million for a new \"Student Persistence Fund,\" which would flow to community colleges and state universities as they help support low-income students who face obstacles in completing their degrees. The money could cover costs tied to transportation, child care and food insecurity.\n\nSenators also want to invest $18.3 million in wraparound services for community college students, and increase investment in grants for students who opt directly into four-year colleges, called MASSGrant Plus.\n\nThe MASSGrant Plus program, which is meant to cover unmet costs of tuition and mandatory fees for low-income community college students across Massachusetts' public higher education institutions, was expanded to an $84 million investment last year. Healey's administration said a third of all University of Massachusetts students qualify for free tuition with the grant expansion approved last year.\n\nThe House sought to maintain that $80 million additional investment, while the Senate Ways and Means plan would inject an $21 million into the MASSGrant Plus grants.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

Pell-eligible students already eligible for a books stipend through state financial aid would also be eligible for a stipend for books, supplies, and costs of attendance, for a combined amount of up to $2,400 per year.\n\n\"With the historic investments announced today, ushering in universally free community college and more, the Senate doubles down on our commitment to build back the power and promise of public higher education,\" Comerford said. \"The Senate investments will propel the Commonwealth forward toward greater social equity and greater economic competitiveness.\"\n\nThe Senate's plan, which will be included in the chamber's FY 2025 budget, would continue to invest in programs created in the FY 2024 budget, including $18 million in free nursing programs at community colleges and $24 million in free community college for residents over age 25.\n\nStudents would be eligible for free tuition, fees and the stipend in the fall 2025 semester if the proposal is included in the Commonwealth's final FY 2025 budget.\n\nTo support students whose education paths can be jeopardized by unanticipated life events, Senate leaders announced the creation of the Student Persistence Fund, a $10 million investment that would go directly toward aiding community colleges and state universities in supporting low-income students with such costs that are shown to put someone's chance of finishing school at risk, such as transportation, childcare, or food insecurity.\n\nUnderstanding that retention and graduation is directly tied to support systems like advising and career planning, the Senate also proposed an $18.3 investment in the Supporting Urgent Community College Equity through Student Services (SUCCESS) program, which is designed for community colleges to invest in wraparound supports and services using models proven to strengthen outcomes for students facing systemic barriers, especially for colleges' most underserved populations.\n\nTo ensure the long-term fiscal sustainability of the program, the Senate's proposal would institute annual tuition-increase caps at community colleges set at an inflation index. And to hold community colleges accountable for producing positive outcomes, the proposal creates a working group to re-evaluate community-college performance funding, aimed at better aligning state funding with key metrics such as student success and workforce alignment.\n\nRecognizing that many Massachusetts students opt directly for four-year universities, the budget makes a historic $105 million investment in the Massachusetts financial-assistance program MassGrant Plus which keeps college costs low for students at all public colleges in the Commonwealth. This increased investment builds on recent investments that have allowed all Pell-eligible students in Massachusetts to go to a community college, state university, or UMass campus without paying tuition or fees.\n\nThe proposal additionally includes policy directives to study future paths to success for the Commonwealth's students. It directs the Department of Higher Education to improve the credit transfer pathway between two- and four-year institutions so students can easily transfer to a public four-year institution. It also creates a new commission to evaluate current state financial assistance for students to attend state universities and UMass and evaluate ways to further ensure accessibility and affordability of an education at these institutions.", "source": {"uri": "businesswest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessWest"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_bednar@businesswest.com", "name": "Joseph Bednar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipend", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stipend"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Community college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Comerford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jo Comerford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Rodrigues_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Rodrigues (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Spilka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karen Spilka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlesex_Community_College_(Massachusetts)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middlesex Community College (Massachusetts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senate of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competition_(economics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competition (economics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_university_system", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State university system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Massachusetts Amherst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools_of_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Schools of Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549692", "eventUri": "eng-9549692", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lowell, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The Massachusetts Senate pushes $118 million plan for that. - The Boston Globe", "body": "Under the Senate's plan, the state would cover tuition and fees for all residents, while certain residents also could receive a stipend of up to $1,200 to cover books, supplies, and other costs, according to Senate leaders. The program, dubbed MassEducate, would cost $75.5 million next fiscal year, funded using money generated by the state's so-called millionaires tax.\n\nSenate leaders say their proposal would also extend initiatives created last year that already cover community college tuition for students in nursing programs, at $18 million, and for residents 25 years or older, at $24 million -- in total, creating a $117.5 million program paid for entirely with millionaires tax revenue.\n\nTo control the costs the state government would be on the hook for under the Senate plan, legislative leaders said under the proposal they would seek to cap annual community college tuition increases at up to 4.5 percent. The Senate's measure would also plow millions of more dollars into a state-run financial aid program that covers other out-of-pocket costs of middle-income students.\n\nSenate leaders have touted their push for tuition-free community college as smart economic policy, arguing that it would help bolster Massachusetts home-grown workforce while cutting costs, particularly for people of color, who account for roughly 55 percent of the student population at Massachusetts community colleges.\n\nIt would also likely help reverse years of declining enrollment for these schools. Roughly a decade ago, the state's community colleges enrolled nearly 140,000 students; in fiscal year 2023, the state's 15 community colleges served just 90,000 students.\n\nThat downward trend began to change last year after the state moved to cover tuition costs for nursing students and those 25 years old and older, with enrollment jumping by roughly 5,000 more students last fall, according to state data.\n\nA legislatively funded report found that should the state pay for even more than the Senate is proposing, including covering tuition and fees, and providing millions of dollars in living stipends for community college students, the enrollment gains could be even larger: roughly 7,000, on average, per year over the next decade. The report pegged annual costs for that approach at $170 million.\n\nSpilka said last year that it was \"beyond time\" for the state to make community college tuition-free, and vowed to pursue a proposal during the current two-year session. Two-thirds of states already offer some type of \"free community college\" program, according to the Massachusetts Association of Community Colleges.\n\nBut it's unclear if other Beacon Hill leaders are aligned on this goal. The Massachusetts House passed its state budget plan late last month, and it did not include any plans for tuition-free community college. That means the Senate plan would have to survive closed-door talks between leaders in both chambers before it could move to Governor Maura Healey's desk.\n\nState tax collections have undergone wide swings this fiscal year, running well behind projections for months before surging $1 billion over expectations in April. That uncertainty has prompted some Democrats to preach fiscal caution, particularly after Healey slashed hundreds of millions in spending in January and froze some state hiring last month.\n\nBut the state's so-called millionaires tax has provided a newfound financial cushion. Passed by voters in 2022, the surtax on annual income over $1 million was expected to deliver as much as $1.7 billion in revenue this fiscal year, allowing lawmakers to shower new transportation and education initiatives with funding.\n\nState officials have already used the new revenue stream to make free school meals universal in public schools, expand financial aid at colleges and universities, and help fund school construction projects, among an array of other initiatives.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Community college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maura_Healey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maura Healey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beacon_Hill,_Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Beacon Hill, Boston"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_meal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "School meal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.S. state"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/ELfd95ruzbC30SBAiPsK4-G7Ubc=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/W2QWEOBPF2JOMFD4LSDBKWRJ4Q.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549692", "eventUri": "eng-9549692", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Now students can use some of that to cover living expenses maybe take a few more classes or work a little bit less,\" said Mark Hudgik, Interim Dean of Strategic Recruitment Initiatives.\n\nThe proposal also includes 18 million to support wraparound services designed to improve outcomes for students facing systemic barriers, and 10 million to help low-income students facing unanticipated life events that reduce their risk of finishing school. Funding would carry over money to continue supporting MassReconnect, which provides free nursing programs and community college for students over 25.\n\nThere are also some policy changes included in the proposal related to state funding and four-year institutions and a host of major benefits for the state through increasing enrollment.\n\nAlready, the MassReconnect program reversed a decade-long decline in community college enrollment, which had fallen to 90,000 students in 2024 from 139,000 in 2013. For those that take advantage, it makes a big difference. People with associate's degrees make $8,000 more per year on average than those with just a high school diploma. Increased revenues and reduced reliance on unemployment would produce an estimated $25 million in tax benefits for the state.\n\nThe proposal also takes things a step further, easing the transfer for four-year institutions.", "source": {"uri": "wpri.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WPRI.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Community college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holyoke,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holyoke, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Holyoke, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holyoke_Community_College", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holyoke Community College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associate degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_diploma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school diploma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nursing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Education/High_School_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Education/High School Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://www.wpri.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2024/05/snapshot-2024-05-07T054036.706.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549692", "eventUri": "eng-9549692", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Holyoke, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

They warned that if \"the standard community college funding formula is reimplemented, many colleges could see rapid declines in state funding. This of course would jeopardize some of the programs that colleges found to be successful at retaining and growing enrollments.\"\n\nCommunity colleges help power the Golden State's economy, the report states, offering low-income Californians access to job skills and education.\n\nDuring the pandemic, enrollment declined 15% at community colleges, with a particularly sharp decline for Black, Latino and low-income students. In addition, the community college system lost nearly 300,000 enrolled students between fall 2019 and fall 2021.\n\nAbout 46% of students also reduced their course load during the pandemic, citing mental stress and the need to care for family. Other barriers included access to work spaces, high-speed internet and course materials. In 2023, nearly two-thirds of students experienced housing and food insecurity or increased medical costs.\n\nThe federal government passed three pandemic relief bills between March 2020 and March 2021, allocating $77 billion in emergency funding to higher education institutions across the U.S.\n\nCalifornia received the largest share, at $10.1 billion. By January 2023, the state's community colleges had received about $4.4 billion in total funding, with nearly $1.8 billion directed towards cash support for students.\n\nCommunity colleges in California found strategic ways to use this money, the researchers found. Institutions invested in improving resources for online classes, forgiving some debts and fines and providing free books, laptops and Wi-Fi hotspots.\n\nAround 93% of the funding went to improving campus safety and technology hardware -- by far the biggest expenditure. Second on the list was money spent purchasing equipment and supplies and covering lost revenue.\n\nRather than giving all students the same awards, many colleges decided to equitably distribute emergency aid to students based on need, the researchers noted approvingly. The funds helped support Pell Grants, financial aid and costs for Black and Latino students, the researchers found, while about one-in-three colleges also used funds to support campus-based food pantries or child care resources.\n\nWithout emergency pandemic funds, continuing to maintain such support could be a challenge, researchers warned. California lawmakers are negotiating a budget to address a multi-year $38 billion budget deficit.\n\nData from the National Student Clearinghouse suggest that community college enrollment grew in 2024. Nonetheless, colleges surveyed for the report told researchers they're concerned about widening income and racial gaps, as well as cuts to instructional programs.\n\nAccording to the report, some colleges found success by using funds to increase enrollment after emergency shutdowns. One college said that after offering direct financial aid, counseling assistance, funding for technology grants and $300 book vouchers, it managed to persuade 382 students to reenroll out of 1,820 that had dropped out.\n\n\"An emergency grant can make the difference between staying enrolled and dropping out,\" the researchers stated. \"Low-income students can often be derailed by not having sufficient money for gas, car maintenance, housing, electricity, water, and other basic needs.\"\n\nGoing forward, researchers recommended that California learn from its successes during the pandemic and continue to invest in support systems like campus food pantries, housing assistance and subsidized childcare. Furthermore, they said, many colleges saw great results from canceling students' debts, such as those from overdue book fees.\n\nThe researchers said the state can also focus funds on building colleges' ability to maintain current emergency aid for students facing housing and food insecurity -- though without more federal funding, doing so could be a challenge. The California's Legislative Analyst's Office, a nonpartisan agency that gives the Legislature fiscal and policy advice, earlier this year cautioned Governor Gavin Newsom about using $226 million for higher education, nearly all of which is for community colleges. In February, it also knocked Newsom's plan to allow schools and community colleges to keep $8 billion in cash disbursements.", "source": {"uri": "courthousenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Court House News Service"}, "authors": [{"uri": "natalie_hanson@courthousenews.com", "name": "Natalie Hanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Community college"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Policy_Institute_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public Policy Institute of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subsidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Think tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonprofit organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educational_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Educational technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Food security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_access", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet access"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_lower_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American lower class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Legislative_Analyst's_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California Legislative Analyst's Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell_Grant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pell Grant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_voucher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "School voucher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deficit_spending", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deficit spending"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisanism", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nonpartisanism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child care"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Funds", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Grants", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/College_Financing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/College Financing", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Research_Funding", "label": "dmoz/Science/Organizations/Research Funding", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Research_Funding", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Research Funding", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2022/08/graduation-cap-gown.jpeg/w=3000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9549692", "eventUri": "eng-9549692", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 2174, "textEnd": 2184}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

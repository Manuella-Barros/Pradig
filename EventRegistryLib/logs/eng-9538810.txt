In the highly anticipated main event of the evening, undisputed super bantamweight champion Naoya Inoue (27-0, 24 knockouts) squared off against Luis Nery (35-2, 27 knockouts). ESPN+ aired the bout live.\n\nOn Monday, Naoya Inoue strengthened his reputation as the top lightweight fighter in the world by stopping Luis Nery via technical knockout to keep his unchallenged junior featherweight title.\n\nA powerful left hook sent Inoue on the canvas for the first time in his 12-year professional career, shocking the sold-out Tokyo Dome audience of about 50,000 spectators into silence toward the end of the opening round.\n\nHowever, Inoue -- the unbeaten Japanese superstar known as the Monster -- repaid the favour and then some with laser-like intensity. Before ending the fight with a stunning right hook in the sixth, he had already taken out his Mexican opponent in the second and fifth rounds.\n\n\"The Monster\" storms back to give Nery three knockdowns, the last coming in the sixth round, following the first of Inoue's career. After the fight, Inoue claims that the early knockdown gave him \"motivation.\n\n\" During the fight, Inoue fired 127 punches and landed 62, yielding a 49 per cent strike rate.

I was not happy I got knocked down,\" Inoue said.\n\n\"That happening gave me good motivation. I am so thankful to get the fight against Nery.\"\n\nInoue has become such a star in his home country that he was able to headline the first boxing event at the Tokyo Dome since James 'Buster' Douglas produced one of the biggest upsets in sports history against Mike Tyson in 1990.\n\n'The Monster', as Inoue is nicknamed, sold out the historic venue and reportedly earned \u00a35.2m before a punch was even thrown.\n\nInoue's rock star profile was further emphasised by his entrance, as legendary Japanese musician Tomoyasu Hotei welcomed him to the ring.\n\nHotei played his song 'Battle Without Honor or Humanity', made famous worldwide when it was used in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies.\n\nInoue entered stony-faced and flanked by a massive firework display, not unlike how heavyweights Anthony Joshua or Tyson Fury might walk to the ring when they fight at Wembley Stadium.\n\nBut after a lavish entrance just after 21:00 local time, there was a wretched start for Inoue as he was knocked down by a beautiful left hook from 29-year-old Nery in the opening round.\n\nFighting from a southpaw stance, Nery caught Inoue flush, but the defending champion recovered well to survive the round.\n\nIt was the first time Inoue, a man with 23 knockouts in 26 fights, had hit the deck.\n\nInoue went on the offensive in the second round and moving backwards landed a lightning quick counter left hook to drop Nery.\n\nThe Mexican was quickly back to his feet, but having touched the canvas he began to be more cautious in his approach.\n\nInoue, meanwhile, began to settle into a dangerous rhythm, firing powerful shots at Nery and ducking under the left hook that dropped him earlier in the fight.\n\nThe defending champion was so comfortable he began to showboat when Nery missed, playing to the crowd as he mixed in body and head shots.\n\nInoue continued to land and dropped Nery again in round five with another left hook, this time from close range.\n\nNery rose again, seeing out the round, before Inoue moved in for the finish in round six.\n\nInoue marched Nery down, backing him on to the ropes and almost sent him through them with the final blow.\n\nTakuma Inoue, the younger brother of Naoya, made a successful defence of his WBA bantamweight title by beating Sho Ishida on points.\n\nComing into the fight, Ishida had 37 fights to Inoue's 20 and he caught the defending champion by surprise with a stiff jab in the opening exchanges.\n\nInoue shook off the knockdown and quickly took control, drawing blood from Ishida's nose in the second round.\n\nAll three judges handed Inoue a dominant victory, 118-109, 118-109 and 116-111, as he improved his record to 20 wins and just one loss.\n\nHis next fight could be an all-Japanese unification bout as Yoshiki Takei's victory over Jason Moloney in the co-main event in Tokyo completed the Japanese domination of the bantamweight division.\n\nTakei dethroned Moloney to win the WBO bantamweight title, joining his compatriots Takuma Inoue, Junto Nakatani (WBC) and Ryosuke Nishida (IBF) as world champions in the division.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"},

Inoue vs. Nery sits atop a stacked card that serves as the first boxing event to be held in the Tokyo Dome since James \"Buster\" Douglas' historic upset of Mike Tyson in 1990.\n\nInoue has become one of the most dominant forces in boxing, with his 26-0 record featuring 23 wins by knockout. Inoue has won titles at junior flyweight, junior bantamweight, bantamweight and now junior featherweight, going undisputed at the two latter weights.\n\nInoue spent his 2023 conquering junior featherweight in just two fights. In July, Inoue faced WBO and WBC champion Stephen Fulton in a highly-anticipated fight only to thrash Fulton before scoring the stoppage in the eighth round. That set up a December showdown with IBF and WBA champ Marlon Tapales, winning the fight with a stoppage in Round 10.\n\nNery is an intriguing opponent based on his history in Japan. After Nery stopped Shinsuke Yamanaka in a 2017 bout in Japan to win the WBC bantamweight title, it was announced Nery had failed a drug test. The title went back to Yamanaka but the result of the fight ultimately stood as the failed test was determined to be the result of contaminated food.\n\nNery then rematched Yamanaka two fights later, this time scoring a TKO in the second round. Nery again failed to win the WBC title as he'd missed weight by three pounds. As a result, Japan's boxing commission suspended Nery from ever fighting in the country again.\n\nThat ban was reversed when Inoue began to target a fight with Nery and means that the already pro-Inoue crowd will be even more enthusiastic in cheering against Nery, who twice stopped a Japanese fan favorite under questionable circumstances.\n\nThe rest of the card is loaded with world title clashes. Jason Moloney will defend the WBO bantamweight championship against Yoshiki Takei, Seigo Yuri Akui will put his WBA flyweight championship on the line against Taku Kuwahara and WBA bantamweight champion Takuma Inoue will defend his belt against Sho Ishida.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard with the latest odds before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event below.\n\nInoue vs. Nery fight card, oddsFavoriteUnderdogWeight class\n\nNoaya Inoue (c) -1200\n\nLuis Nery +700\n\nUndisputed super bantamweight tilte\n\nJason Moloney (c) -200\n\nYoshiki Takei +160\n\nWBO bantamweight title\n\nSeigo Yuri Akui (c)\n\nTaku Kuwahara\n\nWBA flyweight title\n\nTakuma Inoue (c) -700\n\nSho Ishida +500\n\nWBA bantamweight title\n\nPrediction\n\nNery is a solid fighter. He has been in with talented opposition and has had to gut through fights, like his February 2023 thriller with Azat Hovhannisyan. That said, Inoue is a different animal than anyone else in boxing. Inoue is a relentless fighter who not only has massive knockout power, but is one who possesses true boxing skills.\n\nInoue is a nearly perfect fighter, the kind of \"Monster\" you would create in a lab to dominate the boxing world. Yes, he's a -1200 favorite, but that would be the case against basically any available opponent. Inoue is that good. Nery returning to Japan after his suspension should almost be seen as a punishment given what Inoue is capable of doing to him.

Moloney claimed the WBO title two fights against with a majority decision win over Vincent Astrolabio in May 2023. He retained his crown with another majority decision over Saul Sanchez in January.\n\n\"I've had an amazing preparation and am in the best condition of my career,\" Moloney said this week. \"I'm very excited to be part of this historic event and I'm so well-prepared to put on an incredible fight. I'm ready to defend my title.\n\n\"Every time I step in the ring, I give my all, and I plan on giving the fans an exciting fight on Monday night. Takei is fighting to become a world champion, but I am in the best shape of my career and ready to put on the best performance of my career.\"\n\nElsewhere, Seigo Yuri Akui looks to defend his WBA flyweight title against Taku Kuwahara. The matchup is a rematch of their 2021 meeting where Auki scored a 10th-round TKO. Auki has won seven in a row, including a decision over Artem Dalakian in January to claim the WBA crown.

Moving up various weight classes, Inoue's current home is the super bantamweight division, where he is the undisputed champion. He defends his status against Luis Nery on May 6.\n\nThe fight airs on ESPN+ in the U.S. and will be in the legendary Tokyo Dome.\n\nInoue's last five fights have been in Japan, with this being the sixth. There has been debate about whether Inoue needs to fight in the U.S. more to be considered an all-time great. Top Rank has invested a lot in Inoue, and the promotion fully supports his star power in his home country.\n\nNery won a Fight of the Year contender against Azat Hovhannisyan in February 2023 and made it known he wanted to face the winner of Inoue vs. Stephen Fulton, a fight Inoue won to become WBC and WBO super bantamweight champion. The Mexican fighter had to wait longer for a fight, as Inoue later beat Marlon Tapales in December to become undisputed at 122.\n\nWATCH: Naoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery, exclusively on ESPN+\n\n\"Pantera\" has 35 wins in a boxing ring, with 27 via knockout. The former bantamweight champion has had his issues in the ring, including failed drug tests and botched weigh-ins, but is not someone to think of as an afterthought. Inoue is ready for a true challenge heading into a massive homecoming fight.\n\n\"My impression is that Nery is a fighter who likes to mix it up. He is resilient and has a strong will to fight... but I have confidence in myself to be able to be better than him even in the early rounds,\" Inoue told The Ring. \"If there is something I need to be careful about, it's that he is good at throwing combinations from middle range, and it's like he throws punches while moving. I'll need to pay attention to his sense of distance [and take control the distance].\"\n\nThe Sporting News will provide all you need to know about Inoue vs. Nery, from channel, time, and card.\n\nThe Naoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery main card will air on ESPN+ in the U.S. The undercard will air exclusively on ESPN+.\n\nIf Inoue vs. Nery is not available to watch live in your location or if you're traveling abroad, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

It gave me a lot of energy.\"\n\nIt was the first boxing event to be held at the Tokyo Dome since 42-1 underdog James \"Buster\" Douglas knocked out unbeaten heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in February 1990 in one of the sport's biggest upsets.\n\n\"There was a lot of pressure on me as the main event in the first boxing at Tokyo Dome in 34 years, but it gave me strength,\" Inoue said.\n\nInoue took his record to 27-0 with 24 wins by knockout.\n\nIt was his first fight since becoming the undisputed super bantamweight world champion in December.\n\nHe is just the second man to become undisputed world champion at two different weights since the four-belt era began in 2004. American Terence Crawford was the first.\n\nFans at the Tokyo Dome gave the 31-year-old a rapturous welcome as he entered the cavernous venue with all four world championship belts up for grabs.\n\nA huge upset looked like it could be on the cards when Nery sent the champion sprawling.\n\nBut it seemed to energise Inoue, and he came flying out of his corner to send Nery down in the second round.\n\nInoue continued to land ferocious blows, and he sent his opponent to the canvas again with a left hook in the fifth round.\n\nThe referee stopped the fight after Inoue downed Nery for a third time in the sixth round.\n\nNery, a former two-division world champion, was fighting in Japan for the first time since he was stripped of his bantamweight world title in 2018 after failing to make weight for a bout there.\n\nHe was subsequently banned from fighting in Japan, but the country's Boxing Commission gave him the green light to compete against Inoue.\n\nNery was booed when he was introduced to the Tokyo Dome crowd.\n\nThe 29-year-old's record fell to 35-2 with 27 KOs.\n\nInoue was fighting at super bantamweight for only the third time after beating American Stephen Fulton and Marlon Tapales of the Philippines last year for a clean sweep of the titles.\n\nHe moved up in weight class after becoming the first undisputed bantamweight world champion since Panama's Enrique Pinder in 1972.\n\nEarlier, fighting on the undercard, Japan's Yoshiki Takei beat Australian defending champion Jason Moloney by unanimous decision to win the WBO bantamweight world title.\n\nTakei started strongly before Moloney came back into the bout in his second title defence.\n\nBut the Japanese fighter, a former kickboxer who had won all eight of his previous boxing matches by knockout, took the title in front of a raucous crowd .", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The event will be shown live on ESPN+ in the U.S. starting at 4:00 a.m. ET this Monday, May 6.\n\nRevenge or Risk?\n\nInoue (26-0, 23 KOs) wanted to fight Nery (35-1, 27 KOs) rather than move up to featherweight to take on the big dogs at 126.\n\nSome fans believe 'Monster' Inoue chose the recently knocked out Nery to avenge fellow countryman Shinsuke Yamanaka's two defeats against him in 2017 and 2018.\n\nIf this is a move by Inoue for national pride, it's too late. Inoue should have fought Nery in 2018, not 2024 BEFORE he'd been knocked out. It's kind of pointless now, with Nery having been destroyed by Brandon Figueroa in 2021. How does Inoue come out ahead, beating a fighter who was already knocked out?\n\nFigueroa should be the one that Inoue is targeting rather than his knockout victim. Of course, that's a much more dangerous fight for Inoue, and he might lose. It would be more heroic on Inoue's part to fight one of these killers at 126 and 130:\n\nThe Inoue vs. Nery fight has gone under the radar for most U.S. boxing fans, as it hasn't been heavily promoted in the States, and the event time makes it impossible to see unless Americans call off work.\n\nIt would be interesting to be a fly on the wall at Top Rank headquarters and listen to their thoughts on the early morning broadcast of Inoue's fight against Nery. As the co-promoters for Naoya Inoue, Top Rank can't get a good deal with his fights being shown early in the morning.\n\nWith the event starting at 4:00 am ET / 1:00 am PT, it's not going to be seen by many Americans until afterward if they're willing to watch it's already happened.\n\nNaoya's brother, Takuma Inoue is fighting on the undercard. Takuma won his WBA bantamweight title last year, defeating 41-year-old Liborio Sol\u00eds by a 12-round decision.\n\nIn Takuma's last fight, he stopped Jerwin Ancajas in the ninth round.

On the line will be Inoue's status as the undisputed super bantamweight champion. The fight airs on ESPN+ in the U.S.\n\nA top figure on boxing's pound-for-pound list, Inoue is a four-division champion. He is also a two-division undisputed champion, a rare class to be in. Inoue beat Paul Butler in 2022 to become undisputed at bantamweight and decimated Marlon Tapales in December to hold all the gold at super bantamweight.\n\nNery won the WBC and Ring bantamweight titles in 2017, but after testing positive for the banned substance zilpaterol, he got stripped of The Ring title. After missing weight ahead of a Shinsuke Yamanaka rematch, Nery was stripped of the WBC title and banned from competing in Japan. He fought twice in 2023, beating his opponents via knockout.\n\nInoue called for Nery to get exiled from boxing following his controversies, which included missing weight against Emmanuel Rodriguez and the fight getting nixed. So, there is a bit of a rivalry here. Though he is the underdog, Nery, now allowed in Japan, believes Inoue is just another fighter in his way of greatness.\n\nWATCH: Naoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery, exclusively on ESPN+\n\n\"Inoue is a very good fighter, and this is the biggest fight of my career - four titles are on the line,\" Nery told Boxing Scene. \"But, I've seen his fights, and I think he's overrated. I think he's an ordinary fighter, or, at least, that's how it appears to me. I'm going there looking for the knockout. I'm not going to Japan looking for a decision.\n\n\"I have the typical Mexican style. I like to come forward. I like throwing punches. I'm prepared to go 12 rounds. But I hope it doesn't go the 12 rounds. I want it to end early. You will see a conditioned, stronger, faster, and intelligent Nery who hits hard.\"\n\nThe Sporting News will provide all you need to know about the fight, from time, channel, and card.\n\nThe main card starts at 4 a.m. ET.

Boxing insiders, experts and fighter picks and predictions for May 6 matchup", "body": "Undisputed super bantamweight champion Naoya Inoue has dominated world-level boxing for a decade and looks to extend his remarkable legacy at the expense of dangerous Mexican contender Luis Nery at the Tokyo Dome on May 6.\n\nThe 12-round bout, plus undercard action, will air on ESPN+ in the U.S.\n\nInoue (26-0, 23 KOs) is the perfect blend of speed, power and technique. The Japanese star has outpunched the punchers and outboxed the boxers since turning professional in 2012. Nonito Donaire tested \"The Monster\" in The Ring Magazine Fight of the Year for 2019 but was annihilated inside two rounds in a rematch.\n\nWATCH: Naoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery, exclusively on ESPN+\n\nNery (35-1, 27 KOs) is arguably the most formidable opponent left for Inoue at 122 pounds. Thanks to his skill and punching power, the Tijuana-based southpaw has held WBC championships at bantamweight and super bantamweight. In February of last year, Nery scored a sensational 11th-round stoppage over Azat \"Crazy A\" Hovhannisyan in a bout that was named Ring Magazine Fight of the Year for 2023.\n\nWill \"The Monster\" devour another challenger, or can \"Pantera\" spring the colossal upset?\n\nThe Sporting News touched base with boxing insiders and experts to gather their thoughts on this power-packed showdown.\n\nNery is a good fighter with plenty of experience. He's a good campaigner, but he's been around a long time and [that wear and tear] is a huge disadvantage against someone like Inoue, who is an absolute... well... monster.\n\nAnd it's not all about Inoue's power; it's his ring IQ, his intelligence and his actual boxing ability. I think he's more than equipped to do a job on Nery in this one. I fancy Inoue to stop him, carry on with the run and get another sensational knockout. It could be tricky and competitive early, but Inoue breaks him down.\n\nInoue is the complete package. He's proven [against Nonito Donaire] that even when he's in a real horrible fight, a hard fight with hard rounds, he can still come through.\n\nI think Inoue gets it. He's faster, he's stronger and he has the momentum.\n\nInoue's record is unbelievable. He's been going through the divisions and beating the top contenders time after time. He's an absolute credit to boxing in how he's gone about his business.\n\nNery is a good fighter. He has that black mark regarding the failed drug test, but he's really good and he's someone that could test Inoue. But I just don't see anybody in the super bantamweight division putting a dent in him in the near future.\n\nLook what Inoue did to Stephen Fulton -- it was one-sided and pretty easy, and we've not heard a thing from Fulton since. Inoue was brilliant in that fight.\n\nNery is a good opponent, I'm not discrediting him, but Inoue is elite. He has a bit of stardust about him and I don't see any super bantamweight beating him... or many featherweights either.\n\nPrediction: Inoue KO\n\nIn Inoue's last fight, [Marlon] Tapales did some really good work against him. He didn't cause him real problems, but he had moments in some of the rounds and didn't really push forward. He went to the body and stuff, but Inoue just went through the gears.\n\nI think Nery is a really good fighter, but having went up against Inoue (with Paul Butler), if one thing isn't working, he'll just go to something else. And that's the thing with him, he's not a one-trick pony. Inoue can box, he can fight, he can move, he can dance, he can pickpocket shots, he can throw combinations, he can go well to head and body.\n\nIs Nery one step too far? I don't think so. Inoue and his team have been very calculating in their choice of opponents and the way they've worked their way through the divisions. I don't think they've made it this far to make a mistake now. They'll have seen something in Nery that they can deal with.\n\nFair play to Nery for taking such a hard fight, but I'll be going with Inoue, possibly by late stoppage.\n\nI have yet to see any evidence that Inoue is slipping or that he's in any way less interested in his career than before. I see him as one of the top two or three fighters in the world, on the same level as Terence Crawford.\n\nI don't know enough about the opponent to offer any reason why I think Luis Nery can beat Inoue. I think Inoue is a solid favorite in the fight. He's a brilliant fighter.\n\nThe fight is in Tokyo, so I'll pick him to win by KO. I think he'll want to please his audience.\n\nPrediction: Inoue by KO\n\n[Inoue's] a special talent and it's hard to see anyone beating him.\n\nI see [Inoue] winning and I think it will be a super exciting fight while it lasts, because Nery isn't the sort of guy that will come over and just want to lay down or survive. He's going to be going for the knockout and going for the kill himself, which will make a super exciting fight. When you get guys like that that are coming to win, it leaves the opportunities for them to get hurt themselves even more.\n\nIt'll make a super exciting fight and I think Inoue will knock Nery out. [I'm] really looking forward to getting the win (over Yoshiki Takei on the undercard) and sitting up in the stands and experiencing that one live.\n\nPrediction: Inoue\n\nI fully expected to see the best version of Inoue this time. This is such a huge event in Japan, and the continuous trash talks from Nery fuel \"The Monster\" even more.\n\nNery has a puncher's chance, especially in the early rounds, so my guess is Inoue could start somewhat cautiously but once he starts to hit Nery's body effectively, the fight is basically over. Nery was hurt and knocked out by body shots before, and Inoue is one of the best body punchers in the business today. Inoue by fourth-round stoppage. We will see another perfect game from \"The Monster\".", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_magazine_Fight_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Ring magazine Fight of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Ring (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonito_Donaire", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nonito Donaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southpaw_stance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southpaw stance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fulton_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Fulton (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshiki_Takei", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yoshiki Takei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Butler_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Butler (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-04/240306-6.jpg?itok=7kq7ObW2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 216, "textEnd": 221}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Luis Nery capitalized with a sharp counter left hook that spun \"The Monster\" around for the knockdown, the first of his 27-fight professional career.\n\nInoue, 31, a four-division champion, landed on all fours and quickly collected himself, listening to the referee's count from one knee. He appeared astonished, as did the 44,000-plus fans on hand. After all, Inoue has rarely displayed even a modicum of vulnerability during his incredible run.\n\nThe last time a boxing event took place at the Tokyo Dome was 34 years ago when perhaps the greatest upset in sports history transpired, James \"Buster\" Douglas' KO of Mike Tyson for the undisputed heavyweight champion. Tyson was a 42-1 favorite, while Inoue was a 16-1 favorite.\n\nRated No. 2 pound-for-pound by ESPN, Inoue has barely lost a round in the pros. The last time he truly faced adversity inside the ring was in November 2019, when he battled through a fractured nose and broken orbital against future Hall of Famer Nonito Donaire.\n\nInoue (27-0, 24 KOs) rallied to floor Donaire in Round 11 and the \"Filipino Flash\" was in serious trouble, but he made it to the final bell. Inoue settled for the decision victory in ESPN's 2019 fight of the year. Four bouts later in June 2022, Inoue made easy work of Donaire with a second-round TKO.\n\nOn Monday, Inoue swiftly corrected his mistake once again. After the knockdown, the 31-year-old kept his guard tighter and began to time Nery, punching in between his powerful shots.\n\nIn Round 2, Inoue turned the tables with a left hook of his own that dropped Mexico's Nery for the count. Nery, 29, was up before the count of 10 but was floored twice more during the 122-pound title bout.\n\nInoue returned Nery to the canvas with another blistering left hook in Round 5. The following round, Inoue finished matters when a right hand blasted Nery (35-2, 27 KOs) through the ropes, his head resting on the bottom rope as the referee waved off the action for the sixth-round KO victory.\n\n\"How did you like that big surprise in the first round?\" Inoue asked the crowd in Japanese. \" ... That happening gave me motivation and I was so focused until the end of the fight.\"\n\nIt showed. Inoue outlanded Nery 107-54 and was barely touched following the first-round knockdown. Despite the rare, momentary lapse in focus, Inoue proved he's still invincible; still one of the two best fighters in the world regardless of weight, and still one of the all-time greats.\n\nThis fight meant just a little more to the boxing-crazed nation of Japan. Nery became a villain in the \"Land of the Rising Sun\" after a pair of indiscretions surrounding fights with another Japanese star, Shinsuke Yamanaka.\n\nNery traveled to Japan in August 2017 and dethroned Yamanaka with a fourth-round TKO. Yamanaka had held the WBC bantamweight title since November 2011 and had made 12 successful defenses.\n\nAfterward, Nery was suspended when the performance-enhancing drug Zilpaterol was found in his system. Nery scored a second-round stoppage in the rematch in March 2018, but once again, the fight wasn't on even terms. This time, Nery was three pounds overweight at 121 pounds. Yamanaka never competed again.\n\nThe violations led to an indefinite suspension from the Japan Boxing Commission and vilified Nery in the nation. The ban was lifted earlier this year to allow Nery to proceed with the fight, and Inoue delivered by punishing the title challenger.\n\n\"I know there's some difficult feelings among Japanese boxing fans because of his fights in the past but I personally appreciate Nery,\" Inoue said. \"That's why I shook hands with him after the fight.\"\n\nInoue then shook hands with another boxer, Australia's Sam Goodman. He could be next for Inoue, if not Uzbekistan's Murodjon Akhmadaliev. There's a rotation system to determine which mandatory challenger is next for his shot at boxing's unified champions.\n\nGoodman is the top-ranked 122-pounder with the WBO and IBF, while Akhmadaliev is the WBA's No. 1 contender.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to the negotiation to fight against Sam Goodman in September,\" Inoue said.\n\n\"I've been mandatory for over a year, either give up the belts or fight me,\" Goodman responded. \"Let's get it on.\"\n\nNo matter the order, Goodman (18-0, 8 KOs), ESPN's No. 7 junior featherweight, and Akhmadaliev (12-1, 9 KOs), ESPN's No. 4, appear to have the next cracks at solving the Inoue puzzle.\n\nAfter that, Inoue will likely move up to 126 pounds, where he'll look to conquer a fifth weight class. Maybe then, Inoue will meet a fighter who can truly test the limits of his greatness. For now, he is peerless. Enjoy him while he's here.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But \"The Monster\" rallied to score a trio of thrilling knockdowns en route to a sixth-round finish of Nery (35-2, 27 KOs), a former two-division champion, in their 122-pound title bout in Tokyo.\n\nThe fight, contested in front of more than 40,000 fans inside the Tokyo Dome, marked the venue's first major boxing event since James \"Buster\" Douglas upset Mike Tyson in 1990.\n\nThe victory only added to Inoue's growing (and increasingly legendary) lore. After winning his first world title in just his sixth pro fight, the 31-year-old Inoue has gone on to claim titles in four weight classes, including achieving four-belt undisputed status in two separate divisions.\n\nInoue was forced to showcase every bit of his P4P greatness due to the daring combination of Nery's guts and punching power.\n\n\"This is the first Tokyo Dome boxing event in 34 years,\" Inoue said, through a translator. \"I am so happy to be here. Thank you to everyone!\"\n\nInoue sounded relieved and almost grateful when recalling the first-round knockdown that nearly cost him his unbeaten record in Round 1, when Inoue made an uncharacteristic technical error by backing up with his hands down. A clubbing, counter left hook from Nery suddenly placed Inoue on the verge of peril.\n\n\"A big surprise happened in the first round. I am so thankful it happened,\" Inoue said. \"Actually, that happening gave me good motivation. I am so thankful to get a fight against Luis Nery today at Tokyo Dome.\n\n\"I don't remember nothing of what my dad told me during intermission [after Round 1] but that happening gave me motivation and I was so focused until the end of the fight.\"\n\nWhen asked to detail how he was able to regain his poise so quickly by rallying to score a strategic knockdown of his own in Round 2, when Inoue caught Nery overextending and squared up with a perfectly short left hook to pull things even on the scorecards, Inoue reiterated just how much of it was done on instinct.\n\n\"I keep telling you that I don't remember anything very well,\" Inoue said.\n\nInoue outlanded the 29-year-old Nery by a margin of 21-4 in Round 1, according to CompuBox, and went on to nearly double Nery in total punches landed (107 to 54) en route to landing an incredible 49% of his power shots.\n\nAlthough Nery remained dangerous until the end, Inoue began to systematically break him down to the body. In Round 5, with his back to the ropes, Inoue uncorked another impossibly short left hook to drop Nery for a second time.\n\nInoue went on to finish Nery in Round 6 after cornering him and connecting with a perfect counter right hand. Nery crumbled to the canvas as referee Michael Griffin waived off the bout at 1:22 of the round.\n\nNery had previously been banned from fighting on Japanese soil and needed to receive special clearance to compete in the event.\n\nThe issue dates back to Nery's 2017 knockout of Shinsuke Yamanaka in their bantamweight title bout, during a fight in which Nery tested positive for banned substances. Nery badly missed weight ahead of their 2018 rematch, which also took place in Japan, and had his license suspended following the second-round finish.\n\nAfter the victory on Monday, Inoue welcomed unbeaten mandatory challenger Sam Goodman (18-0, 8 KOs) into the ring and hyped up a future clash against the native of Australia.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_campbell@cbssports.com", "name": "Brian Campbell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buster Douglas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weight class (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_challenger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mandatory challenger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompuBox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CompuBox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Yamanaka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Yamanaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doping_in_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doping in sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/05/06/7d993c02-a5bb-4a70-9f88-7ce3fa2a85d9/thumbnail/1200x675/e52c8a4c2fe547a649d44c9c930c6cce/naoya-inoue-belts-nery.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Inoue's strategic advantage and knockdowns prove too much for Nery, leading to a decisive knockout in the sixth round.\n\nNaoya Inoue successfully defends his undisputed super-bantamweight championship against Luis Nery at the prestigious Tokyo Dome in Japan. The Japanese superstar improves his record to 27-0 with 24 knockouts. In the battle, he knocked down Nery three times and dominated the tough Mexican after surviving an early knockdown in the first round.\n\nNery boasts a remarkable record as a two-weight world champion, claiming both the WBC and Ring magazine bantamweight titles from 2017 to 2018, and later securing the WBC super bantamweight title from 2020 until May 2021. However, his career faced a setback in 2018 when he was stripped of his bantamweight world title due to a weight issue ahead of a fight in Japan. This incident led to an indefinite ban by the Japan Boxing Commission, preventing him from competing in the country until this year, when the ban was finally lifted.\n\nRelated Japanese Boxer Kazuki Anaguchi Dies in Hospital Following Defeat to Seiya Tsutsumi on Naoya Inoue Undercard Japanese Boxer Kazuki Anaguchi tragically dies at age 23 after fight with Seiya Tsutsumi.\n\nBoth Naoya Inoue and Luis Nery stand at 5 feet 5 inches tall, but Inoue holds a notable two-and-a-half-inch reach advantage. Both fighters easily made weight for the junior featherweight division limit of 122 pounds at the official weigh-in held yesterday.\n\nNaoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery Round By Round\n\nThe Monster Dominated His Opponent After An Early Scare\n\nIn the opening round, Naoya Inoue and Luis Nery engage in a spirited exchange before the Mexican delivers a punishing hook that sends the Japanese champion to the canvas for the first time in his career. Despite the setback, Inoue appears to recover by the round's end.\n\nMoving into the second round, both fighters trade jabs, with Nery seeking to replicate his earlier success. However, it's Inoue who turns the tables, scoring a knockdown as Nery lunges forward.\n\nBy the third round, Inoue seems to have found his rhythm, landing stiff left hands and outmaneuvering his opponent.\n\nIn the fourth round, Inoue capitalizes on his superior speed, punishing Nery for his aggressive approach and dominating the exchanges. Despite showing signs of damage, Nery remains resilient, pressing forward and attempting to engage on the inside. Inoue lands another left hook, sending Nery to the canvas once more, but the Mexican survives the round.\n\nIn the sixth round, Nery continues to struggle against Inoue's speed and power before succumbing to a devastating knockout, bringing an end to the contest.", "source": {"uri": "thesportster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSportster"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frank_yemi@thesportster.com", "name": "Frank Yemi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Ring (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo_Golf", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Golo Golf", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Survivalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Survivalism", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Legal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Legal", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/55a404f4bd74411db614e2e3266ef9f9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Terence Crawford was the first to do so.\n\nWhen the 31-year-old entered the Tokyo Dome with all four world championship belts at stake, fans welcomed him with rapturous applause.\n\nNery threw the champion to the ground, causing huge upsets.

However, Inoue came back to blast the 29-year-old Nery out, stopping him in the seventh round.\n\nThe contest was halted by referee Michael Griffin officially at 1:22 of round six.\n\nNaoya Inoue Knocked Down for the First Time in His Career\n\nThe fight got off to a surprise start, with Luis Nery catching Naoya Inoue with a picture-perfect left to the head, sending him tumbling to the canvas for the first time in his career. We'd seen Inoue hurt before in the past, but nothing like this. He was in trouble for a moment there.\n\nThe pro-Nery fans at ringside, the few of them, were ecstatic sat that moment, smelling upset and celebrating a little bit too early. Inoue got up and looked in bad shape, ready to be finished off by the powerful Mexican southpaw, who showed that he could give as good as he could take.\n\nInoue Returns the Favor in Round Two\n\nInoue collected himself well after getting up; his power was still there even if his legs and senses were not quite 100% after that asteroid strike that he'd taken from the hard-hitting Nery moments into the 1st round.\n\nIn round two, 'Monster' Inoue evened the score, poleaxing Nery with a heavy shots, putting himself back into the fight with that knockdown. Suddenly, Nery no longer looked so confident, perhaps knowing that he'd let his prey off the hook and blown his chance.\n\nInoue Continues the Assault in Round Five\n\nNery was starting to take a lot of hard shots by the fifth, getting pummeled with lead right hands straight down the pipe. One of them, a short left hook, put Nery down on the seat of his pants for the second time in the fight. Inoue hit Nery with two consecutive short left hooks to drop him.\n\nInoue tried to finish the job, but he was missing shots and the ones that did land, they lacked the same power that had put Nery down.\n\nThat knockdown showed that Inoue was too much for the battered and beaten Nery, who had nothing left by that point in the fight. It was like watching a replay of Nery's previous defeat three years earlier. He's dangerous early, but vulnerable after the first few rounds.\n\nInoue Seals the Victory, But Future at Featherweight is Uncertain\n\n'Monster' Inoue finished the job in the sixth with a meteor shower of shots that put Nery down on the canvas. Nery had been trapped against the ropes and unable to get away during that final barrage of blows.

It gave me a lot of energy.\"\n\nIt was the first boxing event to be held at the Tokyo Dome since 42-1 underdog James \"Buster\" Douglas knocked out unbeaten heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in February 1990 in one of the sport's biggest upsets.\n\n\"There was a lot of pressure on me as the main event in the first boxing at Tokyo Dome in 34 years, but it gave me strength,\" said Inoue.\n\nInoue took his record to 27-0 with 24 wins by knockout.\n\nIt was his first fight since becoming the undisputed super-bantamweight world champion in December.\n\nHe is just the second man to become undisputed world champion at two different weights since the four-belt era began in 2004. American Terence Crawford was the first.\n\nFans at the Tokyo Dome gave the 31-year-old a rapturous welcome as he entered the cavernous venue with all four world championship belts up for grabs.\n\nA huge upset looked like it could be on the cards when Nery sent the champion sprawling with a massive left hand.\n\nBut it seemed to energise Inoue and he came flying out of his corner to send Nery down in the second round.\n\nInoue continued to land ferocious blows and he sent his opponent to the canvas again with a left hook in the fifth round.\n\nThe referee stopped the fight after Inoue downed Nery for a third time in the sixth round.\n\nNery, a former two-division world champion, was fighting in Japan for the first time since he was stripped of his bantamweight world title in 2018 after failing to make weight for a bout there.\n\nHe was subsequently banned from fighting in Japan but the country's boxing commission gave him the green light to compete against Inoue.\n\nNery was booed when he was introduced to the Tokyo Dome crowd.\n\nThe 29-year-old's record fell to 35-2, with 27 KOs.\n\nInoue was fighting at super-bantamweight for only the third time, after beating American Stephen Fulton and Marlon Tapales of the Philippines last year for a clean sweep of the titles.\n\nHe moved up in weight class after becoming the first undisputed bantamweight world champion since Panama's Enrique Pinder in 1972. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "malaymail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Malay Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome",

A picture perfect left hook by challenger Luis Nery put undisputed super bantamweight champion Inoue down in the first round. Suffice to say, it was the first time the 26-0 Inoue had ever been sent off his feet. Although he rose to beat the count, Inoue had to fend the 35-1 Nery off as the challenger went in for the kill. Nery managed to survive the round, but a point had been made loud and clear - Inoue, when facing the right opponent, could indeed be vulnerable.\n\nNot that Inoue didn't rise to the occasion after having tasted the canvas. For, though Nery had a brilliant first, the fight belonged to Inoue from the second round on. Nery himself tasted the mat in the second, then Inoue dropped the gutsy former titlist again in the fifth. And then came the sixth. Nery was already looking thoroughly beaten up while Inoue had taken to taunting his man. Ultimately, it was a Dempseyesque combination from Inoue that sent Nery to the mat for good. His head swinging under the ropes like it was only connected to his torso by a string, the gutsy Nery was the picture of defeat.\n\nAt 31 years of age, Inoue's career is now worth looking at as a whole, for he's unquestionably one of the greats of this generation of fighters. Many, if not most, analysts feel that either Inoue or Terence Crawford is the greatest active fighter in the world today. While this writer gives a slight edge to Crawford, there's no denying that Inoue is right up there with the magnificent Nebraskan. For starters, all but three of Inoue's now 27 wins have come within the distance.\n\nIf that's not enough, the fighter known (understandably) as \"The Monster\" has won world titles in four separate weight divisions - and has been the undisputed champion in two of those four divisions. Only Crawford can claim to have accomplished such a feat. Inoue is more than just impressive on paper, however. To watch the man in action is like watching a human cannon decimate his targets. His punches are as powerful as the are accurate. We live in hyperbolic times, but it at this point, it's not ridiculous to ask where Inoue might stand among the sport's legends.", "source": {"uri": "boxinginsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BoxingInsider.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Weight class (boxing)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.boxinginsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Inoue-nery.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Some say his power has decreased with all the weight changes despite the seven-straight wins via the power punch. It did take ten rounds to put down Marlon Tapales in his last fight, but it is not a cause for concern for Inoue.\n\n\"I am still confident that if I hit someone cleanly, I can knock anyone out, at any time. It's just that the pieces didn't fit together against Tapales,\" Inoue told The Ring. \"Even the two knockdowns weren't as crisp as I wanted, rather, it was a steady attack that caused him to fall down in disgust.\"\n\nWATCH: Naoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery, exclusively on ESPN+\n\nNery has 27 wins via knockout.

American Terence Crawford was the first.\n\nFans at the Tokyo Dome gave the 31-year-old a rapturous welcome as he entered the cavernous venue with all four world championship belts up for grabs.\n\nA huge upset looked like it could be on the cards when Nery sent the champion sprawling with a massive left hand.\n\nBut it seemed to energise Inoue and he came flying out of his corner to send Nery down in the second round.\n\nInoue continued to land ferocious blows and he sent his opponent to the canvas again with a left hook in the fifth round.\n\nThe referee stopped the fight after Inoue downed Nery for a third time in the sixth round.\n\nNery, a former two-division world champion, was fighting in Japan for the first time since he was stripped of his bantamweight world title in 2018 after failing to make weight for a bout there.\n\nHe was subsequently banned from fighting in Japan but the country's boxing commission gave him the green light to compete against Inoue.\n\nNery was booed when he was introduced to the Tokyo Dome crowd.\n\nThe 29-year-old's record fell to 35-2, with 27 KOs.\n\nInoue was fighting at super-bantamweight for only the third time, after beating American Stephen Fulton and Marlon Tapales of the Philippines last year for a clean sweep of the titles.\n\nHe moved up in weight class after becoming the first undisputed bantamweight world champion since Panama's Enrique Pinder in 1972.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)",

Quiet, and yet so very loud. He's a little bit fast, a little bit frightening, a little bit mysterious, a little bit good. He fights on Boxing Day and random week days. His supremacy is missed by some, and yet championed as greatness by others.\n\nNaoya Inoue might be the most dangerous man on the planet. His dominance might also slip through the mainstream net far too often, far too easily.\n\nRarely does he or his excellence venture outside of his Japanese fortress - only four times, in fact. There he is a God, to challenge whom hopeful warriors travel long and far, only to be mercilessly slain by boxing's real life Monster.\n\nMike Tyson referred to him as the best boxer in the world, and suggested in 2021 that he was even more gifted than the great Manny Pacquiao. Inoue is now gearing up to stage the first boxing event at the 55,000-capacity Tokyo Dome since Tyson's famous defeat to James 'Buster' Douglas in 1990 as he defends his undisputed super-bantamweight championship against Luis Nery, live on Sky Sports from 9am on Monday.\n\nLimited sightings beyond the borders of his home country and obvious language barriers no doubt contribute to a profile denied the same spotlit clamour as his pound-for-pound counterparts, but that does not deter from the wonder, the marvel. The quiet demeanour and baby-faced appearance is a veil for venom, and the sleight frame a disguise for destructive knockout power, the kind of which no man can live with.\n\nHe poses a conundrum like few others. Trade with him at your peril; run from him, to where?\n\nIn Nery comes a willing combatant with a fearless belligerence that will empower him to go toe-to-toe with Inoue. He is a capable contender, but will arrive in Tokyo to be greeted by a different kind of talent. Nobody has threatened Inoue; nobody has come close to threatening Inoue, no matter how qualified. Nery, for all his attributes, is merely the next in line.\n\nThe Mexican is no stranger to Japanese fans, having tested positive for a banned substance - later put down to contaminated food - after beating Shinsuke Yamanaka via fourth-round stoppage in 2017, before missing weight as he triumphed again during the rematch a year later. Tokyo worships Inoue; the support might be amplified to new decibels when a not-so-popular Nery pulls up in town.\n\n\"The day it was announced all 55,000 seats were sold,\" Top Rank CEO Bob Arum told Sky Sports. \"Everybody in Japan is really invested in the match, they don't like Nery, the poor guy is coming into a very hostile environment - but at least he's getting paid good money!\n\n\"Inoue is one of my favourite fighters. No 1, he's such a lovely young man, really nice with a great personality, and I can tell that even though I can't speak Japanese and he can't speak English.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like it, the way he fights. A little guy like Inoue, with massive knockout power, he's really something to see.\"\n\nInoue is currently ranked No 2 behind only Terence Crawford on BoxRec's pound-for-pound list. He may have a case for a spot at the top.\n\nThe 31-year-old is just the second man in history behind Crawford to become an undisputed champion in two weight classes in the four-belt era, earning his place as ruler of the super-bantamweight division with a 10th-round knockout win over Marlon Tapales in December. In doing so, he has now held world championships in four weight classes since working his way up from light flyweight.\n\nInoue set the tone for his career upon turning professional with Ohashi Gym in 2012 when he signed an agreement with Hideyuki Ohashi to never face easy opponents, as much evidenced six fights into his career when he knocked out two-division champion Adrian Hernandez in the sixth round to become WBC light flyweight champion.\n\nTwo fights later he knocked out Omar Narv\u00e1ez in December 2014 to capture his second world title in the WBO junior bantamweight belt, before reeling off seven straight defences over the next two years.\n\nIn May 2018 he stopped Jamie McDonnell in the first round to win the WBA (Regular) bantamweight title, and would then overcome Nonito Donaire via unanimous decision to win the WBA (Super) bantamweight title and World Boxing Super Series bantamweight final in November 2019.\n\nJason Maloney was next to endure the ruthless Inoue experience in 2020, suffering a brutal seventh-round knockout defeat, simply no match for the blistering speed, volume and clinical accuracy of his opponent. Donaire then sought revenge in a rematch, only for the former world champion to be blown away in the second as the latter added the WBC bantamweight title to his collection.\n\nStephen Fulton had been touted as Inoue's most daunting obstacle yet last July, before being bullishly bypassed in the eighth round as The Monster captured the WBC and WBO super bantamweight titles. A brave and tough Tapales lasted two rounds longer, but eventually succumbed to the unwavering ferocity that had bombarded him since the first bell.\n\nFulton and Tapales were/are among the most accomplished operators in their weight classes. Between them they barely troubled Inoue. He is different, and the world knows it. Or does it?\n\nHe moves in fast forward, with the back-to-front foot transitions and set-up feints that are impossible to read such is the speed, guile and disguise with which he attacks. His distancing is consistently flawless, and even when it does stray he is too sharp for opponents to exploit the mere inkling of an opening.\n\nThe combinations are slick, electric and packing finisher's power in equal measure; the front-foot explosion is coupled with precise and expertly-timed counters; the pretty melees, the teasing drop of his fists and toying right hand fakes are matched with a relished nastiness and grittiness when the fight moves on the inside. It isn't like he hasn't been caught, either; it's just that he eats everything with remarkable ease, while landing a decisive blow in return for his troubles.\n\nInoue has become a spectacle of inevitability, with one of boxing's most accomplished armouries that seems to only grow in strength and danger as a fight and his career goes on.\n\nThe 5'5\" Japanese giant has grown to be one of the sport's most enthralling case studies, rewarding his home support with regular opportunities to witness greatness while leaving the rest of the world lying in wait for him to grace their stage on a more frequent basis. But this is his world. He'll tour the globe on his terms.\n\nNery will try. Many have tried. In the end, Inoue governs his own class, his own calibre.\n\nStream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

Japan to US time difference for 2024 boxing fight", "body": "Naoya Inoue is ready for a unique challenge when he defends his status as the undisputed super bantamweight champion against Luis Nery on May 6.\n\nInoue is a four-division champion. He is in a rare group of fighters that are undisputed in two divisions. After beating Paul Butler to become king of the bantamweights, he moved up and beat Stephen Fulton for the WBC and WBO super bantamweight titles. The Japanese star ran through Marlon Tapales to claim the WBA, IBF, and Ring belts.\n\nNery is a former WBC and Ring bantamweight champion but got stripped of the belts after testing positive for the banned substance zilpaterol and missing weight in separate contests. Initially banned from Japan, Nery is ready to win gold in the country where he has caused much chaos. The Mexican fighter has won four straight contests since 2022.\n\n\"Pantera\" has 27 wins via knockout, and his ring IQ is unique. He sees someone's offense as an ability to counter-attack, and his lanky frame comes with heavy hands. Inoue is preparing for the best version of Nery and believes he can adjust to counter anything Nery throws at him.\n\nWATCH: Naoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery, exclusively on ESPN+\n\n\"It's difficult to find a sparring partner like that, so image training and repeated practice will be important,\" Inoue told The Ring. \"And I will react and adjust in the ring during the fight. As for his body [and his ability to take a good body shot], if a punch lands at the right time, anyone can go down, it can become a weakness for anyone, not just Nery.\"\n\nInoue and Nery fight in Japan, inside the famous Tokyo Dome. What is the time difference between Japan and other countries? The Sporting News will provide all you need to know about the fight, including time, channel, and card.\n\nThe main card starts at 5 p.m. local time (4 a.m. ET). The main event should start around 8 p.m. local time (7 a.m. ET), depending on how long the undercard fights last.\n\nJapan Standard Time is 13 hours ahead of US Eastern Time.\n\nMORE: Does Inoue need to fight on US soil?\n\nThe Naoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery main card will air on ESPN+ in the U.S. The undercard will air exclusively on ESPN+.\n\nIf Inoue vs. Nery is not available to watch live in your location or if you're traveling abroad, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

Naoya Inoue Says No - He's the World's Best Boxer", "body": "There's plenty of marvel and mystique around the man known as \"The Monster.\"\n\nNaoya Inoue has been living up to his moniker in glorious fashion throughout his 12-year career, pulverizing every pugilist who has been placed in his path.\n\nThe four-division champion has won undisputed honors at 118 pounds and is currently the junior featherweight king and reigning Fighter of the Year.\n\nBut throughout the build-up of the Japanese sensation's fight against Luis Nery at the Tokyo Dome on Monday, sentiment has been shared by some boxing observers that Inoue next needs to take his act to the United States and not just remain \"big in Japan.\"\n\nInoue has fought just three times in the U.S., and even though he's tied to a co-promotional pact with Top Rank, infrequently gracing the states has cut into opportunities to further grow his prolific profile.\n\nBut why would (or should) the idolized Inoue take his \"globally trending\" show on the road to try and replicate what Filipino icon Manny Pacquiao did before him?\n\nOver 55,000 fans will flock to the Tokyo Dome, the fabled baseball stadium, for the first boxing fight in the arena since 1990 when Buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson. A $20 million gate is expected for Inoue (26-0, 23 KOs) and Nery (35-1, 27 KOs), and both fighters will be breaking the bank handsomely.\n\nAs Inoue's promoter Bob Arum recently stated so eloquently, Inoue opponents have their tongues wagging out for an invitation because the purses are so prolific.\n\nRing walks are estimated at 7:35 a.m. ET on ESPN+, which means most boxing fans in the U.S. will have to make unique arrangements not to sleep on a modern great.\n\n\"Of course, if I fight in the United States, I would get more recognition and I could become one of the faces in boxing,\" Inoue told BoxingScene through a translator during a video conference call.\n\n\"As I continue fighting, we'll see how it goes. ... It depends on the condition. Right now, for the lower weight classes, Japan is a big stage for us. If there was a condition in the United States that allowed me to be evaluated better, that would be a consideration.\"\n\nAlthough the former two-division champion Nery is a +800 betting underdog against the -1400 favorite Inoue, the southpaw slugger is still expected to give Inoue a tough fight and not just another tongue-lashing.\n\nNery ignited a fire during the fight's buildup, telling BoxingScene he considered Inoue to be \"overrated, overconfident, and ordinary.\"\n\n\"I saw that interview,\" said Inoue. \"My previous opponents have said the same thing. ... I give Nery the credit as a deserving opponent. I have no plans on losing. I am looking for a definite and decisive beatdown.\"\n\nInoue, 31, will be fighting for the first time this year, after knocking out unified champions Stephen Fulton inside eight rounds and Marlon Tapales inside 10 rounds in 2023.\n\n\"There are quite a few wins I would consider the best of my career, but if I had to choose one, it would be Fulton,\" said Inoue.\n\nInoue is coming into the Nery fight on a seven-fight knockout streak that spans four years.\n\nThe performances have catapulted Inoue to the top of the pound-for-pound list, and many consider him or Terence Crawford to be the world's best fighter.\n\nWhen Inoue is asked if he believes he's the best boxer in the world, the generally stoic and mild-mannered Monster assesses the question from his translator, turns back to the camera as his face lights up and emphatically nods his head and says \"yes\" in English with a wide smile.\n\nThere is no arguing there, even if the global faces of boxing are the likes of Canelo Alvarez, Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua, Gervonta Davis, Ryan Garcia and Crawford.\n\nArum, 92, says Inoue is one of the greatest fighters he has ever seen.\n\nAs Inoue contemplates his opportunities fighting on U.S. soil - just imagine him fighting on another historic baseball field, at Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles, with Japanese star Shohei Ohtani and his legion of fans sitting ringside - he's also interested in a victory lap.\n\nInoue was awarded 2023 Fighter of the Year honors by BoxingScene and the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA). Inoue plans on returning to the U.S. for the BWAA dinner in New York on June 6 to accept his award in person.\n\nA potential stateside trip would serve Inoue well.\n\nTop Rank also has a show at the nearby Madison Square Garden Theater on June 8, and the International Boxing Hall of Fame weekend of events takes place June 6-9 in Canastota, New York.\n\nInoue should certainly be a first-ballot Hall of Famer one day himself, whenever he retires.\n\nBefore getting too far ahead, though - Inoue isn't even considering a move up to 126 pounds for now - he must first defend his titles in a tilt on home turf against Nery.\n\n\"This is a big fight and a big promotion,\" said Inoue. \"It's been a long road for me to get to a big stage like this, and I am going to make the best of it.\"",

American Terence Crawford was the first.\n\nFans at the Tokyo Dome gave the 31-year-old a rapturous welcome as he entered the cavernous venue with all four world championship belts up for grabs.\n\nA huge upset looked like it could be on the cards when Nery sent the champion sprawling with a massive left hand.\n\nBut it seemed to energize Inoue and he came flying out of his corner to send Nery down in the second round.\n\nInoue continued to land ferocious blows and he sent his opponent to the canvas again with a left hook in the fifth round.\n\nThe referee stopped the fight after Inoue downed Nery for a third time in the sixth round.\n\nNery, a former two-division world champion, was fighting in Japan for the first time since he was stripped of his bantamweight world title in 2018 after failing to make weight for a bout there.\n\nHe was subsequently banned from fighting in Japan but the country's boxing commission gave him the green light to compete against Inoue.\n\nNery was booed when he was introduced to the Tokyo Dome crowd.\n\nThe 29-year-old's record fell to 35-2, with 27 KOs.\n\nInoue was fighting at super bantamweight for only the third time, after beating American Stephen Fulton and Marlon Tapales of the Philippines last year for a clean sweep of the titles.\n\nHe moved up in weight class after becoming the first undisputed bantamweight world champion since Panama's Enrique Pinder in 1972.", "source": {"uri": "sports.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@sports.inquirer.net", "name": "Agence

He can be hurt. The problem is, as Luis Nery found out firsthand on Monday, a wounded Inoue might be the most dangerous \"Monster\" of all.\n\nIt was a startling sight: Inoue spinning around on his way down to the canvas, arms flailing and senses scattered, in the very first round of this title defence. This event, the first boxing card at the 55,000-capacity Tokyo Dome in 34 years, was due to be a celebration of Inoue - the undisputed super-bantamweight champion, arguably the pound-for-pound No 1, and inarguably a hero in Japan.\n\nBut 34 years on from Buster Douglas's historic upset of Mike Tyson at the Dome, it looked like another upset was on the cards when Nery floored Inoue with a spiteful left hook in round one. It looked like Nery was moments from a desecration of this celebration.\n\nUnlike Douglas, Nery had the pedigree of a former two-weight world champion, meaning a finishing sequence was a very real prospect after that knockdown. Instead, Inoue - who had looked utterly bewildered while lying on the canvas - pulled off the most daring of escapes.\n\nBy round two, the 31-year-old had already paid back Nery, dropping the 29-year-old Mexican with a left hook of his own. Nery was quickly back on his feet, but not before Inoue had found a moment to celebrate and fire himself up.\n\nBy round four, Inoue had the audacity to mock Nery after landing clean shots, taunting the challenger and calling on him to throw some of his own. Inoue was even dancing in front of a man who had looked so dangerous just minutes earlier. And by round five, Nery looked a fraction of himself as he was floored for a second time, again punished by a left hook.\n\nOne round later, it was done, as Inoue backed up \"Pantera\" and pistoned a short right cross onto the Mexican's jaw, sending him lolloping sickeningly into and half-through the ropes.\n\nNery's eyes glazed over, as Inoue's glistened. Against any odds you might have found with bookmakers after round one, Inoue was not just the victor but an emphatic one.\n\n\"A big surprise happened in the first round!\" he said after his victory, which improved his record to 27-0 with 24 knockouts. \"Actually, that happening gave me good motivation and attention.\n\n\"I don't remember anything that my dad [Inoue's coach] told me during the intermission, but that gave me motivation and focus until the end of the fight.\"\n\nInoue, just the second man ever to hold undisputed gold in two divisions, looked at risk of losing his titles, his aura, and his unbeaten record. Instead, he produced the kind of comeback that only enhances an aura.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshi_Inoue_(entomologist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshi Inoue (entomologist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantera", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pantera"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_us_sports_articles_270/66df534f2555facc1473738210aa2712", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

We had seen the commercial.\n\nJapan's leading man, the boyish wrecking machine that is Naoya Inoue was fighting for the honor of his country against the villain of the piece, Luis Nery.\n\nThe Mexican had been banned from fighting in Japan. Firstly, when he boxed Shinsuke Yakamana, Nery popped for PEDs. When they rematched several months later, Nery showed up overweight and squashed Yamanaka in quick time.\n\nAs Japanese boxing historian Joe Koizumi said this week, \"In this country, coming in overweight is a crime.\"\n\nBut earlier this year, Japan Boxing Commission rescinded the penalty so Nery could face justice in the form of Inoue's flashing fists. Koizumi called it \"punishment.\"\n\nAnd that's what tens of thousands of shrieking fans turned up to witness.\n\nNery had revelled in his role as the bad guy. He knew why he was here and what was expected of him, which is probably why he doubled down.\n\nLast night, as he entered his fourth hour hoping fluid would appear so he could provide VADA with a sample, Nery told me that the Dome was only going to be so full because of him; because of the narrative.\n\nThen, he proceeded to accept his role in it. \"I'm the bad guy,\" he sneered.\n\nWith a body, face, and part of his neck smeared in tattoos, watching the world from behind thick black glasses, a black beard and often dressed in chic shirts - think Scarface - the costume designer for the production was certainly on point. Nery looked the part.\n\nEven his manager, Sean Gibbons, admitted this week that Nery would likely be a victim in any type of random stop and search program.\n\n\"There has to be a good guy and a bad guy in the story, right?\" Gibbons smiled.\n\nAnd that ethos, that defiance, was obvious when Nery walked to the ring. He wasn't booed, Japan was too polite for that, but Nery smirked knowing what they were thinking, waving his Mexican flag over his shoulder as he swaggered between the ropes and awaited Inoue.\n\nThen, a sea of smartphones was raised as one, thousands upon thousands of them, recording Inoue's lavish and explosive entrance amidst a live electric guitar performance and enough fireworks to sink a battleship. Flames were fired into the air the bangs were so loud there were times when you could not even hear the audience, who were beckoning their hero to act out the story they were desperate to tell.\n\nFinally, there were boos when Nery flexed during his introduction by Hall of Famer Jimmy Lennon Jr. The Japanese fans didn't like that show of insubordination or perceived arrogance.\n\nAnd while the bad guys have their moments in the movies, they never get to win. That is not why they have been cast in the role. Their comeuppance is just around the corner.\n\nInoue did as his fans hoped and, 20 seconds after the opening bell, launched a right-hand missile that had the hopes of a nation on it, but it missed by a mile. No matter, Inoue went swinging for it again. Two times. Three times. And then, as both attempted wild strikes, Nery missed a left hook by a huge margin.\n\nThen, suddenly, as the fighters came in close and \"Monster\" Inoue attacked, the unified super bantamweight champion left himself wide open and Nery saw a gap.\n\nThe Mexican southpaw reached around the corner with a left hook and the impossible was on.\n\nInoue spiralled to the canvas and landed in a disorganized heap. Japan held its breath.\n\nInoue looked clear in his eyes and had enough about him to listen to the count of referee Michael Griffin while perched on one knee.\n\nThe edges of 40,000 seats were filled. This was a plot twist of epic proportions.\n\nMore than that, time seemed to stand still. Inoue had seemingly, in slow motion, been sent spinning into the canvas like a corkscrew.\n\nGhosts of 1990s swirled in the air, haunting a packed and scared witless Tokyo Dome. They all knew that 34 years ago the unheralded James \"Buster\" Douglas shocked the world, defeating the heavyweight monster Mike Tyson in this same venue. History was repeating itself.\n\nOne could hear Jim Lampley's understated call, \"Buster Douglas has just beaten Mike Tyson.\"\n\nImages of that dastardly Nery escaping, hightailing it to the airport, flanked by Gibbons carrying the cases of the WBC, IBF, WBA and WBO belts flashed through one's mind.\n\nMaybe they flashed through Nery's, too, because he flew in to finish the job.\n\nInoue was shaken and hurt. It was Nery's moment. The bad guy wins? That wasn't in the script.\n\nBut gradually the fog that had descended through Inoue's neurological system began to clear and Nery shipped a right cross and right uppercut such was his enthusiasm to provide his own ending.\n\nThrough the second round, the crowd implored Inoue to get a foothold into the fight so firmly that they cheered even when his punches landed only on the arms and the gloves but then, just like that, and every bit as suddenly as Inoue had been dispatched in round one, Nery was down.\n\nEuphoria rattled the Dome. Inoue had delivered a counter left hand with his back to the ropes that folded Nery's legs beneath him. The shot was all class, with a drop of power for good measure, and Inoue was right back in it.\n\nBy the third, even the politest Japanese nationals were invested. They booed when Inoue claimed he'd been hit on the head. They jeered sarcastically when Inoue made Nery swing and miss with both hands, skilfully weaving in the opposite direction both times.\n\nThe action was technical and tactical, punctuated by moments of crisp punches, and as time ticked by, you could see Inoue looking more comfortable, like he was starting to figure out what was in front of him.\n\nA right hand that jarred Nery's head back - he was caught leaning away - brought a predictably thunderous ovation. It wasn't a massive shot but the crowd were desperate and wanted Nery out of there, and sooner rather than later.\n\nIn the fourth, Inoue started doing Inoue things. He appeared to be the complete fighter so many of his peers say he is and he even took a moment to put his glove to his jaw and implore Nery to take advantage. When the Mexican declined, well, the fans adored that.\n\nInoue boxed smoothly to evade trouble and then crashed home the occasional pot-shot. He also started to work Nery's body, rattling his left hand into the Mexican's side.\n\nMore worryingly for the challenger, who remained dogged in his pursuit, Inoue was finding a range with his right hand. Nery tried bulling forwards through the oncoming leather, picked up a warning for leading with his head (more boos) and then, as he proceeded to take Inoue into the trenches and marched him to the ropes, the Japanese star whistled over a left hook that sat Nery down once more.\n\nIt was artful. Inoue had almost no room to work but he was able to thread through a glorious shot, laced with beautiful malice. It had been crafted through a space of scarcely four inches and its impact was as dramatic as anything that had come before.\n\nBy the time the sixth started, we were at the point in the movie when the hero has the baddy where he wants him. Nery was not pleading for mercy, but he was absorbing hurtful rights and looking increasingly forlorn. That first round moment felt like an awfully long time ago, by now.\n\nAnd then, with his back to the ropes again, weary Nery was on the (wrong) end of what will be one of this year's most spectacular right hands. Inoue fizzed home an electric right uppercut and followed it with a straight right that nearly decapitated Nery.\n\nThe lead part of a movie is reserved for the good-looking hero, in this case a champion who looks like a J-pop star and who is adored by the fans. Brooding menace in the films only goes so far until, ultimately, the villain is impaled on a spike, met by a hail of bullets or tossed off a building the height of the impressive Tokyo Dome - into the abyss below.\n\nHere, in his final act, the Mexican brutally dropped for a third time and if it wasn't shocking enough to see his head violently rock back, it vividly ricocheted off the top rope and with the rest of his body in a collapsed state, Nery came to rest - just about out of it - with his top half draped over the bottom strand.\n\nEcstasy doesn't describe what was felt at that moment. It was almost as if Nery didn't deserve to a have such a bad ending, but that was my view on matters, and they were not echoed by many.\n\nThat ending, after 1:22 of the sixth, was the movie. It was both cinematic and it was poetic.\n\nAs the end credits started to roll, Nery remained in pile on the canvas and was then escorted to his stool to be reunited with his senses. Inoue leapt on the middle ropes and the crowd roared emphatically, and a nation collectively breathed millions of sighs of relief.\n\nNery, now 35-2 (27 KOs), had paid for his past indiscretions, the crowd was delighted and perhaps even admired his courage. The fighters eventually shook hands and 29-year-old Nery left to make his way to his dressing room. History was not on repeat, but Japanese fans did reach out to high five him as he left.\n\nJust like his brother Takuma had earlier in the night, Inoue climbed off the floor to retain his crown. If it was a movie, you couldn't make it up, but you certainly could make a highlight reel from the knockdowns alone.\n\nInoue spoke post-fight and had his fans in hysterics, it was like watching a live sitcom. He'd gone from being the Monster to the man of the people.\n\n\"I don't remember anything my dad [trainer, Shingo] told me in the intermission [between rounds one and two],\" chuckled Inoue. \"But that happening gave me motivation. I was so focused until the end of the fight.\"\n\nAsked how he was able to turn things around, from that near-disastrous first round, Inoue simply replied: \"I'd like to tell you, but I don't remember anything in the fight.\"\n\nAfterwards, top Australian contender Sam Goodman made his way into the ring and challenged Inoue, saying, \"Either give up the belts or fight me. Let's get it on.\"\n\nGoodman might be next, but Irishman TJ Doheny staked his claim on the undercard and he is known here as the Japanese Assassin for his previous successful visits.\n\nBy the way, there is a good chance that, having accepted his bad guy role and played it perfectly - including that moment of jeopardy - Tijuana's Nery is not all bad. On several occasions this week in the hotel, he spent time smiling for selfies and signing for fans in the lobby. It was like seeing a character at Disney World with their costume hat removed having a few minutes to be themselves.\n\n\"I personally respect Nery, that's why I shook his hand after the fight,\" said Inoue.\n\nYamanaka was in attendance, and I'd pay a penny for his thoughts.\n\nThe champion, who is now a gleaming 27-0 (24 KOs) is 31 years old and promised his fans more exciting fights.\n\nSo there will be another Inoue sequel for this all-action hero who is made for the big screen.\n\nSequels are often unwanted in the cinema, but in a sport that has been suffering lately from obnoxious behavior, drug scandals and a never-ending slew of unwanted drama, both Inoue's fans and fans of the sport should be grateful for that.", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType": "news",

American Terence Crawford was the first.\n\nNery, a former two-division world champion, was fighting in Japan for the first time since he was stripped of his bantamweight world title in 2018 after failing to make weight for a bout there.\n\nHe was subsequently banned from fighting in Japan but the country's boxing commission gave him the green light to compete against Inoue.\n\nNery was booed when he was introduced to the Tokyo Dome crowd.\n\nThe 29-year-old's record fell to 35-2, with 27 KOs.\n\n'A real struggle'\n\nJapan's Yoshiki Takei beat Australian defending champion Jason Moloney by unanimous decision to win the WBO bantamweight world title on the undercard.\n\nTakei, a former kickboxer who had won all eight of his previous boxing matches by knockout, started strongly before Moloney came back into the bout in his second title defence.\n\nThe 27-year-old Takei said the final round was \"a real struggle\".\n\n\"I wanted to win by knock-out but Moloney was really tough,\" he said.\n\nInoue's younger brother Takuma defended his WBA bantamweight title with a unanimous decision win over fellow Japanese Sho Ishida.\n\nIshida floored Takuma Inoue in the first round with a left

Fans at the famous venue, which seats more than 45,000, were left stunned when Nery floored the unbeaten \"Monster\" in the first round with a huge left hand.\n\nBut Inoue got up and knocked his Mexican opponent down in the following round and sent him to the canvas again in the fifth before finishing him off with a right hook in the sixth. It was the first boxing event to be held at the Tokyo Dome since 42-1 underdog James \"Buster\" Douglas knocked out unbeaten heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in February 1990 in one of the sport's biggest upsets.\n\nInoue took his record to 27-0 with 24 wins by knockout. It was his first fight since becoming the undisputed super-bantamweight world champion in December. He is just the second man to become undisputed world champion at two different weights since the four-belt era began in 2004. American Terence Crawford was the first.\n\nFans at the Tokyo Dome gave the 31-year-old a rapturous welcome as he entered the cavernous venue with all four world championship belts up for grabs. A huge upset looked like it could be on the cards when Nery sent the champion sprawling with a massive left hand. But it seemed to energize Inoue and he came flying out of his corner to send Nery down in the second round.\n\nInoue continued to land ferocious blows and he sent his opponent to the canvas again with a left hook in the fifth round. The referee stopped the fight after Inoue downed Nery for a third time in the sixth round.\n\nNery, a former two-division world champion, was fighting in Japan for the first time since he was stripped of his bantamweight world title in 2018 after failing to make weight for a bout there. He was subsequently banned from fighting in Japan but the country's boxing commission gave him the green light to compete against Inoue.\n\nNery was booed when he was introduced to the Tokyo Dome crowd. The 29-year-old's record fell to 35-2, with 27 KOs. Inoue was fighting at super-bantamweight for only the third time, after beating American Stephen Fulton and Marlon Tapales of the Philippines last year for a clean sweep of the titles.\n\nHe moved up in weight class after becoming the first undisputed bantamweight world champion since Panama's Enrique Pinder in 1972.\n\nEarlier, Japan's Yoshiki Takei beat Australian defending champion Jason Moloney by unanimous decision on Monday to win the WBO bantamweight world title at the Tokyo Dome. Fighting on the undercard of undisputed super-bantamweight world champion Naoya \"Monster\" Inoue's title fight against Mexico's Luis Nery, Takei started strongly before Moloney came back into the bout in his second title defence.\n\nBut the Japanese fighter, a former kickboxer who had won all eight of his previous boxing matches by knockout, took the title in front of a raucous crowd at the 45,000-plus seater venue. \"The 12th round was a real struggle,\" said the 27-year-old Takei.\n\n\"I wanted to win by knock-out but Moloney was really tough. \"I knew he was strong before the fight and I trained really hard because of that - it's thanks to Moloney that I was able to toughen up,\" he added.\n\nMoloney, who won the vacant title in May last year, saw his record drop to 29-3, with 27 wins by KO. Earlier on the undercard, Inoue's younger brother Takuma Inoue defended his WBA bantamweight title with a unanimous decision win over fellow Japanese Sho Ishida.\n\nIshida floored Inoue in the first round with a left jab but the champion recovered to dominate the fight. Japan's Seigo Yuri Akui defended his WBA flyweight title with a unanimous decision win over countryman Taku Kuwahara.\n\nBoxing was returning to the Tokyo Dome for the first time since 42-1 underdog

The event took place on May 6 at the Tokyo Dome, Japan in front of a packed-out crowd of 50,000.\n\nIn the main event, undisputed super bantamweight champ Naoya Inoue put his undisputed status on the line against mandatory challenger Luis Nery. 'The Monster' was heading into the fight off the back of a KO win over Marlon Tapales in December while 'Pantera' had put away Froilan Saludar last summer.\n\nNery was hoping to cause the upset and nearly did just that as he landed a huge left hook that dropped Inoue to the canvas in the opening round, the first time he has been knocked down in his career.\n\nThe Japanese boxing star immediately responded, however, and landed a knockdown of his own in the second round as he took control of the fight. The power differential then proved apparent as Nery was visibly fading every time Inoue landed a combination.\n\nNaoya Inoue continued his dominance and even began taunting his opponent in the fourth round before he once again dropped Nery in the fifth with a crushing left hook. The referee then waved the fight off in the sixth round as Inoue put Nery up against the ropes and landed an uppercut and right-hand combination to finish the fight.\n\nWatch the Naoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery finish here:\n\nIn the co-main event, WBO bantamweight champion Jason Moloney attempted to defend his title against Yoshiki Takei.\n\nTakei's gameplan was evident from the off as he hid behind his jab and managed to evade most shots thrown by Moloney. Takei was also warned after landing multiple low blows, however, and was eventually deducted a point in the second round.\n\nThe Japanese boxer continued to control the fight for the first five rounds and largely nullified any attempted offense by his opponent. Moloney did eventually rally in the sixth and had his best round so far as Takei visibly started to tire.\n\nAfter some resurgence from Moloney, the pair then entered the final round and the Australian needed a finish as he tried to claw back a victory. Ultimately, it wasn't enough, and Yoshiki Takei was given the nod 117-110, 116-111, 116-111 on the scorecards, winning the WBO bantamweight title.\n\nNaoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery results: Takuma Inoue and Seigo Yuri Akui successfully defend their titles\n\nTakuma Inoue, the younger brother of Naoya Inoue, put his WBA bantamweight title on the line for a second time when he faced mandatory challenger Sho Ishida at the Tokyo Dome.\n\nIn what proved to be shades of the main event, Inoue was also knocked down in the first round like his brother after Ishida launched a sharp counter jab to drop him to the canvas.\n\nInoue immediately bounced back in the second and took control of the fight in its entirety. His combination of punches and the power behind them meant Ishida was unable to build on any momentum from the first and needed a knockdown in the final round to stand any chance of victory.\n\nThe challenger was unable to find it and Inoue retained his title 118-109, 118-109, 116-111 on the scorecards.\n\nIn the opening bout of the main card, Seigo Yuri Akui successfully defended his WBA flyweight title for the first time against Taku Kuwahara.\n\nThe bout was a rematch of their 2021 clash, which saw Yurki Akui win the first outing via a 10th-round TKO. While he was unable to find a finish this time round, the 28-year-old dominated the bout with his pressure-heavy style and he took the fight via unanimous decision (118-110, 117-111, 117-111).\n\nCatch the full main card results here:\n\nSuper bantamweight - Naoya Inoue def.

champion Naoya Inoue recovered from the first knockdown of his professional career to stop Luis Nery in devastating fashion.\n\nThe 31-year-old Japanese, who has held world titles at four different weights and two undisputed, went down in the first round, but picked himself up to secure a sixth-round victory after putting his Mexican opponent down for the third time with a brutal right hand.\n\nNery stunned both the champion and a 55,000 sell-out crowd at the Tokyo Dome in Japan, where Buster Douglas shocked Mike Tyson in 1990, when barely two minutes into the fight he floored Inoue with a swinging left hook.\n\nHowever, Nery had to pick himself up from the canvas in the second after the Japanese fighter caught him with a short left.\n\nInoue scored heavily with the straight right in an impressive third-round display and began to showboat in the fourth as a frustrated Nery repeatedly missed the target with his big punches and was peppered with his opponent's jab and body shots.\n\nNaoya Inoue climbed off the canvas to retain his undisputed super bantamweight crown against Luis Nery\n\nA short left hook from Neary dropped Inoue for the first time in his career in the opening round\n\nBut the 31-year-old recovered and controlled much of the contest from the front foot\n\nAn explosive right in the sixth round sent Nery crashing into the ropes and marked Inoue's 24th KO win\n\nThe four-weight world champion has now won his last eight fights inside the distance\n\nThe 29-year-old's work became increasingly untidy as he tired and after being warned for leading with his head, he was felled by another left hook in round five, and the end arrived midway through the sixth.\n\nInoue, nicknamed 'The Monster', had opened up Nery with a lethal combination and having forced him on to the ropes, dispatched him with a vicious right hand to end the contest and complete a successful second defence of the titles he won in December.\n\nIt was the 27th win of his unbeaten career and 24th knockout, and just a second defeat for Nery in 37 bouts.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nSo, Naoya Inoue is vulnerable after all. He can be hurt. The problem is, as Luis Nery found out firsthand on Monday, a wounded Inoue might be the most dangerous \"Monster\" of all.\n\nIt was a startling sight: Inoue spinning around on his way down to the canvas, arms flailing and senses scattered, in the very first round of this title defence. This event, the first boxing card at the 55,000-capacity Tokyo Dome in 34 years, was due to be a celebration of Inoue - the undisputed super-bantamweight champion, arguably the pound-for-pound No 1, and inarguably a hero in Japan.\n\nBut 34 years on from Buster Douglas's historic upset of Mike Tyson at the Dome, it looked like another upset was on the cards when Nery floored Inoue with a spiteful left hook in round one. It looked like Nery was moments from a desecration of this celebration.\n\nUnlike Douglas, Nery had the pedigree of a former two-weight world champion, meaning a finishing sequence was a very real prospect after that knockdown. Instead, Inoue - who had looked utterly bewildered while lying on the canvas - pulled off the most daring of escapes.\n\nBy round two, the 31-year-old had already paid back Nery, dropping the 29-year-old Mexican with a left hook of his own. Nery was quickly back on his feet, but not before Inoue had found a moment to celebrate and fire himself up.\n\nBy round four, Inoue had the audacity to mock Nery after landing clean shots, taunting the challenger and calling on him to throw some of his own. Inoue was even dancing in front of a man who had looked so dangerous just minutes earlier. And by round five, Nery looked a fraction of himself as he was floored for a second time, again punished by a left hook.\n\nOne round later, it was done, as Inoue backed up \"Pantera\" and pistoned a short right cross onto the Mexican's jaw, sending him lolloping sickeningly into and half-through the ropes.\n\nNery's eyes glazed over, as Inoue's glistened. Against any odds you might have found with bookmakers after round one, Inoue was not just the victor but an emphatic one.\n\n\"A big surprise happened in the first round!\" he said after his victory, which improved his record to 27-0 with 24 knockouts. \"Actually, that happening gave me good motivation and attention.\n\n\"I don't remember anything that my dad [Inoue's coach] told me during the intermission, but that gave me motivation and focus until the end of the fight.\"\n\nInoue, just the second man ever to hold undisputed gold in two divisions, looked at risk of losing his titles, his aura, and his unbeaten record. Instead, he produced the kind of comeback that only enhances an aura.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshi_Inoue_(entomologist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshi Inoue (entomologist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantera", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pantera"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/06/14/ef39ef808e9943ec973b1e2664195170.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. on the fight between Canelo Alvarez and Jaime Munguia: It was a robbery\n\nIn a thrilling display of boxing prowess, Japanese fighter Naoya Inoue knocked out Mexican challenger Luis Nery in the sixth round, securing his title in the super bantamweight division before nearly 60,000 fans at the Tokio Dome. This match marked a significant event as it brought championship boxing back to the Tokio Dome for the first time in 34 years.\n\nThe fight began with an unexpected turn when Nery, nicknamed 'Pantera', stunned Inoue, known as the 'Monster', by sending him to the canvas in the first round, shocking the massive crowd in attendance.\n\nHowever, Inoue quickly regained his composure. By the second round, the actions leveled as Inoue dodged Nery's aggressive assaults and measured a powerful left hook to reciprocate the earlier humiliation delivered by the Tijuana native.\n\n\"The fall gave me the motivation to continue; I am grateful to have this fight with Luis Nery,\" Inoue expressed during the post-fight interview, holding his four championship belts.\n\nFrom the third round onward, Inoue took command of the ring with renewed confidence. He turned the fight around by connecting with more precision. In the fourth round, he demonstrated his dominance, even taunting Nery by presenting his face as a target, provoking the Mexican fighter.\n\nNery fell into Inoue's strategic trap of engaging in close-range boxing, which played to the champion's advantage. Inoue capitalized on this by landing a devastating left hook that floored Nery once again.\n\nBy the sixth round, aware he was trailing on the scorecards, Nery aggressively attempted to overpower Inoue. However, the champion's superior skill and power were too much for Nery. Inoue decisively sent Nery to the canvas again, swiftly concluding the fight and igniting the jubilation of his fans.\n\nNaoya Inoue's victory not only reaffirmed his status as one of the top boxers in the world but also delighted his home crowd, who witnessed a historic fight reminiscent of the boxing glory days at the Tokio Dome.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Mungu\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Mungu\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_C\u00e9sar_Ch\u00e1vez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canelo_\u00c1lvarez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canelo \u00c1lvarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tijuana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tijuana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tijuana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/8b97ab524009f9af822ecce25d76436f/crop/0x0/2036x1358/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/05/06/17150052068182.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

He is arguably the most complete fighter in the world right now,\" says former WBO super-featherweight world champion Barry Jones.\n\nThe 31-year-old will make a first defence of his crown against Mexican Luis Nery in Tokyo on Monday.\n\nNery, a heavy underdog, has described Inoue as \"overrated, over-confident and ordinary\" - but the champion's accolades say otherwise.\n\nInoue has lived up to the moniker 'kaibutsu' - translated to 'the monster' - bestowed upon him by gym owner and former world champion Hideyuki Ohashi after just one fight.\n\nHe is a four-weight world champion and the only male fighter - after Terence Crawford - to become undisputed in two weight classes.\n\n\"Inoue does pretty much everything very, very well. He has crazy power but his technique is flawless and his balance is sublime. These are hall of fame attributes,\" Jones says.\n\n\"But that power - he carries it throughout. He can knock you out in round one or knock you out in round 12. He can even take a good shot.\"\n\nSouthpaw Nery is himself a two-division champion and has just one blemish on his record - a stoppage loss to Brandon Figueroa in 2021.\n\n\"It's a good and fun fight\" Jones says. \"I wouldn't be surprised if it goes late but with the power in his right hand, I think Inoue will win inside the distance.\"\n\nJones expects Inoue to move up to featherweight and has identified the winner of WBC champion Ray Ford or Nick Ball -

where he has fought 22 times - there are those who feel he has not yet reached the global superstar status deserving of his achievements.\n\nEarlier this year boxer-turned-pundit Shawn Porter said Inoue had to \"crack America\" to enhance his stardom.\n\n\"How can you say he is not a big enough star?,\" Jones asks. \"Name me another guy at that weight who sells out a stadium?\"\n\n\"It's just the western world - we're pretty much talking about the UK and US - where he may not be a household name, but every boxing fan knows who he is.\n\n\"The fact is he's small and his fights are often on weekday daytimes, but this idea that he isn't famous or isn't a big enough star depends on what side of the street you're walking on.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Weight class (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Underdog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_featherweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super featherweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Figueroa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Figueroa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideyuki_Ohashi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hideyuki Ohashi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southpaw_stance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southpaw stance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Featherweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Featherweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buster Douglas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shawn Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_yen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japanese yen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/bbc_us_articles_995/a451e3747054f7eff362c990fb7c517a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1781, "textEnd": 1787}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The Japanese star is ranked No 2 behind Terence Crawford on the pound-for-pound list, having held world titles in four weight classes as just the second man behind Crawford to be an undisputed champion in two classes during the four-belt era.\n\nHe enters the clash on the back of a 10th-round knockout victory over Marlon Tapales last December to become undisputed super bantamweight champion, following up his victory over former unified champion Stephen Fulton earlier in the year.\n\nNery comes in with an impressive record of 35-1 including 27 victories by knockout, the latest of which saw him stop Froilan Saludar in the second round last July. His sole career defeat came at the hands of Brandon Figueroa in 2021 when he suffered a seventh-round knockout against the American.\n\nThe 29-year-old has fought in Japan twice before, notably failing a drugs test after beating Shinsuke Yamanaka in 2017 - his positive result put down to contaminated food - and winning the subsequent rematch after missing weight a year later.\n\nThe undercard action will see Australia's WBO bantamweight champion Jason Maloney (27-2, 19 KOs) defend his title against former kickboxing world champion Yoshiki Takei (8-0, 8 KOs).\n\nHe's diminutive, and so very towering. Quiet, and yet so very loud. He's a little bit fast, a little bit frightening, a little bit mysterious, a little bit good. He fights on Boxing Day and random weekdays. His supremacy is missed by some, and yet championed as greatness by others.\n\nNaoya Inoue might be the most dangerous man on the planet. His dominance might also slip through the mainstream net far too often, far too easily.\n\nRarely does he or his excellence venture outside of his Japanese fortress - only four times, in fact. There he is a God, to challenge whom hopeful warriors travel long and far, only to be mercilessly slain by boxing's real-life Monster.\n\nIn Nery comes a willing combatant with a fearless belligerence that will empower him to go toe-to-toe with Inoue. He is a capable contender, but will arrive in Tokyo to be greeted by a different kind of talent. Nobody has threatened Inoue; nobody has come close to threatening Inoue, no matter how qualified. Nery, for all his attributes, is merely the next in line.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

With an impressive track record of 23 wins by knockout, he has established himself as a force to be reckoned with across multiple weight divisions. Having conquered titles at junior flyweight, junior bantamweight, bantamweight, and now junior featherweight, Inoue's quest for undisputed glory has been relentless.\n\nHis recent exploits include a dominant campaign at junior featherweight in 2023, where he swiftly dispatched opponents to claim the division's top honors. Notable among his victories was a commanding performance against Stephen Fulton in July, followed by a decisive triumph over Marlon Tapales in December, solidifying his status as the undisputed champion.\n\nMeanwhile, Nery brings his own intriguing narrative to the ring, particularly in the context of his history in Japan. His previous encounters on Japanese soil, notably against Shinsuke Yamanaka for the WBC bantamweight title in 2017, were marred by controversy surrounding a failed drug test. Despite subsequent setbacks, including a suspension from fighting in Japan, Nery's resilience has earned him a shot at redemption against Inoue.\n\nWith tensions running high and the crowd firmly in favor of hometown hero Inoue, Nery faces an uphill battle as he seeks to overcome the odds and make his mark on the international stage.

Uh, no.\n\nInoue, his otherworldly talents on full display, got up from the knockdown to put his Mexican opponent down three times before referee Michael Griffin stopped the fight at 1:22 of Round 6.\n\nThus, Inoue (27-0, 24 KOs) retained his undisputed 122-pound championship.\n\n\"That happening gave me motivation,\" Inoue said about the knockdown through a translator afterward.\n\nNery's hook about a minute and a half into the fight -- landed when Inoue's right hand was down -- genuinely rocked the champion, who had never been on the canvas in his decade long career.\n\nHe got up quickly but went into a defensive mode, perhaps a sign that he felt the weight of the blow. However, by the end of the round he seemed to be at 100%.\n\nThen came the fireworks. Inoue, careful to avoid Nery's left thereafter, proceeded to pick the slower, less skillful Nery apart from both the outside and inside until the Mexican challenger could fight no more.\n\nInoue put the challenger down with a short left hook as he was rushing in recklessly in the second round, although Nery wasn't hurt.\n\nThe champion scored the second knockdown with the same punch in Round 3. This time Nery seemed to truly feel Inoue's power.\n\nAnd, after taking a fearful beating that broke him down over the next two-plus rounds, Nery went down once more from a right hand as his back was against the ropes.\n\nGriffin had no reason to count as Nery sat on the canvas.

Pound-for-pound star Naoya \"The Monster\" Inoue will also make the walk to take on Mexican challenger Luis Nery at the Tokyo Dome in Japan.\n\nWhile Alvarez might be the most popular boxer in the game right now, Inoue is the most dominant. He occupies the No. 1 spot in Bleacher Report's latest pound-for-pound rankings and it would be shocking to see him lose it this weekend.\n\nInoue has vaulted to the top of most pound-for-pound list while collecting world titles in four different weight classes. Lately, he's made a home at 122 pounds where he has now won two fights and four belts.\n\nHe'll put all of those belts on the line against Nery, a two-time world champion in his own right.\n\nHere's a look at all the information you'll need to catch the fight and see if Inoue can keep his dominant streak going.\n\nInoue's moniker is \"The Monster\" but \"The Machine\" would be applicable too. It's hard to find many flaws in his game and his ability to completely overwhelm his opponents is the best in the game.\n\nInoue hasn't just collected titles, he's done it in style. Only three opponents have even made it to the cards with him and one of them, Nonito Donaire, was obliterated by second-round TKO in the rematch.\n\nIf there were any concerns about his transition to 122 pounds after winning belts at 108, 115 and 118 pounds he has certainly put them to rest.\n\nThe only thing you can really say about this matchup is that Nery is going to present a style he hasn't really seen at super bantamweight.\n\nStephen Fulton was a good athlete and defensive fighter. Marlon Tapales was able to get his fight with The Monster to the 10th round with a highly defensive game plan. His shell made it hard for Inoue to land his power shots for a while but eventually broke down under the pressure.\n\nNery might not be good enough to pull the upset but he is going to stand there and force Inoue to showcase his defense.\n\nThe 29-year-old is a powerful fighter in his own right. He has scored knockouts in 27 of his 35 career victories including his last three fights.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, Nery is as good of a puncher as Inoue. But even if that's true he's not nearly the technician and doesn't hold a speed advantage.\n\nIn a battle of punchers, Inoue's varied attack which includes plenty of body blows is going to wear down Nery and likely add another knockout to his record.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_ballentine@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Alex Ballentine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canelo_\u00c1lvarez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canelo \u00c1lvarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinco_de_Mayo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinco de Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weight class (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonito_Donaire", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nonito Donaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fulton_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Fulton (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Tapales", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marlon Tapales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1714780615/tnvuyhxyzcvlorf3h5xr.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The Japanese star is ranked No 2 behind Terence Crawford on the pound-for-pound list, having held world titles in four weight classes as just the second man behind Crawford to be an undisputed champion in two classes during the four-belt era.\n\nHe enters the clash on the back of a 10th-round knockout victory over Marlon Tapales last December to become undisputed super bantamweight champion, following up his victory over former unified champion Stephen Fulton earlier in the year.\n\nNery comes in with an impressive record of 35-1 including 27 victories by knockout, the latest of which saw him stop Froilan Saludar in the second round last July. His sole career defeat came at the hands of Brandon Figueroa in 2021 when he suffered a seventh-round knockout against the American.\n\nThe 29-year-old has fought in Japan twice before, notably failing a drugs test after beating Shinsuke Yamanaka in 2017 - his positive result put down to contaminated food - and winning the subsequent rematch after missing weight a year later.\n\nThe undercard action will see Australia's WBO bantamweight champion Jason Maloney (27-2, 19 KOs) defend his title against former kickboxing world champion Yoshiki Takei (8-0, 8 KOs).\n\nHe's diminutive, and so very towering. Quiet, and yet so very loud. He's a little bit fast, a little bit frightening, a little bit mysterious, a little bit good. He fights on Boxing Day and random weekdays. His supremacy is missed by some, and yet championed as greatness by others.\n\nNaoya Inoue might be the most dangerous man on the planet. His dominance might also slip through the mainstream net far too often, far too easily.\n\nRarely does he or his excellence venture outside of his Japanese fortress - only four times, in fact. There he is a God, to challenge whom hopeful warriors travel long and far, only to be mercilessly slain by boxing's real-life Monster.\n\nIn Nery comes a willing combatant with a fearless belligerence that will empower him to go toe-to-toe with Inoue. He is a capable contender, but will arrive in Tokyo to be greeted by a different kind of talent. Nobody has threatened Inoue; nobody has come close to threatening Inoue, no matter how qualified.

Inoue appeared more shocked than hurt, taking a knee early in the count and calmly making it to his feet at eight before surviving Nery's closing efforts and surviving until the bell.\n\nThe second round unfolded on even terms for the first two minutes until Inoue returned the favor with a sharp counter left hook to the inside while moving backwards that dropped an overextended Nery to the deck. From that point Inoue seemed to be timing his opponent, whose lack of an alternative plan led to complications in the third.\n\nBy the fourth Inoue's unique cocktail of power, speed and footwork was on full display as he pointed to his jaw and showboated in the center of the ring. Nery's face began to swell as Inoue peppered him with punches, looking to set up the left hand to the midsection.\n\nThe end appeared near during the fifth when Nery dropped his guard just long enough for Inoue to detonate a left hand on his chin, putting the Mexican down for a second time. Nery was saved by the bell after beating the count but proved less fortunate in the sixth, when a massive right dropped him for the third and final time, prompting an immediate intervention from referee Michael Griffin.\n\nInoue landed 107 of 239 blows (44.8%), according to Compubox's punch statistics, compared to 54 of 194 for Nery (27.8%).\n\nIt was the latest sensational finish for the 5ft 5in Inoue, who captured his first world title at 108lbs in only his sixth professional fight before adding another belt at 115lbs, then becoming the undisputed champion at 118lbs and 122lbs over a 378-day span.\n\nA card stacked with four world title fights marked boxing's return to the Big Egg for the first time since February 1990, when a 42-1 underdog named James 'Buster' Douglas knocked out then-unbeaten heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in one of the great upsets in all of sport.\n\nInoue is no Tyson. He's better, both on body of work and appetite for destruction. He has fought 13 world champions and beaten every one of them. At 31, he's already one of the finest at any weight from any era: a true superstar and the arguably the greatest show in sports today.\n\nWhether it was enough for Inoue to eclipse the undisputed welterweight champion Terence Crawford atop boxing's pound-for-pound list is a matter of opinion. But that it's become a two-horse race is beyond credible dispute.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Tapales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marlon Tapales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canelo_\u00c1lvarez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canelo \u00c1lvarez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southpaw_stance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southpaw stance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weight class (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tijuana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tijuana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tijuana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footwork_(martial_arts)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Footwork (martial arts)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_guardian_765/75f79ceda9ef267470948af21d8b69ea", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1990-02-", "textStart": 3312, "textEnd": 3325}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The Mexican-born southpaw has proven his class by posting stoppage wins over the likes of Shinsuke Yamanaka, Juan Carlos Payano, McJoe Arroyo and Azat Hovhannisyan. However, despite Nery's vaunted punching power and experience, he'll need something very special to derail the champion.\n\nThe Sporting News will provide live coverage from the full card in Japan and round-by-round scoring for the main event.\n\n3:00 p.m. JST/ 2:00 a.m. ET: Hello and welcome to The Sporting News' live coverage of pound-for-pound superstar Naoya Inoue's defence of his undisputed super bantamweight title against hard-punching Mexican southpaw Luis Nery.\n\nThe main card starts at 5 p.m. local time (4 a.m. ET). The main event should start around 8 p.m. local time (7 a.m. ET), depending on how long the undercard fights last.\n\nJapan Standard Time is 13 hours ahead of US Eastern Time.\n\nMORE: Naoya Inoue or Terence Crawford?

Ring walks are estimated for 7:35 a.m. ET on ESPN+.\n\n\"He's a terrific young man and one of the greatest fighters I've ever seen,\" Arum told BoxingScene. \"It's scary with what I am seeing. He overwhelms really good opponents. I've never seen a fighter of that size perform the way he has. Maybe Salvador Sanchez had that ability. Even then, Sanchez did not win nearly all his fights by knockout. Inoue goes in, boxes, and knocks these guys out. What we're seeing in Inoue is something that is really special. There are no ifs, ands, or buts about it. He's as special to boxing to what [Japanese star] Shohei Ohtani is to baseball. We're honored to be playing a part in his career.\"\n\nThe Japanese sensation Inoue will be headlining a boxing event at the Tokyo Dome for the first time since 1990 when Mike Tyson was upset by Buster Douglas. The sold-out show featuring Inoue and Nery will draw over 50,000 fans and generate a gate of over $20 million.\n\nEven though Inoue's fights in Japan take place in the early morning hours in the United States, Arum said he's still a smashing success with stateside fans.\n\n\"ESPN has told us that even though Inoue's fights come on at a crazy hour, the audience is still very large,\" said Arum. \"Boxing fans also know they are watching something special when they are watching Inoue ... The Japanese are not really emotional, but they are really emotional for Inoue.\"\n\nThe four-division champion Inoue certainly has been special in recent years.\n\nThe 31-year-old was the undisputed champion at 118 pounds before moving up to 122 pounds in 2023. In two fights, Inoue became the 122-pound king by knocking out unified champions Stephen Fulton and Marlon Tapales.\n\nBoxingScene and the Boxing Writers Association of America, among others, awarded Inoue 2023 Fighter of the Year honors.\n\nInoue is currently considered a top-two pound-for-pound fighter along with Terence Crawford.\n\nAn unimpressed Nery hasn't gotten the memo - he recently called Inoue \"overrated, overconfident, and ordinary.\"\n\n\"Luis Nery is a tough Mexican fighter who will give him a go for a few rounds and then Inoue will knock him out,\" said Arum.", "source":

The 12-round bout, plus undercard action, will air on ESPN+ in the U.S.\n\nInoue (26-0) is a four-weight world titleholder and a two-division undisputed champion. The Japanese star halted Paul Butler to win undisputed at 118 and knocked out Marlon Tapales to hold all the gold at super bantamweight. He is in rare company, as he is only the second male fighter in the four-belt era to accomplish that feat.\n\n\"The Monster\" is a mainstay in the mythical pound-for-pound rankings and there are many who view him as the finest fighter in the world today. He's been a world champion for over a decade.\n\n\"April 6 is like my birthday, and it's been ten years as I've continued my speedy run,\" Inoue said via Kyodo News. \"I'm getting into amazing physical condition.\"\n\nWATCH: Naoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery, exclusively on ESPN+\n\nNery (35-1) was banned from entering Japan after he missed weight for a world title rematch with Shinsuke Yamanaka, who he knocked out in two rounds. That infraction followed a failed drug test before the first fight, which he won via TKO 4.\n\nThe former champion is on a four-fight win streak and has 27 wins via knockout. The Japanese Commission elected to lift Nery's ban to give him the biggest opportunity of his career.\n\nThe undercard features three major world title fights. Included will be an always-ready Australian star, as well as the brother of Inoue looking to come out from under The Monster's shadow.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the entire action on the Inoue vs. Nery card.\n\nJason Moloney defends the WBO bantamweight title against Yoshiki Takei.\n\nMoloney (27-2) lost world title bouts to Emmanuel Rodriguez and Naoya Inoue. However, the Aussie is now on a six-fight win streak and beat Vincent Astrolabio in May 2023 to annex WBO bantamweight gold.\n\nA multi-time K-1 champion, Takei (8-0) controlled the kickboxing scene from 2014 to 2020. The 27-year-old has a 100-percent knockout-to-win ratio since transitioning to boxing.\n\nThe younger brother of Naoya, Takuma (19-1) is on a six-fight win streak. He outlasted Liborio Solis in April 2023 to win the vacant WBA bantamweight championship, a title that \"The Monster\" previously held.\n\nIshida (34-3) fought for the WBA super flyweight title in 2017, dropping a decision to Britain's Kal Yafai, He has since gone 10-2 and is on a five-fight win streak.\n\nFinally, Seigo Yuri Akui defends the WBA flyweight title against Taku Kuwahara.\n\nA former association football player, Akui (19-2-1) scored a controversial upset win over Artem Dalakian to lift the WBA flyweight title in January. This will be his maiden title defense.\n\nMORE: How to bet on combat sports\n\nKuwahara (13-1) is on a five-fight win streak, with four of those coming via knockout. He punched his way to top contender status by knocking out Wulan Tuolehazi in July.\n\nThe main card starts at 4 a.m. ET. The main event should start around 7 a.m. ET, depending on how long the undercard fights last.\n\nThe Naoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery main card will air on ESPN+ in the U.S. The undercard will air exclusively on ESPN+.\n\nIf Inoue vs. Nery is not available to watch live in your location or if you're traveling abroad, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

Nery Live On ESPN+ On Monday, May 6th At 4 Am ET / 9 Am UK - Boxing News 24", "body": "Inoue vs Nery undisputed junior featherweight showdown tops world title quadruple-header on Monday, May 6 at Tokyo Dome LIVE on ESPN+ + starting at 4 a.m. ET / 1 a.m. PT / 9 am UK\n\nPromoter Bob Arum reports that undisputed super bantamweight champion Naoya Inoue and his WBC mandatory Luis Nery are set for May 6th at the Tokyo Dome in Japan.\n\nA Prestigious Stage for a Big Fight\n\nArum says the \"prestigious\" Tokyo Dome is the same location where former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson lost to Buster Douglas in 1990, and it seats 50,000.\n\nThat's a big stadium, but the Nissan Stadium seats 70,000 in Yokohama, Japan, and that would be ideal if the idea was to get as many fans as possible.\n\nPost-Fight Plans: Japan, US, or the Desert?\n\nIf Inoue (26-0, 23 KOs) is victorious against the former two-division world champion Nery (35-1, 27 KOs), Arum says he could fight in the United States or possibly Saudi Arabia.\n\nArum doesn't say who Inoue would be fighting, but it's probable that he would be moving up to featherweight to challenge one of these three champions:\n\n- Luis Lopez: IBF\n\n- Rey Vargas: WBC\n\n- Rafael Espinoza: WBO\n\nIf Inoue chooses to stay at 122, he'll likely go ahead with his plans to defend against former world champions Murodjon Akhmadaliev and John Riel Casimero.\n\nThose are less appealing options because both of those guys were recently beaten. Moreover, Casimero is long in the tooth and has a lot of miles on him.\n\nThose fights would appeal more to the Japanese audiences than the U.S fans, who are aware that Casimero and Akhmadaliev were both beaten recently.\n\n\"He's fighting Luis Nery in Japan on May 6th,\" said Bob Arum to 3 Knockdown Rule about undisputed super bantamweight champion Naoya Inoue defending against Luis Nery on May 6th in Japan.\n\n\"It is the first fight since Mike Tyson and Buster Douglas fought in the Tokyo Dome. It's a very prestigious. The arena seats over 50,000, and with Inoue, it'll be filled.\n\n\"The question of whether he wins that fight, he comes out of Japan to fight in the United States or Saudi Arabia, that's really up to my co-promoter, and I'd have to talk to them at that time,\" said Arum on whether Naoya Inoue will fight outside of his home country of Japan if he's victorious against Nery.\n\n\"It's a combination of what he can do in Japan financially, which is huge, and what he can do outside of Japan, which, particularly if we're talking about the Saudi's interest, it could be even greater. So, I honestly can't answer that question,\" said Arum.\n\nIn the co-feature, Australia's Jason \"Mayhem\" Moloney (27-2, 19 KOs) is set to defend his WBO bantamweight world title against the ex-kickboxing champ, Yoshiki Takei (8-0, 8 KOs), who has knocked out all opponents in his boxing career so far.\n\nAlso on the card, Takuma Inoue (19-1, 5 KOs) will defend his WBA bantamweight title against the seasoned Sho Ishida (34-3, 17 KOs). The younger brother of Naoya Inoue, Takuma is keen to cement his own legacy in a division his sibling once dominated.\n\nRounding out the title fights, Seigo Yuri Akui (19-2-1, 11 KOs) will once again throw down with Taku Kuwahara (13-1, 8 KOs) for the WBA flyweight world title, revisiting their 2021 clash that left fans clamoring for more. This rematch promises to be a riveting sequel to their previous fierce encounter.", "source": {"uri": "boxingnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boxing News 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Now we know that he's even better than that.\n\nOn Monday, for the first time in his career, \"The Monster\" was knocked clean off his feet in a fight. Mexican southpaw and former two-weight world champion Luis Nery caught Inoue in the opening round with a savage left hand to the jaw that dropped him hard at the Tokyo Dome.\n\nShaken up when he rose, Inoue backed off for the remainder of the session and used the one-minute rest period before round two to clear his head. Immediately, the requisite adjustments were made to take away Nery's vaunted left hand, and then Inoue went to work... in earnest.\n\nBang! Down went Nery from a left hook in round two. Bang! Down went Nery from another left hook in round five. Bang! Down and OUT went Nery from a lightning-quick double right to the jaw in round six. It was an exquisite performance from one of the greatest boxers of the modern era. Yes, I said it.\n\nMORE: Naoya Inoue floored for the first time, rises to score brutal sixth-round KO\n\nAnd as well as that, Inoue is also the finest pound-for-pound fighter in the world today.\n\nIn July of last year, I took a hammering from Team Inoue for favouring Terence Crawford as the best fighter in the world. I had my reasons for making that choice. In my opinion, Crawford outclassing and stopping Errol Spence Jr. was more impressive than Inoue taking down Stephen Fulton. Even after Inoue had hammered the reliable Marlon Tapales to become undisputed super bantamweight champion in December, I still wasn't convinced he was better than his welterweight (soon-to-be super welterweight) counterpart.\n\nI am now. Inoue continues to go from strength to strength and we're still learning new things about him. What we know after the 27th straight triumph of his Hall of Fame career is that the Japanese star can take a killer blow and still prevail. You'll encounter the odd sorry soul who'll try to convince you that Inoue being knocked down shows that he's not that good after all. That's just a shortcut to thinking.\n\nWith very few exceptions, most great fighters will go down at some point in their careers. Muhammad Ali was dropped by Sonny Banks and Henry Cooper before he even became champion. Sugar Ray Leonard was decked by journeyman Kevin Howard in 1984. Inoue was just put over by arguably the hardest puncher in his division besides himself. What do all three champions have in common? They all got up to win by stoppage. That's how you cement yourself as a great fighter.\n\nThis moment has added to Inoue's legacy. I've said many times that \"The Monster\" is the perfect blend of speed, power and technique. Those attributes are matched only by his willingness to fight the best and his fighting heart. But the other thing Inoue has going for him is that he's so much busier than his pound-for-pound contemporaries.\n\nMORE: The greatest boxers from every decade\n\nSince this decade began, Crawford has gone 4-0 in world title bouts. Granted, the graceful American switch hitter scored the biggest win of his career when he took out Spence, but his ring activity has still been shockingly low. The same is true of unified heavyweight champ Oleksandr Usyk (also 4-0) although the war in his home country of Ukraine has been a huge contributing factor.\n\nInoue has gone 8-0 in world title fights since 2020. He has become undisputed champion in two divisions during that time and has taken down a string of world-class operators. Not one of those opponents has managed to last the distance and you could count the number of rounds Inoue has lost on one hand.\n\nThe Japanese warrior's stay at the top of the pound-for-pound perch may be brief - especially if Usyk finds a way to beat Tyson Fury on May 18 - but Inoue deserves his flowers right now. He's an incredible boxer, and fight fans the world over should be privileged that they're seeing his epic rise.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southpaw_stance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southpaw stance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fulton_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Fulton (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Tapales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marlon Tapales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Spence_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Errol Spence Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Light middleweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Banks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sonny Banks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henry Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Usyk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oleksandr Usyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Ray_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sugar Ray Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muhammad Ali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/GettyImages-2151163322.jpg?itok=c6bVZ43t", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 3769, "textEnd": 3775}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

Would it come back to haunt him? Inoue saw to as much being the case.\n\nHere was the biggest test of Inoue's so-far spotless career. One he would pass immediately as he turned his attention to Nery's body before swerving a front-foot pounce and catching his opponent off-balance with a perfectly-timed left hook to the torso, leaving the Mexican on the floor. All square.\n\nInoue's adjustments were underlined in the third as the one boxing fans call 'Monster' began to neutralise Nery's left hook counter with ease, prompting a more tentative approach from the challenger as his main weapon deteriorated.\n\nComing back Nery's direction were lightning head-to-body combinations and a straight right hand that breached his defences time and time again, one thumping jab snapping his head back in a warning of what was to follow. Inoue had settled; Nery had missed his chance.\n\nInto the fourth and Nery's left hook adopted a more wild look, while across from him Inoue reassured Japanese fans of his control with some showboating followed by two vicious body shots and some more taunting head feints as he skipped around the ring.\n\nEvery counter was being slipped, every right hand was finding its target and the body shots were showing increasing signs of wearing Nery down.\n\nNery's attempts to make the fight a gritty, nasty one on the inside quickly backfired when he was floored by a crashing left hand on the ropes, leaving him biting down on his gumshield upon regaining his feet.\n\nThe end was in sight, and eventually arrived in the sixth when Inoue showcased blistering hand speed to land a right upper-cut followed by a clinical right jab that left Nery sprawled out in the ropes.\n\nIf anything, the early knockdown only elevated the stock of Inoue, who was unflappable in the face of a setback that might have rocked others far more significantly. A generational talent remains undefeated, and the world remains in awe.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshi_Inoue_(entomologist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hiroshi Inoue (entomologist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Yamanaka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Yamanaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cross (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jab", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mouthguard"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/05/1600x900/skysports-naoya-inoue-boxing_6545341.jpg?20240506134958", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Inoue, currently No. 2 in The Ring's pound-for-pound rankings, dialed in with a power jab and stinging one-two combinations in Round 3, keeping Nery at arms' length and holstering the Mexican's offense.\n\nBy Round 4, Inoue was confident enough to showboat a little, play to the crowd and taunt the challenger in front of at least 40,000 fans. Nery (35-2, 27 KOs) took the punches but wasn't returning fire. That changed in Round 5, when the Mexican opened up and forged forward, pressing Inoue to the ropes. And that's all the opening the four-division world titleholder needed to land another knockdown-producing left hook with 35 seconds left in the round.\n\nInoue went for the kill in Round 6, no longer content to play with his food. Backing weary looking Nery into a corner Inoue unleashed a combination punctuated with a right uppercut followed by a right cross that violently deposited the gutsy challenger to the canvas where referee Michael Griffin waved the bout off at 1:22 of the round.\n\nWhat began as a dramatic shootout became a one-sided beating, but it was thrilling due to Inoue's dynamic offense and Nery's toughness. When the Fighter of the Year faces the winner of the Fight of the Year, we should have expected entertainment. Most expected revenge for Japanese boxing, as Nery was once banned from fighting in the country due to controversial back-to-back knockouts of respected bantamweight champ Shinsuke Yamanaka in 2017 and 2018. Nery tested positive for a banned substance after their first bout and then missed weight by three and half pounds for the rematch.\n\nDespite the ugly past, Inoue said he respected Nery as a competitor during his post-fight interview.\n\nSo, what's next for The Monster? Sam Goodman, the mandatory challenger for one of the four sanctioning body belts that Inoue holds, was in the ring at the end of his post-fight interview. Inoue said he would love to fight the undefeated Australian, The Ring's No. 4-rated junior featherweight, in September.\n\nGoodman will be an even bigger underdog than Nery was, but that first round may have given him (and all the other top 122 and 126 pounders) hope.", "source": {"uri": "ringtv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Ring"}, "authors": [{"uri": "doug_fischer@ringtv.com", "name": "Doug Fischer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southpaw_stance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southpaw stance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tijuana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tijuana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tijuana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uppercut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uppercut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jab", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandatory_challenger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mandatory challenger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_magazine_Fighter_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Ring magazine Fighter of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_magazine_Fight_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Ring magazine Fight of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Yamanaka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Yamanaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.ringtv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Naoya-Inoue-Luis-Nery_Fukuda.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Let's start with the big one:\n\nAccording to Top Rank, these are the anticipated ring walk times:\n\nMain event: Inoue and Nery are expected to make their ring walks at approximately 7:35 a.m. ET.\n\nChief support: Moloney vs. Takei ring walks are estimated for 6:25 a.m. ET/3:25 a.m. PT.\n\nWhy to Watch: One of the best fighters in the world is taking on one of his top remaining challengers.\n\nInoue has sat atop or near the top of pound-for-pound lists for years, impressing early as he won a world title at 108 pounds, jumped straight to 115 to knock off a longtime titleholder there, and showcased his skills and power in several title defenses in that division.\n\nHe was already a star in Japan and beloved by hardcore fan favorites. But where Inoue really began to cross over into greater awareness was during his run at bantamweight. Inoue plowed through the weight class and made it look (mostly) easy.\n\nHis first two fights at 118 came against contenders Jamie McDonnell and Juan Carlos Payano. They were taken out in about three minutes combined. Inoue stopped Emmanuel Rodriguez in less than two rounds for a world title. He battled through a fractured orbital bone and a resurgent Nonito Donaire in 2019's Fight of the Year for 2019, unifying with a second world title.\n\nA rematch with Inoue a little later went much easier. Inoue sent Donaire packing in two rounds and added a third world title. By the end of 2022, Inoue had become the undisputed champion, winning the fourth and final world title in the weight class with an 11th-round knockout of Paul Butler.\n\nHe wasn't done.\n\nInoue moved up to 122 and went straight to the top junior featherweight, Stephen Fulton. A fight that many thought was going to be more competitive? It wasn't. Inoue scored an eighth-round technical knockout and won two world titles. In his next fight, Inoue sent Marlon Tapales away before the final bell, picking up the remaining two world titles. Once again, he was undisputed, now in a second division.\n\nThe 31-year-old \"Monster\" from Yokohama is now 26-0 (23 KOs). And his work isn't done now either.\n\nHe's facing Luis Nery, a 29-year-old from Tijuana who is 35-1 (27 KOs).\n\nNery is a former two-division titleholder himself, though one of those title wins is tainted. Nery knocked out longtime titleholder Shinsuke Yamanaka in the fourth round in 2017. But Nery tested positive for a banned substance. And the WBC, in its infinite wisdom (cough, cough), decided not to strip Nery of its belt.\n\nNery and Yamanaka had a rematch in 2018. Nery lost his title on the scales, coming in three pounds overweight. He knocked out Yamanaka again, this time in the second round, and was subsequently banned from fighting again in Japan, where both of those bouts had taken place. (That ban has been rescinded for this clash with Inoue.)\n\nIn 2020, Nery outpointed Aaron Alamada to win a vacant title at 122. He lost it in his next outing, stopped on a body shot in the seventh round of a competitive unification match with Brandon Figueroa in 2021.\n\nNery has won four straight since over Carlos Castro (SD10), David Carmona (KO3), Azat Hovhannisyan (KO11) in one of the best fights of 2023, and Froilan Saludar (TKO2).\n\nThis fight should be fun while it lasts. It's absolutely worth waking up early for.\n\nAnd it's worth waking up even earlier for the televised undercard, which features three title fights:\n\nJason Moloney vs. Yoshiki Takei: Moloney, a 33-year-old from Australia, is a former Inoue victim, knocked out in the seventh round back in 2020. He's won six straight since, picking up the WBO bantamweight belt (one of the four Inoue vacated) with a majority decision over Vincent Astrolabio in May 2023 and retaining it this past January with another majority decision, this one against Saul Sanchez. Moloney is 27-2 (19 KOs).\n\nTakei, a 27-year-old from Japan, is 8-0 with 8 KOs. He's mostly fought at or near the junior featherweight limit of 122 pounds but is moving down for this opportunity. Takei last fought in December, knocking out Mario Diaz Maldonado in two rounds.\n\nTakuma Inoue vs. Sho Ishida: Takuma will defend his WBA bantamweight title -- another belt left vacant when his older brother, Naoya, left the 118-pound division behind. The 28-year-old Takuma is 19-1 (5 KOs). He lost in his first title shot, dropping a unanimous decision to Nordine Oubaali in 2019. Takuma has notched six wins since (say that six times fast), outpointing Liborio Solis for the belt in April 2023 and scoring a KO9 over former 115-pound titleholder Jerwin Ancajas in February.\n\nIshida, a 32-year-old from Osaka, fell short in his only previous title challenge, losing a unanimous decision in 2017 to Khalid Yafai down in the 115-pound division. Two more blemishes have been added to his record since, both via split decision, bringing him to 34-3 (17 KOs). One came against Israel Gonzalez in 2019 (Gonzalez went on to face Roman \"Chocolatito\" Gonzalez) and the other against Kosei Tanaka in 2021 (Tanaka, a former three-division titleholder at the time, has since added a title in his fourth weight class).\n\nSeigo Yuri Akui vs. Taku Kuwahara: Akui picked up the biggest win of his career, and the WBA flyweight title, in January when he outpointed longtime beltholder Artem Dalakian. That brought the 28-year-old from Kurashiki, Japan, to 19-2-1 (11 KOs). And it was a stunning resuscitation for Akui's career given the setbacks he'd suffered years before: stoppage losses to future three-division titleholder Junto Nakatani in 2017 and a 17-8 foe named Jaysever Abcede in 2018. The victory over Dalakian was Akui's seventh straight win.\n\nKuwahara was one of the people Akui defeated during that streak. Their first fight, held in 2021, was very close on the scorecards, with Akui slightly ahead entering the 10th and final round. They didn't make it to the final bell. Akui stopped Kuwahara with 11 seconds to go. Kuwahara, a 29-year-old who calls Yokohama home, has won five in a row since to improve to 13-1 (8 KOs).\n\nWednesday, May 8: Robbie Davies Jr. vs. Sergey Lipinets (ProBoxTV.com, 8 p.m. Eastern Time)\n\n(Note: BoxingScene.com is owned by ProBox.)\n\nThis show in Plant City, Florida, is headlined by junior welterweights Davies and Lipinets.\n\nDavies, a 34-year-old from Liverpool, is 23-4 (15 KOs). He last fought in March 2023, when he was stopped in three rounds by Darragh Foley.\n\nLipinets is a 35-year-old originally from Kazakhstan who now calls Southern California home. He briefly held a world title at 140 pounds, capturing a vacant belt in late 2017 and then dropping it four months later in a decision loss to Mikey Garcia. Lipinets then went up to welterweight for a spell, only to be sent packing after getting put away in six rounds by Jaron Ennis in April 2021.\n\nSince then he's been back at junior welterweight, though his appearances came between two long layoffs: 16 months between the Ennis fight and a TKO8 win over Omar Figueroa in August 2022, and then 15 months until last November's decision loss to Michel Rivera. Lipinets, now 17-3-1 (13 KOs), will only have been out of the ring for five months before this Wednesday's match.\n\nSaturday, May 11: George Kambosos Jr. vs. Vasiliy Lomachenko (ESPN and ESPN+, undercard begins at 10 p.m. Eastern Time)\n\nKambosos and Lomachenko are two of the last four men to stand atop the lightweight division. That recognition went from Lomachenko to Teofimo Lopez, from Lopez to Kambosos, and finally from Kambosos to Devin Haney. They'll headline at the RAC Arena in Perth, performing in Kambosos' home country of Australia.\n\nLomachenko won Olympic gold twice while representing Ukraine and went on to become a three-division world titleholder in the pros. The 36-year-old is now 17-3 (11 KOs). Following his 2020 loss to Lopez, Lomachenko took care of a shoulder injury he came into the fight with, stopped Masayoshi Nakatani, outpointed Richard Commey, won a decision in a competitive fight with Jamaine Ortiz, and then took on Haney in May 2023. Haney vs. Lomachenko was close, but the three judges favored Haney. When Haney moved up to 140, that left his four world titles available for those remaining at 135.\n\nThis fight will be for the vacant IBF belt, one of the titles that Kambosos previously owned after he shocked Lopez in late 2021. Kambosos didn't reign long. Haney flew to Australia twice in 2022, clearly outpointing Kambosos once to take the throne and then doing it again to defend it. Some felt Kambosos underwhelmed in his last appearance -- a July majority decision over Maxi Hughes -- and should've lost. That brought Kambosos, a 30-year-old from Sydney, to 21-2 (10 KOs).\n\nThe undercard includes a women's bantamweight title fight between Nina Hughes and Cherneka Johnson, plus a clash between junior bantamweights Andrew Moloney and Pedro Guevara.\n\nHughes is a 41-year-old from Essex in the United Kingdom, and it might surprise you to learn that she's 6-0 (2 KOs) rather than the owner of a lengthy pro record. Hughes was 25 when she first laced up the gloves in an exercise class, which led to an amateur career, then time away from the sport as she had a family, according to BBC Sport. Hughes turned pro at the end of 2021, defeated Jamie MItchell for the WBA belt a year later, and outpointed Jaime Healy last June.\n\nJohnson is a 29-year-old originally from New Zealand and now fighting out of Melbourne. She is a former junior featherweight titleholder who captured a vacant belt in 2022 with a majority decision win over Melissa Esquivel, defended the title with a unanimous decision over Susie Ramadan, then lost it on points to Ellie Scotney last June on the same show as Hughes vs. Healy. That brought Johnson's record to 15-2 (6 KOs).\n\nMoloney vs. Guevara pits a former 115-pound contender vs. a former 108-pound titleholder. Moloney, a 33-year-old Australian, is fighting days after his twin brother, bantamweight titleholder Jason Moloney, performs on the Inoue-Nery undercard. Andrew is 26-3 (16 KOs) and may be best remembered for his trilogy with Joshua Franco from 2020-2021, when Andrew went 0-2 with one headbutt-shortened no contest. Andrew was also on the receiving end of one of 2023's most picturesque knockouts, put down for the count by Junto Nakatani last May. Moloney came back in December with a points win over Judy Flores.\n\nGuevara is a 34-year-old from Mexico who is 41-4-1 (22 KOs). He lost his first title shot way back in 2012 in a close decision to Johnriel Casimero but took out Akira Yaegashi in 2014 to win a belt at 108 pounds. His reign ended less than a year later. Since then, Guevara has come up short against a pair of notable names, dropping a majority decision to Kenshiro Teraji in 2017 and a split decision to Carlos Cuadras last November. He outpointed a designated opponent this past February.\n\nSaturday, May 11: Jessica McCaskill vs. Lauren Price (Peacock, 2 p.m. Eastern Time / 7 p.m. BST)\n\nThese two things can be true: McCaskill is the lineal women's welterweight champion. She also hasn't won a fight in nearly two years.\n\nMcCaskill, a 39-year-old from Chicago, became the queen of the 147-pound division when she dethroned Cecilia Braekhus by majority decision in August 2020, then reaffirmed that win in their 2021 rematch with a wider victory on the scorecards. She added two more successful defenses, both via TKO.\n\nIn late 2022, McCaskill journeyed down to junior welterweight, where she'd previously competed and been a unified titleholder. Her opponent: Chantelle Cameron, who owned two world titles. The other two, each vacant, were also on the line. That meant the winner would become undisputed at 140.\n\nMcCaskil lost to Cameron via unanimous decision, and so she returned to 147 to defend her lineal championship and three remaining world titles against Sandy Ryan. McCaskill was able to retain her titles in a draw, but the decision was heavily debated and some believe it should've gone Ryan's way.\n\nMcCaskill's now 12-3-1 (5 KOs) and is down to just one sanctioning body belt. She hopes to reassert herself against Lauren Price, undefeated at 6-0 (1 KO) and the 2020 Olympic gold medalist in the middleweight division. The 29-year-old hails from Wales, which means Price will have a hometown crowd at the Cardiff International Arena while McCaskill will be in hostile territory.\n\nThe undercard is slated to include Hughie Fury as well as a number of undefeated prospects.\n\nSaturday, May 11: John Leonardo vs. Frank Gonzalez (BoxingInsider.com, 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time)\n\nThis show, which will stream for free, takes place at the Tropicana Atlantic City in New Jersey.\n\nLeonardo is a 23-year-old junior featherweight from about 90 minutes up the road in Manlapan Township. He's 10-1-1 (4 KOs) and has won three straight since a majority decision loss to Jostin Ortiz Maysonet in 2022. Only three of Leonardo's pro wins have come against opponents with winning records.\n\nBeating Gonzalez would make it four. Gonzalez is a 27-year-old from Florida who is 12-5 (6 KOs). He's coming off two straight defeats. And he, too, has only beaten three foes with winning records.\n\nThe undercard also features a handful of unbeaten prospects.\n\nSaturday, May 11: Eduardo Hernandez vs. Daniel Lugo (DAZN, 8 p.m. Eastern Time)\n\nHernandez was one round away from winning the WBC's world title at 130 pounds last October, ahead on the scorecards against O'Shaquie Foster going into the 12th. But then Foster dropped Hernandez twice and finished him with 22 seconds to go. That dropped the 26-year-old, who was born in Mexico City and now calls Las Vegas home, to 34-2 (31 KOs). Hernandez's other loss came on the other end of the spectrum, a first-round knockout loss to Roger Gutierrez back in 2019.\n\nHe'll look to rebound on this show in Aguascalientes, Mexico, against countryman Daniel Lugo. The 29-year-old from Sonora is 27-2-1 (18 KOs) and is coming off a majority draw this past February against former featherweight titleholder Mauricio Lara.\n\nTheir chief support is a women's junior featherweight title fight, with Erika Cruz Hernandez, 17-2 (3 KOs), defending against Nazarena Romero, 13-0-1 (7 KOs). Cruz Hernandez, 33, of Mexico City, held a featherweight title before losing it to Amanda Serrano in 2023. She then moved down to 122 and outpointed Mayerlin Rivas for the WBA belt in November.\n\nRomero, a 29-year-old from Argentina, deserves a shot at the title. It almost belonged to her first. She faced Rivas in June 2023 and scored a knockdown in the third round, only to suffer a bad cut from an accidental clash of heads that sent the fight to the scorecards in the fifth round. The judges were split, so the fight ended as a technical draw.\n\nSaturday, May 11: Denzel Bentley vs. Danny Dignum (TNT Sports 1, 7 p.m. BST)\n\nThese two British middleweights headline at York Hall in London.\n\nBentley, 29, is 18-3-1 (15 KOs) and has lost two of his last three. He was outpointed by WBO titleholder Zhanibek Alimkhanuly in November 2022, knocked Kieran Smith out in 45 seconds in April 2023, and then was upset via majority decision by Nathan Heaney this past November.\n\nDignum, 32, is 16-1-1 (9 KOs). He also has a loss to Alimkhanuly, dispatched in about five minutes in May 2022. Dignum returned with a pair of wins in March and April 2023 but has not fought in about 13 months.\n\nSeveral prospects are scheduled for the undercard.\n\nSaturday, May 11: Junior Younan vs. Ricardo Luna (StarBoxing.tv, 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time)\n\nThis show is being held at The Paramount in Long Island, New York. Younan is an undefeated 28-year-old from Brooklyn who has competed in recent years at super middleweight and light heavyweight. He is 19-0-1 (11 KOs). That draw came in 2018 against Ronald Ellis, who went on to lose to familiar names such as David Benavidez, Christian Mbilli and Erik Bazinyan.", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType":

However, it was the worst possible start. Nery began to use his jab well as he settled down quickly. Once he was in his groove, Nery made Inoue pay with a solid left hook on the inside, sending the champion to the canvas.\n\nIt was an eye-opener for Inoue. The champion responded well in the second. Nery attempted to press home his advantage, throwing another left hook. The punch missed, with Inoue landing his left hook on the counter to score his knockdown in an even two rounds.\n\nThe tide began to turn in Inoue's favor. The champion played to the crowd, goading Nery as he combined his punching with some showboating.\n\nInoue upped the tempo in the fifth round. He connected with a left hook and a right hook counter upstairs. The champion then landed a left hook to send Nery to the canvas. Nery made it to the bell, but the writing was on the wall.\n\nInoue ended proceedings in the sixth with his trademark shot: the right hand. The champion pushed Nery on the back foot, landing a massive right hand to send him through the ropes. The referee waved off the fight, as Inoue extended his record to 27-0.\n\n\"This is the first Tokyo Dome boxing event in 34 years, I'm so happy to be here.

The Japanese superstar certainly has the credentials and his skill level is beyond reproach.\n\nInoue (26-0, 23 KOs) has won world titles in four weight classes and reigned as undisputed champion in two of them. He briefly held the pound-for-pound top spot in 2022 after knocking out the legendary Nonito Donaire, but Terence Crawford has since taken over.\n\nWATCH: Naoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery, exclusively on ESPN+\n\nThe depth of talent in boxing is extremely high and holding the pound-for-pound mantle for a prolonged period of time is difficult. In the mid-1990s, Roy Jones Jr. reigned supreme for years due to his otherworldly talent and dominance. Later on, Floyd Mayweather was the consensus No. 1 thanks to his dazzling skills and unmatched defensive prowess.\n\nThe field is different now and it's harder to break free of the pack. Thanks to his one-sided annihilation of Errol Spence Jr. in July 2023, Crawford has joined the pantheon of welterweight greats that includes Sugar Ray Robinson and Sugar Ray Leonard. In 2021, Oleksandr Usyk became the first undisputed cruiserweight champ to ascend to heavyweight king since Evander Holyfield. These are massive accomplishments.\n\nSo what can Inoue do to re-establish himself as the best fighter in the world regardless of weight class? The Sporting News takes a look at the pound-for-pound landscape.\n\nThe one area where Inoue excels over his peers is activity. Since the beginning of this decade, \"The Monster\" has gone 7-0 and he's picked up two undisputed championships.\n\nWhile Crawford and Usyk have also posted career-defining triumphs, they haven't been as busy. Usyk has gone 4-0, though it must be said that the Ukrainian hero's inactivity has been largely due to the war in his homeland. Crawford has also gone 4-0 since the beginning of 2020.\n\nIf Inoue batters Luis Nery on May 6 in Tokyo, then he will have doubled his pound-for-pound counterparts in terms of activity. Nery is arguably the biggest threat available at 122 pounds, so this is a solid opponent that Inoue is facing.\n\nFor my money, should Inoue defeat Nery emphatically, then he's the new pound-for-pound king.\n\nMORE: SN's Top 12 best pound for pound boxers\n\nJust 12 days after Inoue has punch swapped with Nery, we'll have the first undisputed heavyweight title fight in a quarter of a century.\n\nIf Oleksandr Usyk were to overcome Tyson Fury's size and physicality to win the undisputed title in boxing's glamour division, then it will be almost impossible to deny him. This is the type of feat that epitomizes pound-for-pound.\n\nUsyk would have to do the job in style - a controversial decision would not be enough - but the reigning unified champ has aces up his sleeve if he wins the richest prize in sport on May 18.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Jones_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roy Jones Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Usyk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oleksandr Usyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Weight class (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonito_Donaire", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nonito Donaire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Spence_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Errol Spence Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Ray_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sugar Ray Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Ray_Leonard", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sugar Ray Leonard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiserweight_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cruiserweight (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Holyfield", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evander Holyfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2022-12/Naoya%20Inoue%20Paul%20Butler%20four%20belts%20131222%20%282%29.jpg?itok=60GKIVGx", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 1952, "textEnd": 1957}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 2856, "textEnd": 2862}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Why pound-for-pound boxer rankings could shift in 2024", "body": "As Japanese powerhouse Naoya Inoue gears up to face hard-hitting southpaw Luis Nery at the Tokyo Dome on May 6, fight fans the world over will once again debate the undisputed super bantamweight champ's pound-for-pound standing.\n\nOftentimes choosing your best pound-for-pound fighter is the same as choosing your favorite color or restaurant. It's down to preference. For the best part of a decade, Floyd Mayweather was regarded as the best boxer in the world regardless of weight class. However, if you offered that opinion to a Manny Pacquiao fan, they'd be sure to disagree - strongly.\n\nWATCH: Naoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery, exclusively on ESPN+\n\nIn today's pound-for-pound debate, fans and experts are split between Inoue and welterweight champ Terence Crawford.\n\nSimply put, they don't come much better than Inoue and Crawford. The Sporting News takes a look at Team Inoue's case for \"The Monster\" being the best fighter in the world today:\n\nInoue's brilliance can't be understated after moving up in weight in 2023 to dominate a fourth weight class.\n\nAnd yet at this moment, according to both The Sporting News and The Ring, Terence Crawford is recognized as the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world.\n\nIn July 2023, \"Bud\" scored a dominant ninth-round stoppage win over Errol Spence Jr. to emerge as the undisputed welterweight champion. The American turned in a sensational performance in a superfight that was years in the making and improved his record to 40-0 (31 KOs).\n\nInoue (26-0, 23 KOs) also had a banner year, stopping both Stephen Fulton and Marlon Tapales to become undisputed super bantamweight champ. However, the magnitude of Crawford's win gave him the edge over the Japanese superstar.\n\nAt this moment, Inoue campaigns at super bantamweight (122 pounds), which is his fourth weight class. Right now, Crawford is positioning himself to move north to super welterweight (154 pounds), which will also be his fourth weight class.\n\nBottom line: Crawford is the much bigger man and a fight between the pair is completely unrealistic.\n\nMORE: SN's Top-12 best pound-for-pound boxers\n\nThere's every chance that Inoue could become pound-for-pound No. 1 if he defeats Nery. The Mexican southpaw is a world-class operator and arguably the biggest threat in the division.\n\nIf Crawford has a flaw it's inactivity, which is the reason why a lot of fans view Inoue as the pound-for-pound king. Should \"The Monster\" win on May 6, that would be his third victory in 18 months. Meanwhile, Crawford will only have fought Spence in that space of time.\n\nThe other threat to pound-for-pound supremacy is Oleksandr Usyk. The Ukrainian technician takes on Tyson Fury in Saudi Arabia on May 18. If Usyk wins, he'll become the first former undisputed cruiserweight champion to become undisputed heavyweight champion since Evander Holyfield accomplished the feat in 1990.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Weight class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_for_pound", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pound for pound"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terence Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Mayweather_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floyd Mayweather Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southpaw_stance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southpaw stance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Welterweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Pacquiao", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manny Pacquiao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fulton_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Fulton (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Tapales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marlon Tapales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Spence_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Errol Spence Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Ring (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexicans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mexicans"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleksandr_Usyk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oleksandr Usyk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruiserweight_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cruiserweight (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evander_Holyfield", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evander Holyfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyson_Fury", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyson Fury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heavyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_middleweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Light middleweight"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Gyms", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2023-12/Naoya%20Inoue.jpg?itok=IEqVQucS", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 105, "textEnd": 110, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-18", "textStart": 2685, "textEnd": 2691}], "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Inoue is a once-in-a-generation fighter.\n\n\"It's why the guy is packing out stadiums in Japan, why he has such a huge following globally and why whenever he takes a world title fight, it's something the whole world tunes in for.\n\n\"The aura he has at the moment, the fighter you compare him to is Manny Pacquiao.

Yet Inoue, 31, has won his last seven fights via KO, and he is predicted to improve that run here.\n\nHere's all you need to know.

It is like you've said a code word in a sect that triggers happy vibes and releases dopamine for those who can hear.\n\nEven trainer Dave Coldwell, whose fighter Jamie McDonnell was ruined in a round in Japan back in 2018, can't help himself when you say the name.\n\n\"Oh, what a fighter,\" Coldwell replies, when told that is what the forthcoming discussion will be about.\n\nIt was involuntary; a reflex. The \"Monster'' lurks in our subconscious, ready to pounce on command.\n\nThat is what he's due to do on Monday (May 6) night, on Mexican Luis Nery. The 29-year-old who challenges for Inoue's second full set of belts - now at super bantamweight - having previously won the lot at bantamweight, has been here before. In fact, Nery wasn't supposed to be coming back to Japan.\n\nLast year, the Japanese Boxing Commission suspended Nery from boxing here. Initially, Nery tested positive following his 2017 fourth-round win over Shinsuke Yamanaka, but the final straw came when he returned to these shores and then didn't make the weight for their rematch, when he beat Yamanaka in two frames.\n\nNery was banned for life, and one might wonder what he is doing back here until you see who is in the opposite corner. Perhaps it is thought that the punishment of stepping into the ring with the ferocious Japanese gunslinger is a harsher punishment than being banished.\n\nLike Nery will be on Monday, Coldwell was in the opposite corner almost six years ago with Doncaster's decent former two-time bantamweight champion. Inoue was moving up in weight, having won belts at light-flyweight and super-flyweight, and some believed McDonell - who'd acquitted himself well to win the IBF title against Julio Ceja before winning the vacant WBA title and defending it five times, including two wins in the U.S. over Tomoki Kameda - might present Inoue with a headache or two.\n\nThe McDonnell camp hoped they could take the smaller man - Inoue was moving up in weight, remember - into the deeper waters. Inoue was 15-0, but as photos emerged of a gaunt McDonnell barely, somehow, making weight, it soon became a one-horse race. It lasted a minute and 52 seconds.\n\n\"It's going back a long time now,\" sighed Coldwell. \"Don't forget, he [Inoue]'s progressed more, so much since where he was when we fought him. You look at the people he's been in the ring with, the fighters that he's beaten since. He's a completely different fighter and the body of work is completely different to where we were. If you look at before Jamie, you'd probably say that without being disrespectful - and Jamie's a very underrated fighter - he'd not been in with anyone of Jamie's calibre, I don't think.\n\n\"He'd been in with good fighters, don't get me wrong, and I don't want it to come across that I was dismissive of him. What I saw was him as this absolute monster, but he'd had a couple of tougher nights. I think people that had gone down to the body had some success with him, but I felt coming up to the weight, if Jamie could establish his reach advantage and his boxing smarts, then he could control that.\n\n\"And Inoue did sometimes lunge in a little bit - back then. Now, since the fight with Jamie, you've got to look at the list of fighters he's fought and everyone's been outstanding and he's developed into a hell of a fighter, a pound for pounder. At that stage, he wasn't a pound for pounder. He was this monster that's coming out of Japan...\"\n\nHe is still the \"Monster\", and if the deep pockets and allure of Saudi Arabia reach for him, then perhaps he will be coming out of Japan. Inoue's last six outings have all been at home, since two pandemic fights in the U.S.\n\nWhile Top Rank president Todd duBoef wants Inoue to box in the USA for selfish reasons, financially he doesn't need to move a muscle. Inoue is doing just fine in Japan.\n\nThat said, it is not as if Inoue needs the comforts of home comforts. Coldwell rated Inoue highly when he had to train someone to fight him, but he sees a much-improved and more rounded boxer today.\n\n\"What I was looking at in preparation [for McDonnell] to what he [Inoue] are now are two different fighters; two different bodies of work,\" acknowledged Coldwell. \"He's been in with so many different, high-grade opponents whereas back then he was in with solid opponents but nobody that jumps out and grabs you.\n\n\"He'd had a couple of fights where I felt he'd just had a little reaction off bodyshots, I can't remember who it was but the kid just caught him with a shot or a couple of shots downstairs - it was a game fighter - it was a tough fight, and Inoue just stopped punching for about 30 seconds. From being all-out attack, he just stopped punching, he gathered his thoughts and got himself together and it was one of those when, going into a fight, you can look at that and go, 'Hmm. Did he feel that?' 'Is that the reason why he stopped punching?'\"\n\nSadly for the Englishman, any hope for McDonnell turned out to be false, but Inoue has not looked back. The \"Monster\" has munched on 26 opponents, ending 23 of his bouts early and often viciously.\n\nThe world-class fighter has, according to Coldwell, earned his elite stripes since, and then some.\n\n\"Sometimes, back then, you're looking at possible weaknesses but actually as a fighter develops, you see they [the weaknesses] aren't there any longer. When you see the bombs he took off [Nonito] Donaire, to see that... to go with his power, and his boxing IQ, and his skills, he's a tough motherfucker, too.\n\n\"Whereas back then you don't know that, so you look at him when you're preparing and think, 'Maybe we can grind him down, down the stretch. If you can control the early rounds, target the body and maybe grind him down, but obviously things are different in real life.\"\n\nInoue is not living a real life to the rest of us. As Coldwell says, things far from stopped for him after McDonnell, instead, he tipped the gradient up on the treadmill and started running faster.\n\nInoue, now 31, won the World Boxing Super Series with a two-round annihilation of Emmanuel Rodriguez, then shared a Fight of the Decade contender with Donaire before blitzing the Filipino in a rematch. Inoue then unified at bantamweight, stepped up and beat the top dog (Stephen Fulton) at super bantam, became undisputed again (a weight up) by stopping Marlon Tapales, and now we're here, with Nery staying at a hotel a stone's throw from the venue, ready to kick the door down and spoil the party.\n\nNot for Coldwell, who sees Inoue negating the southpaw puncher, doing well with his right hand to retain the titles.\n\nIt is Inoue's mindset that particularly impresses Coldwell. Inoue is regularly seeking out tough and dangerous opposition.\n\n\"Unbelievable,\" praises Coldwell once more. \"Unbelievable mentality, ability, IQ, toughness, punching power, shot selection, you've only got to look at the attitude. He steps up in weight, doesn't look for a marking time fight, or a fight where he's just going to find his way into the division. He goes straight in against the best and that just shows you the level of confidence and ability the man's got. Stepping up and fighting Stephen Fulton right away, things like that you look at it and think, 'Wow. This guy's unreal'.\"\n\nColdwell thinks Inoue might only come undone when he tries to claim one weight division too far, trying to add to his already legendary status as the fighter who is already being heralded as the finest fighter Japan has produced.\n\n\"It's not about being greedy,\" Coldwell explains. \"It's about truly trying to find out how good you are. That's the difference. I don't think that's greed. That's the absolute pinnacle of elite mentality where you're not going to be satisfied with just being The Man in your division. Once you've conquered the best in your division, let's see if we can do it again.\n\n\"Sooner or later, you run into that guy that's just that bit too big.\"\n\nThe very mention of the Japanese icon's name has a similar effect on Joe Gallagher, who trained Liverpool's Paul Butler to face Inoue at the close of 2022. Butler was derided for being too negative, but he lasted until the 11th before Inoue broke him down with bodyshots.\n\n\"Inoue, yeah,\" the Manchester coach lamented, when asked to think back to the fight and the camp with Butler.\n\n\"It's one of them, like when we fought [Vasiliy] Lomachenko with [Anthony] Crolla, they're the type of guys you come away from after the event and think, 'They're just on a different level' and you know you've been in with someone right at the top of the game.\"\n\nLike Coldwell, Gallagher drew up a strategy although, by that stage in Inoue's career, the coach was all too aware that Butler was going in with someone very special.\n\n\"For Inoue, we'd had good sparring, we'd trained well, we'd worked on certain things and it paid off to an extent, and there were times that we got through, let our shots go and land, and they didn't have an effect, and you think, 'Okay, here we go now.'\n\n\"I thought we did a good job. Although Paul got a lot of criticism for the negativity, what were people expecting? Paul to go out and have a Hagler-Hearns three-round shootout with him? It wasn't just a case of going out and trying to nullify him, stop him getting his shots off, frustrate him and counterpunch him, catch him on the way in.\n\n\"Paul countered with the left hook, which worked well at times, we were always aware of Inoue's right hand. I always felt you have to keep your feet moving with him, if you sat there like Donaire did - second time, anyway - you're getting caught clean.\"\n\nOf course, there are plenty who didn't appreciate or condone Butler's tactics, of doing everything he could to keep his head attached to his shoulders, and Gallagher explained what he felt might be someone's keys to victory against Inoue. One day.\n\n\"I think feet and movement, you've got to frustrate him and then, when he's frustrated, he gambles a little bit but you've got to 1) be able to carry the power and 2) hit more than once or twice, and sustain that a little bit.\n\n\"Against Tapales, that kid had some success in parts, he stayed there and he hit the body well and he did good. But it's [can you] keep that up, and whether you want to go into the eye of the storm and continue getting hit with those hard shots. You could see Tapales had good success, but he broke out [of working inside] first instead of staying there and making Inoue come out first of the exchanges.\"\n\n\"Success in Parts\" is damn near a victory if you're paired with Inoue and, like Coldwell, Gallagher has seen Inoue grow through the years, becoming the man who, along with Terence Crawford and Oleksandr Usyk, has the best claim for the pound-for-pound throne.\n\nGallagher and Butler were treated well in Japan. It was not your typical bout in the blue corner, where you are given the run around and have to deal with stressful situations to the point of distraction. Instead, Gallagher said things ran like clockwork, the details were meticulous, the promotion was slick and the audience was polite.\n\n\"I think the crowd is very good,\" Gallagher recalled. \"They were cheering and singing. They're quite reserved, there's polite applause, but when Inoue lands, there's an awful roar. And they chant, and they shout and everything else. Every time Inoue lands, there'll be a big roar, I'll tell you that much.\"\n\nAnd on Monday night, the \"Monster\" is looking to roar once more and only the na\u00efve would stand there and go toe-to-toe with him, but it appears the options are fight or flight, and either way he will catch up with you.\n\n\"People say Paul ran all the time but the game plan was to frustrate him, try and rob some rounds,\" Gallagher went on, \"and then, if we were involved in a shootout, we'd be able to land some good shots and some telling shots. [But] Inoue took them, and then kept on coming, and eventually he caught up with Paul in the 11th with a bodyshot.\"\n\nColdwell is calling it a mid-to-late stoppage of Nery, who is a +600 second favorite, and those odds are far from slender unless you're lifting a page out of the book of possibly the biggest underdog in all of sport, James \"Buster\" Douglas.\n\nThirty-four years ago, at this very arena, Douglas faced down the imperious monster of the heavyweight division, \"Iron\" Mike Tyson, and handed him the first defeat of his career and arguably one he never fully recovered from.\n\nLore has it that Douglas was a 42/1 underdog, which is said to be a myth, but one thing that is not is a myth is that several Las Vegas sportsbooks didn't even create a line for Douglas, due to lack of interest.\n\nNo one expects Nery to win here. People are in Tokyo to witness a modern great, a destructive force, the hottest ticket in town.", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BoxingScene.com"}, "authors": [],

The Japanese living legend appears unchallenged at 122 pounds, and he could potentially move up to 126 and run the table uncontested as well. Many thought Inoue would at least face some resistance against Stephen Fulton when he entered the division -- mainly due to Fulton's slickness -- but Inoue truly looks unstoppable. That doesn't bode well for Nery, especially as he may have a target on his back.\n\nA few years back, Nery gained infamy in Japan for his two dubious victories over the long-reigning 118-pound champion Yamanaka. Nery was flagged for testing positive for a trace amount of a banned substance in the first fight and came in three pounds over the limit in the rematch.\n\nNery won by knockout both times, lowering his profile as a whole, including an indefinite ban from the Japanese Boxing Commission that was lifted for this fight. Though Nery made the jump to 122 pounds, he was mauled and stopped by Brandon Figueroa and hasn't looked as strong as he did when draining down to 118.\n\nNery is a punch magnet, and he opts to fight as an aggressor thanks to the size advantages he's enjoyed in the lighter divisions. He and Inoue are roughly the same size, and giving Inoue any sort of opening is disastrous. I wouldn't doubt Inoue comes into this fight wanting to make an example of Nery, and unless he suffers a cut in the early rounds or walks into a wicked shot from nowhere, he'll do just that in a painful exhibition of his skill and power.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Fulton_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Fulton (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Figueroa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Figueroa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/a79aacc8-be45-4815-8e7c-76a7ad246838.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Still, Japan allowed him back for a grudge rematch with Yamanaka. But when he came in three pounds overweight, it was deemed a cardinal sin. Worse followed for Japanese fight fans when Nery dispatched Yamanaka in half the time in their return.\n\nNow Nery is back, and he has taken this week in his stride, looking every inch the bad guy; designer clothes, thick black shades, and an all-too confident swagger. He's loved playing the part, even if the build-up has been mostly respectful since both fighters arrived in Tokyo.\n\nThe weigh-in saw a heated staredown, but it never threatened to boil over.\n\n\"I like being called the bad guy, but I like to have fun also,\" Nery explained. \"I can be a bad guy outside the ring, but I have to be in the ring, too. The suspension was nothing serious. At the end of the day, the fight was going to sell no matter what. They're never going to find a fighter that is going to fill the Tokyo Dome like I will. It doesn't matter who Inoue fights; they're not going to fill the Tokyo Dome without me.\"\n\nNery is embracing his part in this week's huge event, one that has captured the imagination of fight fans in Japan and much, much further afield.\n\n\"It feels great because there hasn't been a show here [at the Tokyo Dome, when another substantial underdog, Buster Douglas, drilled Mike Tyson] in 34 years, and being in the main event, it's a great feeling being here.\"\n\nNery's team has this week spoken of his renewed dedication. The 29-year-old southpaw is 35-1 (27 KOs), a two-time champion and he has doubled down making sure he is ready for the \"Monster\".\n\n\"Pantera\" admits he is seeing a lot of things differently now than did several years ago.\n\n\"I changed a lot of things. The things I changed were outside the ring,\" he said. \"I changed the way I eat, my discipline, my training. Everything.\"\n\nNery's body, neck and face lie under an increasingly thick blanket of tattoos. There is a symbol on his left cheek that represents the surname of his wife and daughter, and Nery said: \"All of the tattoos are important, there's a story behind all of them.\"\n\nAnd now the countdown clock is ticking and we are hours away from Nery's big chance, perhaps his last big chance in this country, and he has looked certain of himself and his mission all week. Nery is also not buying wholly into the Inoue hype. Asked if Inoue was the best he has faced in his career, Nery admitted Inoue has \"the best style.\"", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BoxingScene.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Yamanaka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Yamanaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heel_(professional_wrestling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Heel (professional wrestling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Underdog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southpaw_stance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southpaw stance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buster_Douglas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buster Douglas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantera", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pantera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tyson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tattoo"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.boxingscene.com/uploads/Luis%20Nery%20Camp%20Photos%201.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The 55,000-capacity Tokyo Dome has not hosted boxing since 1990 but is somewhat synonymous with the sport on account of what went down there almost three-and-a-half decades ago.\n\nJames 'Buster' Douglas, a 42-1 underdog, famously beat up and got off the canvas to stop Mike Tyson and win the world heavyweight title. In terms of nights where he kept his teeth to himself, it remains the most infamous of Iron Mike's career.\n\nWATCH: Naoya Inoue vs. Luis Nery, exclusively on ESPN+\n\nNowadays, Tyson is all in as a member of the Inoue fan club. In a 2023 episode of his podcast HotBoxin', the heavyweight great lavished praise on \"The Monster\".\n\n\"He [Inoue] is a mean son of a b****. He don't look like much, but he's better than Manny Pacquiao,\" Tyson said.\n\nThe Pacquiao comparison instantly set tongues wagging and it came before Inoue's clinical rampage through the super bantamweight division. As he prepares to walk out at a venue fit for a true great, it's too tantalising not to ponder the fantasy matchup Tyson invoked.\n\nThere are so many imponderables and intangibles but, one thing for sure, there wouldn't be any 42-1 outsider in this fight.\n\nPacquiao's status as one of the finest boxers of the 21st century largely rests upon his exploits in little higher up the divisions, particularly his run at welterweight when he became a mainstream pound-for-pound star.\n\nBut Pacquiao's incredible resume saw him rack up titles across eight divisions, starting down at flyweight. Inoue is now a four-weight champion across light flyweight, super flyweight, bantamweight and super bantam, reigning as undisputed across the latter two.\n\nMORE: Will Naoya Inoue become pound-for-pound No. 1 if he beats Luis Nery?\n\nIn part, this week feels like a time to ponder a mythic showdown with Pacquiao because of the division where Inoue now rules. 'Pacman' made his US debut at super bantamweight in 2001 and produced a sensational performance on the undercard of Oscar De La Hoya's WBC super welterweight challenge against Javier Castillejo, unseating IBF champion Lehlo Ledwaba.\n\nEntering the ring as a late replacement for Enrique Sanchez and a clear betting underdog, Pacquiao was ferocious and overwhelmed Ledwaba, decking him with a left hand in round two and dropping him twice more to stop him in the sixth.\n\nHe made four defences of his 122lbs title before stepping up to beat Marco Antonio Barrera at featherweight -- the start of Pacquiao's true legacy-building phase and an incredible series of fights against Barrera, Erik Morales and his greatest rival Juan Manuel Marquez.\n\nThat's how the story of Pacquiao the Hall of Famer begins, but how would Pacquiao the 23-year-old tearaway fare against Inoue and his liquidising punch power?\n\nThe fight would surely see both men fighting fire with fire, while deploying their arsenal in very different ways. Pacquiao's incredible skills, speed and volume could threaten to overwhelm the more methodical Inoue during the first half of the contest. The Japanese hero's thrilling first bout with Nonito Donaire and his fleeting struggles with Tapales' mid-round footwork last time out would be points of encouragement for their illustrious countryman.\n\nIn some respects, it's easy to envisage the version of Pacquiao who went on to halt Barrera and Morales dishing out some of the same pain to Inoue, but if we're talking knockouts we're in The Monster's house.\n\nOnly three of Inoue's 25 professional opponents have heard the final bell. The most recent of those, Donaire, was ruthlessly dispatched within two rounds of their rematch. There are fighters who carry damaging, fight-ending power. Pacquiao was certainly one of those. Then you have true rarities like Inoue with otherworldly means of destruction in their fists.\n\nInoue's power looms over this fantasy fight. Pacquiao had suffered two knockout losses by the time he took down Ledwaba, having boiled perilously down to flyweight for too long. Unheralded Filipino Rustico Torrecampo rendered Manny briefly unconscious with an overhand left that was compounded by the fighters colliding on his follow-through. Bonsai Sangsurat wrecked Pacquiao with a body shot.\n\nThe super bantamweight version of Pacquiao was brilliant and would represent a significant step up compared to the elite opposition Inoue has conquered. But he was a little wilder in those days and Inoue's knockout capabilities sometimes means his ringcraft and sublime technique go under the radar.\n\nIf that side of his game was on point he could ride out the Pacquiao storm. Inoue, that mean son of a b**** would then land telling blows on a man who had shown he could be stopped at that stage of his career.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news",

Let's get it on.\"\n\nIn the chief support, Yoshiki Takei was taken the distance for the first time as a professional and won the WBO bantamweight title on the scorecards against Jason Moloney.\n\nMoloney (27-3, 19 KOs) had little answer to the heavy-handed Takei (9-0, 8 KOs) early on, but the champion inched into the contest, and the home favourite understandably faded late on.\n\nThe 27-year-old southpaw still had enough to see the final bell, where he won by two scores of 116-111, and a third at 117-110.\n\nThere was further Inoue success on the card, as Takuma Inoue kept the WBA bantamweight title, getting off the deck to record a wide points win over Sho Ishida.\n\nA swift shot on the counter had Inoue (20-1, 5 KOs) on the floor in the opening round, but Ishida (34-4, 17 KOs) failed to take advantage of the early success, and Inoue largely dominated to get the win by two scores of 118-109, and a third at 116-111.\n\nSeigo Yuri Akui retained his WBA flyweight title, as he took a clear points win against Taku Kuwahara (13-2, 8 KOs) in a breathless encounter.\n\nAkui (20-2-1, 11 KOs) kept his belt by two scores of 117-111, and a third at 118-110.\n\nTJ Doheny (26-4, 20 KOs) continued the Indian Summer to his career, as the former world champion upset Bryl Bayogos (7-1-1, 2 KOs), taking a fourth round stoppage win in their super bantamweight meeting

That's the real difference.\n\nSuper bantamweight has limited fighters with marginal ability, but four lbs up, that's where the true class exists. It seems obvious that Inoue doesn't want to take the risk of fighting those high-level fighters at featherweight; Hence, he chooses to stay at super bantamweight, where it's safer.\n\nButler would have liked to have seen 'Monster' Inoue (27-0, 24 KOs) move up to featherweight after he captured the undisputed super bantamweight championship in his previous fight, but Naoya knows \"deep down' that it would be different up there.\n\nI think it's obvious it would be VERY different at featherweight for Inoue, as he would have to face fighters that would not only potentially beat him, but knock him out and dim his star power. Obviously, staying where it's safe at super bantamweight is one way for Naoya to avoid that terrible outcome.\n\nButler: Inoue Knows \"Deep Down\"\n\n\"Eventually, size will beat him, and that's the case with Loma. You're treating greatness that much that eventually size will become a big part in the fight,\" said Paul Butler to Secondsout, talking about why Naoya Inoue won't move up four pounds to featherweight to compete in that division.\n\nSize would eventually catch up to Inoue if he moved up to 130 and 135, but NOT at 126. Inoue is as big as featherweight champions Luis Alberto Lopez and Raymond Ford.\n\nInoue would obviously be too small for champions Rey Vargas and Rafael Espinoza in terms of height. However, Inoue has beaten tall fighters before, like 5'10\" Jamie McDonnell. So, height shouldn't be an excuse for Inoue not moving up to 126.\n\nStaying Safe vs. Testing Limits\n\n\"He knows that himself deep down that size could play a part because that's why he's staying at super bantamweight,\" Butler said about Inoue. \"He holds all the belts there. What point is it to take a big risk and going up to featherweight?\"\n\nThe point is that if Inoue moves up to featherweight, his popularity will increase if hie beats the more talented fighters in that weight class rather than staying at super bantamweight and having no one compelling to fight. That's the difference.\n\nTonight, Inoue brought his IBF 122-lb mandatory Sam Goodman into the ring after his win over Nery to let the fans know who he intends to fight next in September. The unheralded Goodman, an Australian fighter with no power, is completely unknown.

Ahead of the match, Nery stated:\n\nWe're looking for Naoya Inoue; we think it is a big fight, and [I] think I will finish him.\"\n\nLuis Esteban Nery Hern\u00e1ndez is a Mexican professional boxer who was born on December 12, 1994, in Tijuana, Mexico. He is currently 29 years old and competes in the Bantamweight and Super bantamweight weight-class. The Mexican boxer has a Southpaw stance, and is a two-weight world champion. Throughout his career, Luis has held the WBC and Ring magazine bantamweight titles between 2017 and 2018. He was also the WBC super bantamweight title holder from 2020 to May 2021.\n\nLuis Nery stands at a height of 5 ft 5 in (165 cm) and roughly weighs around 122 pounds (55kg). He boasts a reach of 65 inches and is a Christian by religion.\n\nLuis Nery is also known by the nickname 'Pantera'.\n\nLuis Nery has an impressive fight record of 35-1 with 17 wins via knockout.\n\nLuis Nery started out his professional boxing career in May 2012, before winning 23 straight fights (17 knockout wins) to challenge for a world title against unbeaten Japanese hero Shinsuke Yamanaka, who held the WBC and Ring Magazine bantamweight titles. The pair faced off in an exciting bout on August 15, 2017, where Nery battered Yamanaka under four rounds.\n\nHowever, the win was shrouded in controversy after Nery tested positive for zilpaterol (a banned substance) in a pre-fight test just over a week after the win. As a result, 'The Ring' stripped Nery of their title and reinstated Yamanaka as champion. However, the WBC accepted the fighter's explanation that he had mistakenly ingested contaminated food and allowed him to retain their title.\n\nDuring the rematch with Yamanaka in March 2018, Nery shockingly came in three pounds over the bantamweight limit and eventually lost the WBC title on the scales. Despite this, Yamanaka went through with the fight and subsequently lost in just two rounds. The Japanese Boxing Commission, however, retaliated against Nery's conduct and banned him from competing in Japan for life.\n\nFollowing this scandal, Nery went on to win four stoppage wins before moving up to compete for the vacant WBC super bantamweight title. On September 26, 2020, Nery managed to beat Aaron Alameda to become a two-weight world champion. However, Luis Nery's success was short-lived as he competed in a unification matchup against WBO counterpart Brandon Figueroa in his next fight. Nery was stopped in seven rounds, recording his first defeat so far. He has since won four fights, three by stoppage, and will now face off against Naoya Inoue, for which the Japanese Boxing Commission agreed to lift the challenger's ban.\n\nNotably, Luis Nery's next opponent, Naoya Inoue, is a Japanese professional boxer who was born on April 10, 1993. He stands at a height of 5-5 and has a reach of 67 \u00bd inches. Throughout his career, he has obtained a fight record of 26-0 with 23 wins via knockout.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsgrail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsGrail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Professional boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Yamanaka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Yamanaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ring_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The Ring (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN+", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tijuana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tijuana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tijuana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilpaterol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zilpaterol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southpaw_stance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southpaw stance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Figueroa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Figueroa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Organization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Boxers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/thesportsgrail.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Boxing-stock.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 282, "textEnd": 287}, {"amb": false, "date": "1994-12-12", "textStart": 727, "textEnd": 744}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-15", "textStart": 1711, "textEnd": 1726}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-09-26", "textStart": 2688, "textEnd": 2706}, {"amb": false, "date": "1993-04-10", "textStart": 3265, "textEnd": 3279}, {"amb": false, "date": "2012-05-", "textStart": 1469, "textEnd": 1477}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 2205, "textEnd": 2215}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Inoue is, for many, either the best or second-best fighter in the world, along with Terence Crawford, and he is 26-0. Twenty-three victims have been battered into defeat or knocked out. He is also, for even more, the most terrifying puncher in the sport.\n\nInoue fought a 10-rounder in just his third fight, won the Japanese light flyweight title in his fourth and his first world title in sixth, stopping Adrian Hernandez in six rounds.\n\nIn 2014, at 7-0, he bombed out tricky Argentine veteran Omar Narvaez, then 43-1-2 in just two rounds, becoming the first man to stop Narvaez and only the second man to defeat him after Nonito Donaire had managed it in 2011.\n\nIf Inoue hadn't been on the radar before, he was by then. But you could be forgiven for a slow introduction.\n\nInoue was a good amateur with a reported 75-6 record, managing almost 50 stoppages, and we might have heard more about him had it not been for decorated Cuban Yosvany Veitia, who defeated Inoue in the World Youth Championships in 2010 and again at the World Amateur Championships in 2011. And Inoue's Olympic dream faded in the 2012 Asian qualifiers when he lost to Kazakh Birzhan Zhakypov, who lost to eventual gold medallist Zou Shiming.\n\nBut Inoue promptly put that disappointment behind him, called himself the \"Monster\", turned pro in October 2012, and then set about one of the most destructive runs in the history of the lighter weight classes. More than that, he has become one of the hottest commodities in global sport, is an idol in Japan, feared and respected in boxing and on Monday (May 6) night, will sell out the Tokyo Dome, fighting in front of 55,000 against Mexican Luis Nery in what has been labelled the biggest fight in Japanese boxing history.\n\nAs far as tidal waves go, Inoue is riding the absolute crest of one.\n\nYuriko Miyata is a California-based boxing journalist who has been writing for Japanese Boxing magazine for 27 years and she has covered Inoue's career since 2014.\n\n\"He was already famous when he made his pro debut because he started his career as an interesting prospect, so already he was standing out,\" she says.\n\n\"I didn't know that he would be this big. It's hard to compare but he's as big a sports star next to [Shohei] Ohtani, the baseball player [who plays for the L.A. Dodgers].\"\n\nMiyata believes Inoue's popularity skyrocketed after he won the World Boxing Super Series in 2019, whether it was the two-round destruction of the previously-unbeaten Emmanuel Rodriguez in May or the Fight of the Decade-type encounter with Filipino legend Nonito Donaire six months later.\n\n\"Before that, I think they struggled to sell some of the tickets, but after that, I don't know what happened,\" says Riyata.\n\nSo was it how Inoue fights, or was it his personality? Or was it just that the knockouts that were coming thick and very fast?\n\n\"That's a big thing,\" Miyata smiles. \"I think that's the biggest.\"\n\nShe also reckons the increase in weight has helped the four-division champion, that he had struggled to make 108lbs and 115lbs, so we never saw the best of him there and, from 118 upwards, he has become more explosive.\n\nBut Miyata also states that Inoue has become a better talker, and that has coincided with his rise to stardom.\n\nShe, too, scoffs at the notion that Inoue needs to fight outside of Japan to further grow his brand.\n\n\"I was thinking about that,\" Miyata adds. \"I moved to Los Angeles because I thought America was the center of boxing. But now I think, as people say, the center is everywhere in the world, not only America, so he can create his mecca here.\"\n\nJapanese boxing historian Joe Koizumi has witnessed so much of this sport, but even he has seen nothing like Inoue. Koizumi was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2008 and the 77-year-old ranks Inoue as the country's greatest fighter.\n\n\"Inoue is a superstar, everybody knows Inoue and this is a very big show, so people are paying attention to this superfight,\" says Koizumi.\n\n\"The reason why Inoue is so famous is first because of his record. He has unified in two divisions and that was reported in all the big newspapers and the coverage of Inoue's achievements has been bigger and bigger and he's become a household name.\"\n\nKoizumi, however, also believes Inoue's character and personality has made him a magnet for brands and fans alike.\n\n\"He's a family man,\" Koizumi continues. \"He is married already, he has children, there's no scandal. He is a very straight person. Look, his father [Shingo] is his trainer, his younger brother [Takuma] is also a world champions. Inoue is surrounded by his family and he's very diligent in his training.\"\n\nAnd while Koizumi does not believe Inoue needs to fight anywhere else, to either enhance his reputation or his bank balance, he feels Inoue is a fine representative for the country on the world stage.\n\n\"In his divisions, there are no strong, competitive opponents there so Inoue has no need to go to the United States,\" assesses Koizumi. \"Also, in Japan, because this fight is being held in Japan, Inoue can get this great amount of money. We don't think Inoue can get as much money or more money if he fights in the United States.\"\n\nAsked about the possibility of Inoue being part of the Saudi Arabia investment into boxing, Koizumi says: \"Oh yes. He is willing to go there. We are happy to see Inoue is making great achievements outside of Japan and it is great news that there could be a hero fighting in Saudi Arabia, like Tyson Fury or Oleksandr Usyk [on May 18]. Inoue has become a worldwide superstar.\"\n\nKoizumi was here in Tokyo in February 1990, helping as an interpreter for then heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, who was in town preparing to face an unheralded challenger named James \"Buster\" Douglas.\n\nThe Tokyo Dome had opened just two years earlier and, when Tyson met Douglas, the idea was for Tyson to deliver a clean-cut KO, not be on the wrong end of one of sport's greatest upsets, groggily fumbling for his mouthpiece to the shock and amazement of just about everyone, bar Douglas.\n\n\"At the time, people just came to see the opening of the Tokyo Dome,\" recalls Koizumi. \"Also, they wanted to see the monster 'Iron' Mike. It was a big, big successful show. But this time, it's because of Inoue's popularity, people are coming and they will fill 55,000 in the Tokyo Dome.\"\n\nThe culture of boxing in Japan is respectful and efficient. Today's weigh-in for five fights was completed in 20 minutes, with no music and polite applause after a boxer made weight. There has been no smack talk, merely platitudes about great camps, mutual respect and good opportunities.\n\nNery has gone along with that this time, but there is a stain on his reputation that has made this fight especially enormous commercially.\n\nAfter Nery fought Shinsuke Yamanaka in Japan in August 2017, the Mexican tested positive for a banned substance having stopped the Japanese fighter in four rounds. When they brought Nery back for Yamanaka to gain a measure of revenge several months later, Nery came in overweight and this time blasted Yamanaka out in two.\n\nNery was promptly banned by the Japanese Boxing Commission for bringing the sport into disrepute. They then dropped the suspension so Inoue could make him pay the penalty in public in front of thousands of fans.\n\n\"Luis Nery is a very ideal opponent,\" Koizumi continues. \"He has this bad reputation for coming in overweight against Yamanaka and in this country [coming in] overweight is a crime, so people hope to see Inoue punish bad boy Nery. Japan Boxing Commission responded to the people's demands of boxing people, and the promoter is one, to give Nery this punishment to fight Inoue.\"\n\nAlthough the five-fight bill features four world title fights, this is the Inoue show. That is no disrespect to the others in the line-up, merely an accurate reflection of the 31-year-old's starpower.\n\n\"I'm blown away,\" says promoter Lou DiBella, taking it all in. \"First of all, I love Japan. Second of all, [promoter Akihiko] Honda is, in my mind, the greatest promoter in the world.\n\n\"I've never known a man in boxing as well-respected by everyone in this industry as Honda, and if Honda is doing an event, the event is going to be first class. And now he has a superstar, this kid has aura.\n\n\"I've never seen a little fighter with the air about him that Inoue has. Manny [Pacquiao] was a quiet kid, a poor kid that came over. This kid looks like a J-pop Star, he's a good kid. He has an aura about him of stardom. He's one of the greatest fighters I've ever seen.\n\n\"Pound-for-pound, this might not only be the hardest puncher in boxing today, it's the hardest puncher I've ever seen. And when I think about fighters, you try to think, 'Who do you remember from the past and who've you seen tapes of at this weight that could beat this guy?' I don't know who beats this guy. I'm not talking about now; I'm talking about historically.\"\n\nDiBella understands there will be a thirst around the world to see Inoue box live. There is speculation that the Japanese megastar could head to Australia or Saudi Arabia in the near future, but for DiBella, sticking with Japan makes sense.\n\n\"He doesn't have to crack anywhere because people don't understand this, here, he is a superstar in one of the biggest, most powerful, economically strong countries in the world.\n\n\"His sponsorship income is unmatched by any fighter in the world. He makes more in sponsorship than most American fighters make in their purses. He's a king over here. If there's a reason to go anywhere, this guy's not afraid. He's fought in America already, but why would he leave here? He's about to fight in a sold-out Tokyo Dome.\"\n\nTop Rank works with Ohashi Promotions on Inoue fights, and with Teiken Promotions on the worldwide deal. Todd duBeof is one of a significant travelling Top Rank contingent on hand, not only to make sure everything passes off without incident, but to watch one of sport's biggest stars live.\n\n\"This is one of the reasons why I love coming to countries where we represent athletes we're a little disconnected [geographically] from,\" duBoef explains. \"When you get your feet on the ground, you get to hear from the locals, you get to hear from the people how big they are, how huge they are. And here they say him [Inoue] and Ohtani are running one and two, you can't pick, they're both that big.\"\n\nWhat would be a U.S equivalent?\n\n\"I think you're probably talking Michael Jordan in his day in this country,\" duBeof goes on. \"I think it's what the sport and the athlete represents at the time. It's hard to go back in time because basketball was huge with Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson and guys who were that good and that powerful, but I think universally at that time Michael Jordan was known as the greatest fighter on the planet. I think people would say Ohtani is the greatest baseball player on the planet and now Inoue is probably the best boxer on the planet. He's just that good. He's spectacular.\"\n\nAsked for a financial steer on Inoue's purses, an official could only say: \"It's staggering. His endorsements alone are staggering.\"\n\n\"You're talking Mike Tyson in his day, who everybody was after, so you're looking at that level, relative here,\" duBeof states, about how in-demand Inoue finds himself with sponsors.\n\n\"I think if you look at a metric of ticket sales; one thing is numbers and the other is amounts, and I can tell you that other than [Floyd] Mayweather and [Manny] Pacquiao that was an outlier, he [Inoue]'s delivering at the highest level with all the fighters that we've ever had and with the biggest fights in the United States and all over the world and the biggest MMA events, if it is was UFC 300, or Conor McGregor. He's at that level.\"\n\nTop Rank used to work with Japanese middleweight Ryota Murata. He was a commercial hit, advertised a stack of products, and Inoue has been able to seize that lucrative momentum.\n\nThis fight with Nery starts another partnership with Amazon Prime in Japan, too, who Top Rank worked with for Murata vs. Gennady Golovkin and the second Inoue fight with Donaire.\n\nInoue also fights on docomo - the mobile company - who show his fights on PPV outside of when he boxes on Prime.\n\nInside the ring, however, is where Inoue excels.\n\nFormer opponent Jason Moloney knows the sport inside out, has seen plenty on his travels and is the current WBO bantamweight champion. He was poleaxed by Inoue with one of the best punches of 2020, a crunching right hand.\n\n\"I think he's the most complete fighter and pound-for-pound the best fighter on the planet, and I don't see anyone beating him,\" says the Australian, who knew how high the stakes were if he could defeat Inoue in the Las Vegas Bubble in 2020.\n\n\"If I beat Naoya Inoue, I'm a superstar in the sport. So it was a high risk, high reward fight.\n\n\"He has incredible speed, incredible footwork, great control and distance, and extreme power. He's the full package. When I was trying to get close to him or trying to land my punches, his feet were just incredible at backing up and pulling you onto a counter. It's hard for you to be aggressive against him, and then he obviously backs his power up and just comes in so explosively.\n\n\"His first step's insanely fast but he's strong with those legs he explodes in off, and he's hard to see coming. It's not just power, it's a great mix of timing, speed and power. He's a very complete fighter.\"\n\nThis week, Moloney has been dubbed the \"Road Warrior\" for travelling into the fire for big fights. He says Inoue has no need to follow his path and leave these shores.\n\n\"Why would he leave Japan when you can see the magnitude of this event? He's a superstar over here.\"\n\nAsked how far Inoue could possibly go up in weight, Moloney takes a while to give it some thought. He smiled, possibly thinking of some outrageous matches, and then replies: \"Probably 130 [junior lightweight], but you've got to see if you can build on his frame. He does have a small frame, so 130, 135 guys are going to be very big.\n\n\"I think he would struggle to jump to 135 but you never know. As good as Inoue is, size matters and that's why we have weight classes and just giving up that much of an advantage is too much.\"\n\nWould he write him off the very best at 135? Tank Davis, Shakur Stevenson and alike?\n\n\"I wouldn't, no,\" Moloney shoots back quickly with a chuckle, almost born out of disbelief. \"I'd give him a good chance of beating Tank and beating Shakur. This guy's a freak. But you're giving away a big disadvantage. These guys are a lot bigger than him.\"\n\n\"I think he maybe taps out at 126lbs,\" adds a more conservative duBoef. \"I think you have the [Rafael] Espinozas, the [Luis] Lopezs... A dream match for me would be amazing if you could get [Vasiliy] Loma [Lomachenko] to go back to '26. That's a dream match.\"\n\nThe stage is set here at the Tokyo Dome, as it was for Mike Tyson to bring his own brand of shock, awe and destruction 34 years ago. That script did not go to plan.\n\nWhat if Inoue loses on Monday?\n\n\"We don't need to say that,\" smiles, Koizumi sunned by the question.\n\nNo one is ready for this story to end and no one wants to Inoue train derailed because, sure, it is a lucrative one, but it is a good, wholesome story for boxing.\n\nInoue is so good, there are suspicions of why he is so good. But he is enrolled with VADA and he and Nery have been tested for this fight since February.\n\nDuBoef quickly swept aside that kind of negative chatter that manifests online, too, saying they were \"narratives that are just mean spirited\" and the Top Rank president adds that Inoue is the best fighter that he has laid eyes on.\n\n\"You're talking about an athlete who - I entered the sport in 1993 - I've never seen such a complete fighter as him.\n\n\"We get polluted a lot hearing, 'You fighters don't want to lose, don't take the risks', he's all risk. From when he was like, 'Let's unify the titles. Let's do it again. This is what I want.' When you take that perspective and you want to do that and be great and prove it and have confidence in yourself, I think it elevates the sport. He's a poster boy for that.", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BoxingScene.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Inoue was 121\u00be pounds ahead of his first defense as undisputed king and second overall title defense at the weight. Tijuana's Nery was well under the mark at 120.8 pounds in a bid to become a two-time RING champion.\n\nTheir bout headlines a four-title fight show this Monday on ESPN+ and Amazon Prime-Japan from the Tokyo Dome. It marks the first boxing event at the famed venue since Buster Douglas' historic March 1990 upset of Mike Tyson.\n\nFor Nery (35-1, 27 knockouts), it's a chance at redemption in a country where he was previously banned to box. He badly blew weight ahead of a March 2018 knockout win over Shinsuke Yamanaka at Kokugikan Arena in Tokyo. The rematch came seven months after Nery dethroned a then-unbeaten Yamanaka for the WBC and Ring crown in Kyoto.\n\nNery, No. 2 at 122, was issued an indefinite suspension, which was lifted earlier this year.\n\nThere is no question the overturned verdict came as an effort to satisfy a hit list item for the nation's best fighter.\n\nInoue (26-0, 23 KOs), No. 2 pound-for-pound, was determined for Nery to be his first challenger of 2024. Talks were underway even before he defeated Marlon Tapales to fully unify the 122-pound division. The knockout win saw Inoue become Japan's first-ever two-division undisputed champion, a feat he accomplished in just 54 weeks.\n\nThe unbeaten 31-year-old from Yokohama previously held titles at 108, 115 and 118. He fully unified the bantamweight division by the end of 2022 before he moved up in weight to conquer junior featherweight.\n\nNery has won four straight, including three consecutive stoppage victories. Included among the bunch is his eleventh-round knockout of Azat Hovhannisyan last February. Their thriller was a top runner-up for 2023 Fight of the Year.\n\nBelow are the weights for the other three title fights.\n\nJason Moloney (27-2, 19 KOs), New South Wales, Australia, 117 \u00be

Picking\"? - Boxing News 24", "body": "Undisputed super bantamweight champion Naoya Inoue brought his IBF mandatory, little known, Sam Goodman, into the ring, making it clear that he intends on defending against him next in September after knocking out Luis Nery in the sixth round tonight in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nWhile casual boxing fans are happy with Inoue choosing Goodman next, hardcore view it as cherry-picking and playing it safe, choosing not to move up to featherweight to take talented fighters who could expose him.\n\nGoodman: A Soft Touch Compared to a Murderer's Row\n\nThis is disappointing news for fans, as they had hoped that 'Monster' Inoue (27-0, 24 KOs) would test himself by moving up to featherweight to take on what many few as the king of the division, Brandon Figueroa or the dangerous knockout artist, IBF champion Luis Alberto Lopez.\n\nGoodman is a soft touch for Inoue compared to the talented fighters at 126, going up against this Murderers' Row:\n\nBrandon Figueroa, Luis Lopez, Rafael Espinoza, Rey Vargas, and Raymond Ford.\n\nDid Nery and Tapales Spook Inoue?\n\nGiven the hard time Inoue had against Nery and in his previous fight against Marlon Tapales, the Japanese superstar might see the writing on the wall, realizing that if he moved up to featherweight, he wouldn't last long against the talented fighters, many of them good enough to beat him.\n\nInstead of moving up among the best, Inoue appears content to stay at 122, a division completely barren of talented life.\n\nInstead of moving up four pounds from 122 to 126 to take on the talents at featherweight, Inoue has decided to stay at super bantamweight to defend against the 25-year-old Australian fighter Sam Goodman (18-0, 8 KOs), who lacks punching power and has fought largely lackluster opposition.\n\nIt appears that the tough fight that Marlon Tapales gave Naoya Inoue last December has made him reluctant to move up to 126 to mix it with the many talented fighters in the featherweight division, who can punch as hard as him and would have a very good chance of beating him.\n\nThe Featherweight Gauntlet\n\nThese are some of the fighters that Inoue would have massive trouble with if he decided to move up to 126.\n\n- Brandon Figueroa: The King of the featherweight division?\n\n- Luis Alberto Lopez: Knockout artist with power in both hands\n\n- Rey Vargas: 5'10\" WBC champion.\n\n- Rafael Espinoza: The 6'1'' WBO champion\n\n- Robeisy Ramirez: Two-time Olympic gold medalist from Cuba\n\n- Nick Ball: Dangerous slugger\n\n- Raymond Ford: WBA champion\n\n- Ruben Villa: Excellent technician with skills to beat Inoue", "source": {"uri": "boxingnews24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boxing News 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

McDonnell, proven and sturdy at world level, was taken apart in 112 violent seconds.\n\nA beatdown of a double belt-holder exhibited the versatility of Inoue at the highest of levels as he claimed undisputed status in a second weight class.\n\nArguably the most cinematic finish of Inoue's career to date, the whip cracker right hand that stole Payano's balance was beautifully orchestrated.\n\nA thrilling affair that featured Inoue engaging in a rare competitive fight. That the injured Inoue (fractured right eye socket, no less) scored a knockdown so late in the bout (round 11) and Donaire survived it was testament to the qualities of both.\n\nArguably the performance that made the world pay attention. Showcasing an offensive repertoire that belied his 21 years, Inoue dethroned WBO junior bantamweight king Omar Andres Narvaez, who was making his 13th defence. Inoue dropped Narvaez twice in each of the first and second rounds. The veteran, who had only lost one of 46 bouts beforehand, could not rise following the fourth fall.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Inoue artfully outboxed Jason Moloney from range for the first six minutes before hurting his rival for the first time in round three, a left uppercut the offending blow. A right cross stunned Moloney in the fifth and, in the next, Inoue delved further into his box of tricks to floor his opponent, while going backwards, with the sweetest of left hooks. The finishing blow, a right hand that almost bent Moloney in half as he fell to the mat in round seven, was the best of the lot.\n\nWhether Inoue had improved or Donaire had faded since their first encounter - in truth, it was a combination of both - the rematch was barely competitive. Inoue stalked Donaire, who came with the WBC bantamweight title, from the opening bell and scored a knockdown at the end of the first round. With the end nigh, Inoue set about his rival to complete the demolition job midway through the second.", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BoxingScene.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_flyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Light flyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undisputed_championship_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Undisputed championship (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Narv\u00e1ez_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omar Narv\u00e1ez (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_flyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super flyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Weight class (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knockout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knockout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Moloney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Moloney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.boxingscene.com/uploads/Naoya-Inoue2-Naoki-Fukuda.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The animosity was on full display in their 2019 encounter and resulted in quite a finish.\n\nThere was a lot at stake for Inoue and Rodriguez as they were competing for the unified bantamweight championship. 'The Monster' was the reigning WBA unified bantamweight champion, while the Puerto Rican was the IBF bantamweight champion. In addition to their own titles being contested, the winner would also claim the vacant The Ring bantamweight championship.\n\nThree years following the bout, Steve Boxman took to his X account and posted a video of the incident between Rodriguez's camp and Inoue's father. In the video, the Puerto Rican's coach Williams Cruz is shown shoving 'The Monster's father, which turned out to be a costly decision.\n\nInoue obviously took the offense personally and took out his anger on Rodriguez when they met inside the ring. He made quick work of his opponent as he dropped him with a combination to earn a second-round knockout. Boxman wrote:\n\n\"3 years ago today, Naoya Inoue ripped through Emmanuel Rodriguez in 2 rounds to claim the IBF and Ring bantamweight titles. In the build up, Williams Cruz, the trainer of Rodriguez shoved Inoue's father and 'The Monster' wanted blood!\"\n\nCheck out Steve Boxman's tweet regarding Naoya Inoue vs. Rodriguez below:\n\nNaoya Inoue receives praise for latest knockout win\n\nNaoya Inoue received plenty of praise for his latest knockout win over Luis Nery to retain his super bantamweight titles.\n\nSteve Boxman, who posted the aforementioned tweet regarding 'The Monster's memorable win over Emmanuel Rodriguez, heaped praise for his latest win. He took to his X account following Inoue's sixth-round knockout over Nery.\n\nDespite being dropped earlier in the fight, Inoue managed to regroup and eventually finish Nery. Boxman mentioned that 'The Monster' showcased his greatness and expressed his excitement for what could be next. He wrote:\n\n\"Inoue simply is a special talent!

[For Inoue] he left January 2nd and never went back to Tijuana.\n\n\"He was there for three months [in training camp], all focus and that's it. He's been in the zone.\"\n\nNery has also brought plenty of back up. \"He's got more support here than any fighter has had, even my Filipino fighters didn't come this heavy,\" Gibbons added. \"I came with Michael Dasmarinas, I came with [Stephen] Fulton, I came with [Marlon] Tapales, nobody had confidence. This guy, all he tells me every day is, 'This is the first time in nine years I did things right. I'm knocking Inoue out'. The guy's confident. I'm like, 'Okay, let's go champ'.\"\n\nGibbons understands the backstory here, and why it is Nery who has been brought in for Inoue. The decision to let Nery back to return after the Japanese Boxing Commission had banned him for coming in overweight against Shinsuke Yamanaka, having failed a drug test in their first fight, was not universally welcomed in Japan, but it made the fight commercially attractive and some see it as an alternative method of punishment for the Mexican challenger.\n\n\"He [Nery] absolutely thinks he's here so Inoue can get revenge for Japan,\" Gibbons added. \"And for Yamanaka and for everybody, but that just motivates him.\n\n\"I don't think he has to cast himself as the bad guy, I think he did a pretty good job already of making himself the bad guy here - and I think that's who Luis is. He thrives on it. It doesn't bother him. There has to be a good guy and a bad guy in the story, right?\n\n\"I think that's his personality, he's really a confident guy and he looks the part. Look at him.\"\n\nNery has been seen signing for fans and having pictures with them this week, so he can't be all bad.\n\n\"[He's a] bad guy in a sense that when the fight starts,\" Gibbons continued. \"He's not a nice guy in the ring. He's cool with the fans, and he had his moment with Yamanaka where he apologized, but at the end of the day he's just one of those guys that they're going to pull in at that secondary TSA [Transport Security Administration] pre-check!\"\n\nHad Gibbons thought that, with his fighter barred from Japan, he would ever get the money-spinner with Inoue?\n\n\"I never really thought about it per se. I just knew that he was working his way to get to mandatory, so I never really put a thought to it,\" Gibbons continued. \"All we thought was, 'Get to the mandatory and let's see about fighting for the WBC world title', but it was never a thing where we were worried that he wasn't going to get the fight because he was on suspension.\"\n\nNery came in a pound under the super bantamweight limit at yesterday's weigh-in, and it was greeted in some quarters with an applause that could be deemed sarcastic. But Gibbons said this new, professional version of Nery wouldn't miss the weight, and he won't miss on fight night.", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BoxingScene.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tijuana", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tijuana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tijuana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmanuel Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Nery_(boxer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Nery (boxer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naoya_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naoya Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinsuke_Yamanaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shinsuke Yamanaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_ring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing ring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transportation Security Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://www.boxingscene.com/uploads/Naoya_Inoue_Luis_Nery_presser.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 111, "textEnd": 116}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-02", "textStart": 590, "textEnd": 601}], "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

But because Tyson lost that that's a bad omen for Inoue? I never get involved in that type of conjecture.\"\n\nArum was also quick to put the brakes on where Inoue's future lies in regards to weight classes. There is speculation about where Inoue might go, should he successfully defend his undisputed super bantamweight title against the Mexican challenger, and how he might be able to go up in weight and still impress.\n\n\"One step at a time,\" Arum urged. \"I know in talking with the management that he's going to stay at 122 for the rest of the year. What he does next year, whether he goes up or not, is not a decision that I'll be making, it's a decision that he and his management have to make.\n\n\"Look, he started so much below and he's risen in weight all through these divisions. Can he go to 126? Probably. But he'll be giving away a lot of size at that level at 126, but I think we'll see him at 126 maybe next year.\"\n\nThe four-weight world champion, who has unified in two divisions, is 26-0 (23 KOs) and big things are expected on Monday (May 6) night. Arum certainly hopes so, and he has no hesitation and saying what makes Inoue such a special talent.\n\n\"He's special because he's a very very good boxer, but he is the most devastating puncher that we've ever seen as far as fighters in this lightweight division,\" Arum said. \"In other words, we've had great fighters in those divisions, but if you look at their records, generally an overwhelming number of their victories came as a result of decisions. With Inoue, he leaves no doubt because how can there be a doubt of an outcome of a fight when his opponent is counted out. That makes him extraordinarily exciting.\"\n\nArum has been involved in boxing since the 1960s and has promoted a who's who of the sport, from Oscar De La Hoya to Muhammad Ali, from Marvin Hagler to Sugar Ray Leonard and Tommy Hearns to Manny Pacquiao.

He changed the metrics of the fight, where and how it was fought, by pulling Ishida inside and making the box at close quarters.\n\nInoue began to score freely with his right uppercut as Ishida submitted his height and reach advantage and accept the invitation of boxing on the inside, but it was to his detriment.\n\nA fine Inoue left to the body was followed by another uppercut and the 32-year-old's nose started to pump blood.\n\nInoue really started to do damaging work in the fourth. There seemed only one winner on the inside, and Inoue lashed out right hands as Ishida tried to escape his clutches.\n\nEven with a little distance between them in the fifth, Inoue had started to time and control Ishida, 34-4 (17 KOs), at range and the challenger's face started to tell an increasingly one-sided tale.\n\nInoue was able to step back to avoid Ishida's jab but would then pounce forward with left hook or right hand counters, and while the action was competitive, the fight had seemingly turned irreversibly in the champion's favor.\n\nInoue appeared composed and confident, boxing with a heightened alertness and he was still able to land the occasional thumping uppercut with Ishida unable to contain him behind little more than a pawing jab.\n\nBoth, however, had moments of give and take in the eighth and Ishida tried to impose himself in the ninth and force Inoue backwards, with some success, to the point that Inoue sported fresh swelling below his right eye but still Ishida couldn't defend against the right uppercut.\n\nIt was gritty, hard and close and the 11th was all of those things and clearly thrilling the absorbed crowd at the Tokyo Dome who roared their approval when the fighters came out for the final session and, as it turned out, more of the same. Ishida slipped near the bell and finished the fight on the canvas but it was a terrific round and had been a good fight.\n\nKazunobu Asao and Pinit Prayadsab both scored it 118-109, while Michiaki Someya handed down a 116-111 scorecard.\n\nInoue made his second defense, having picked up one of the crowns his brother, Naoya, vacated by beating Liborio Solis and defending against Jerwin Ancajas.\n\nIshida, the WBA No. 1, lost to Kal Yafai on points in Wales in 2017 for a WBA belt at super flyweight but was on a run of five wins.", "source": {"uri": "boxingscene.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BoxingScene.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takuma_Inoue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Takuma Inoue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantamweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bantamweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jab", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jab"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Boxing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(boxing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hook (boxing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kal_Yafai", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kal Yafai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liborio_Sol\u00eds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liborio Sol\u00eds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Dome", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo Dome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_flyweight", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super flyweight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerwin_Ancajas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerwin Ancajas"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Boxing/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Boxing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.boxingscene.com/uploads/takuma-inoue%20(3).jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538810", "eventUri": "eng-9538810", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

A promising start to a stacked TV undercard.\n\nHello and welcome to the Tokyo Dome for tonight's blockbuster between Naoya 'Monster' Inoue and Mexican challenger Luis Nery. A sellout crowd of about 55,000 spectators is expected as boxing returns to the Big Egg for the first time since February 1990, when a 42-1 underdog named James 'Buster' Douglas knocked out then-unbeaten heavyweight champion Mike Tyson in one of the great upsets in all of sport.\n\nInoue (26-0, 23 KOs) is no Tyson. He's even better, both on body of work and appetite for destruction. Since winning his first world championship at 108lbs in his sixth professional fight back in April 2014, the 31-year-old knockout merchant from Kanagawa prefecture has added belts at 115lbs, 118lbs and 122lbs while amassing a record of 21-0 in world title fights, including 19 coming inside the distance. Most recently, Inoue became the undisputed champion in two different weight classes over a 378-day span, knocking out Paul Butler in December 2022 to consolidate all four titles at bantamweight, then stopping the previously unbeaten Stephen Fulton in his junior featherweight debut and fully unifying the belts at 122lbs with a stoppage of Marlon Tapales in December. He is only the second Japanese man to win titles in four different weight classes after the great Kazuto Ioka.\n\nNery (35-1, 27 KOs) is a former two-division world champion who held the WBC's version title at both bantamweight and junior featherweight. The 29-year-old Tijuana southpaw lost his bantamweight strap after badly missing weight for his 2018 rematch against Shinsuke Yamanaka, which earned him an indefinite suspension in Japan that was lifted earlier this year. After becoming a two-weight champion with a 2020 decision over Aaron Alameda, he suffered his first and only professional loss the following year by seventh-round knockout in a title unification bout with Brandon Figueroa. He's rebuilt nicely since then with four straight wins - including a spectacular 11th-round knockout over Azat Hovhannisyan last February in one of the year's best scraps - but he will go off tonight as a 10-1 underdog on merit.\n\nWe've got three world title fights on the televised undercard ahead of tonight's main event, which should go off around 8.30pm local time (7.30am EDT/12.30pm BST).

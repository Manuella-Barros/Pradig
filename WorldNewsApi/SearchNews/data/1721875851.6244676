{"id": 239774870, "title": "Eoin O\u2019Malley: Question of who leads in a coalition of equals is likely to be the undoing of any grand left al", "text": "Will the party go to the country as one of a set of government parties seeking re-election? Or will it form part of the soft-left alliance being touted by Labour? Its decision will have some impact on the timing of the election, for if the decision is to pursue a left alliance, then the party should start to distance itself from the government partners, perhaps even confecting a rupture that might see an election before a budget is passed? Eamon Ryan was not one for this type of politics. If those on the rural right hated him for being effective in driving his preferred policies, the left saw him as a sell-out for his pragma-tic willingness to compromise. At the time the Government formed almost four years ago, Cath-erine Martin challenged Ryan for the leadership of the party. She would have been the most likely to pursue a shift away from the government parties. Martin has proved chronically indecisive in government and her handling of the RT\u00c9 crisis was inept, so maybe she thought her leadership might harm the Greens. The two contenders, Roderic O\u2019Gorman and Pippa Hackett, seem less likely to cause a split in the government, though O\u2019Gorman\u2019s leadership of the heavily defeated referendums would hardly give confidence in his campaigning abilities. But nor are they likely to want to face the country in an alliance with Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il. The likely outcome of that might be that Green candidates\u2019 eliminations provide some votes for the bigger parties in later counts. In the aftermath of the local and European elections, Labour, which seems to think it did well \u2014 expectations were obviously low \u2014 has been talking up the idea of a left alliance if not a full-blown merger. That took a blow last week when the party pulled out of a \u2018progressive alliance\u2019 that might have run Dublin City Council. The Popular Front of left parties that was formed in the French elections to confront the immediate threat of the ethnonationalist RN party points to problems with such alliances. They only seem to form in reaction to a threat, not to deliver a positive agenda. And within days of it being formed, there were divisions as one populist left party tried to remove some members of the alliance. \u200bIn Ireland, they\u2019d have to decide first who goes in. It would probably be just the Greens, Social Democrats and Labour. The other parties on the left are too far left, such as PBP, so neither side would want it. Although it claims to be left-wing, many would be sceptical of whether Sinn F\u00e9in is really that committed to anything but a united Ireland. Would the three small social democratic parties really want to align with a party associated with historical human rights abuses? Certainly, its votes in the D\u00e1il and European Parliament suggest its commitment to green issues is flimsy. In any case, would those parties want to align with a much larger party where they might just be sweeper candidates to help elect Sinn F\u00e9in candidates? Then they\u2019d have to think what form the alliance would take. Would it have a name on the ballot paper? There is a reason why large companies such as Procter and Gamble have many brands of essentially the same washing powder. It might be more efficient for there to be one. But while the Greens, Labour and the SocDems might be ideologically similar, each appeals to different markets. A merger under one brand would be less than the sum of its parts. It would also be unnecessary. Such alliances are usually needed where the electoral system biases against small parties. But Ireland\u2019s is pretty forgiving. An alliance commanding 30 seats might be able to deliver more than where one part of it is picked off and played against the other Where the party has a strong candidate in a local area, even very small parties can do well. We saw in the European elections that voters of these parties already tend to transfer to each other anyway. Where such an alliance might make a difference is in its approach to government. An alliance commanding 30 seats might be able to deliver more than where one part of it is picked off and played against the other. Within government, it would be treated as an equal partner to the bigger parties rather than something that should be thrown some crumbs. It would also mean that each of the parties would be more willing to form part of a government, knowing their main rivals for votes are also coming in. But there\u2019s the rub. For this to work, there needs to be a leader of the alliance in government. In Spain, where such an alliance was tried, the grouping is unravelling because it quickly became seen as the personal vehicle for the woman who put it together and led it. Given the SocDems have so far shown less enthusiasm for government than the other two, it could be that decision that would drive the alliance apart.", "summary": "<p>The first strategic decision the new leader of the Green Party will have to make is how to approach the next election.</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/opinion/comment/eoin-omalley-question-of-who-leads-in-a-coalition-of-equals-is-likely-to-be-the-undoing-of-any-grand-left-alliance/a413290188.html", "image": "https://focus.independent.ie/thumbor/D_f6O1lJE5rIyjp-8wAdRX7fPxw=/0x299:2176x1748/550x550/prod-mh-ireland/057ff9f5-a4bb-4a1f-9265-6951853fd34f/cd36c84c-dcaf-4d17-b14a-ef30a6db576b/057ff9f5-a4bb-4a1f-9265-6951853fd34f.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:30:00", "author": "Eoin O'malley", "authors": ["Eoin O'malley"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.375}

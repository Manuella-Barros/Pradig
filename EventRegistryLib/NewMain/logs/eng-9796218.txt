diplomatic ties with Ukraine, a move which signals a burgeoning rift between some West African states and Kyiv.\n\nNiger's military government said it made the move in \"solidarity\" with neighbouring Mali, who severed their own relations with Ukraine two days ago.\n\nBoth countries cited comments by a Ukrainian military official, who suggested Kyiv played a role in the killing of dozens of Malian soldiers last month.\n\nUkraine has been trying to win allies in Africa throughout its war with Russia, likely in an attempt to counter Moscow's growing influence on the continent.\n\nAt the end of July, scores of Malian soldiers, along with mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, were killed in clashes with separatist rebels and al-Qaeda-linked militants.\n\nMali's military regime had turned to the notorious Wagner group in 2021, seeking support in tackling its crippling insecurity issues.\n\nAfter Wagner confirmed \"losses\" in July's attack, Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukrainian military intelligence, said the rebels received \"the necessary information they needed\" to conduct the attacks.\n\nHe did not elaborate.\n\nIn response to Mr Yusov's comment, Mali accused Ukraine of violating its sovereignty and announced it was breaking off relations with Ukraine \"with immediate effect\".\n\nNiger followed suit on Tuesday, with government spokesman Amadou Abdramane calling Mr Yusov's remarks \"unacceptable\".\n\nMali's neighbour Senegal also rebuked Ukraine.\n\nOver the weekend, Senegal's foreign ministry summoned Ukraine's ambassador, Yurii Pyvovarov, accusing him of supporting July's attack in Mali in a since-deleted video posted on the Ukrainian embassy's Facebook account.\n\nUkraine's foreign ministry has not yet commented on Niger's decision to sever diplomatic ties.\n\nHowever, it called Mali's decision \"short-sighted and hasty\", and said Ukraine \"unconditionally\" complies with international law and accused Russian-controlled outfits of \"numerous war crimes\" in African countries.\n\nRussia weighed in on the matter on Wednesday, accusing Ukraine of opening a \"second front\" in Africa.\n\n\"The regime of [Ukrainian President] Zelensky is pandering to terrorist groups in countries on the continent friendly to Moscow,\" Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told the RIA Novosti news agency.\n\nIn recent years, Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have undergone coups and their new military government's have ripped up defence agreements with France and the US, preferring military help from Russia.\n\nAs Russia's popularity on the continent expands, Ukraine has attempted to strengthen its ties with African nations.\n\nUkrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba is currently on his fourth visit to Africa in the last two years - this time he is visiting Malawi, Zambia and Mauritius.\n\nPresently, it is hard to tell whether other West African countries might follow Niger and Mali in cutting ties with Ukraine.\n\nMany will be waiting to see the reaction of Burkina Faso, which formed a bloc with Niger and Mali earlier this year and is also ruled by the military.\n\nWest Africa is not the only region to be impacted by the Ukraine-Russia war.\n\nIn Sudan, Wagner is alleged to be backing the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been at war with the Sudanese army for more than a year now.\n\nMeanwhile, widely circulated videos show what is reported to be Ukrainian special forces carrying out drone strikes, and other armed attacks, against the RSF and Wagner fighters in Sudan.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to verify these videos.\n\nAs Russia and Ukraine's war continued to play out in Africa, more than 70 mourners gathered in Moscow to pay homage to the Wagner fighters killed in July's attack.\n\nRed carnations were laid below pictures of fallen fighters at a memorial on Sunday, press agency Reuters reported, while some attendees lit candles.", "source":

The unrest, which resulted in the deaths of dozens of soldiers and Russian Wagner fighters in July, prompted the move.Thank you for reading this post, don't forget to subscribe!\n\nThis decision follows Mali's similar action on Sunday, which came after Ukraine's military intelligence agency made remarks about the conflict in northern Mali. Tuareg rebels reportedly killed at least 84 Wagner mercenaries and 47 Malian soldiers in the clashes. This incident marked one of Wagner's most significant defeats since it began supporting Mali's military two years ago.\n\nNiger's spokesperson, Abdourahamane Amadou, stated that the country's decision to cut ties with Ukraine was made in solidarity with Mali. The Ukrainian foreign ministry was unavailable for comment due to the time difference.\n\nOn Monday, Ukraine condemned Mali's decision as hasty and accused Kyiv of supporting international terrorism. The controversy originated from statements by Andriy Yusov, a spokesperson for Ukraine's military intelligence, who suggested that Malian rebels had received critical information to carry out their attack.\n\nAdditionally, Senegal's foreign minister summoned Ukrainian Ambassador Yurii Pyvovarov over a video in which Pyvovarov purportedly endorsed the attack in Mali. The dispute highlights Ukraine's challenges in gaining support from the Global South amid its broader international diplomacy efforts.", "source": {"uri": "naija247news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija247news"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Niger"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Niger"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mali"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mali"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niamey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Niamey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Niamey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Niger"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tuareg people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mercenary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_for_Europe_and_Foreign_Affairs_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Ukraine)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senegal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Senegal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Senegal"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_9315.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796218", "eventUri": "eng-9796218", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Niamey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Niger"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 8, "textEnd": 13}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

alleged support of Malian \"terrorist groups.\"\n\nThe move came days after Mali severed relations with Ukraine over the same accusation.\n\nIn a statement on national television, Niger's government spokesperson Colonel Amadou Abdramane said the matter would be referred to the UN Security Council as a case of \"Ukrainian aggression.\"\n\nThe diplomatic impasse follows a defeat of the Malian Armed Forces during clashes with separatist rebels at the end of July.\n\nThe Malian army admitted Monday that it had suffered a high death toll following clashes in Tinzaouaten in the north of the country, while the Russian-affiliated Wagner Group supporting the Malian army had confirmed Russian losses and the death of a commander following heavy fighting there.\n\nMali said it considered support for Ukraine \"as support for international terrorism\" and an aggression which is part of \"the broader pattern of certain actors who actively support and instrumentalize terrorist groups in the region.\"\n\nThe diplomatic blow coincides with the visit of Ukraine's foreign minister, who started a fourth tour of African countries this week seeking to strengthen ties with the region.\n\nDmytro Kuleba embarked on a tour including Malawi, Zambia and Mauritius on Sunday that is expected to end on Thursday, where he will meet with the heads of state of the three countries and his

The ministry did not immediately comment on Niger's decision to sever ties on Wednesday.\n\nThe breakdown of diplomatic relations is a symbolic defeat for Ukraine, which has sought to gain support in Africa as it battles Russia's full-scale invasion. Many African countries have been neutral in the war, or like Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have backed Russia's position. Ukraine had launched a charm offensive in the hopes of bringing more African countries to its side.\n\nThe diplomatic row, which comes during Ukraine foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba's three-country tour in Africa, threatened to overshadow Kyiv's efforts to expand ties in the global south and secure broader support for its fight against Russia's ongoing military invasion.\n\nKuleba is this week visiting Malawi, Zambia and Mauritius, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nA rebel Tuareg coalition called the Permanent Strategic Framework for Peace, Security and Development (CSP-PSD) claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 47 Malian soldiers and 84 Russian mercenaries near the remote town of Tinzaouaten.\n\nIt was the most significant setback for the Wagner forces, who are fighting alongside the Malian army as the country struggles to contain a decade-old insurgency fuelled by Isis and al-Qaeda affiliates as well as the Tuaregs agitating for greater independence.\n\nAl-Qaeda affiliate Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin has also claimed responsibility for the attack. CSP-PSD and JNIM have a fractious relationship, sometimes collaborating and other times clashing, but they have a common enemy in the Malian state and its Russian supporters.\n\nMali, Niger and Burkina Faso are all run by military regimes that swept to power over recent years with promises to tackle the spiralling insecurity that largely democratic administrations were unable to quell.\n\nAll three countries have also pulled out of the Economic Community of West African States, which they see as a western stooge and have formed the tri-state confederation of the Alliance of Sahel States.\n\nThe military regimes have sought closer relations with Moscow and have shunned traditional western allies including the US and former colonial ruler France. French forces have been kicked out of all three nations and the US completed its troop withdrawal from Niger this week.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times

Amadou Abdramane, spokesperson for the Niger military government, delivered this announcement on national television on Tuesday, citing Kyiv's alleged support for terrorist organisations as the primary reason for this drastic decision.\n\nThe statement issued by Abdramane highlighted Niger's call for the UN Security Council to intervene and assess Ukraine's actions, terming them as \"aggression.\" Abdramane emphasised the gravity of the situation, pointing to Ukraine's purported involvement in the aggression against Mali as a key factor behind the decision. This move, according to the statement, stands in solidarity with the Malian government and people.\n\nNotably, this development comes on the heels of a similar decision by Mali's transitional government, which also swiftly cut off diplomatic ties with Ukraine. Mali's decision was prompted by remarks made by Andriy Yusov, spokesperson for Ukrainian military intelligence, acknowledging Ukraine's role in an attack by armed groups that resulted in the loss of Malian defence and security forces in Tinzaoutene. Abdoulaye Maiga, spokesperson for the Malian government, reiterated the severity of the situation, pointing to significant losses suffered by the Malian Armed Forces in clashes with terrorist forces.\n\nThe recent unrest in the Sahel region has been a cause for concern, with the Malian Armed Forces reporting substantial casualties during clashes with terrorist forces in the country's northeastern region. Against this backdrop, the formation of the Confederation of the Alliance of Sahel States by Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger during their inaugural summit in early July signifies a united front in addressing regional challenges.", "source": {"uri": "dimsumdaily.hk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dimsum Daily"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dimsumdaily_hong_kong@dimsumdaily.hk", "name": "Dimsumdaily Hong Kong", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Niger"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Niger"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mali"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mali"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations Security Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niamey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Niamey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Niamey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Niger"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Mali", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of Mali"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Provisional government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sahel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkina_Faso", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burkina Faso"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Burkina Faso"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.dimsumdaily.hk/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/07081448/Niger-1.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796218", "eventUri": "eng-9796218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

killed at least 47 government soldiers and 84 Russian Wagner mercenaries in fighting last month near the West African country's border with Algeria.\n\nThe losses incurred by Wagner fighters arguably amounted to the heaviest defeat the Russian mercenary group has suffered in the two years since it began to give military assistance to the Bamako regime.\n\nWithout directly confirming Kyiv's involvement, Andrey Yusov, a spokesman for Ukraine's Defense Ministry's Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR), told Ukrainian public television that the rebels \"received all the necessary information they needed\" to defeat the Russian mercenaries fighting alongside Malian troops.\n\nYusov's comments prompted Mali's military government to sever ties with Ukraine and accuse Kyiv of supporting terrorism and violating Mali's sovereignty.\n\nKyiv, whose troops fought fierce battles against Wagner mercenaries in eastern Ukraine, strongly rejected Mali's move, calling it \"short-sighted and

the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries, and resolutely rejects the accusations of the Transitional Government of Mali of alleged support of international terrorism,\" the ministry said in a statement on August 5.\n\nRussia has been offering regime protection and other services to authoritarian governments in Africa and has recently expanded into Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger as military coups sweep through the Sahel.\n\nOn August 6, some 40 people were arrested in Nigeria's north, which borders Niger, for waving Russian flags during protests against the high cost of living and government policies.\n\nOn August 5, the United States handed over Airbase 201 in Agadez, its last military base in Niger, to local authorities, the U.S. Department of Defense and Niger's Ministry of Defense announced in a joint statement.\n\nThe handing over of Airbase 201 came after U.S. troops withdrew earlier this month from Airbase 101, in Niger's capital of Niamey.\n\nThe closing of the two bases, which played a major role in U.S. counterterrorism operations in the region, came after Washington and Nigerien authorities agreed that U.S. troops will leave the country by September 15.\n\nWagner was previously involved in some of the fiercest fighting of Russia's war in Ukraine, but its fate was put into question when founder Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash in August 2023, two months after leading a brief mutiny against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nWagner mercenaries who did not sign contracts with Russia's Defense Ministry after the mutiny

trying to win allies in Africa throughout its war with Russia, likely in an attempt to counter Moscow's growing influence on the continent.\n\nAt the end of July, scores of Malian soldiers, along with mercenaries from Russia's Wagner group, were killed in clashes with separatist rebels and al-Qaeda-linked militants.\n\nMali's military regime had turned to the notorious Wagner group in 2021, seeking support in tackling its crippling insecurity issues.\n\nAfter Wagner confirmed \"losses\" in July's attack, Andriy Yusov, a spokesman for Ukrainian military intelligence, said the rebels received \"the necessary information they needed\" to conduct the attacks.\n\nHe did not elaborate.\n\nIn response to Mr Yusov's comment, Mali accused Ukraine of violating its sovereignty and announced it was breaking off relations with Ukraine \"with immediate effect\".\n\nNiger followed suit on Tuesday, with government spokesman Amadou Abdramane calling Mr Yusov's remarks \"unacceptable\".\n\nMali's neighbour Senegal also rebuked Ukraine.\n\nOver the weekend, Senegal's foreign ministry summoned Ukraine's ambassador, Yurii Pyvovarov, accusing him of supporting July's attack in Mali in a since-deleted video posted on the Ukrainian embassy's Facebook account.\n\nUkraine's foreign ministry has not yet commented on Niger's decision to sever diplomatic ties.\n\nHowever, it called Mali's decision \"short-sighted and hasty\", and said Ukraine \"unconditionally\" complies with international law and accused Russian-controlled outfits of \"numerous war crimes\" in African countries.\n\nRussia weighed in on the matter on Wednesday, accusing Ukraine of opening a \"second front\" in Africa.\n\n\"The regime of [Ukrainian President] Zelensky is pandering to terrorist groups in countries on the continent friendly to Moscow,\" Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told the RIA Novosti news agency.\n\nIn recent years, Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have undergone coups and their new military government's have ripped up defence agreements with France and the US, preferring military help from Russia.\n\nAs Russia's popularity on the continent expands, Ukraine has attempted to strengthen its ties with African nations.\n\nUkrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba is currently on his fourth visit to Africa in the last two years - this time he is visiting Malawi, Zambia and Mauritius.\n\nPresently, it is hard to tell whether other West African countries might follow Niger and Mali in cutting ties with Ukraine.\n\nMany will be waiting to see the reaction of Burkina Faso, which formed a bloc with Niger and Mali earlier this year and is also ruled by the military.\n\nWest Africa is not the only region to be impacted by the Ukraine-Russia war.\n\nIn Sudan, Wagner is alleged to be backing the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been at war with the Sudanese army for more than a year now.\n\nMeanwhile, widely circulated videos show what is reported to be Ukrainian special forces carrying out drone strikes, and other armed attacks, against the RSF and Wagner fighters in Sudan.\n\nThe BBC has not been able to verify these videos.\n\nAs Russia and Ukraine's war continued to play out in Africa, more than 70 mourners gathered in Moscow to pay homage to the Wagner fighters killed in July's attack.\n\nRed carnations were laid below pictures of fallen fighters at a memorial on Sunday, press agency Reuters reported, while some attendees lit candles.", "source": {"uri": "bbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

On Monday, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry posted a statement on its website condemning Mali's decision as \"short-sighted and hasty,\" saying no evidence has been provided to prove Kyiv's role in the attack.

The Wagner Group has been active in Africa for years and was once estimated to have 50,000 fighters in Ukraine. Moscow has restructured and exerted greater control over Wagner ever since its founder, Yevgeny Prigozhin, launched a failed mutiny against Vladimir Putin in 2023 and died in a mysterious plane crash not long after.\n\nThis diplomatic feud also comes amid increasingly tense relations between the West, which is closely allied with Kyiv, and Sahel nations like Mali that have gone through coups in recent years.", "source": {"uri": "gzeromedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GZERO Media"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyiv", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyiv"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mali"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mali"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wagner Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuareg_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tuareg people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military dictatorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercenary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mercenary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Separatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Qaeda", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al-Qaeda"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sahel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Ukraine"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yevgeny_Prigozhin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yevgeny Prigozhin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutiny", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mutiny"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vladimir Putin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamako", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bamako"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bamako"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mali"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sudan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Cracking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.gzeromedia.com/media-library/people-gather-in-front-of-a-makeshift-memorial-during-a-commemoration-ceremony-held-to-pay-tribute-to-wagner-fighters-who-were.jpg?id=53127545&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C2", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796218", "eventUri": "eng-9796218", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Niamey criticized \"the silence of other African countries and the African Union\" in the face of \"malicious attempts to turn the Sahel into a theater of ideological and strategic confrontation\"\n\nThe West African bloc Ecowas, which Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso quit earlier this year to form a separate regional bloc, also expressed its \"strong disapproval and condemnation of any foreign interference in the region.\"\n\nThis series of events set off alarm bells beyond Mali and Niger. A video of Andriy Yusov's interview was shared on social media by Iouri Pyvovarov, the Ukrainian ambassador to Senegal, prompting the ire of the Malian government and a rebuke from the Senegalese foreign affairs minister. Pyvovarov was summoned by the foreign ministry to \"remind him of the obligations of discretion, restraint and non-interference,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"Bamako has always denied\" using the Wagner Group, a Russian paramilitary organization that operates widely in Africa, said Bokar Sangar\u00e9, a political sciences researcher currently in Bamako.. \"The authorities only refer to simple military instructors, no different from their Western counterparts.\" Sangar\u00e9 said he doubted the Ukrainian action was an isolated case: Recently, Wagner forces faced unexpected setbacks in Sudan as well as Syria, due to the unacknowledged help of the DIU.\n\nThere are reasons to believe that the public acknowledgement of Ukrainian help to the Tuareg separatists was a blunder. Firstly, it occurred shortly before Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba set off for an African diplomatic tour -- his fourth in two years -- to Malawi, Zambia and Mauritius from Aug. 4 to 8. Since March 2022, when African nations made up half of the abstentions on the UN resolution condemning the \"aggression against Ukraine,\" Kyiv's has pursued a sustained charm offensive in Africa and opened several embassies. It has even suggested President Volodymr Zelenskyy would be making his first Africa visit this year.\n\nSecondly, Pyvovarov has promptly deleted his social media posts on Mali. Third, Ukraine didn't reciprocate the severance of ties, choosing instead to highlight its \"significant contribution\" to peacekeeping operations in Mali.\n\nSangar\u00e9 argued that the battle between Ukraine and Russia in Africa is mostly about influence, perception, and communication \"and not yet in the outsourcing of the Ukrainian conflict to Africa.\"\n\nYet, there are troubling signs of Kyiv's determination to pursue its countermeasures against Wagner forces in Africa. In his now-deleted posts, Pyvoravov stated: \"The work will continue. There will certainly be other results. Punishment for war crimes and terrorism is inevitable.\"\n\nUkrainian intelligence services are thought to have sent tentative feelers towards separatists movements in Chad, where an increased Russian involvement is anticipated. Their presence in Libya is also known to security specialists.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

attack claims - Trending News", "body": "Mali says it has severed diplomatic relations with Ukraine after a military official said Kyiv was involved in fatal fighting along the Algerian border last month.\n\nDozens of Malian soldiers and mercenaries from Russia's Wagner organisation were killed in confrontations with Tuareg separatist rebels and al-Qaeda terrorists over several days.\n\nAccording to Andriy Yusov, a representative for Ukrainian military intelligence, the rebels were provided with the \"necessary information\" to carry out the strikes last week.\n\nA top Malian official, Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga, said his government was shocked to hear the claim and accused Ukraine of violating Mali's sovereignty.\n\nYusov's comments admitted Ukraine's involvement in a cowardly, treacherous and barbaric attack by armed terrorist groups\" that had led to the deaths of Malian soldiers, Col Maiga's statement said.\n\nMali has decided to break off relations \"with immediate effect\", he said.\n\nLast week, Mali's army admitted it had suffered \"significant\" losses during several days of fighting earlier that erupted on 25 July.\n\nThe clashes took place in the desert near Tinzaouaten, a north-eastern town on the border with Algeria.\n\nReports say the Malian and Russian forcers were ambushed by Tuareg rebels and fighters from al-Qaeda affiliate Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin while waiting for reinforcements, after retreating from Tinzaouaten.\n\nNeither Mali's military nor Wagner - which has since morphed into a group called the Africa Corps - have given exact figures, but the estimated death toll for Wagner fighters ranges from 20 to 80.\n\nThe Russian mercenary outfit's losses are thought to be the heaviest it has suffered in Mali since it began helping the military government fight the insurgents two years ago.\n\nWagner has acknowledged that one of its commanders was killed and a Russian helicopter was downed in \"fierce fighting\", saying they had been attacked by around 1,000 fighters.\n\nOn Thursday, Tuareg-led separatists claimed to have killed 84 Wagner mercenaries and 47 Malian soldiers.\n\nMore than a decade ago, Mali's central government lost control of much of the north due to a Tuareg revolt fueled by a desire for an independent state.\n\nThe presence of Islamist extremists in the fight compromised the country's security even further.\n\nWhen seizing power in coups in 2020 and 2021, the military blamed the government's incapacity to address the unrest.\n\nIn an effort to suppress the unrest, the new junta broke off Mali's long-standing connection with former colonial power France in favor of Russia.", "source": {"uri": "tvcnews.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "TVC News Nigeria"}, "authors": [],

The rebels were victorious and inflicted severe casualties on the government forces, killing more than 80 of Moscow's mercenaries.\n\nIn the early hours of Wednesday, Aug. 7 the CSP-DPA issued a statement via its official X / Twitter site that angrily responded to accusations by Senegal and ECOWAS that the Tuareg forces had carried out an unprovoked attack on Mali's armed forces.\n\nThe CSP-DPA statement claims that their forces were only defending themselves against an attack by Wagner mercenaries who were supporting the Malian junta and condemned the international community for ignoring crimes against civilians committed by the Russian mercenaries.\n\nIt urges Senegal, which considers the militants of the Wagner Group to be part of the Armed Forces of Mali and the Tuareg to be terrorists, along with ECOWAS to help end the conflict and return to a peaceful resolution, rather than supporting the junta that violates human rights.\n\nThe CSP-DPA says that the Tuaregs \"are ready to cooperate to provide more information about this situation to any state or organization that wishes it.\"\n\nIts spokesman, Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane, points out that the Tuaregs only took up arms against the Malian junta and Wagner after the regime violated a previous peace agreement and expelled peacekeeping forces.\n\nFollowing the July battle at Tinzawaten, Ukraine's Main Intelligence Directorate (HUR) hinted that it had provided \"necessary information\" to the Tuaregs \"ensured a successful military operation against Russian war criminals\" without confirming any operational activity in Mali.\n\nOn Monday, July 29, Kyiv Post received an exclusive photograph from sources within Ukraine's defense and security sector, that appeared to show Tuareg rebels posing with a Ukrainian flag that was taken prior to the July action.\n\nMali accused Kyiv of supplying intelligence to the rebel forces and, in response, announced that it was severing diplomatic relations with Kyiv on Sunday, Aug. 4. It gave the reason for this action being a mysterious statement by a Ukrainian military intelligence spokesman who allegedly acknowledged involvement.\n\nUkraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated on Monday that this decision was \"regrettable, short-sighted and hasty,\" adding that Mali proceeded \"without a thorough examination of the facts and circumstances... and without providing any evidence of Ukraine's [direct] involvement.\" The statement went on to criticze Russian military presence in Africa.\n\nLast week, Kyiv Post received exclusive footage showing how Ukrainian special forces, a day after Russia's President Vladimir Putin had met with Syria's President Bashar al- Assad, delivered a devastating strike on a Russian airbase in Syria, destroying military equipment.\n\nIn June, Kyiv Post obtained exclusive video allegedly showing Ukrainian special forces working with Syrian rebels to decimate Russian mercenaries in Syria.\n\nIn February, it received exclusive video that purported showing Ukrainian special forces interrogating captured Wagner mercenaries in the Republic of Sudan. In the video, the prisoners admit that their task had been to go to Sudan and overthrow the government there.\n\nIn January, Kyiv Post published an exclusive video showing Ukrainian drones destroying \"Russian mercenaries\" and their \"local terrorist partners\" in Sudan.", "source": {"uri": "kyivpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KyivPost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

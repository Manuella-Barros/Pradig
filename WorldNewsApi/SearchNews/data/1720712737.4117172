{"id": 232085374, "title": "'I was dead - it's a miracle I'm here': Love Island's Paul Danan reveals he was brought back to life...", "text": "Love Island's Paul Danan has revealed that he was brought back to life after his 'obsessive' vape usage caused respiratory failure. The former reality star, 45, - who appeared on the original 2005 series of Celebrity Love Island and has been in Hollyoaks - collapsed and had to be given CPR by his family after losing consciousness while at home. He was then rushed to hospital in an ambulance and ended up in the ICU with pneumonia as his family were warned he might not 'make it through the night'. Paul had smoked cigarettes for years before switching to disposable vapes which he candidly admitted he would even 'go to sleep with' for comfort. After waking up in hospital he told how the doctor was incredibly stern with him and said if he carried on smoking he risked having to be linked to an oxygen tank later in life. He told The Sun: 'I was dead \u2014 it's a miracle I'm here. I'm upstairs puffing away on my vape then suddenly I lost my breath and collapsed. My family called for an ambulance and started giving me CPR, then police arrived and took over before paramedics took me to hospital. 'I was on a machine in ICU and ended up with pneumonia. My family were warned I might not make it through the night. I'm so lucky.' 'The doctor was so, so harsh with me. She told me, 'Paul, you don't know how serious this was and you are going to be in here for a while now, on this oxygen'. The reality star has had a history of addiction, battling drugs and alcohol in the past but he has said that he has been clean for more than three years. He said that the flavours and 'a YouTube video' convinced him that vaping was safer than cigarettes. Nicotine vaping is not risk-free, but it is substantially less harmful than smoking. In 2022, UK experts reviewed the international evidence and found that 'in the short and medium-term, vaping poses a small fraction of the risks of smoking'. Cigarettes release thousands of different chemicals when they burn \u2013 many are poisonous and up to 70 cause cancer. Most of the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke, including tar and carbon monoxide, are not contained in vape aerosol. People who switch completely from smoking to vaping have significantly reduced exposure to toxins associated with risks of cancer, lung disease, heart disease and stroke. Last month Paul looked worlds away from his old self as he appeared on The Dozen with Liam Tuffs podcast. The former Hollyoaks star revisited his past drug addiction, his near-fatal heroin overdose and bedding over one thousand women during the candid interview. The actor, who played Sol Patrick in the soap, sported thick blonde curly hair and looked noticeably different from his soap days when he sported a buzzcut. During the chat, Paul recalled overdosing on heroin shortly after he returned from a rehab stint in South Africa after his time on Hollyoaks. Speaking about the ordeal, he said: 'It took a bad route, a very dark route. Drugs, I had an overdose. I came out of rehab in South Africa. The psychiatrist had put me on all these anti-psychotics. I was there for months. 'I got back home and my parents were so proud of me. I was fat and horrible and didn't feel like myself.' Paul went out to get some cocaine but also ended up buying heroin which he had never taken before. He said: 'They gave me my keys and car and I detoured and got some gear, some coke. I got a bag of brown [heroin] which I'd never done before. 'I snorted it and shouldn't have snorted it because that's dangerous. I ended up having an overdose really bad.' Paul returned home and went to bed but his parents realised something was wrong and called an ambulance. He said: 'My mum found me and I couldn't breath, it was terrible. Apparently my mum heard me gagging on my last breath. She came into the room and couldn't wake me up. 'My little brother was next door which was the saddest thing about it because still to this day he's been traumatised by it. 'She called the ambulance and luckily they were parked down the end of the road. They came and said what has he taken and she said he doesn't do drugs. They knew they had to give me the antidote. F**k me, it was Pulp Fiction. He added: 'All I could see was my dad's face at the end of the ambulance. My mum said to me she'd already said goodbye to me. I saw my dad's face and could see this look of absolute disgust and hate, but relief, \"Oh my God, he's alive.\" ' Elsewhere during the interview, Paul spoke about his many flings and estimated he has slept with over one thousand women. Asked how many women he has slept with, he replied: 'I don't know. I think we're definitely in the higher range. More than a thousand, yeah.' Paul admitted he misses his wild younger days, saying those types of casual flings don't happen as much for him anymore. He said: 'I really miss it. It don't happen like it used to. You have to be careful if you're looking at someone who is 25, is that wrong, is that right? 'Are you alright to fancy someone who's 25, 30? They're not on your level at 45. I am looking more at the 30 range, I need to be attracted.' Paul's battle with drug addiction first began after he left Hollyoaks in 2001 after four years playing Sol. He moved to Los Angeles in an attempt to make it in Hollywood but not having family or friends nearby caused him to use drugs frequently. He said: 'They were selling me as this young Jude Law type guy. You can't party and do well in Hollywood. You've got to be healthy. It was cool but I ended up getting into the wrong type of routine of using drugs. 'I can't handle rejection but I choose the one job that gives you more rejection than any other job. I'm auditioning for big, big movies. 'A lot of the time my life revolved around getting stoned, going to a gig, doing a pill or coke. There was always drugs involved. 'America is very drug orientated if you're young. I was in my twenties. The one thing I needed was family or friends around me and I didn't. It was like the drugs filled that void, they were my friend.' Paul also claimed during the chat he won a small role in the Hollywood comedy Cheaper By The Dozen before the casting agents ultimately decided on Ashton Kutcher for the part. The actor previously told how he relapsed during the first Covid-19 lockdown in the spring of 2020, and ended up homeless - but later turned his life around and is now helping others with addiction problems. He ended up spending three and a half months in rehab, after having previously spent 'about \u00a31million on rehab and recovery' over the years. Paul told The Sun that he decided to move in with his parents in Essex, so that he wouldn't be on his own in Hertfordshire during the first lockdown in March 2020. He believed he'd be fine because he hadn't touched drugs in a year and a half. The Hollyoaks star revealed that - due to his dad being in the high risk category - he couldn't even meet people for walks, and couldn't she his son DeNiro, 6, who was in London with Paul's ex. Paul recalled getting 'really bad cabin fever' and began feeling 'frustrated' as if he was 'going mad,' but gave notice on his flat in May 2020 with no end in sight for the restrictions, because he didn't want to keep paying rent when he wasn't there. Unfortunately, when he went to clear out the flat, the soap star spotted an empty bag of cocaine, which 'triggered something' and left him wanting drugs again. He told the publication: 'I ended up bumping into someone outside and getting some cocaine from them. It was a moment of like, \"F**k it, I'm not going to get another chance.\" Then I went back to my parents and used. 'I only had a few lines but it was enough to get the taste again. They say one line is too many, a thousand is never enough, and that's what it's like. 'I felt terrible, so guilty and ashamed. I reckon over the years I've spent about \u00a31million on rehab and recovery, and yet there I was doing it all again.' Unable to cope living with his parents, Paul decided to attempt to detox by staying with a friend of a friend in Bournemouth. However, the pair fell out, with the friend 'dumping' paul - who 'wasn't really ready to get clean' - at the station and leaving him there. The actor couldn't get into a hotel because of lockdown, so ended up going for a walk along the beach 'and scoring some drugs.' Paul recalled meeting 'dodgy guys' who ended up stealing some of his belongings, and suddenly it was midnight, and he had nowhere to go. He admitted: 'It got scary. I just walked the streets trying to get into places but every hotel said no to me and I was in tears. I was basically homeless.' Despite wanting to be back under his parents roof, they were 'furious' at him because of having to deal with his relapses so many times before. Thankfully a kind taxi driver took him to a hotel owned by his brother, where Paul slept for a few hours before going back to London. There, he booked an assessment at the famous Nightingale Hospital, which treats addicts, but missed the appointment. Paul then 'blagged' a room at a Holiday Inn in London, and found another dealer. He started using every day from the hotel room. The actor revealed that he ate just a croissant per day: 'For two weeks, I didn't sleep and was just taking a few grams of coke all day... I was losing my mind.' Eventually, the star began hallucinating, believing that police were coming to get him and seeing things that weren't real, which he described as 'terrifying.' Thankfully Gladstones - a rehab facility in the Cotswolds - offered to take him within the week, with Paul admitted that it 'saved my life.' He stayed at Gladstones for three and a half months, where they put him on the right ADHD medication and got him a psychiatrist as well as a yoga teacher. While in the facility, Paul pitched his idea for therapeutic drama workshops to different drug and alcohol recovery centres. When he checked out of Gladstones he moved to Bristol where he began his The Morning After Theatre workshops, which has now grown into a charity with ten people working for Paul and his business partner.", "summary": "Love Island's Paul Danan has revealed that he was brought back to life after his 'obsessive' vape usage caused respiratory failure.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13510901/I-dead-miracle-Im-Love-Islands-Paul-Danan-reveals-brought-life-obsessive-vape-usage-caused-respiratory-failure.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/09/15/85898509-0-image-a-53_1717944190073.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2019/02/08/3233710025363442602/1024x576_MP4_3233710025363442602.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:55:34", "author": "Amelia Wynne,Editor", "authors": ["Amelia Wynne", "Editor"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.446}

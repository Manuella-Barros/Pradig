{"id": 232029242, "title": "Keely Hodgkinson opens up on \"torture\" of shock knee injury ahead of Olympics bid", "text": "Keely Hodgkinson says it was torture to have missed more than two months of early season training because of a knee injury. But the 800m star insists that time off will prove a \u201cblessing in disguise\u201d as she aims to defend her European title before upgrading an Olympic silver medal to gold. The 22-year-old gets her Euros campaign underway in Rome on Monday morning as the heaviest of favourites, with a personal best four seconds faster than the rest of the field. And having not run a step for nine weeks at the turn of the year, she is ready to \u201cbe the best I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d Hodgkinson has already run a world-leading 1:55 in her only 800m of the season, a performance that proved the injury that had been kept under wraps is no longer a problem. She had twisted an ankle on a training camp in late 2023 but kept running and that led to \u201ca rip\u201d that caused damage to her knee and hamstring. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t ideal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a bit of a freak accident but what can you do?\u201d And while there were moments in January when she began to feel anxious - \u201cIt was torture, I had to be patient\u201d - she is convinced that doing extra work in the gym has her in prime condition. Hodgkinson knows putting on a show this week will help the psychological battle that awaits in August against Kenya\u2019s Mary Moraa and American Athing Mu and she is viewing the schedule as a dress rehearsal. \u201cThat would always be nice,\u201d she said of putting on a show. \u201cBut it\u2019s still three rounds in three days, which is quite tough. There are two early mornings, which isn\u2019t my thing, but I\u2019m determined to put on a really good performance and see what I can do out there.\u201d It would be a seismic upset for her not to win Wednesday night\u2019s final and it should not be taken as arrogance that she is more focused on challenging herself rather than the prospect of being challenged by the others in the field. \u201cI'll always respect the competition but I am four seconds clear of the next person,\u201d she said. \u201cSo how do I keep the motivation high? I want to attack every race, I don\u2019t want to have 1:55 here and 1:58 the next week, I want to be as consistent as possible.\u201d Then it will be on to the British trials at the end of the month and the London Diamond League before her Olympic showdown. Will that be the night she peaks and fulfils her dream? \u201cI haven't let you down so far, have I? No, I'm joking\u201d she said. But really it was only half-joking.", "summary": "The GB 800m star is overwhelming favourite to win gold at the European Championships in Rome this week but she admits it was hard to stay patient when sidelined by knee injury at start of year", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/athletics/keely-hodgkinson-opens-up-torture-32992661", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32992652.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-2154658345.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:11:34", "author": "Alan Smith,Alansmithjourrnalist", "authors": ["Alan Smith", "Alansmithjourrnalist"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.39}

{"id": 231244540, "title": "Queen Sonja of Norway calls art a \u2018unifying force in turbulent times\u2019 at printmaking awards", "text": "Queen Sonja of Norway has described art as a \u201cunifying force in turbulent times\u201d as she awarded the world\u2019s most important prize for printmaking to Tomas Colbengtson, an indigenous S\u00e1mi artist. At a ceremony in Bod\u00f8, a European Capital of Culture for 2024, Queen Sonja also presented Anselm Kiefer with a lifetime achievement award and the young Swedish artist, Maria Kayo Mpoyi, with an inspiration award. Speaking to The Independent, the Norwegian monarch emphasised the importance of communication and shared culture in \u201cturbulent times\u201d. Her remarks come as Europe prepares for a series of elections this week in which far-right parties are expected to gain footholds. Queen Sonja added: \u201cWe just have to go on.\u201d Bod\u00f8 is one of three European Capitals of Culture in 2024 and has more than 1,000 events scheduled throughout the year. Historian and television presenter Simon Schama, who gave a lecture on the work of the acclaimed artist Keifer, used the awards to warn of the importance of preserving printmaking and graphic art now that the \u201cthreatening age of AI is upon us\u201d. S\u00e1mi artist Colbengtson won the Queen Sonja Print Award 2024, while Kiefer was awarded the Queen Sonja Print Award Lifetime Achievement Award, and the Swedish artist Maria Kayo Mpoyi won the QSPA Inspirational Award. \u201cI am delighted that this year the award has gone to a Sami artist,\u201d Queen Sonja said. \u201cTomas Colbengtson\u2019s work is already represented in museum collections and I hope this prize will make his work know even more widely internationally\u201d. Discussing how his work is inspired by the destruction of S\u00e1mi culture in Norway in the first half of the 20th century, Colbengtson\u2019s work attempts to preserve the life and traditions of Indigenous communities by reflecting culture through art. However, indigenous communities are still facing the loss of their livelihoods and identities due to an erosion of rights as Norway\u2019s transition from gas and oil to green energies, which have come at the cost of land traditionally used by S\u00e1mi people to herd reindeer. The topic of art\u2019s role in peace was also central to discussions throughout the awards. During Schama\u2019s talk on printmaking, the historian took issue with the Norwegian playwright and Nobel Prize winner Jon Fosse, who said in March that \u201cwar and art are opposites, just as war and peace are opposites. Art is peace\u201d. Schama countered: \u201cIt would be nice to think that art was the conveyor of peace. But I\u2019m frankly not sure about this. I don\u2019t know that anyone who has an encounter with the Sistine Chapel comes out feeling more peaceful, or with a Caravaggio, or with Jackson Pollock, or with one of the great works of Anselm Kiefer. \u201cI think art has the capacity, like strong history, to be a disturber of the peace. One of the measures of great art and great history, I think, is that it\u2019s likely to give you insomnia, even if there is no midnight sun around\u201d. Anselm Kiefer joins past winners of The Queen Sonja Lifetime Achievement Award including David Hockney in 2018, Paula Rego in 2020, and William Kentridge in 2022. HM Queen Sonja said: \"It is a great honour for the QSPA board to present Anselm Kiefer with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his distinguished contribution to the art of printmaking through a long and outstanding career\".", "summary": "<p>Anselm Kiefer\u00a0received\u00a0The Queen Sonja Lifetime Achievement Award</p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/queen-sonja-printmaking-award-anselm-kiefer-colbengtson-b2559140.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/08/13/Her20Majesty20Queen20Sonja20of20Norway.2020Photo20by20JC3B8rgen20GomnC3A6s2C20the20Royal20Court.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:22:18", "author": "Rod Ardehali", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.874}

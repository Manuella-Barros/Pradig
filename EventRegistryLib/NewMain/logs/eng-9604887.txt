(Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, file)WASHINGTON (AP) - President Joe Biden's campaign on Tuesday showed up outside former President Donald Trump's New York City criminal hush money trial in an effort to refocus the presidential race on the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol insurrection. It was a sharp about-face for Biden's team, which had largely ignored the trial since it began six weeks ago and is now looking to capitalize on its drama-filled closing moments, sending actor Robert De Niro and some of the first responders who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6. A top Biden adviser said they weren't there to talk about the trial, rather to exploit the large media focus on the legal proceedings. \"We're not here today because of what's going on over there,\"\u009d Biden campaign communication director Michael Tyler told reporters, gesturing toward the courthouse. \"We're here today because you all are here.\"\u009d The Biden campaign last week released a new ad that was narrated by De Niro sharply criticizing Trump's presidency and plans if he's reelected. \"I don't mean to scare you. No, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you,\"\u009d De Niro told reporters. \"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\u009d \"I love this city. I don't want to destroy it,\"\u009d De Niro added. \"Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city but the country, and, eventually, he could destroy the world.\"\u009d Former Washington, D.C., police officer Michael Fanone and former Capitol police officer Harry Dunn spoke of their personal experiences on Jan. 6, with Fanone describing his injuries suffered at the hands of the mob of Trump supporters seeking to halt Congress' certification of Biden's 2020 presidential victory. \"I came here today to remind Americans of what Donald Trump is capable of and the violence that he unleashed on all of Americans on Jan. 6, 2021,\" Fanone said. Added Dunn, who recently lost a Democratic primary race for the House in Maryland, \"We can't count on these institutions to stop Donald Trump. It's going to take us Americans at the ballot box to defeat him once and for all.\" Trump's allies planned their own press conference Tuesday, with the Republican former president's adviser Jason Miller saying the Democratic president's event proved Trump's argument that his prosecution was politically motivated. \"Joe's crookeds aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA - they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\"\u009d he posted on X. \"It's always been about politics.\"\u009d", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"},

But the event did not focus on the hush money case. Instead, it was a campaign speech filled with attacks on Donald Trump.\n\nJoining De Niro were two former Capitol Police officers who clashed with Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021: Michael Fanone and Harry Dunn. A Biden campaign official said the event was being held near the courthouse to take advantage of the contingent of media gathered there.\n\n\"We're not here today because of what's going on over there,\" Michael Tyler, the Biden campaign's communication director, said to reporters at the event. \"We're here today because you all are here.\"\n\nThe press conference follows the Biden campaign unveiling an ad last week in which De Niro called Trump \"blatantly stupid,\" \"a punk,\" \"a con\" and \"an embarrassment to this country,\" adding, \"I'd like to punch him in the face.\"\n\nDe Niro continued to go after Trump on Tuesday as he claimed freedom and democracy are on the line in the election.\n\n\"Under Trump, this kind of government will perish from the earth,\" the \"Goodfellas\" star said. \"I don't mean to scare you. No, no, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you. If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted. And the elections, forget about it. That's all done. If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave.\"\n\n\"We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another crappy real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot,\" he added. \"I love this city. I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city but the country, and, eventually, he could destroy the world.\"\n\nDe Niro said he hopes his ad campaign will reach \"outside the bubble to remind supporters of what a danger he is to our lives.\"\n\n\"This is not a threat; this is a reality,\" De Niro said. \"And that's why I've joined the Biden-Harris campaign, because the only way to preserve our freedoms and hold on to our humanity is to vote for Joe Biden for president. Really. We don't have a choice.\"\n\nAt one point, De Niro got into an exchange with a Trump supporter. De Niro had just called them \"true heroes,\" when the heckler accused them of lying under oath and called them \"traitors.\"\n\n\"I don't even know how to deal with you,\" De Niro told the man.\n\n\"They stood there and fought for us, for you. For you!\" the actor added.\n\nAfter the heckler responded, \"They weren't fighting for me,\" De Niro told him: \"No, no they fought for you, buddy. You're able to stand right here now.\"\n\nFanone said he was there to remind Americans \"of what Donald Trump is capable of and the violence that he unleashed on all Americans on Jan. 6, 2021.\"\n\nHe said Trump supporters who attacked police officers were fueled by Trump's lies about fraud in the presidential election, adding the lies \"continue to this day\" and \"inspire my fellow Americans to turn against their fellow Americans, to turn against police officers.\"\n\nDunn said: \"Americans need to wake up. This is not a drill.\"\n\n\"We can't count on these institutions to stop Donald Trump,\" he said. \"It's going to take us Americans at the ballot box to defeat him once and for all.\"\n\nDe Niro got into a heated exchange with Trump supporters after he walked away from the news conference.\n\nVideo shows the actor, surrounded by a sea of journalists, telling Trump supporters, \"You are gangsters!\"\n\nAfter one of them tells De Niro, \"You're washed up,\" the \"Taxi Driver\" star responds, \"F*** you!\"\n\nAnother Trump supporter then hit De Niro with a series of insults as the movie star walked away.\n\n\"You're a punk!\" the man wearing a red \"Make America Great\" cap said. \"You're a softy! You're a nobody! Your movies suck! You're trash! You're trash! You're done! You're done after this!\"\n\nTrump senior campaign adviser Jason Miller called De Niro a \"washed-up actor\" and decried the fact that Biden's reelection bid \"showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump.\" Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt called it \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top\" -- even though in recent weeks, allies of the former president, including elected Republican officials and former rivals for the GOP presidential nomination, have taken to holding press conferences of their own outside of the courthouse to rail against the case and show their support for Trump.\n\nTrump's eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and daughter-in-law Lara Trump, the co-chair of the Republican National Committee, held a press conference of their own on Tuesday to rail against the case.\n\n\"He needs attention because it's been a while since he cranked out a good movie,\" Donald Trump Jr. said of De Niro, adding of the Biden campaign: \"The fact that they are holding a rally across the street from this very witch hunt, right across the street, tells us exactly what we all knew all along, which is that it is a political persecution.\"", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Biden's campaign had been wary about feeding into Trump's argument that his criminal trials were the result of politically motivated prosecutions, but ultimately it decided to engage because its message about the stakes of the election was struggling to break through the intense focus on the trial.\n\nA top Biden adviser said they weren't there to talk about the trial -- and De Niro and the officers didn't reference the sordid criminal case directly -- rather to exploit the large media focus on the legal proceedings. But Trump advisers argued in a dueling press conference that the Biden team's presence validated the Republican former president's claims that his prosecutions are being driven by politics.\n\n\"We're not here today because of what's going on over there,\" Biden campaign communication director Michael Tyler told reporters, gesturing toward the courthouse. \"We're here today because you all are here.\"\n\nThe back-to-back press conferences were a side show to the main event playing out inside the courthouse, where closing arguments were under way in the only Trump trial likely to surface before the November election. There are two others directly related to the Republican's efforts to undo his 2020 loss to Biden, a Democrat: A federal case in Washington is related to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, and a state case in Georgia accuses him of election interference. He has pleaded not guilty in those cases.\n\nThe Biden campaign last week released a new ad that was narrated by De Niro sharply criticizing Trump's presidency and plans if he's reelected.\n\n\"I don't mean to scare you. No, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you,\" De Niro told reporters. \"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nThe actor cast himself as the true New Yorker and mocked Trump's history of sometimes-unsuccessful business ventures and self-promotion, saying Trump was looking to \"destroy\" the city.\n\n\"We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another crappy real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot,\" De Niro said. \"I love this city.

Hundreds of law enforcement officers were beaten and bloodied in the attack by Trump supporters, who descended after a rally and smashed into the Capitol while Trump remained silent for hours.\n\n\"Americans need to wake up.

\"It's going to take us Americans at the ballot box to defeat him once and for all.\"\n\nTrump's campaign staffers held their own news conference at the same spot outside the courthouse to respond to De Niro, the Jan. 6 officers and the Biden campaign.\n\nTrump's senior campaign adviser, Jason Miller, called De Niro -- who won Oscars for his roles in \"The Godfather: Part II\" and \"Raging Bull\" -- \"a washed-up actor\" and said the Biden news conference proved Trump's arguments that the trial, like the others the former president is facing, was motivated by politics.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said its event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"", "source": {"uri": "capitalgazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Capital Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@capitalgazette.com", "name": "Associated Press",

Hundreds of law enforcement officers were beaten and bloodied in the attack by Trump supporters, who descended after a rally and smashed into the Capitol while Trump remained silent for hours. \"Americans need to wake up. This is not a drill,\"\u009d said Harry Dunn, a former Capitol police officer who ran unsuccessfully for office in Maryland. \"We can't count on these institutions to stop Donald Trump,\" he added. \"It's going to take us Americans at the ballot box to defeat him once and for all.\" Trump's aides held their own press conference after the Democrats concluded, with adviser Jason Miller suggesting that the Biden team's presence validated Trump's contention that his criminal issues were \"all politics.\"\u009d \"If you don't think this is politics, why did the Democrats wheel out a retread like Robert De Niro,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "medicinehatnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medicine Hat News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@medicinehatnews.com", "name": "Canadian

A top Biden adviser said they weren't there to talk about the trial, rather to exploit the large media focus on the legal proceedings.\n\nLive updates: Closing arguments in Trump's hush money trial\n\n\"We're not here today because of what's going on over there,\" Biden campaign communication director Michael Tyler told reporters, gesturing toward the courthouse. \"We're here today because you all are here.\"\n\nThe New York trial is the first of four criminal trials for Trump, likely the only one before the November election. There are two others directly related to the Republican's efforts to undo his 2020 loss to Biden: A federal case in Washington is related to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, and a state case in Georgia accuses him of election interference.

This is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all.\"\n\nIf Trump returns to the White House, he said, Americans could see the civil liberties they take for granted evaporate as well as the end of elections.\n\n\"If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave,\" said De Niro.\n\nTrump hush money trial live coverage: Judge calls defense closing argument 'outrageous'\n\nFanone and Dunn delivered emotional remarks, saying violence at the Capitol was fueled by Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen. The speakers were heckled by a Trump supporter as pro-Trump demonstrators chanted in the background.\n\nTrump campaign officials said the De Niro event showed desperation in the Biden camp.\n\nSpokesman Steven Cheung, taking the podium shortly afterwards, said the Biden camp was in \"complete freakout mode\" over Trump's resilience despite the multiple criminal cases against him.\n\n\"Joe Biden is losing nationally,\" said Jason Miller, another Trump spokesperson. \"President Trump's numbers continue to rise. And the best that Biden can do is roll out a washed up actor.\"\n\nRobert De Niro accused of berating pro-Palestinian protesters during filming for Netflix show\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found the two men effectively tied among registered voters.\n\nIn his most biting comments, De Niro spoke of Trump through the lens of the largely Democratic city whose voters know Trump well and roundly rejected him at the polls.\n\n\"We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot, a two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids,\" he said. \"A clown...No one took him seriously.

This is not a drill,\" said Mr Dunn, a former Capitol police officer who ran unsuccessfully for office in Maryland.\n\n\"We can't count on these institutions to stop Donald Trump,\" he added.\n\n\"It's going to take us Americans at the ballot box to defeat him once and for all.\"\n\nTrump's campaign staff held their own news conference at the same spot outside the courthouse to respond to De Niro, the January 6 officers and the Biden campaign.\n\nTrump's senior campaign adviser, Jason Miller, called De Niro - who won Oscars for his roles in The Godfather: Part II and Raging Bull - \"a washed-up actor\" and said the Biden news conference proved Trump's arguments that the trial, like the others the former president is facing, was motivated by politics.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Mr Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said its event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that

You are gangsters. You are gangsters!\" De Niro shouts at the Trump supporters, as expletives are hurled at him by by the swarming and raucous crowd.\n\nDe Niro was appearing on behalf of the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris presidential campaign, just outside the Manhattan court where Trump's closing hush money trial arguments are underway. The former president denies criminal charges of falsifying business documents ahead of the 2016 election.\n\nAs the Oscar-winning star walks to his vehicle, Trump supporters continue to hurl insults at De Niro, while security guards push back the angry crowd.\n\n\"You're not going to intimidate. That's what Trump does. They try to intimidate. And we're going to fight back!\" De Niro says in another video, posted to X by NewsNation's Kristen Eskow.\n\nNewsweek emailed a representative for De Niro for further comment about Tuesday's press conference.\n\nFormer Washington, D.C., police officer Michael Fanone and former Capitol police officer Harry Dunn joined De Niro and spoke of their personal experiences in the January 6 Capitol riot. Fanone described his injuries suffered at the hands of the mob of Trump supporters seeking to halt Congress' certification of Biden's 2020 presidential victory.\n\nDe Niro consistently faced interruptions from Trump supporters on the scene in Manhattan. A honking horn in the background also drowned out portions of De Niro's remarks.\n\nOne Trump supporter called the January 6 Capitol police officers \"traitors\" who \"lied under oath. De Niro fired back: \"I don't even know how to deal with you, my friend. I don't even know how to deal with you!\"\n\nAt the end of his remarks outside the courthouse, another Trump supporter shouted that Dunn and Fanone were \"traitors.\"\n\nDe Niro then replied, \"They stood there. They didn't have to. They stood there and fought for us. They fought for you, buddy. You're able to stand right here. They are the true heroes. I'm honored to be with these two heroes today.\"\n\nDe Niro added that the former President wants to \"sow total chaos,\" and people in the crowd screamed \"f*** you\" as the actor continued speaking.\n\n\"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye, that we all take for granted,\" De Niro said. \"If he gets in... he will never leave.\"\n\n\"I don't mean to scare you. No, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you,\" De Niro told reporters. \"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\n\"I love this city. I don't want to destroy it,\" De Niro added. \"Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city but the country, and, eventually, he could destroy the world.\"\n\nDe Niro also called Trump a \"two-bit playboy.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump doesn't belong in my city. We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot,\" the actor said. \"A two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids. He's a clown. But this person can't run the country. That does not work, and we all know that.\"\n\nTuesday's press conference marked a notable turn for the Biden campaign, which has largely dismissed the hush money trial since it began six weeks ago.\n\n\"We're not here today because of what's going on over there,\" Biden campaign communication director Michael Tyler told reporters before the press conference, gesturing toward the courthouse. \"We're here today because you all are here.\"\n\nJason Miller, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, took aim at De Niro's appearance on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"Don't worry, my remarks will be shorter than The Irishman,\" Miller said, referencing De Niro's three-plus hour Netflix movie. \"The best that Biden can do is roll out a washed-up actor.\"\n\nDe Niro was nominated for the 2024 Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role Oscar in Killers of the Flower Moon, which grossed $157 million worldwide, according to multiple sources.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType":

Forget about it. That's over. That's done. If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave.\"\n\nAs the conference continued, the Republican National Committee excoriated De Niro for wearing a mask and participating in a \"deranged witch hunt\" against Trump in a social media post. The conference was unusually chaotic as protesters yelled epithets and a car alarm disrupted De Niro as he spoke.\n\nAt one point De Niro had to contend with a bystander who defended the Jan. 6 rioters and called the police officers \"traitors.\"\n\n\"I don't even know how to deal with you, my friend,\" De Niro said to the man in a bit of back-and-forth at the press conference.\n\nDe Niro continued to be taunted by Trump supporters when he left the press conference.\n\nDe Niro recently narrated a 30-second \"Snapped\" ad for the Biden campaign that blasted Trump for being \"out of control\" when he lost the 2020 election.\n\n\"I hope this new ad campaign reaches outside the bubble to remind supporters of what a danger he is to our lives. This is not a threat. This is our reality,\" De Niro warned. \"And that's why I've joined the Biden-Harris campaign because the only way to preserve our freedoms and hold on to our humanity is to vote for Joe Biden for president.\"\n\nIn a twist of the law-and-order campaign that Republicans have long run in support of, De Niro also blamed rising crime rates on Trump.\n\n\"It's no surprise that the murder rate and other violent crimes peaked under Trump and are now falling under Biden,\" he said. \"And now he's promising to use our own military to attack U.S. citizens. That's the tyrant.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nTrump's campaign surrogates quickly responded to the allegations from De Niro, slamming him as a \"retread\" in their own press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"The Biden folks have finally done it. After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" said Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller, who argued Biden made the public relations change because he's losing in the polls. \"President Trump's numbers continue to rise and the best that Biden can do is roll out a washed up actor.\"\n\nTuesday marks the beginning of the closing arguments of the trial against Trump after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses testified before the jury. The Biden campaign has stayed away from commenting on the trial until Tuesday during the surprise press conference.\n\nOther Biden campaign surrogates pointed to the violence of the Capitol riot as an example of why Trump should not be reelected. They, too, were met with profanities and a car alarm blasting as they spoke.\n\n\"I came here today to remind Americans of what Donald Trump is capable of,\" Fanone said. \"And the violence that he unleashed on all Americans on Jan. 6, 2021.\"\n\nFanone recounted the harrowing story of being beaten by protesters who descended on the Capitol in 2021.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"I'm just one representative of the hundreds of police officers that were assaulted that day by Donald Trump supporters inspired by his lies,\" he said. \"The lies that continue to this day to inspire my fellow Americans to turn against their fellow Americans to turn against police officers.\"\n\nDunn recently lost a Democratic primary for Maryland's 3rd Congressional District this month but has continued to campaign with Democrats against Trump, who he blames for the Capitol riot.\n\n\"Donald Trump is the greatest threat to our democracy and the safety of communities across the country today,\" Dunn said. \"Political violence is never acceptable. But you have a presidential candidate, you have a presidential candidate that champions it, that encourages it, that supports it. We cannot have that.\"\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters. Success!

The campaign brought out actor Robert De Niro to do its dirty work.\n\nIt can't be stressed enough - Team Biden and the Biden White House is in a deep panic. They see the writing on the wall as the state of the presidential race stands today. Joe Biden is losing badly to Donald Trump. This election will be decided by a few counties in a handful of battleground states. To date, Trump is ahead of Biden in all of the battleground states except Wisconsin, where the two candidates are tied.\n\nThe Biden campaign sent out a media advisory for their event that can only be seen as an attempt to interfere with a criminal trial. In true Biden campaign style, the wrong date was on it. Today is May 28 and the media advisory put the date of the press conference as May 27. Dorks.\n\nThis stunt was a truly horrible idea. The only campaign decision worse is that Biden will speak from the White House after Trump's trial verdict is announced. From the White House. Let that settle in.\n\nAlong with De Niro, the campaign also brought along two Capitol Police officers from Washington. They were both involved in the J6 riot. Harry Dunn -- who is running for Congress, and Michael Fanone were with the Biden campaign today. It's not political. Why do you think this stunt was political?\n\nRemember when Joe Biden ran for president and promised a return to normal? Nothing has been normal with his administration. Americans are divided as never before. The country is going to hell in a handbasket while Biden eats ice cream and spends weekends at his beach house.\n\nBiden and the Democrats are waging lawfare against his opponent, Donald Trump, to keep Trump out of the White House and Biden in power. This has never been seen before. It's all political with Team Biden and the stunt in front of the courthouse in Manhattan was proof of that.\n\nBelieve it or not, the campaign rolled out actor Robert De Niro as their new spokesperson. It is hard to imagine a more Trump-deranged celebrity than De Niro. I have written about his hatred of Trump for years.\n\nIn 2018, De Niro showed his derangement to the world when he was announced at the Tony Awards. He came on stage and screamed, \"F*** Trump!\" The audience went wild for that.\n\nDe Niro continues to use every television appearance to promote his unhinged behavior against Trump. He can't let it go. In 2019, De Niro thought Buttigieg would be the strongest candidate to beat Trump. Heh.\n\nHe loves to drop an F-bomb. All of his acceptance speeches turn into a political screed. In 2023, De Niro brought out the sad trombones when Trump announced his re-election bid. Trump didn't win in 2016, you know, SHE did. De Niro has gotten so predictable and so bad that one award event allegedly edited his speech to take out his ugliness toward Trump. That is what De Niro claimed.\n\nYou get the picture.\n\nOf course, it was ridiculous that the press conference opened with Michael Tyler, the Biden-Harris communication director, stating that the stunt was not political. They truly think people are stupid.\n\nWhen De Niro began to speak, he slammed the Trump supporters who were there to protest the trial. He called the supporters \"clowns,\" the same word used by New York Governor Hochul when Trump held his big campaign rally in the Bronx. Democrats don't learn.\n\n\"If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave! He will never leave! You know that. He will never leave,\" DeNiro said, claiming that Trump would make himself \"dictator for life.\"\n\n\"What does that mean? Is that the country we want to live in? Do we want him running this country and saying, 'I'm not leaving, I'm dictator for life'?\" he added.\n\n\"I hope this new ad campaign reaches outside the bubble to remind supporters of what a danger he is to our lives. This is not a threat, this is a reality,\" he continued.\n\nHe read his remarks. He was an actor reading a script.\n\nWhat better way to draw attention to the politics of the lawfare conducted against Trump than for Biden's campaign to hold a press conference in front of the courthouse while Trump was sitting in a courtroom?\n\nToo bad for De Niro and his fellow TDS travelers that Trump has a record in office. He left the White House on the day he was required to do so. Biden is the one grasping for power, trying to keep his opponents off the ballot and, in the case of Trump, in jail. Biden's America is beginning to look like a banana republic.\n\nAs he left, Trump supporters yelled at De Niro. He returned fire by claiming Democrats are \"trying to be gentlemen\" and calling the Trump supporters \"gangsters.\"\n\nCringeworthy stuff, old man.\n\nRobert De Niro won't change a single mind. He comes off as an unhinged maniac. He didn't even read his script well. It was like someone handed it to him before he went to the mic to speak.\n\nThe Biden campaign is counting on stunts like this to pull him over the finish line in November.

But Trump advisers argued at a dueling news conference that the presence of Biden's team confirmed claims by former Republican presidents that his prosecutions were politically motivated.\n\nWe're not here today because of what's happening there, Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler told reporters, pointing to the courthouse.

The debates are expected to last all day. Follow live updates.

the January 6 officers and the Biden campaign.\n\nTop Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller called De Niro, who won Oscars for his roles in The Godfather: Part II and Raging Bull, a failed actor and said Biden's press conference proved the Trump's arguments that the trial, like others the former president. faced, was politically motivated.\n\nAfter months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a day-long trial for President Trump in Lower Manhattan a campaign event, Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, press secretary for the Trump campaign, called the Biden

Donald Trump has created this. He should be telling them not to do this... he wants to sow total chaos, which he's succeeding in some areas and places to do,\" De Niro said.\n\n\"I don't mean to scare you. No no, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you. If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss away these freedoms that we take for granted and elections, forget about it... he will never leave,\" he added.\n\nTyler also said that the campaign wanted to warn against Trump ahead of the first presidential debate, which is set for June.\n\n\"We want to remind the American people ahead... of the first debate on June 27 of the unique, persistent, growing threat Donald Trump poses to the American people and towards democracy,\" Tyler said.\n\nPolice officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Dunn and Fanone, stood behind De Niro as he criticized Trump over actions both before and after his career in politics.\n\n\"I love this city, I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only this city but the country and eventually he will destroy the world,\" De Niro said.\n\n\"We vowed that we would not allow terrorists -- \" he said, stopping himself.\n\nHe said in New York, locals used to \"tolerate him\" when Trump was a real estate mogul, arguing that no one took him seriously at the time.\n\nThe actor then focused on Jan. 6, calling out Trump to further warn against another presidency. He said that Trump rallied \"an angry mob\" on Jan. 6, saying that he \"ran and hid in the White House\" during it.\n\n\"He doesn't get blood on his hands... he directs the angry mob to do his dirty work for him,\" he said.\n\nFanone spoke after De Niro, describing in detail the brutality that happened to him during the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol. Dunn then spoke, arguing that Trump \"encourages\" political violence.\n\nSenior adviser Jason Miller, after the Biden team press conference, called De Niro a \"washed up\" actor and cited a report from Politico that Democrats are in a \"full blown 'freakout'\" over Biden this election cycle.", "source": {"uri": "who13.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "who13.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_gangitano@who13.com", "name": "Alex Gangitano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lower Manhattan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(communications_strategist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (communications strategist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://who13.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2024/05/deniro_trump_courthouse.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604887", "eventUri": "eng-9604887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 41, "textEnd": 47, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1819, "textEnd": 1826}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Biden's campaign had been wary about feeding into Trump's argument that his criminal trials were the result of politically motivated prosecutions, but ultimately it decided to engage because its message about the stakes of the election was struggling to break through the intense focus on the trial.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But Trump advisers argued in a dueling press conference that the Biden team's presence validated the Republican former president's claims that his prosecutions are being driven by politics.\n\n\"We're not here today because of what's going on over there,\" Biden campaign communication director Michael Tyler told reporters, gesturing toward the courthouse. \"We're here today because you all are here.\"\n\nThe back-to-back press conferences were a side show to the main event playing out inside the courthouse, where closing arguments were under way in the only Trump trial likely to surface before the November election. There are two others directly related to the Republican's efforts to undo his 2020 loss to Biden, a Democrat: A federal case in Washington is related to his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, and a state case in Georgia accuses him of election interference. He has pleaded not guilty in those cases.\n\nThe Biden campaign last week released a new ad that was narrated by De Niro sharply criticizing Trump's presidency and plans if he's reelected.\n\n\"I don't mean to scare you. No, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you,\" De Niro told reporters. \"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nThe actor cast himself as the true New Yorker and mocked Trump's history of sometimes-unsuccessful business ventures and self-promotion, saying Trump was looking to \"destroy\" the city.\n\n\"We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another crappy real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot,\" De Niro said. \"I love this city. I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city but the country, and, eventually, he could destroy the world.\"\n\nFormer Washington, D.C., police officer Michael Fanone and former Capitol police officer Harry Dunn spoke of their personal experiences on Jan. 6, with Fanone describing his injuries suffered at the hands of the mob of Trump supporters seeking to halt Congress' certification of Biden's 2020 presidential victory.\n\n\"I came here today to remind Americans of what Donald Trump is capable of and the violence that he unleashed on all of Americans on Jan. 6, 2021,\" Fanone said.\n\nThe two former officers were also witnesses during a congressional investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. Hundreds of law enforcement officers were beaten and bloodied in the attack by Trump supporters, who descended after a rally and smashed into the Capitol while Trump remained silent for hours.\n\n\"Americans need to wake up. This is not a drill,\" said Harry Dunn, a former Capitol police officer who ran unsuccessfully for office in Maryland.\n\n\"We can't count on these institutions to stop Donald Trump,\" he added. \"It's going to take us Americans at the ballot box to defeat him once and for all.\"\n\nTrump's campaign staffers held their own news conference at the same spot outside the courthouse to respond to De Niro, the Jan. 6 officers and the Biden campaign.\n\nTrump's senior campaign adviser, Jason Miller, called De Niro -- who won Oscars for his roles in \"The Godfather: Part II\" and \"Raging Bull\" -- \"a washed-up actor\" and said the Biden news conference proved Trump's arguments that the trial, like the others the former president is facing, was motivated by politics.\n\n\"After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" Miller said.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's press secretary, called the Biden campaign \"desperate and failing\" and \"pathetic\" and said its event outside the trial was \"a full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Forget about it. That's over. That's done. If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave.\"\n\nAs the conference continued, the Republican National Committee excoriated De Niro for wearing a mask and participating in a \"deranged witch hunt\" against Trump in a social media post. The conference was unusually chaotic as protesters yelled epithets and a car alarm disrupted De Niro as he spoke.\n\nAt one point De Niro had to contend with a bystander who defended the Jan. 6 rioters and called the police officers \"traitors.\"\n\n\"I don't even know how to deal with you, my friend,\" De Niro said to the man in a bit of back-and-forth at the press conference.\n\nDe Niro recently narrated a 30-second \"Snapped\" ad for the Biden campaign that blasted Trump for being \"out of control\" when he lost the 2020 election.\n\n\"I hope this new ad campaign reaches outside the bubble to remind supporters of what a danger he is to our lives. This is not a threat. This is our reality,\" De Niro warned. \"And that's why I've joined the Biden-Harris campaign because the only way to preserve our freedoms and hold on to our humanity is to vote for Joe Biden for president.\"\n\nIn a twist of the law-and-order campaign that Republicans have long run in support of, De Niro also blamed rising crime rates on Trump.\n\n\"It's no surprise that the murder rate and other violent crimes peaked under Trump and are now falling under Biden,\" he said. \"And now he's promising to use our own military to attack U.S. citizens. That's the tyrant.\"\n\nTrump's campaign surrogates quickly responded to the allegations from De Niro, slamming him as a \"retread\" in their own press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"The Biden folks have finally done it. After months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event of a lower Manhattan trial day for President Trump,\" said Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller, who argued Biden made the public relations change because he's losing in the polls. \"President Trump's numbers continue to rise and the best that Biden can do is roll out a washed up actor.\"\n\nTuesday marks the beginning of the closing arguments of the trial against Trump after more than four weeks and nearly two dozen witnesses testified before the jury. The Biden campaign has stayed away from commenting on the trial until Tuesday during the surprise press conference.\n\nOther Biden campaign surrogates pointed to the violence of the Capitol riot as an example of why Trump should not be reelected. They, too, were met with profanities and a car alarm blasting as they spoke.\n\n\"I came here today to remind Americans of what Donald Trump is capable of,\" Fanone said. \"And the violence that he unleashed on all Americans on Jan. 6, 2021.\"\n\nFanone recounted the harrowing story of being beaten by protesters who descended on the Capitol in 2021.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"I'm just one representative of the hundreds of police officers that were assaulted that day by Donald Trump supporters inspired by his lies,\" he said. \"The lies that continue to this day to inspire my fellow Americans to turn against their fellow Americans to turn against police officers.\"\n\nDunn recently lost a Democratic primary for Maryland's 3rd Congressional District this month but has continued to campaign with Democrats against Trump, who he blames for the Capitol riot.\n\n\"Donald Trump is the greatest threat to our democracy and the safety of communities across the country today,\" Dunn said. \"Political violence is never acceptable. But you have a presidential candidate, you have a presidential candidate that champions it, that encourages it, that supports it. We cannot have that.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mabinty_quarshie@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Mabinty Quarshie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fanone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fanone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Violent crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lower Manhattan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(communications_strategist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (communications strategist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24149547576005.jpg.optimal.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604887", "eventUri": "eng-9604887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1171, "textEnd": 1177}], "sentiment": -0.207843137254902, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city but the country, and, eventually, he could destroy the world.\"\n\nFormer Washington DC police officer Michael Fanone and former Capitol police officer Harry Dunn spoke of their personal experiences on January 6, with Mr Fanone describing his injuries suffered at the hands of the mob of Trump supporters seeking to halt Congress's certification of Mr Biden's 2020 presidential victory.\n\n\"I came here today to remind Americans of what Donald Trump is capable of and the violence that he unleashed on all of Americans on January 6 2021,\" Mr Fanone said.\n\nThe two former officers were also witnesses during a congressional investigation of the January 6 2021 riot.\n\nHundreds of law enforcement officers were beaten and bloodied in the attack by Trump supporters, who descended after a rally and smashed into the Capitol while Trump remained silent for hours.\n\n\"Americans need to wake up.

Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world,' De Niro said.\n\nA group of Trump supporters could be heard in the background chanting, 'f*** Joe Biden.'\n\nActor Robert De Niro showed up outside of former President Donald Trump's hush money trial Tuesday as a guest of President Joe Biden's campaign\n\nDe Niro called Trump a slew of names and then had some heated altercations with some of the former president's supporters\n\n'We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot,' De Niro said of Trump. 'A two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids. A clown.'\n\n'But this city is pretty accommodating. We make room for clowns,' the actor continued. 'But not a person like Trump, who will eventually run the country, that does not work and we all know that.'\n\nDe Niro said that Trump voters 'bought into his bulls***.'\n\n'Trump bought their votes with outrageous lies and empty promises,' the actor said.\n\nDe Niro, with Dunn and Fanone hovering behind him, recalled how Trump was able to get a angry mob to assault the capitol on January 6.\n\nHe said this is what motivated him to do the voiceover in a new Biden-Harris campaign ad.\n\n'It shows the violence of Trump and reminds us that he'll use violence against anyone who stands in the way of his megalomania and greed,' the actor said. 'But it's a coward's violence,' he added.\n\n'You think Trump ever threw a punch himself or took one?' De Niro mused. 'This guy who ran and hid in the White House bunker when there were protesters outside? No way. He doesn't get blood on his hands. No he doesn't. He directs the mob to do his dirty work for him.'\n\nDe Niro pointed to reports that said Trump would use the U.S. military to quell future protests against him.\n\n'That's the tyrant he's telling us he'll be,' the actor warned.\n\nTrump spokesperson Jason Miller ridiculed the Biden campaign bringing De Niro out telling reporters afterward 'the best they can do is roll out a washed up actor.'\n\nOne of Trump's supporters used that same insult on De Niro as he departed.\n\n'You're washed up,' a Trump supporter yelled at the actor.\n\n'You are gangster,' De Niro said.\n\n'F*** you,' the actor also offered.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fanone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fanone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Protests against Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narcissistic personality disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(communications_strategist)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (communications strategist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gangster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Conferences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Maxi-Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Maxi-Basketball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/28/16/85429193-0-image-a-8_1716911661923.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604887", "eventUri": "eng-9604887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1637, "textEnd": 1646}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

De Niro showed up alongside Capitol Police officers Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone as special guests of President Joe Biden's campaign.\n\nThe actor called Trump a 'clown' but also warned that reelecting him would be dangerous. 'I love this city I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world,' De Niro said.\n\nA group of Trump supporters could be heard in the background chanting, '[Expletive] Joe Biden.' 'We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot,' De Niro said of Trump. 'A two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids. A clown.'\n\n'But this city is pretty accommodating. We make room for clowns,' the actor continued. 'But not a person like Trump, who will eventually run the country, that does not work and we all know that.' De Niro said that Trump voters 'bought into his [expletive].'\n\n'Trump bought their votes with outrageous lies and empty promises,' the actor said. De Niro, with Dunn and Fanone hovering behind him, recalled how Trump was able to get an angry mob to assault the capitol on January 6.\n\nHe said this is what motivated him to do the voiceover in a new Biden-Harris campaign ad . 'It shows the violence of Trump and reminds us that he'll use violence against anyone who stands in the way of his megalomania and greed,' the actor said. 'But it's a coward's violence,' he added.\n\n'You think Trump ever threw a punch himself or took one?' De Niro mused. 'This guy who ran and hid in the White House bunker when there were protesters outside? No way. He doesn't get blood on his hands. No he doesn't. He directs the mob to do his dirty work for him.'\n\nDe Niro pointed to reports that said Trump would use the U.S. military to quell future protests against him. 'That's the tyrant he's telling us he'll be,' the actor warned. Trump spokesperson Jason Miller ridiculed the Biden campaign for bringing De Niro out telling reporters afterward 'the best they can do is roll out a washed-up actor.'\n\nOne of Trump's supporters used that same insult on De Niro as he departed. 'You're washed up,' a Trump supporter yelled at the actor. 'You are gangster,' De Niro said. '[Expletive] you,' the actor also offered.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

He said New Yorkers once tolerated Trump, but now recognize his threat.\n\n\"I love this city. I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city, but the country, and eventually he can destroy the world,\" De Niro said.\n\nDe Niro added that if \"Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nDe Niro recently voiced an anti-Trump ad for the Biden campaign.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Actor Robert De Niro called Donald Trump a \"clown\" who is bent on destroying American democracy on Tuesday outside the New York City courtroom where the Republican presidential candidate's hush money trial is being held.\n\nDe Niro, a longtime Democrat who recently voiced an ad for Democratic President Joe Biden, attended a Biden campaign event outside the Manhattan courtroom with two former law enforcement officers, Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone, who were at the U.S. Capitol when it was attacked by Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe remarks are part of the Biden campaign's attempt to use wall-to-wall media coverage of the Trump trial to push their own message: Trump is a danger to democracy.\n\nTrump's campaign dismissed the event as a stunt.\n\nReferring to Trump's successful 2016 run for president, Academy Award winner De Niro said Trump's candidacy was initially laughed off as a joke.\n\n\"We've forgotten the lessons of history that showed us other clowns who weren't taken seriously until they became vicious dictators,\" he said. \"With Trump we have a second chance and no one is laughing now. This is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all.\"\n\nIf Trump returns to the White House, he said, Americans could see the civil liberties they take for granted evaporate as well as the end of elections.\n\n\"If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave,\" said DeNiro.\n\nFanone and Dunn delivered emotional remarks, saying violence at the Capitol was fueled by Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen. The speakers were heckled by a Trump supporter as pro-Trump demonstrators chanted in the background.\n\nTrump campaign officials said the De Niro event showed desperation in the Biden camp.\n\nSpokesman Steven Cheung, taking the podium shortly afterwards, said the Biden camp was in \"complete freakout mode\" over Trump's resilience despite the multiple criminal cases against him.\n\n\"Joe Biden is losing nationally,\" said Jason Miller, another Trump spokesperson. \"President Trump's numbers continue to rise. And the best that Biden can do is roll out a washed up actor.\"\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found the two men effectively tied among registered voters.\n\nIn his most biting comments, De Niro spoke of Trump through the lens of the largely Democratic city whose voters know Trump well and roundly rejected him at the polls.\n\n\"We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot, a two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids,\" he said. \"A clown...No one took him seriously.

De Niro's remarks aimed to leverage media coverage of Trump's trial to convey Biden's message. Trump supporters dismissed the event as a desperate stunt by the Biden camp.\n\nBy Doina Chiacu and Trevor Hunnicutt WASHINGTON, May 28 (Reuters) -\n\nActor Robert De Niro called Donald Trump a \"clown\" who is bent on destroying American democracy on Tuesday outside the New York City courtroom where the Republican presidential candidate's hush money trial is being held. De Niro, a longtime Democrat who recently voiced an ad for Democratic President Joe Biden, attended a Biden campaign event outside the Manhattan courtroom with two former law enforcement officers, Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone, who were at the U.S. Capitol when it was attacked by Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe remarks are part of the Biden campaign's attempt to use wall-to-wall media coverage of the Trump trial to push their own message: Trump is a danger to democracy. Trump's campaign dismissed the event as a stunt.\n\nReferring to Trump's successful 2016 run for president, Academy Award winner De Niro said Trump's candidacy was initially laughed off as a joke. \"We've forgotten the lessons of history that showed us other clowns who weren't taken seriously until they became vicious dictators,\" he said. \"With Trump we have a second chance and no one is laughing now. This is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all.\"\n\nIf Trump returns to the White House, he said, Americans could see the civil liberties they take for granted evaporate as well as the end of elections. \"If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave,\" said DeNiro.\n\nFanone and Dunn delivered emotional remarks, saying violence at the Capitol was fueled by Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen. The speakers were heckled by a Trump supporter as pro-Trump demonstrators chanted in the background. Trump campaign officials said the De Niro event showed desperation in the Biden camp.\n\nSpokesman Steven Cheung, taking the podium shortly afterwards, said the Biden camp was in \"complete freakout mode\" over Trump's resilience despite the multiple criminal cases against him. \"Joe Biden is losing nationally,\" said Jason Miller, another Trump spokesperson. \"President Trump's numbers continue to rise. And the best that Biden can do is roll out a washed up actor.\"\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found the two men effectively tied among registered voters. In his most biting comments, De Niro spoke of Trump through the lens of the largely Democratic city whose voters know Trump well and roundly rejected him at the polls.\n\n\"We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot, a two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids,\" he said. \"A clown...No one took him seriously.

The press conference marked a key moment where President Biden's campaign took a turn and waded into a trial they had avoided for the past six weeks.\n\nMr. Tyler told reporters the campaign visited the Manhattan courthouse on May 28 because \"you all are here,\" referring to members of the media.\n\n\"We want to remind the American people ahead of the next debate ... of the unique, persistent, and growing threat that Donald Trump poses to the American people and to our democracy. So since you all are here, we are here communicating that message,\" he said.\n\nMr. Tyler was asked if there was a political motivation for the Biden campaign's visit to the courthouse, given President Trump's accusations of politically motivated prosecutions in his multiple criminal indictments.\n\n\"Again. You all are already here,\" Mr. Tyler replied. \"It's easy to talk about the choice in this election when the entire news media is camped out here day in and day out.\"\n\nHowever, questions about whether President Biden would comment on the case or whether the state-level trial is a \"political weaponization of the Justice Department\" went unanswered. Trump advisers hosted a separate press conference where they suggested that the presence of the Biden campaign outside the courthouse validated the political narrative of the prosecution.\n\nMr. Tyler said they were there not for the trial but to speak to the media about \"the entirety of what voters are going to be taking to the ballot box\" ahead of the first presidential debate in June.\n\nMr. De Niro and the two Jan. 6 police officers, Michael Fanone and Harry Dunn, did not discuss the trial in their speeches.\n\nThe actor, known for movies like \"The Godfather Part 2,\" \"Taxi Driver,\" and \"Goodfellas,\" was featured in a Biden campaign ad the previous week where he criticized President Trump and his reelection platform.\n\n\"I don't mean to scare you. No, no, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you. If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted,\" Mr. De Niro said at the press conference.\n\n\"If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave.\"\n\nMr. De Niro said that New Yorkers like himself \"used to tolerate\" President Trump, who is also a New Yorker, but alleges the former president wants to \"destroy\" the City of Dreams.\n\n\"I love this city. I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city but the country, and, eventually, he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the actor was heckled by several supporters of the former president and, at one point, stopped to argue with a man who accused Mr. Fanone and Mr. Dunn of lying about their experiences on Jan. 6.\n\n\"My friend, I don't even know how to deal with you,\" Mr. De Niro said to the heckler. \"They stood there and fought for us, for you.\"\n\nMr. Fanone, a former DC police officer, recounted the moment when Jan. 6 protesters tried to take his weapon as he was \"beaten\" by people in the crowd. He alleged that President Trump isn't running to be a \"public servant\" but rather as an \"authoritarian who answers to and serves only himself.\"\n\nMr. Dunn, a former Capitol police officer, said Americans \"need to wake up\" and that \"We can't count on these institutions to stop Donald Trump.\"\n\nJason Miller, President Trump's senior campaign adviser, called Mr. De Niro a \"washed-up actor\" and argued the press conference proved the former president's allegations about the trial's political motivations.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's press secretary, echoed those comments and said the event was a \"full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NTD"}, "authors": [],

This case would have been laughed out of any other courtroom in America, legal scholars on both sides of the aisle even liberal legal scholars agree there is no crime there is no case, but Joe Biden knew he could use Alvin Bragg, who is sitting in that courthouse today, wasting away the tax dollars of the hard working people of this city to go after, Joe Biden's political opposition,\" said Trump campaign staffer Karoline Leavitt.\n\nTrump's trial on Tuesday turns on the testimony of a prosecution witness. His defense team is asking jurors for an acquittal in the first criminal case against a former American president.", "source": {"uri": "turnto10.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WJAR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jamel_valencia@turnto10.com", "name": "Jamel Valencia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriot (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courthouse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Courthouse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch-hunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witch-hunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://turnto10.com/resources/media/d62c4ad2-97c1-49f6-942e-071108a0479c-large16x9_AP24149526871208.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604887", "eventUri": "eng-9604887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 1067, "textEnd": 1076}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

This is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all.\"\n\nIf Trump returns to the White House, he said, Americans could see the civil liberties they take for granted evaporate as well as the end of elections.\n\n\"If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave,\" said DeNiro.\n\nFanone and Dunn delivered emotional remarks, saying violence at the Capitol was fueled by Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen. The speakers were heckled by a Trump supporter as pro-Trump demonstrators chanted in the background.\n\nTrump campaign officials said the De Niro event showed desperation in the Biden camp.\n\nSpokesman Steven Cheung, taking the podium shortly afterwards, said the Biden camp was in \"complete freakout mode\" over Trump's resilience despite the multiple criminal cases against him.\n\n\"Joe Biden is losing nationally,\" said Jason Miller, another Trump spokesperson. \"President Trump's numbers continue to rise. And the best that Biden can do is roll out a washed up actor.\"\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found the two men effectively tied among registered voters.\n\nIn his most biting comments, De Niro spoke of Trump through the lens of the largely democratic city whose voters know Trump well and roundly rejected him at the polls.\n\n\"We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot, a two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids,\" he said. \"A clown...No one took him seriously.

The press conference marked a key moment where President Biden's campaign took a turn and waded into a trial they had avoided for the past six weeks.\n\nMr. Tyler told reporters the campaign visited the Manhattan courthouse on May 28 because \"you all are here,\" referring to members of the media.\n\n\"We want to remind the American people ahead of the next debate ... of the unique, persistent, and growing threat that Donald Trump poses to the American people and to our democracy. So since you all are here, we are here communicating that message,\" he said.\n\nMr. Tyler was asked if there was a political motivation for the Biden campaign's visit to the courthouse, given President Trump's accusations of politically motivated prosecutions in his multiple criminal indictments.\n\n\"Again. You all are already here,\" Mr. Tyler replied. \"It's easy to talk about the choice in this election when the entire news media is camped out here day in and day out.\"\n\nHowever, questions about whether President Biden would comment on the case or whether the state-level trial is a \"political weaponization of the Justice Department\" went unanswered. Trump advisers hosted a separate press conference where they suggested that the presence of the Biden campaign outside the courthouse validated the political narrative of the prosecution.\n\nMr. Tyler said they were there not for the trial but to speak to the media about \"the entirety of what voters are going to be taking to the ballot box\" ahead of the first presidential debate in June.\n\nMr. De Niro and the two Jan. 6 police officers, Michael Fanone and Harry Dunn, did not discuss the trial in their speeches.\n\nThe actor, known for movies like \"The Godfather Part 2,\" \"Taxi Driver,\" and \"Goodfellas,\" was featured in a Biden campaign ad the previous week where he criticized President Trump and his reelection platform.\n\n\"I don't mean to scare you. No, no, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you. If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted,\" Mr. De Niro said at the press conference.\n\n\"If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave.\"\n\nMr. De Niro said that New Yorkers like himself \"used to tolerate\" President Trump, who is also a New Yorker, but alleges the former president wants to \"destroy\" the City of Dreams.\n\n\"I love this city. I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city but the country, and, eventually, he could destroy the world.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the actor was heckled by several supporters of the former president and, at one point, stopped to argue with a man who accused Mr. Fanone and Mr. Dunn of lying about their experiences on Jan. 6.\n\n\"My friend, I don't even know how to deal with you,\" Mr. De Niro said to the heckler. \"They stood there and fought for us, for you.\"\n\nMr. Fanone, a former DC police officer, recounted the moment when Jan. 6 protesters tried to take his weapon as he was \"beaten\" by people in the crowd. He alleged that President Trump isn't running to be a \"public servant\" but rather as an \"authoritarian who answers to and serves only himself.\"\n\nMr. Dunn, a former Capitol police officer, said Americans \"need to wake up\" and that \"We can't count on these institutions to stop Donald Trump.\"\n\nJason Miller, President Trump's senior campaign adviser, called Mr. De Niro a \"washed-up actor\" and argued the press conference proved the former president's allegations about the trial's political motivations.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's press secretary, echoed those comments and said the event was a \"full-blown concession that this trial is a witch hunt that comes from the top.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

I grew up here and feel at home in these streets,\" he said, before remarking on the strangeness of Trump being in a courtroom across the street, \"because he doesn't belong in my city\".\n\nThe former president and presumptive 2024 Republican presidential nominee had been tolerated in the Big Apple, said the actor, when he was \"just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot\".\n\nBut now the stakes had been raised and Trump, De Niro explained, had a vision of dictatorial power that had prompted him to step into the political arena, citing the mob violence from Trump's supporters that accompanied the storming of the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.\n\n\"That's why I needed to be involved ... in the new Biden-Harris ad, because it shows the violence of Trump,\" he said.\n\nDe Niro invoked the lessons of Monday's Memorial Day holiday, held to celebrate the US's fallen military heroes, and quoted Abraham Lincoln in saying they had died so that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth\".\n\nStepping back into Hollywood gangland rhetoric, De Niro warned: \"Under Trump, this kind of government will perish from the earth. I don't mean to scare you. No, no, wait - maybe I do mean to scare you. If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted. And elections? Forget about it.\"\n\nBut arguably the most belittling reference concerned Trump's taste for political violence, which De Niro dismissed as \"a coward's violence\".\n\n\"You think Trump ever threw a punch himself or took one?\" he asked. \"No way. He doesn't get blood on his hands. He directs the mob to do his dirty work for him by making a suggestion, an inference.\"\n\nThe punch reference recalled Raging Bull, the 1980 biopic in which De Niro played Jake LaMotta, the turbulent boxer who was once world middleweight champion.\n\nHis depiction of LaMotta's sometimes menacing persona sprung to mind as the actor bristled at being heckled by a Trump supporter as he introduced two police officers, Michael Fanone and Harry Dunn, who had been present at the Capitol on 6 January 2021 as it was assailed by a mob trying to prevent Congress certifying Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\n\"They lied under oath,\" said the out-of-camera-shot heckler, who was heard to add: \"They're traitors.\"\n\nDe Niro glared then countered: \"Excuse me, they lied under oath. What are you saying? They're traitors. I don't even know how to deal with you, my friend.\n\n\"They stood there and fought for us, for you ... they fought for you, buddy, you're able to stand right here now. They are the true heroes.\"\n\nFanone, who served as a Washington DC police officer recounted how he was violently attacked and beaten by members of the mob, one of whom tried to take his firearm. All had been \"inspired by lies\" told by Trump, he said.\n\nComing to the microphone after De Niro had left the scene, Trump's campaign adviser, Jason Miller, ridiculed both Biden and the Hollywood star.\n\n\"The best that Biden can do is roll out a washed up actor - and don't worry, my remarks will be shorter than The Irishman,\" he said, invoking one of De Niro's later films, directed by Martin Scorsese. \"I won't make you suffer for three hours.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Each was there to speak to the media about the \"threat\" Trump poses to the United States.\n\nWhile the Biden campaign spokesman said they were not there because of what was happening inside the courtroom but instead to speak to the assembled media, he went on to say, \"The contrast here pretty much writes itself. As we speak, Donald Trump, somewhere fighting for himself, maybe taking a power nap. And we've seen him for weeks and for months, we've seen the ramblings of an unhinged, power-hungry, self-centered man, both here, at Mar-a-Lago, on Truth Social, wherever he may be.\"\n\n-- (@)\n\nWhen it was De Niro's turn to speak, he invoked the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and said, like the terrorists who attacked New York City, Trump will destroy the Big Apple, the United States, and possibly the world.\n\n\"The Twin Towers fell just over here, just over there. This part of the city was like a ghost town, but we vowed we would not allow terrorists to change our way of life. And we started the Tribeca Festival to bring people back. I love this city. I love this city. I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city, but the country, and eventually he could destroy the world,\" De Niro said.\n\n'If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye.'\n\n\"But we vowed we would not allow terrorists ... I owe this city a lot. That's why it is so weird that Donald Trump is just across the street. He doesn't belong in my city. I don't know where he belongs. But he certainly doesn't belong here. We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler ... big shot pretending to be a spokesman, a spokesperson for himself,\" he continued.\n\n-- (@)\n\nWhen De Niro started to shower praise on Dunn and Fanone, someone could be heard off camera telling De Niro they had lied under oath about what they did during the riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nDe Niro became exasperated during the exchange and tried to convince the man Dunn and Fanone had fought for the country.\n\n\"They stood there and fought, for us! For you!\" the actor shouted.\n\n\"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted. And elections? Forget about it. That's over, that's done. If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave. He will never leave. You know that.

He directs the mob to do his dirty work for him by making a suggestion, an inference.\"\n\nThe punch reference recalled Raging Bull, the 1980 biopic in which De Niro played Jake LaMotta, the turbulent boxer who was once world middleweight champion.\n\nHis depiction of LaMotta's sometimes menacing persona sprung to mind as the actor bristled at being heckled by a Trump supporter as he introduced two police officers, Michael Fanone and Harry Dunn, who had been present at the Capitol on 6 January 2021 as it was assailed by a mob trying to prevent Congress certifying Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\n\"They lied under oath,\" said the out-of-camera-shot heckler, who was heard to add: \"They're traitors.\"\n\nDe Niro glared then countered: \"Excuse me, they lied under oath. What are you saying? They're traitors. I don't even know how to deal with you, my friend.\n\n\"They stood there and fought for us, for you ... they fought for you, buddy, you're able to stand right here now. They are the true heroes.\"\n\nFanone, who served as a Washington DC police officer recounted how he was violently attacked and beaten by members of the mob, one of whom tried to take his firearm. All had been \"inspired by lies\" told by Trump, he said.\n\nComing to the microphone after De Niro had left the scene, Trump's campaign adviser, Jason Miller, ridiculed both Biden and the Hollywood star.\n\n\"The best that Biden can do is roll out a washed up actor - and don't worry, my remarks will be shorter than The Irishman,\" he said, invoking one of De Niro's later films, directed by Martin Scorsese. \"I won't make you suffer for three hours.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She has been working at PEOPLE since 2023. Her work previously appeared on ok.co.uk, in OK! Magazine and Reach PLC magazines.\n\nAs closing arguments in Donald Trump's historic criminal trial began, the Biden reelection campaign sent actor Robert De Niro and Jan. 6 first responders to speak outside the New York City courthouse where the case has unfolded.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign showed up outside the Manhattan criminal courthouse on Tuesday, May 28, amid Trump's \"hush money\" trial, which began on April 15. Trump, 77, is facing 34 felony counts of falsified business records related to how he allegedly documented reimbursements for a hush money payment made to former adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\n\nBiden, 81, has stayed quiet about Trump's trial so far, and according to the Associated Press, a Biden adviser told reporters that the campaign wasn't there to talk about the trial, but rather to take advantage of the major media focus on the legal proceedings.\n\n\"We're not here today because of what's going on over there,\" Biden 2024 communications director Michael Tyler said. \"We're here today because you all are here.\"\n\nThe move was an effort to refocus the presidential race on the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, according to AP.\n\n\"I don't mean to scare you. No, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you,\" De Niro, 80, told reporters outside the courthouse. \"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\n\"I love this city. I don't want to destroy it,\" added De Niro, who was born in Manhattan. \"Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city but the country, and, eventually, he could destroy the world.\"\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.\n\n\"He doesn't belong in my city, I don't know where he belongs, but he certainly doesn't belong here,\" he continued, per Fox News. \"We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot, a two-bit Playboy lying his way into the tabloids, pretending to be a spokesman, a spokesperson for himself. He was calling it as himself for himself, to fool the press into inflating his net worth.\"\n\n\"A clown, but this city is pretty accommodating. We make room for clowns. We have them all over the city, people who do crazy things in the street, we tolerate it, it's part of the city, it's part of the culture, but not a person like Trump who'll eventually run the country, that does not work and we all know that,\" he said.\n\nDe Niro's appearance outside the courthouse comes after the Biden campaign released a new advertisement narrated by De Niro that criticized Trump seeking another White House term and called him \"out of control.\"\n\nFormer Washington, D.C., police officer Michael Fanone and former Capitol police officer Harry Dunn also spoke outside the courthouse on Tuesday, according to AP.\n\nFanon described his injuries from the riot, which took place two months after Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden and saw Trump supporters storm the Capitol in a bid to overturn the election result as lawmakers gathered inside to certify Biden's victory.\n\n\"I came here today to remind Americans of what Donald Trump is capable of and

And we've seen him for weeks and for months, we've seen the ramblings of an unhinged, power-hungry, self-centered man, both here, at Mar-a-Lago, on Truth Social, wherever he may be.\"\n\nWhen it was De Niro's turn to speak, he invoked the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and said, like the terrorists who attacked New York City, Trump will destroy the Big Apple, the United States, and possibly the world.\n\n\"The Twin Towers fell just over here, just over there. This part of the city was like a ghost town, but we vowed we would not allow terrorists to change our way of life. And we started the Tribeca Festival to bring people back. I love this city. I love this city. I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city, but the country, and eventually he could destroy the world,\" De Niro said.\n\n'If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye.'\n\n\"But we vowed we would not allow terrorists ... I owe this city a lot. That's why it is so weird that Donald Trump is just across the street. He doesn't belong in my city. I don't know where he belongs. But he certainly doesn't belong here. We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler ... big shot pretending to be a spokesman, a spokesperson for himself,\" he continued.\n\nWhen De Niro started to shower praise on Dunn and Fanone, someone could be heard off camera telling De Niro they had lied under oath about what they did during the riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nDe Niro became exasperated during the exchange and tried to convince the man Dunn and Fanone had fought for the country.\n\n\"They stood there and fought, for us! For you!\" the actor shouted.\n\n\"They didn't fight for me,\" the man shot back.\n\n\"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted. And elections? Forget about it. That's over, that's done. If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave. He will never leave. You know that. He will never leave,\" De Niro went on to say.\n\nOutside observers noted the poor optics of Biden's campaign hosting a press conference while closing arguments in Trump's trial were taking place, further giving credence that the trial is solely politically motivated.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fanone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fanone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Center_(1973\u20132001)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribeca", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tribeca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tribeca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_town", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghost town"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/robert-de-niro-warns-trump-could-destroy-the-world-in-unhinged-biden-campaign-presser.jpg?id=52334135&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C82", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604887", "eventUri": "eng-9604887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2001-09-11", "textStart": 966, "textEnd": 984}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

This is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all.\"\n\nIf Trump returns to the White House, he said, Americans could see the civil liberties they take for granted evaporate as well as the end of elections.\n\n\"If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave,\" said DeNiro.\n\nFanone and Dunn delivered emotional remarks, saying violence at the Capitol was fueled by Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen. The speakers were heckled by a Trump supporter as pro-Trump demonstrators chanted in the background.\n\nTrump campaign officials said the De Niro event showed desperation in the Biden camp.\n\nSpokesman Steven Cheung, taking the podium shortly afterwards, said the Biden camp was in \"complete freakout mode\" over Trump's resilience despite the multiple criminal cases against him.\n\n\"Joe Biden is losing nationally,\" said Jason Miller, another Trump spokesperson. \"President Trump's numbers continue to rise. And the best that Biden can do is roll out a washed up actor.\"\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found the two men effectively tied among registered voters.\n\nIn his most biting comments, De Niro spoke of Trump through the lens of the largely Democratic city whose voters know Trump well and roundly rejected him at the polls.\n\n\"We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot, a two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids,\" he said. \"A clown...No one took him seriously.

But it was undoubtedly meant to draw attention to the criminal defendant inside the nearby building.\n\n\"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted,\" De Niro said, with chanting protesters and a car alarm blaring in the background. \"And elections -- forget about it, that's all. That's done, if he gets in, I can tell you right now -- he will never leave. He will never leave.\"\n\nPreviously, Biden's team had been wary of doing or saying anything that might appear to politicize the former president's trial. In their view, Trump's trial would speak for itself, reintroducing the former president and the chaos that surrounds him to voters who may have tuned him out.\n\nSome of Biden's allies had questioned that notion, however, suggesting Trump had already done plenty to politicize his legal issues and that Biden -- if he wanted to capture voters' attention -- would be wise to weigh in as well.\n\nTuesday's event amounted to a nod to the second approach.\n\n\"The entire news media is camped out here, day in and day out,\" campaign communications director Michael Tyler said, explaining the choice to address reporters outside the lower Manhattan courthouse.\n\nAside from De Niro, who recently narrated an ad slamming Trump, two police offers who were present at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and attacked by pro-Trump rioters were featured: Michael Fanone and Harry Dunn.\n\n\"At the end of the day, this election is about Donald Trump and his vision for the office of the president of the United States -- not as a public servant who answers to the elected -- to the people who elected him, but as an authoritarian, who answers to, and serves only, himself,\" Fanone said.\n\nTop Trump advisers Jason Miller, Steven Cheung and Karoline Leavitt spoke to reporters immediately after the news conference. Miller bashed the two-time Oscar winner.\n\n\"The best they can do is roll out a washed up actor,\" Miller said.\n\nHe echoed Trump's attacks on Judge Juan Merchan as \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted,\" and continued to argue the case was \"complete garbage.\"\n\nThe president's team sees an opening once the trial concludes to become more aggressive in their framing of Trump as a threat to democracy, all leading up to the CNN debate on June 27. On everything from the ads the campaign runs to the messaging and rhetoric that comes from the president himself to growing the campaign's infrastructure, a person familiar with the campaign's thinking said, the Biden team recognizes that once the Trump trial -- and the aggressive media coverage of it -- is over, there will be more room and opportunities to make their case to the American people ahead of November.\n\nBiden campaign officials are still grappling with the reality, this person said, that a substantial part of the population still doesn't see that the choice on Election Day will be between Biden and Trump.\n\nAnd while the campaign will need to calibrate its messaging and strategy based on how exactly Trump's trial ends, this person insisted that at the end of the day, the thrust of their case against the former president won't change -- whether Trump emerges a convicted felon or not.\n\nDe Niro presented the main theme of that messaging on Tuesday. He blasted the former president as \"a tyrant\" and \"a coward,\" telling reporters that as New Yorkers, they tolerated the former real estate mogul as \"just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot, a two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids.\"\n\nAnd he said that the stakes of November's election are what prompted him to join the campaign for a new ad released last week.\n\n\"That's why I needed to be involved and wanted to be involved in the new Biden-Harris ad, because it shows the violence of Trump and reminds us that he'd use violence against anyone who stands in the way of his megalomania and greed,\" De Niro said. \"You think Trump ever threw a punch himself or took one? This guy ran and hid in the White House bunker when there were protesters outside -- no way. He doesn't get blood on his hands. No, he doesn't. He directs the mob to do his dirty work for him.\"\n\nAs CNN reported on Friday, the Biden campaign effectively launched the start of that next phase by releasing a scorching new ad called \"Snapped,\" narrated by Niro.\n\n\"We knew Trump was out of control when he was president,\" De Niro says over a shot of Trump behind the Resolute Desk. \"Then he lost the 2020 election and snapped.\"\n\nThe ad describes Trump as \"desperately\" trying to cling to power while showing images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The phrases \"dictator\" and \"terminate the Constitution\" flash on screen, followed by a clip of Trump saying, \"If I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath.\"\n\nFanone, a former Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Officer who was attacked during the January 6 insurrection, said that he was \"just one representative of the hundreds of police officers that were assaulted that day by Donald Trump's supporters inspired by his lies, the lies that continue to this day to inspire my fellow Americans to turn against their fellow Americans, to turn against police officers.\"\n\nDunn, a former US Capitol Police officer, called Trump \"the greatest threat to our democracy and the safety of communities across the country today.\"\n\n\"He has encouraged and continues to encourage political violence. We've been called traitors - just today. We were all called traitors on January 6, for doing our job,\" Dunn said. \"Political violence is never acceptable, but you have a presidential candidate that champions it, that encourages it, that supports it. We cannot have that.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Biden's reelection campaign said it was enlisting police officers working at the US Capitol on January 6 to stump for Biden across battleground states in the coming weeks.\n\nSgt. Aquilino Gonell and officer Danny Hodges also plan to join Dunn in telling voters that Trump poses a threat to democracy and to their fundamental rights as Americans. Dunn and Gonell sustained injuries during the attack on the Capitol and have since retired from the Capitol Police. Hodges continues to serve with DC's Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nCNN's Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

While all the cameras were there, they wanted to get their moment in the sun. And it was a big mistake. It politicizes the trial. Better to have waited. And then what was said, with all due respect to Mr. De Niro, who's a wonderful, wonderful actor... \"Donald Trump wants to destroy New York, destroy America, and destroy the world. And if you reelect him, he's never going to leave office. He's going to make himself a tyrant for life.\" Are those the kind of credible statements that are going to cause people who don't like Biden and don't like Trump, but are trying to figure out who to vote for, are they going to cause people to say, 'well, geez, you now told me you wanted to destroy our country.' Of course he did. The people who believe that are already in the Biden camp. That's not who they should be trying to reach out to. He came close in a moment of talking about January 6th and talking about the two officers, but that might have had an impact. But this was so over-the-top as to simply be useless. And what a stupid mistake on the part of the Biden campaign. More reason why Democratic leaders are probably going to be concerned that he's the likely nominee of their party.\n\nAs closing arguments were heard in the former president's criminal trial, the Biden-Harris team held a press conference outside the Manhattan courtroom where the actor made his thoughts about the 45th president clear.\n\n\"Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city, but the country. And eventually he could destroy the world,\" he said.\n\n\"I owe this city a lot. And that's why it's so weird that Donald Trump is just across the street because he doesn't belong in my city. I don't know where he belongs, but he certainly doesn't belong here. We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot,\" De Niro added.\n\nThe actor was joined by the Biden campaign's communications director, Michael Tyler, who called Trump a \"chaos agent,\" as well D.C. Metropolitan Police Department Officer Michael Fanone and former Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, who was present in the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nPresident Biden and Vice President Harris were not present during the event.\n\nThe Trump campaign held a separate press conference Tuesday, following the Biden campaign's presser with De Niro, where Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller slammed De Niro as a \"washed up actor.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump's highly-controversial N.Y. criminal trial served as the backdrop for the dueling press conferences.\n\nThe former president is facing the end of his trial in Manhattan, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nBy Doina Chiacu and Trevor Hunnicutt\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Actor Robert De Niro called Donald Trump a \"clown\" who is bent on destroying American democracy on Tuesday outside the New York City courtroom where the Republican presidential candidate's hush money trial is being held.\n\nDe Niro, a longtime Democrat who recently voiced an ad for Democratic President Joe Biden, attended a Biden campaign event outside the Manhattan courtroom with two former law enforcement officers, Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone, who were at the U.S. Capitol when it was attacked by Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThe remarks are part of the Biden campaign's attempt to use wall-to-wall media coverage of the Trump trial to push their own message: Trump is a danger to democracy.\n\nTrump's campaign dismissed the event as a stunt.\n\nReferring to Trump's successful 2016 run for president, Academy Award winner De Niro said Trump's candidacy was initially laughed off as a joke.\n\n\"We've forgotten the lessons of history that showed us other clowns who weren't taken seriously until they became vicious dictators,\" he said. \"With Trump we have a second chance and no one is laughing now. This is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all.\"\n\nIf Trump returns to the White House, he said, Americans could see the civil liberties they take for granted evaporate as well as the end of elections.\n\n\"If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave,\" said DeNiro.\n\nFanone and Dunn delivered emotional remarks, saying violence at the Capitol was fueled by Trump's lies that the 2020 election was stolen. The speakers were heckled by a Trump supporter as pro-Trump demonstrators chanted in the background.\n\nTrump campaign officials said the De Niro event showed desperation in the Biden camp.\n\nSpokesman Steven Cheung, taking the podium shortly afterwards, said the Biden camp was in \"complete freakout mode\" over Trump's resilience despite the multiple criminal cases against him.\n\n\"Joe Biden is losing nationally,\" said Jason Miller, another Trump spokesperson. \"President Trump's numbers continue to rise. And the best that Biden can do is roll out a washed up actor.\"\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll last week found the two men effectively tied among registered voters.\n\nIn his most biting comments, De Niro spoke of Trump through the lens of the largely Democratic city whose voters know Trump well and roundly rejected him at the polls.\n\n\"We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot, a two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids,\" he said. \"A clown...No one took him seriously. They take him seriously now.\"\n\n(Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Trevor Hunnicutt; editing by Deepa Babington)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Byron Donalds of Florida, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, former GOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, and several U.S. senators including JD Vance of Ohio, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and Rick Scott of Florida.\n\nTrump's campaign lined up allies to appear at the courthouse to attack witnesses and others whom Trump is barred by a judge's gag order from criticizing himself.\n\nDonalds and Burgum are both considered possible vice presidential candidates for Trump.\n\nEarlier, Trump spoke to reporters as he made his way into the courtroom.\n\nThe former president carried a sheet of paper and read quotes off of it from political and legal commentators who have attacked the hush money case, a feature Trump has made a regular part of his trial routine. He called Judge Juan M. Merchan \"corrupt\" and \"conflicted\" but said he couldn't speak about it because of the gag order.\n\n\"We'll see how it goes. This is a very dangerous day for America. It's a very sad day,\" Trump said.\n\nHe was accompanied by three of his children, Don Jr., Eric and Tiffany, along with one of his de facto campaign managers Susie Wiles.\n\nRELATED: Trump hush money trial: Insights from previous high-profile cases\n\nProsecutors say the former president falsified internal business records to cover up hush money payments tied to a scheme to buy and bury negative stories that potentially threatened his 2016 presidential bid.\n\nHe has denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty to all 34 felony counts.\n\nClosing arguments are expected to last all day

He also referred to the presidential aspirant as a \"clown,\" noting that everyone could kiss their freedom goodbye \"if Trump returns to the white house.\"\n\nRobert De Niro's presence did not sit well with Donald Trump's supporters, especially in the heat of the hush money trail's closing arguments. Not minding the security detail surrounding the actor, angry Trump supporters heckled him right outside the courtroom, hauling expletives at him. Many also threw words accusing De Niro of being a traitor to his people and the Jews.\n\nAt some point, Robert De Niro seemed fed up with the obscenities, halting his steps to fire back at the MAGA mob, per TMZ. He shot,\n\n\"We're trying to be gentlemen in this world, the Democrats. You are gangsters! F-k you!!!\"\n\nHis comment did little to quelch the sea of vitriol around him, but De Niro did not seem to mind. He maintained his composure throughout his stay outside the trial's venue, speaking to various reporters about Donald Trump's dark deeds, and the dangers of voting for him.\n\nOf course, this isn't the first time Robert De Niro would stand in for the Democrats in a public campaign against Donald Trump. Days back, Joe Biden's campaign released an advertisement condemning Trump's second bid for the presidency, calling him \"out of control.\" The voice behind the Biden-approved campaign was none other than De Niro. With Trump's hush money trial coming to a close, the equally outspoken Republican just might have enough leverage to shoot back with his own nerve-wracking propaganda.", "source": {"uri": "thenerdstash.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nerd Stash"}, "authors": [{"uri": "judith_ike@thenerdstash.com", "name": "Judith Ike", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Irishman_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Irishman (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Propaganda"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Maxi-Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Maxi-Basketball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://media.thenerdstash.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Robert-De-Niro-actor.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604887", "eventUri": "eng-9604887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

But it was undoubtedly meant to draw attention to the criminal defendant inside the nearby building.\n\n\"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted,\" De Niro said, with chanting protesters and a car alarm blaring in the background. \"And elections -- forget about it, that's all. That's done, if he gets in, I can tell you right now -- he will never leave. He will never leave.\"\n\nPreviously, Biden's team had been wary of doing or saying anything that might appear to politicize the former president's trial. In their view, Trump's trial would speak for itself, reintroducing the former president and the chaos that surrounds him to voters who may have tuned him out.\n\nSome of Biden's allies had questioned that notion, however, suggesting Trump had already done plenty to politicize his legal issues and that Biden -- if he wanted to capture voters' attention -- would be wise to weigh in as well.\n\nTuesday's event amounted to a nod to the second approach.\n\n\"The entire news media is camped out here, day in and day out,\" campaign communications director Michael Tyler said, explaining the choice to address reporters outside the lower Manhattan courthouse.\n\nAside from De Niro, who recently narrated an ad slamming Trump, two police offers who were present at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, and attacked by pro-Trump rioters were featured: Michael Fanone and Harry Dunn.\n\n\"At the end of the day, this election is about Donald Trump and his vision for the office of the president of the United States -- not as a public servant who answers to the elected -- to the people who elected him, but as an authoritarian, who answers to, and serves only, himself,\" Fanone said.\n\nThe president's team sees an opening once the trial concludes to become more aggressive in their framing of Trump as a threat to democracy, all leading up to the CNN debate on June 27. On everything from the ads the campaign runs to the messaging and rhetoric that comes from the president himself to growing the campaign's infrastructure, a person familiar with the campaign's thinking said, the Biden team recognizes that once the Trump trial -- and the aggressive media coverage of it -- is over, there will be more room and opportunities to make their case to the American people ahead of November.\n\nBiden campaign officials are still grappling with the reality, this person said, that a substantial part of the population still doesn't see that the choice on Election Day will be between Biden and Trump.\n\nAnd while the campaign will need to calibrate its messaging and strategy based on how exactly Trump's trial ends, this person insisted that at the end of the day, the thrust of their case against the former president won't change -- whether Trump emerges a convicted felon or not.\n\nDe Niro presented the main theme of that messaging on Tuesday. He blasted the former president as \"a tyrant\" and \"a coward,\" telling reporters that as New Yorkers, they tolerated the former real estate mogul as \"just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot, a two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids.\"\n\nAnd he said that the stakes of November's election are what prompted him to join the campaign for a new ad released last week.\n\n\"That's why I needed to be involved and wanted to be involved in the new Biden-Harris ad, because it shows the violence of Trump and reminds us that he'd use violence against anyone who stands in the way of his megalomania and greed,\" De Niro said. \"You think Trump ever threw a punch himself or took one? This guy ran and hid in the White House bunker when there were protesters outside -- no way. He doesn't get blood on his hands. No, he doesn't. He directs the mob to do his dirty work for him.\"\n\nAs CNN reported on Friday, the Biden campaign effectively launched the start of that next phase by releasing a scorching new ad called \"Snapped,\" narrated by Niro.\n\n\"We knew Trump was out of control when he was president,\" De Niro says over a shot of Trump behind the Resolute Desk. \"Then he lost the 2020 election and snapped.\"\n\nThe ad describes Trump as \"desperately\" trying to cling to power while showing images of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The phrases \"dictator\" and \"terminate the Constitution\" flash on screen, followed by a clip of Trump saying, \"If I don't get elected, it's going to be a bloodbath.\"\n\nFanone, a former Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Officer who was attacked during the January 6 insurrection, said that he was \"just one representative of the hundreds of police officers that were assaulted that day by Donald Trump's supporters inspired by his lies, the lies that continue to this day to inspire my fellow Americans to turn against their fellow Americans, to turn against police officers.\"\n\nDunn, a former US Capitol Police officer, called Trump \"the greatest threat to our democracy and the safety of communities across the country today.\"\n\n\"He has encouraged and continues to encourage political violence. We've been called traitors - just today. We were all called traitors on January 6, for doing our job,\" Dunn said. \"Political violence is never acceptable, but you have a presidential candidate that champions it, that encourages it, that supports it. We cannot have that.\"\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Biden's reelection campaign said it was enlisting police officers working at the US Capitol on January 6 to stump for Biden across battleground states in the coming weeks.\n\nSgt. Aquilino Gonell and officer Danny Hodges also plan to join Dunn in telling voters that Trump poses a threat to democracy and to their fundamental rights as Americans. Dunn and Gonell sustained injuries during the attack on the Capitol and have since retired from the Capitol Police. Hodges continues to serve with DC's Metropolitan Police Department.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_liptak@cnn.com", "name": "Kevin

Now, with just days to go before a verdict is released, it's dispatched Robert De Niro and some other campaign surrogates to the New York City courtroom to draw attention to the threat they say Trump poses to the country.\n\nAs closing arguments in Trump's trial kicked off nearby, the Biden campaign held a press conference that featured the famed actor and former U.S. Capitol police officers Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone, who served during the attack on Jan. 6, 2021. The trio described Trump as an \"authoritarian who answers to and serves only himself,\" Fanone said during his remarks.\n\n\"When Trump ran in 2016, it was like a joke,\" said De Niro, who cut an ad for Biden's campaign that characterized Trump as a threat to democracy. \"With Trump, we have a second chance, and no one is laughing now. This is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all.\"\n\nWhile the speakers did not reference the trial specifically, the press conference marks a notable escalation for the Biden team, who have, so far, largely avoided all of Trump's legal challenges. It suggests that there may be brewing frustration that the trial has not resonated more broadly with voters.\n\nWhen asked why the Biden campaign showed up on Tuesday, \"because you all are here,\" said Michael Tyler, Biden's communications director.\n\n\"You've been incessantly covering this, day in and day out,\" Tyler said. \"And we want to remind the American people ahead of the next debate, the first debate on June 27, of the unique, persistent and growing threat that Donald Trump poses to the American people and to our democracy.\"\n\nTrump faces charges related to hush money payments he made just before the 2016 election to a porn star with whom he had an affair. The former president has argued that the prosecution is politically motivated. And in light of that, Biden has been steadfast in avoiding the matter, deferring questions to the Department of Justice, who he says is operating independently.\n\nBut the reelection team's also decided to take advantage of the media attention devoted to Trump's trial, and the decision to hold a press conference at the courthouse on the same day is recognition that they need to offer some counter-programming.\n\nThe press conference was not without its misfires. Multiple hecklers interrupted the comments, drawing De Niro into a back-and-forth over whether Dunn and Fanone were \"heroes.\" A car alarm went off for several minutes during De Niro and Fanone's comments.

He led a boisterous press conference outside the Manhattan courthouse, where the defense team of former President Donald Trump delivered their final arguments in the so-called \"hush money\" trial.\n\nThe Biden campaign made a major statement by announcing the press availability \"with special guests\" on the day of closing arguments, with the jury slated to hear the case on Wednesday after weeks of remaining silent on the case.\n\n\"We're not here today because of what's going on over there,\" Biden campaign communications director Michael Tyler disingenuously told reporters, indicating the courthouse. \"We're here today because you all are here.\"\n\nAfter telling reporters on Tuesday that Trump \"wants to sow total chaos\" and \"destroy not only the city,\" De Niro, 80, who has previously narrated advertisements for the Biden campaign, went on to suggest that \"eventually he could destroy the whole world.\"\n\n\"This buffoon running for president, 'no, never could happen,' we'd forgotten the lessons of history that showed us other clowns who weren't taken seriously until they became vicious dictators... With Trump, we have a second chance, and no one is laughing now,\" De Niro said outside the courthouse in front of a slew of reporters.\n\n\"This is not a threat, this is a reality!\" He continued in an animated yet paranoid tone.\n\n\"I don't mean to scare you. No, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you,\" he added. \"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\n\n\"And elections. Forget about it. That's over. That's done. If he gets in. I can tell you right now. He will never leave. He will never leave. You know that. He will never leave.\"\n\nIt appears that De Niro is unaware that Trump was already elected president in 2016 and nothing of the sort happened. Alternatively, perhaps these Hollywood elites believe that the general public and Democrat voters are so naive about the workings of the system, that the more he says, \"Trump will never leave if he is elected,\" the more people will eventually begin to believe him.\n\nDuring De Niro's prepared remarks, which called Trump a \"clown,\" \"grubby real estate hustler,\" and a \"tyrant,\" the Raging Bull actor cursed at pro-Trump demonstrators who were trying to drown out the celebrity campaigner by yelling \"F-k Joe Biden\" and \"De Niro is a gangster bitch.\"\n\nDe Niro then yelled \"You're a f-king idiot\" to one pro-Trump protester. Another one also called him a \"paid actor for the DNC\" and suggested that De Niro had ties to the now-deceased pedophile Jeffrey Eptein.\n\nIn 1998, when De Niro's name came up throughout the course of an investigation involving a child sex ring, French investigators questioned him for some time, but the Casino actor was never taken into custody or charged.\n\n\"The 1998 story in the Independent said six people were charged in France with running an international prostitution ring, which involved some girls as young as 15. The agency was adept at 'tricking, or trapping, star-struck teenage girls into selling their bodies with the promise of careers as models or actresses,' Lichfield wrote,\" according to Politifact.com.\n\nCommenters online also chimed in and expressed how they felt about De Niro's remarks.\n\n\"Is this guy just out of his mind? It is his preferred party and political bent that took away our freedoms during the pandemic, they are the ones who tell us what words we can and can't use now, they are the ones weaponizing the non-elected departments of the government, not to mention trying to prosecute political opponents...\" One commenter said.\n\nShortly after Biden's team departed, Trump's press team took to the microphones, asserting that the Biden campaign's presence close to the courtroom demonstrated that the trial amounted to \"election interference of the highest order.\"\n\n\"Crooked Joe Biden and his campaign are in complete freakout mode, and that's why they've gone back on the word and now they've gone in bed with a highly conflicted, conflicted judge, and now they're making a political mockery of this entire thing,\" said campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the 2024 press secretary for the Trump campaign, also added that \"actors like Robert De Niro\" have \"no idea the real problems that people in this city and across this country are facing.\"\n\n\"President Trump is backed by the hard-working men and women of this country, and I cannot help but laugh when Joe Biden's spokesperson actually came out here and accused President Trump of being a threat to democracy. Joe Biden is the real threat to democracy. He is weaponizing our justice system,\" she said.\n\nStay informed! Receive breaking news blasts directly to your inbox for free.

No, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you,\" De Niro told reporters. \"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nThe actor cast himself as the true New Yorker and mocked Trump's history of sometimes-unsuccessful business ventures and self-promotion, saying Trump was looking to \"destroy\" the city.\n\n\"We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another crappy real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot,\" De Niro said. \"I love this city. I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city but the country, and, eventually, he could destroy the world.\"\n\nFormer Washington, D.C., police officer Michael Fanone and former Capitol police officer Harry Dunn spoke of their personal experiences on Jan. 6, with Fanone describing his injuries suffered at the hands of the mob of Trump supporters seeking to halt Congress' certification of Biden's 2020 presidential victory.\n\n\"I came here today to remind Americans of what Donald Trump is capable of and the violence that he unleashed on all of Americans on Jan. 6, 2021,\" Fanone said.\n\nThe two former officers were also witnesses during a congressional investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. Hundreds of law enforcement officers were beaten and bloodied in the attack by Trump supporters, who descended after a rally and smashed into the Capitol while Trump remained silent for hours.\n\n\"Americans need to wake up. This is not a drill,\" said Harry Dunn, a former Capitol police officer who ran unsuccessfully for office in Maryland.\n\n\"We can't count on these institutions to stop Donald Trump,\" he added. \"It's going to take us Americans at the ballot box to defeat him once and for all.\"\n\nTrump's aides held their own press conference after the Democrats concluded, with adviser Jason Miller suggesting that the Biden team's presence validated Trump's contention that his criminal issues were \"all politics.\"", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston

This is the time to stop him.\"\n\nTrump has spoken daily to TV news cameras inside the court premises, claiming the trial is a political attack against him, lambasting the judge as biased and repeating falsehoods about the last election being rigged.\n\nDe Niro's unexpected press conference -- against a noisy backdrop of pro-Trump protesters and car alarms -- appeared to be an effort to push back against Trump's dominance of the TV news channels.\n\n\"If he gets in. I can tell you right now, he will never leave,\" De Niro said. \"Is that the country we want to live in? Do we want him running this country and saying 'I'm not leaving? I'm dictator for life'?\"\n\n\"The only way to preserve our freedoms and hold on to our humanity is to vote for Joe Biden for president,\" the legendary actor said.\n\nHe accused Trump of directing \"an angry mob\" to storm the US Capitol after his 2020 election defeat to Biden, adding that the Republican \"ran and hid in the White House\" during the violence, in which dozens of police officers were injured.\n\nDe Niro was flanked by retired officers Henry Dunn and Michael Fanone, who were wounded in the January 6, 2021 insurrection, launched to halt the certification by Congress of Biden's victory.\n\nDunn is one of three officers who defended the Capitol who will campaign for Biden in key battleground states ahead of the president's first election debate against Trump, slated for June 27.\n\nThe trio will emphasize how Trump \"snapped\" after losing the 2020 election, the campaign said Tuesday, underscoring his pledge to pardon the rioters on his return to office.\n\n\"Donald Trump and his unhinged quest for power and retribution pose an existential threat to our democracy,\" said Dunn, who bid unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to run for a Maryland seat in the House of Representatives.\n\n\"He continues to embrace political violence, going as far as saying there will be a 'bloodbath' if he loses again and promising to be a dictator on 'day one' and pardon January 6 rioters.\"\n\nClosing arguments began Tuesday in Trump's hush money trial, less than six months before the election.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"},

He tried to temper his foul mouth but showed his true colors rather quickly. His words concerning the former president dripped with hatred, calling him a \"clown\" and a \"terrorist\" repeatedly. A class act it was not but it is what you would expect from the washed-up actor.\n\nAs De Niro launched into his false tirade claiming that Trump would not only destroy the country but the world while calling him a dictator, he was heckled by supporters of the former president. You could see it incensed him and he raged that if Trump had any decency he would tell his supporters not to harass him. But again, if De Niro had any decency he would not slander the former president outside a courtroom.\n\n\"This is my neighborhood, downtown New York City. I grew up here and feel at home in these streets. I feel comfortable. The Twin Towers fell just over here, just over there. This part of the city was like a ghost town, but we vowed we would not allow terrorists to change our way of life. And we started the Tribeca festival to bring people back. I love this city,\" DeNiro intoned.\n\n\"I love this city. I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city, but the country and eventually, he could destroy the world,\" the actor ridiculously claimed using heated hyperbole that few buy into.\n\n\"But we vowed we would not allow terrorists -- I owe this city a lot. That's why it is so weird that Donald Trump is just across the street. He doesn't belong in my city. I don't know where he belongs. But he certainly doesn't belong here,\" DeNiro proclaimed.\n\nThe actor made himself the self-appointed spokesman for all New Yorkers and relished calling Trump names. It was reminiscent of a five-year-old throwing a hissy fit.\n\n\"We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot, a two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids, pretending to be a spokesman, a spokesperson for himself. He was calling as himself for himself to fool the press and to inflating his net worth. A clown!\" he railed.\n\n\"But this city is pretty accommodating. We make room for clowns. We have them all over the city. People who do crazy things in the street. We tolerate it and it is part of the culture, but not a person like Trump who will eventually run the country. That does not work and we all know that. Anyway, we make room for clowns. To each his own,\" De Niro condescendingly asserted.\n\nAround the 7:30 min mark in the video above De Niro briefly spars with someone in the crowd who called the Capitol officers 'traitors' for lying under oath. This, wasn't De Niro's first nor last interaction with the pro-Trump crowd.\n\nThe actor took swipes not just at Trump but Christians, conservatives, and anyone who supports the former president. His lies were simply breathtaking and all evidently sanctioned by the Biden campaign.\n\n\"No one took him really seriously. They take him seriously now, of course. But around the country, people who didn't know him as we did started to support him. They bought into his bullsh*t. Trump bought their votes with outrageous lies and empty promises. He got the most religious evangelicals to applaud a sinner who bragged about sexual assault and who just a couple of blocks from here, a jury found him liable for sexual abuse,\" DeNiro spouted.\n\n\"Somehow he even got self-styled patriots to support a man who called for terminating the Constitution and on January 6th, rallied an angry mob to threaten democracy, leaving death and destruction in its wake,\" he said with a straight face knowing full well the only one to die on Jan. 6 was actually a Trump supporter and that the former president did not rally anyone to attack the Capitol.\n\nThen came his pitch for the vicious propaganda campaign ad for which Biden had DeNiro do a voiceover. The media ate it up and started spitting talking points on how Americans just don't remember how bad it was under Trump.\n\n(Video Credit: MSNBC)\n\n\"That's why I needed to be involved and wanted to be involved in the new Biden/Harris ad because it shows the violence of Trump and reminds us he will use violence against anyone who stands in the way of his greed. But it is a coward's violence. You think Trump ever threw a punch himself or took one? This guy ran and hid in the White House bunker with protestors outside, no way,\" De Niro expertly deflected.\n\n\"He doesn't get blood on his hands, no he doesn't. He directs the mob to do his dirty work for him by making a suggestion, an inference, and his gang follows his obvious order. It's no surprise the murder rate and other violent crimes peaked under Trump and are falling under Biden, and now he is promising to use our own military to attack U.S. citizens. That's the tyrant,\" he falsely claimed.\n\n\"That's the tyrant he is telling us he will be. And believe me, he means it. When Trump ran in 2016, it was like a joke, this buffoon running for president. It could never happen. We got the lessons of history that showed us other clowns who weren't taken seriously until they became vicious dictators. With Trump, we have a second chance, and no one is laughing now. This is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all. We don't want to wake up after the election saying 'What, again? My God, what the hell have we done?' We can't have that happen again,\" De Niro concluded.\n\nVideo obtained by RNC Research shows a masked De Niro being paraded in while protesters can heard heard yelling at him.\n\nA crowd can be heard yelling 'F**k Joe Biden' while De Niro spoke in another clip from CSPAN:\n\nFurther footage showed De Niro making a B-line for his getaway car while people yelled, \"You're a nobody and your movies suck!\"\n\nNeedless to say, the publicity stunt appeared to be a huge backfire, and X users continued to shred both DeNiro and Biden for the vile spectacle:\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

This is the time to stop him.\"\n\nTrump has spoken daily to TV news cameras inside the court premises, claiming the trial is a political attack against him, lambasting the judge as biased and repeating falsehoods about the last election being rigged.\n\nDe Niro's unexpected press conference - against a noisy backdrop of pro-Trump protesters and car alarms - appeared to be an effort to push back against Trump's dominance of the TV news channels.\n\n\"If he gets in. I can tell you right now, he will never leave,\" De Niro said. \"Is that the country we want to live in? Do we want him running this country and saying 'I'm not leaving? I'm dictator for life'?\"\n\n\"The only way to preserve our freedoms and hold on to our humanity is to vote for Joe Biden for president,\" the legendary actor said.\n\nHe accused Trump of directing \"an angry mob\" to storm the US Capitol after his 2020 election defeat to Biden, adding that the Republican \"ran and hid in the White House\" during the violence, in which dozens of police officers were injured.\n\nDe Niro was flanked by retired officers Henry Dunn and Michael Fanone, who were wounded in the January 6, 2021 insurrection, launched to halt the certification by Congress of Biden's victory.\n\nDunn is one of three officers who defended the Capitol who will campaign for Biden in key battleground states ahead of the president's first election debate against Trump, slated for June 27.\n\nThe trio will emphasize how Trump \"snapped\" after losing the 2020 election, the campaign said Tuesday, underscoring his pledge to pardon the rioters on his return to office.\n\n\"Donald Trump and his unhinged quest for power and retribution pose an existential threat to our democracy,\" said Dunn, who bid unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to run for a Maryland seat in the House of Representatives.\n\n\"He continues to embrace political violence, going as far as saying there will be a 'bloodbath' if he loses again and promising to be a dictator on 'day one' and pardon January 6 rioters.\"\n\nClosing arguments began Tuesday in Trump's hush money trial, less than six months before the election.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"},

A top Biden adviser said they weren't there to talk about the trial, rather to exploit the large media focus on the legal proceedings.\n\nPeople are also reading...

No, wait, maybe I do mean to scare you,\" De Niro told reporters. \"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\n\"I love this city. I don't want to destroy it,\" De Niro added. \"Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city but the country, and, eventually, he could destroy the world.\"\n\nFormer Washington, D.C., police officer Michael Fanone and former Capitol police officer Harry Dunn spoke of their personal experiences on Jan. 6, with Fanone describing his injuries suffered at the hands of the mob of Trump supporters seeking to halt Congress' certification of Biden's 2020 presidential victory.\n\n\"I came here today to remind Americans of what Donald Trump is capable of and the violence that he unleashed on all of Americans on Jan. 6, 2021,\" Fanone said.\n\nAdded Dunn, who recently lost a Democratic primary race for the House in Maryland, \"We can't count on these institutions to stop Donald Trump. It's going to take us Americans at the ballot box to defeat him once and for all.\"\n\nTrump's allies planned their own press conference Tuesday, with the Republican former president's adviser Jason Miller saying the Democratic president's event proved Trump's argument that his prosecution was politically motivated.\n\n\"Joe's crookeds aren't in PA, MI, WI, NV, AZ or GA - they're outside the Biden Trial against President Trump,\" he posted on X. \"It's always been about politics.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Except for a handful of conservative talent guided by a moral compass, Tinseltown is a liberal nuclear wasteland on par with Chernobyl.\n\nAnd then, there's Robert De Niro. He's the glowing, three-eyed fish of that radioactive swamp.\n\nOne of the most storied acting careers in all of film has been decimated by a bad case of what is commonly referred to as Trump Derangement Syndrome.\n\nThe Raging Bull and Godfather actor first contracted the disease in 2016 when he was so despondent over Donald Trump's candidacy for President that he declared he'd like to \"punch him in the face.\"\n\nAmong many other things.\n\nWe could rehash his many detestable comments since then. In 2018 he was censored at the Tony Awards for shouting \"F--- Trump!\" with raised arms and clenched fists.\n\nHe even suggested that Trump's presidency made him feel the same way he did after 9/11.\n\nBut why recall the crazy from years ago when he essentially said the very same things today?\n\nIn one of the wildest press conferences you'll ever see, a masked De Niro joined two of the saddest figures to come out of the January 6 mostly peaceful protest - Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone - to rant and seethe with rage over President Biden's opponent. Just as he has repeatedly for years.\n\nSame message. Just a different setting outside the courthouse at the Trump trial in New York.\n\n\"We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot,\" De Niro ranted against Trump. \"A two-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloids. A clown.\"\n\nCalling somebody else a clown? Self-awareness: -500 points, Robert.\n\nThen, in a statement that makes AOC look like sanity personified, De Niro claimed Trump would destroy the country if re-elected ... and it'll be just like 9/11.\n\n\"The Twin Towers fell just over here, just over there. This part of the city was like a ghost town, but we vowed we would not allow terrorists to change our way of life. ... I love this city. I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city, but the country, and eventually, he can destroy the world,\" De Niro said.\n\n\"I don't mean to scare you. No, no, wait -- maybe I do mean to scare you,\" he added. \"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nPerhaps AOC can give Robert the number to her therapist. (You know, the one she consulted after Ted Cruz almost had her murdered on January 6 even though she wasn't in the building.)\n\nOh, speaking of bad actors, De Niro tried to drive home his point by inviting sobbing famed J6 committee witnesses in Dunn and Fanone.\n\nDunn's presence helped accentuate the fact De Niro is basically a star in the remake of The Biggest Loser. He recently attempted to run for an open House seat in Maryland and was defeated in the Democrat primary by double digits.\n\nDunn, you may recall, was one of the many Capitol Police officers who provided a toreador defense of the building that day and later whined about it being \"an attempt to overthrow democracy.\"\n\nHint: It wasn't.\n\nPivoting to the next loser, Fanone is probably one of the more vile creatures to come out of the Capitol insurrection media-generated production. That attribute is likely why he landed a gig at CNN.\n\nSharing De Niro's world view that January 6 was akin to 9/11, former Capitol officer Fanone once indicated the day Trump was indicted over the protest made him as happy as the day Osama bin Laden was killed.\n\nYes, he actually said that.\n\n\"Much in the way that I did when I learned that our military had killed Osama bin Laden,\" the CNN contributor said. \"I just felt incredibly proud.\"\n\nIt's important to note that this triumvirate of losers was attaching themselves to the Biden campaign. This was a campaign event for the current president of the United States. Featuring an unhinged lunatic flanked by two perpetually teary-eyed trolls.\n\nThis is the best they had to offer to counter Trump?\n\nYou have to hand it to them, though. Fanone and Dunn surely know how to act when they need to. And De Niro obviously has some skill in that arena.\n\nIt's just a shame that De Niro, once a respected Academy Award-winning actor, has been relegated to B-level press conferences where the attendees try to outduel each other with their ignorance.\n\nTrump has rightly described De Niro for what he has become.\n\n\"He has become a total loser, as the World watches, waits, and laughs!\" Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform last December.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rusty_weiss@redstate.com", "name": "Rusty

He got the most religious evangelicals to applaud a sinner who bragged about sexual assault.\"\n\n\"Somehow he even got self-styled patriots to support a man who called for terminating the constitution,\" De Niro claimed, twisting the former president's words suggesting the \"termination\" of the constitution could be allowable as he reacted to the news about the Democrat Party colluding with Twitter to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story.\n\nRELATED: Robert De Niro Clutches Pearls Over Another Possible Trump Presidency, Says \"He'll Come Looking For Me\" Because \"That's What Happens In That Kind Of A Dictatorship\"\n\nFurther accusing, without providing any empirical evidence to back his already debunked claim, De Niro added, \"And on January 6th rallied an angry mob to threaten democracy; leaving death and destruction in its wake.\"\n\n\"That's why I needed to be involved, and wanted to be involved, in the new Biden-Harris ad,\" he declared, adding, \"Because it shows the violence of Trump and reminds us that he'll use violence against anyone who stands in the way of his megalomania and greed.\"\n\nHe then encouraged, \"With Trump we have a second chance, and no one is laughing now. This is the time to stop him by voting him out once and for all. WE don't want to wake up after the election saying, 'What, again? My God, what the Hell have we done?' We can't have that happen again.\"\n\n\"Yesterday was Memorial Day. It's a good time to reflect on how Americans fought and died so that we may enjoy the freedoms guaranteed to us by a Democratic government. A Government that, as president Lincoln said, 'Of the people, by the people, for the people. Shall not perish from the earth.'\"\n\nHe then baselessly warned, \"Under Trump this kind of government will perish from the earth. If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye, that we all take for granted, and elections? Forget about it. That's over. That's done.\"\n\n\"If he gets in, I can tell you right now he will never leave. He will never leave. You know that? He will never leave,\" De Niro reiterated. \"What does that mean? Is that the country we want to live in? Do we want him running this country? And saying, 'I'm not leaving. I'm dictator for life'?\"", "source": {"uri": "boundingintocomics.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bounding Into Comics"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_berger@boundingintocomics.com", "name": "Josh Berger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_(American_Revolution)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patriot (American Revolution)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slogan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual assault"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelicalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evangelicalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_worth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Net worth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden_laptop_controversy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden laptop controversy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissistic_personality_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Narcissistic personality disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empirical evidence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abraham Lincoln"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/World_War_II_Dormant_Accounts", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/World War II Dormant Accounts", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://boundingintocomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-28-at-13.45.16.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604887", "eventUri": "eng-9604887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 3158, "textEnd": 3169}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Until now, it appeared that they had realized that commenting too much on the trial could be seen as election interference. But now it looks like they have thrown that concern out the window -- and in the worst possible way.\n\nAside from the Biden campaign's seeming inability to read a calendar -- Tuesday is May 28, not the May 27 as written on the news release -- the fact that they pushed De Niro before the cameras is hard to believe.\n\nThe Biden campaign trotted out Hollywood elitist De Niro to respond to the Trump trial. And, boy, was he out of his mind.\n\nDe Niro went on a manacle rant claiming that Trump won't leave office if he wins this year.\n\n\"If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave! He will never leave! You know that. He will never leave,\" DeNiro exclaimed, insisting that Trump would become a \"dictator for life\" if he wins.\n\n\"What does that mean? Is that the country we want to live in? Do we want him running this country and saying, 'I'm not leaving, I'm dictator for life?'\" De Niro continued.\n\n\"I hope this new ad campaign reaches outside the bubble to remind supporters of what a danger he is to our lives. This is not a threat. This is a reality,\" he bellowed, according to Breitbart.\n\nDe Niro also called Trump a \"clown\" and referred to Trump voters as \"gangsters.\"\n\nBut as his unhinged rant continued, some of those in the streets began to react to the wild-eyed attack and started screaming back, Breitbart indicated in a separate report.\n\nEven a car alarm seemed to have had enough. At some point, it began blaring as De Niro tried to deliver his unhinged message.\n\nJoe Biden's campaign made a crucial campaign error by appearing in front of the courthouse on Tuesday. The Biden campaign went from seemingly being unconnected to this travesty of justice, to appearing to be intimately involved with the political prosecution of Joe Biden's chief political rival for the 2024 election.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "warner_todd_huston@westernjournal.com", "name": "Warner Todd Huston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlesque", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Burlesque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gangster"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Maxi-Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Maxi-Basketball", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Conferences", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.westernjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Robert-de-Niro.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604887", "eventUri": "eng-9604887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 974, "textEnd": 980}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-27", "textStart": 990, "textEnd": 996}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Trump's criminal trial, then beginning to make sly insinuations about how he was \"free on Wednesdays,\" the court's day off, President Biden's campaign has jumped in with a stunt designed to emphasize the unprecedented situation of a major party's presidential candidate awaiting a felony verdict.\n\nThe Biden campaign on Tuesday dispatched Robert De Niro, the actor whose voice narrates the campaign's latest ad, along with Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone, two former U.S. Capitol Police officers who have since become spokesmen for the Democratic effort to attack Mr. Trump over his role in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, to hold a news conference outside the courthouse in Manhattan where Mr. Trump's trial was concluding.\n\n\"This is not a threat,\" Mr. De Niro said of the prospect that Mr. Trump could return to the White House. \"This is a reality.\"\n\nThe news conference was the sort of thing the Trump campaign would have done from the beginning if the political situation were reversed.\n\nThe Biden campaign has for weeks kept to the letter of the president's directive to not address the criminal charges Mr. Trump faces or offer commentary on the trial, but its decision to dispatch surrogates to the Manhattan courthouse while the former president's lawyer was delivering his closing argument was hardly subtle.\n\nThough Mr. De Niro and the two former police officers did not address Mr. Trump's Manhattan trial -- he is charged with falsifying business records related to a hush-money payment to a porn star before the 2016 election -- they sought to draw attention to his actions that led to the events of Jan. 6, which are the subject of another federal criminal case pending against Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Trump has sought to tie together all four of his criminal cases and has argued baselessly that Mr. Biden is behind them all. In addition to the Manhattan trial, he is charged in separate federal cases over his handling of classified documents and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, along with a Georgia case related to his push to reverse that year's results.\n\nMr. Trump's loudest supporters quickly jumped on the Biden news conference as evidence that the four cases against Mr. Trump are connected and that Mr. Biden is the hidden hand behind them all.\n\n\"In case you needed more evidence that all of these BS cases were quarterbacked by Team Biden to interfere in the 2024 election, the Biden campaign is now showing up in NYC to explicitly cheerlead the political prosecution of my father,\" Donald Trump Jr. wrote on social media.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New

As we speak, Donald Trump, somewhere fighting for himself, maybe taking a power nap.

This part of the city was like a ghost town, but we vowed we would not allow terrorists to change our way of life. And we started the Tribeca Festival to bring people back. I love this city. I love this city. I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city, but the country, and eventually he could destroy the world,\" De Niro said.\n\n'If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye.'\n\n\"But we vowed we would not allow terrorists ... I owe this city a lot. That's why it is so weird that Donald Trump is just across the street. He doesn't belong in my city. I don't know where he belongs. But he certainly doesn't belong here. We New Yorkers used to tolerate him when he was just another grubby real estate hustler ... big shot pretending to be a spokesman, a spokesperson for himself,\" he continued.\n\n-- (@)\n\nWhen De Niro started to shower praise on Dunn and Fanone, someone could be heard off camera telling De Niro they had lied under oath about what they did during the riot at the Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nDe Niro became exasperated during the exchange and tried to convince the man Dunn and Fanone had fought for the country.\n\n\"They stood there and fought, for us! For you!\" the actor shouted.\n\n\"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted. And elections? Forget about it. That's over, that's done.

Less than a day later, he told the campaign that he loved it and recorded it with his distinct voice.\n\nOn March 8, De Niro ranted about Trump on Bill Maher's talk show, Real Time with Bill Maher, arguing that the former president is \"such a mean, nasty, hateful person\" who he would never portray \"as an actor because\" he found nothing \"good\" or \"redeemable\" about him.\n\nDe Niro and Maher discussed the election polls from The New York Times, with the talk show host eliciting his guest's thoughts on Trump being ahead of Biden.\n\nThe actor then shifted his attention to Trump supporters, saying that these individuals \"want to f -- with people, screw them because they're unhappy about something.\"\n\nHe said that \"[Trump's] a sociopathic, psychopathic, malignant narcissist\" and that he is \"a dangerous person.\"\n\nDe Niro also publicly attacked Trump while speaking on MSNBC's The 11th Hour. During an interview, the actor warned people about the former president's possible return to the White House if he wins the 2024 election.\n\nHe called Trump \"a sick person,\" \"narcissistic, \"a \"monster\" and a \"stupid bully.\" Despite this, he mentioned he was \"tired of calling [Trump] names\" during the same segment.\n\nDe Niro had then compared Trump to Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, saying that \"they don't take him seriously\" and that \"he looks like a clown and \"acts like a clown.\"\n\nLeave a comment Cancel reply Read more about: Donald Trump Joe Biden Political

Another added, \"New Yorkers hate him!

A crowd of MAGA protesters looked on before shouting at the star that Capitol police officers \"lied under oath\" about the Jan. 6 insurrection.\n\nDe Niro did not take too kindly to the interruptions.\n\nWith the Trump hush-money trial heading into closing arguments, De Niro held the press conference surrounded by several law enforcement officers, including Michael Fanone and Harry Dunn, who were attacked by Jan. 6 rioters at the Capitol.\n\nThroughout his address, the Goodfellas star repeatedly referenced the violence of the insurrection. \"Somehow he even got self-styled patriots to support a man who called for terminating the Constitution and on Jan. 6, rallied an angry mob to threaten democracy leaving death and destruction in its wake,\" he declared. \"That's why I needed to be involved and wanted to be involved in the new Biden-Harris ad because it shows the violence of Trump and the use of violence to anyone who stands in the way of his greed.\"\n\nWhile pro-Trump demonstrators heckled De Niro several times during his speech, he didn't engage with them until he was interrupted while lauding the Capitol police officers as \"true heroes.\"\n\nWith a car alarm blaring in the background, the famed actor grew incensed when one man said \"they lied under oath\" after De Niro pointed to Dunn and Fanone and praised their bravery.\n\n\"Oh, they lied under oath? What are you telling me?\" De Niro shot back, prompting the man to say \"those two traitors behind you,\" referencing the two officers present.\n\n\"They're traitors?!\" De Niro incredulously replied. \"I don't even know how to deal with you, my friend. I don't even know how to deal with you!\"\n\nContinuing to address his heckler, De Niro waved toward the two cops and said \"they stood there\" on Jan. 6 when \"they didn't have to,\" adding that they showed more courage than other officers at the scene.\n\n\"There were other ones in there who probably were with them a little bit and found a way to get around. Not these guys,\" the actor shouted. \"They stood there and fought for us, for you. For you!\"\n\nThe MAGA protester, meanwhile, insisted the cops \"weren't fighting for me.\"\n\n\"No?

It briefly returned, with De Niro clearly stating what he felt Trump's \"slogan should be\" before his audio dropped a second time.

Jean Carroll, a former magazine writer. In January, the former president was ordered to pay $83.3 million in damages to Ms. Carroll. The Biden campaign has rarely discussed that case or the verdict against Mr. Trump.\n\n\"Just a couple of blocks from here a jury found him liable for sexual abuse,\" Mr. De Niro said.\n\nThe Biden campaign sought to argue that bringing Mr. De Niro and the two Capitol Police officers to Mr. Trump's trial was not a commentary on the case but on the news media scrum gathered to cover it.\n\n\"We're not here today because of what's going on over there,\" Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director, told the assembled reporters outside the courthouse. \"We're here today because you all are here.\"\n\nWith a number of demonstrators stationed in a protest area outside the courthouse, many of the news conferences throughout the trial have been met with some level of heckling. Mr. DeNiro was challenged by a man wearing a red Make America Great Again hat, who criticized his remarks and accused the Capitol Police officers of lying under oath, calling them traitors.\n\nMr. Trump has sought to tie together all four of his pending criminal cases and has argued baselessly that Mr. Biden is behind them all. In addition to the Manhattan trial, he is charged in separate federal cases over his handling of classified documents and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, along with a Georgia case related to his push to reverse that year's results.\n\nThe Trump campaign quickly jumped on the Biden news conference.\n\n\"The Biden folks have finally done it,\" said Jason Miller, a senior adviser to the campaign. \"After months of saying that politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made it with a campaign event.\"\n\nHe characterized Mr. De Niro's involvement as a desperate reach for a campaign that needed to lift Mr. Biden's poll numbers, referring to him as a \"washed-up actor\" and arguing that Biden campaign staff members at the news conference had sensed it was a bad idea to stand in the proverbial shadow of the courthouse.\n\nSteven Cheung, a Trump campaign spokesman, said the Biden campaign was \"making a political mockery\" of the criminal case with its appearance.\n\nAsked about the Biden campaign's contention that it had held a news conference at the courthouse only because the national news media had been stationed there for weeks, Karoline Leavitt, the campaign's press secretary, responded simply: \"They're pathetic.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_gold@nytimes.com", "name": "Michael Gold", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "reid_j_epstein@nytimes.com", "name": "Reid J.

This year, Mr Dunn ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Maryland.\n\nThey spoke to the press not far from the Manhattan Criminal Court, with Mr De Niro arguing that Mr Trump wants to \"Destroy not only the city but the country and eventually he could destroy the world.\"\n\nHe said Mr Trump would \"never leave\" if he wins in November and that Americans can \"kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted.\"\n\nMr Trump faces 34 charges that he falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to adult actor Stormy Daniels issued shortly before the 2016 election to cover up a 2006 affair.

They stood and put their lives on the line.\"\n\nWhen a man interrupted to call Mr Dunn and Mr Fanone \"traitors\" who \"lied under oath,\" Mr De Niro pushed back, \"I don't even know how to deal with you, my friend ... They stood there and fought for us, for you!\"\n\nThe actor said that New Yorkers tolerated Mr Trump \"when he was just another grubby real estate hustler masquerading as a big shot.\"\n\n\"We make room for clowns ... But not a person like Trump,\" he added.\n\nMr De Niro argued that Mr Trump \"called for terminating the Constitution.\n\n\"And on January 6, rallied an angry mob to threaten democracy, leaving death and destruction in its wake.\"\n\n\"It's a coward's violence,\" he added. \"You think Trump ever threw a punch himself or took one? This guy ran and hid in the White House bunker when there were protesters outside. No way.\"\n\n\"He doesn't get blood on his hands ... He directs the mob to do his dirty work for him by making a suggestion and inference and his gang grovels and follows his obvious order,\" Mr De Niro added.\n\nA seemingly emotional Mr Fanone said he's \"Just one representative of the hundreds of police officers that were assaulted that day by Donald Trump's supporters, inspired by his loss.\"\n\n\"This election is about Donald Trump and his vision for the Office of the President of the United States, not as a public servant who answers to ... the people who elected him, but as an authoritarian who answers to and serves only himself,\" he added.\n\n\"I just unsuccessfully ran for office. A lot of people that I met out there said they were afraid. They're scared to see what another Trump presidency looks like,\" Mr Dunn said.\n\n\"I couldn't say it's going to be okay,\" he added, before arguing that \"we can't count on these institutions to stop Donald Trump. It's going to take us Americans at the ballot box to defeat him once and for all.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden is planning on finally speaking out regarding Mr Trump's criminal trials after a verdict has been handed down in the hush money case, Politico reported last week.\n\nIf his predecessor is convicted, Mr Biden is set to argue that Mr Trump is not suited to hold office and that it shows the lengths Mr Trump would go to regain the presidency.\n\nThe Biden campaign's social media team is looking at using a conviction to possibly refer to their opponent as \"Convicted Felon Donald Trump\" online.\n\nThe Biden team is also expecting volleys of attacks from Mr Trump and his allies if the former president is acquitted or if there's a hung jury.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk",

A verdict could come as early as this week or into next week.\n\nMr Trump is accused of 34 counts of fraud by falsifying business records to cover up payments of $200,000 ($US130,000) to porn star Stormy Daniels to buy her silence about an alleged extramarital sexual encounter. The allegations were in danger of becoming public knowledge in the run up to the 2016 US Presidential election.\n\nThe prosecution is attempting to persuade the jury that the payments were effectively electoral interference.\n\nMr Trump, 77, has denied a sexual encounter took place and denied the charges.\n\nDe Niro fracas\n\nDrama unfolded outside the courthouse, however, as pro- and anti-Trump protesters clashed.\n\nOn some days there have been relatively few protesters around the Downtown building. But as a verdict nears, numbers have grown and tempers have been raised.\n\nA group of police officers who helped prevent the January 6 insurrection joined with Robert De Niro in supporting Mr Biden.\n\n\"We were all called traitors on January 6 for doing our job,\" said retired Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, reported the New York Post.\n\nAnother said Mr Trump was an \"an authoritarian who answers only to himself.\"\n\nBut it was the Taxi Driver and Raging Bull star's comments about his fellow New Yorker that led to a clash with Trump supporters.\n\n\"He doesn't belong in my city,\" he said.\n\n\"He's a clown. But this city is pretty accommodating, we accommodate clowns.\"\n\nDe Niro said Mr Trump wanted to \"sow total chaos.\"\n\n\"He will never leave. This is not a threat, this is a reality.\n\n\"Donald Trump wants to destroy not only this city and the country but the entire world.\"\n\nOne pro Trump protester then made unsubstantiated claims that De Niro was connected to the late disgraced Jeffrey Epstein. There is no evidence for the claim.\n\n\"You're a f****** idiot,\" shot back De Niro.\n\nAs the actor left in a car, the vehicle was jostled with one pro-Trump protester calling him a \"traitor\".\n\nTrump 'innocent,' claim defence\n\n\"President Trump is innocent, he did not commit any crimes, and the district attorney has not met their burden of proof, period,\" defence lawyer Todd Blanch told the jury on Tuesday, local time.\n\nFormer Trump Organisation lawyer Michael Cohen has been key to the prosecution's case. He has claimed that the money he received to be President's Trump's personal lawyer in 2017 was in actually part of a reimbursement for the hush money he paid to Ms Daniels allegedly with Mr Trump's approval.\n\nHe also said that Mr Trump's motivation for paying the cash was less to do with protecting his marriage and more to do with hiding unsavoury details that might put off his potential voters.\n\nBut summing up for the defence, Mr Blanch said Mr Cohen - who has done prison time for violating campaign finance laws in another case related to Mr Trump - couldn't not be believed.\n\n\"You cannot convict President Trump of any crime beyond a reasonable doubt on the words of Michael Cohen.\n\n\"He took an oath, he swore to tell the truth and he told you a number of things on the witness stand that were lies, pure and simple,\" he said.\n\n\"Cohen lied to you\".\n\nMr Blanche said that the scandals Mr Trump was involved in prior to the election - such as the infamous Access Hollywood hot mic tape where he talked about how he would \"Grab (woman) by the pussy,\" - would not effect his election chances so there was little need to cover them up.\n\n\"It was not a doomsday event. He never thought it was going to cause him to lose his campaign, and indeed, it didn't\".\n\nHe also said that Mr Trump was simply too busy being President to actually commit any fraud.", "source":

Trump's criminal trial, then beginning to make sly insinuations about how he was \"free on Wednesdays,\" the court's day off, President Biden's campaign has jumped in with a stunt designed to emphasize the unprecedented situation of a major party's presidential candidate awaiting a felony verdict.\n\nThe Biden campaign on Tuesday dispatched Robert De Niro, the actor whose voice narrates the campaign's latest ad, along with Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone, two former U.S. Capitol Police officers who have since become spokesmen for the Democratic effort to attack Mr. Trump over his role in the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, to hold a news conference outside the courthouse in Manhattan where Mr. Trump's trial was concluding.\n\nMr. De Niro said that Mr. Trump had engaged in a \"coward's violence\" after the 2020 election.\n\n\"He directs the mob to do his dirty work for him,\" he said.\n\nThe news conference was the sort of thing the Trump campaign would have done from the beginning if the political situation were reversed.\n\nThe Biden campaign has for weeks kept to the letter of the president's directive to not address the criminal charges Mr. Trump faces or offer commentary on the trial, but its decision to dispatch surrogates to the Manhattan courthouse while the former president's lawyer was delivering his closing argument was hardly subtle.\n\nThough Mr. De Niro and the two former police officers did not address Mr. Trump's Manhattan trial -- he is charged with falsifying business records related to a hush-money payment to a porn star before the 2016 election -- they sought to draw attention to his actions that led to the events of Jan. 6, which are the subject of another federal criminal case pending against Mr. Trump.", "source": {"uri":

And it's likely to come back to haunt them as Americans are going to see it as just one more example of the lawfare being political to take out former President Donald Trump in the election. They must have thought that Americans weren't paying enough attention to the trial so they were going to highlight it. But what an incredibly bad move on every level.\n\nHere's the advisory that they sent out to the press.\n\nEven that they couldn't get right -- it's May 28, you ridiculous people. Isn't that so typical of the Biden team though? Always wrong, right down to knowing what the date is.\n\nThey even reportedly brought a campaign sign.

They brought along the unhinged Robert De Niro to attack Trump. Who thought this was a good idea?\n\nThen check out this excuse for why they're there. It's not because of the Trump trial, it's because they want to talk to the media. That's why they're attacking Trump right outside of the trial. These people are seriously delusional.\n\nThis is throwing the norms in the dirt and tap-dancing on them, while lying right to our faces and expecting us to buy it.\n\nThen they let De Niro talk and it got even worse as he tried to attack the Trump supporters who were there for the trial -- the trial that the Biden team wasn't there to talk about.\n\nDoes he think there's something wrong with supporters being there? No, what's wrong and \"crazy\" is the Biden team and him showing up and the lawfare against Trump.\n\nHe goes on to call them and Trump \"clowns.\" Um, Bob?

So the Biden campaign slated what was billed as a presser.\n\nThe complete video is above. Di Nero delivered his remarks as pro-Trumpers tried to drown him out or disorient him. After Di Nero's remarks a Trump aide and some Trump supporters online described the Oscar winner and acting icon Di Niro as a \"washed up\" and \"failed\" actor.\n\nNBC News gives this excerpt from Di Niro's remarks:\n\n\"The Twin Towers fell just over here, just over there. This part of the city was like a ghost town, but we vowed we would not allow terrorists to change our way of life. ... I love this city. I don't want to destroy it. Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city, but the country, and eventually he can destroy the world,\" De Niro said.\n\n\"I don't mean to scare you. No, no, wait -- maybe I do mean to scare you,\" De Niro continued. \"If Trump returns to the White House, you can kiss these freedoms goodbye that we all take for granted. And elections -- forget about it. That's over, that's done. If he gets in, I can tell you right now, he will never leave.\n\nAnd what happened as Di Niro left the scene:\n\nAfter the press conference, on the way back to his car, De Niro mixed it up with some pro-Trump protesters, who yelled that he's a \"wannabe,\" \"paid sell-out\" to the Democratic National Committee, \"nobody\" and a \"little punk\" whose \"movies suck.\"\n\n\"You're not going to intimidate,\" De Niro replied. \"That's what Trump does. ... We are going to fight back. We're trying to be gentlemen in this world, the Democrats. You are gangsters.

The former president is facing more than 30 felony counts for falsifying business records. He's accused of concealing hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels to cover up an affair. He's denied knowledge of hush money payments and that an affair ever happened.\n\nFanone and Dunn, both of whom were present and injured on Jan. 6, spoke to MSNBC's Vaughn Hillyard following the wild press conference featuring De Niro. The actor, who recently featured in a Biden ad, predicted the end of American democracy and possibly the world if Trump is reelected to the White House.\n\nDe Niro also got into a tense exchange with a pro-Trump heckler who accused Fanone and Dunn of lying under oath when they testified to the congressional subcommittee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. Both men are vocal Trump supporters.\n\n\"I don't even know how to deal with you, my friend. I don't even know how to deal with you. They stood there. They didn't have to,\" De Niro said after the heckler called the officers \"traitors.\" \"And there were other ones in there who probably were in with them a little bit, too. And they found a way to get around. Not these guys. They stood there and fought for us. For you. For you.\"\n\nFanone said he was \"incredibly grateful\" to De Niro after the presser, but he called it disheartening that the Oscar-winning actor was needed to draw press attention to the potential dangers of Trump. MSNBC and CNN did not carry the press conference live, however, while Fox News did cover the presser, including De Niro's comments.\n\n\"I am incredibly grateful for Robert De Niro lending his celebrity and his voice to this cause. That being said, I think that it's disheartening to know that's what it takes three and a half years after an insurrection in the Capitol in which hundreds of officers were brutalized and our democracy was threatened to get the media's attention,\" Fanone said.\n\nThe former officer did not specifically name any networks, but accused some of \"mischaracterizing\" the events of Jan. 6.\n\n\"There's still networks out there that are mischaracterizing the facts of that day, mischaracterizing the events that led up to the insurrection at the Capitol, and then there are other networks that just turned away from the insurrection as if we can just forget about it and move beyond it,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifying_business_records", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falsifying business records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fanone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fanone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film_actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornographic film actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Multilateral", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Conferences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Maxi-Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Maxi-Basketball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Conferences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fanone.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604887", "eventUri": "eng-9604887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 732, "textEnd": 738, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Subsequently, the Biden Campaign had to select a new out-of-touch celebrity to influence the masses to vote against their best interest. Thus, Robert De Niro has made quite the headlines recently. And today, he partnered with the Biden Campaign to hold an URGENT press conference outside the Trump trial to tell everyone how dangerous he is for the millionth time. However, he provided no evidence to back up what that danger actually is....\n\nBut actually, it's not a threat, it's reality, De Niro claimed outside the Manhattan courtroom, as he implied Trump really is Hitler reincarnated.\n\nAccording to Fox News:\n\n\"I hope this new ad campaign reaches outside the bubble to remind supporters of what a danger he is to our lives. This is not a threat. This is our reality. And that's why I've joined the Biden-Harris campaign, because the only way to preserve our freedoms and hold on to our humanity is to vote for Joe Biden for president,\" De Niro said of Trump Tuesday during the Biden-Harris press conference in Manhattan.\n\nIn other words, the only way to preserve democracy is to vote for Sleepy Joe. Because nothing says Democracy more than convincing people why Democracy is a bad thing. Duh.\n\nThe actor was joined by the Biden campaign's communications director, Michael Tyler, who called Trump a \"chaos agent,\" as well DC Metropolitan Police Department Officer Michael Fanone and former Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, who was present in the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were not present during the event.\n\nOf course, he was joined by those two clowns. So while De Niro calls anyone who disagrees with him a \"low life\" he is baffled as to why someone would accuse the two men of being a \"traitor\" or \"lying under oath.\"\n\nThis clown doesn't even know what he's talking about as he points the finger at Trump for things his side is allegedly purporting to the extreme.\n\n\"Trump poses a unique and growing threat to our fundamental rights and our freedoms, our very democracy and our economy. The threat is crystal clear today and will remain crystal clear tomorrow. And will be crystal clear on the debate stage in Atlanta on June 27th,\" Tyler said, referring to the anticipated June 27th debate between Biden and Trump.\n\nBut I thought it wasn't a threat, I thought it was reality. And when you compare Trump's economy with Bidens, how is Trump the dangerous one? Because anyone who is old enough to vote in Nov. is old enough to have been alive under Trump and it's going to take a lot more than demanding the masses disbelieve their reality.\n\n\"Donald Trump wants to destroy not only the city, but the country. And eventually he could destroy the world,\" he said.\n\nNone of that made any sense and the fear-mongering can only go so far, especially considering he provides not even the least bit of evidence outside ad hominem attacks.\n\nThe best part about all this is that while he probably did all this with the expectation of being flooded with Biden supporters, the opposite seems to have proved to be true.\n\nNo one seemed to be there in support of what this clown had to say. And that's because he doesn't even know what he's saying. And for an actor, De Niro did a crappy job acting at the press conference. Too bad they couldn't get The Rock this year.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fanone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fanone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Department_of_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ad hominem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Performers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Performers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.louderwithcrowder.com/media-library/image.png?id=52334506&width=1200&height=800&coordinates=200%2C0%2C0%2C0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604887", "eventUri": "eng-9604887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 2340, "textEnd": 2349, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Biden's campaign had been wary about feeding into Trump's argument that his criminal trials were the result of politically motivated prosecutions, but ultimately it decided to engage because its message about the stakes of the election was struggling to break through the intense focus on the trial.\n\nA top Biden adviser said they weren't there to talk about the trial -- and De Niro and the officers didn't reference the sordid criminal case directly -- rather to exploit the large media focus on the legal proceedings.

I think they just show how incredibly desperate they were with such a move, blowing up all norms outside his trial right as the case is about to be given to the jury. They've now confirmed it's political, and their actions not have only blown up all norms about not commenting on trials, but doing so at this point in the proceedings opens them up to justifiable claims that they're trying to influence the trial as well. Then adding Robert De Niro to the mix in an unhinged rant just added to the total insanity of it all.\n\nOnce the Biden team had finished imploding their campaign, the Trump team ripped them for their actions, pointing out how their appearance at the courthouse confirmed the political nature of the trial.\n\nFirst, there was Trump Senior Advisor Jason Miller, and he just excoriated the Biden team and mocked De Niro.\n\nMiller said that after months of the Biden team denying that the trial was about politics, they nevertheless showed up and made a campaign event out of it. They even had a campaign sign with them, he noted. He said that they were making it a Biden rally after \"months of weaponizing the legal system against President Trump\" because Biden was doing so badly in the polls - including in all the battleground states - and the Democrats were in full \"freakout\" mode.\n\n\"Joe Biden is losing nationally, he's losing in every single battleground state,\" Miller said. \"And President Trump's numbers continue to rise.\"\n\n\"And the best that Biden can do is roll out a washed-up actor -- and don't worry my remarks will be shorter than \"The Irishman\" -- I wouldn't make you suffer for three hours.\" That's mocking De Niro's incredibly long film. Miller also noted the huge rally for Trump in the South Bronx.\n\nMiller also said they hadn't shown there was any actual crime, and he pulled out the front page of the NY Post with George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley's story criticizing the case, calling it \"Nothing to Bragg About.\"\n\nMiller said he thought even the Biden staffers who were there knew this move on their part was a bad idea, but someone at \"central command\" made them do it because everything was going down the tubes.\n\nTrump Campaign Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was a full-blown concession that this was a political \"witch hunt\" and this case would have been \"laughed out of any courtroom in America.\" She also ripped into the gag order on Trump and called the trial a disgrace and a \"Communist show trial.\"\n\nTrump will ultimately be vindicated, Leavitt said, \"Because he is an innocent man.\"\n\nSteven Cheung then finished up, terming it \"election interference.\"\n\n\"Make no mistake -- This is election interference of the highest order. Crooked Joe Biden and his campaign are in complete freakout mode,\" Cheung declared.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. got it right. De Niro even attacked Trump supporters.\n\nIndeed. This is the move of someone desperate to move the needle. But unfortunately for them, it just shows how they will do anything and say anything, no matter the norms or the consequences, just to try to hold onto power. But it's not changing all the reasons that Americans are rejecting Joe Biden.\n\nMore raging:\n\nBiden Campaign Holds Wild Presser Outside Trump Trial, With Special Guest...

But De Niro first responders who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6 didn't mince words.\n\n\"Somehow he even got self-styled patriots to support a man who called for terminating the Constitution and on Jan. 6 rallied an angry mob to threaten Democracy, leaving death and destruction in its wake. That's why I needed to be involved and wanted to be involved in the new Biden-Harris ad because it shows the violence of Trump and reminds us that he'll use violence against anyone who stands in the way of his megalomania and greed,\" De Niro said.\n\n\"It's a cowards violence. You think Trump ever threw a punch himself? Or took one? This guy, who ran and hid in the White House bunker when there were protesters outside? No way. He doesn't get blood on his hands. He directs the mob to do his dirty work for him by making 'suggestion,' an inference. And his gang grovels and follows his obvious order,\" he said.\n\nFormer Washington, D.C., police officer Michael Fanone and former Capitol police officer Harry Dunn spoke of their personal experiences on Jan. 6, with Fanone describing his injuries suffered at the hands of the mob of Trump supporters seeking to halt Congress' certification of Biden's 2020 presidential victory.\n\n\"I came here today to remind Americans of what Donald Trump is capable of and the violence that he unleashed on all of Americans on Jan. 6, 2021,\" Fanone said.\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records as part of an alleged effort to keep salacious -- and, he says, bogus -- stories about his sex life from emerging during his 2016 campaign. On Monday, Trump called the case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg a \"scam\" and \"witch hunt.\"\n\nThe charges center on $130,000 in payments that Trump's company made to his then-lawyer, Michael Cohen. He paid that sum on Trump's behalf to keep porn actor Stormy Daniels from going public with her claims of a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier. Trump has denied the sexual encounter ever happened.\n\nProsecutors say the payments to Cohen were falsely logged as legal fees. Prosecutors have described it as part of a scheme to bury damaging stories Trump feared could help his opponent in the 2016 race, particularly as Trump's reputation was suffering at the time from comments he had made about women.\n\nTrump has acknowledged reimbursing Cohen for the payment and that it was designed to stop Daniels from going public about the alleged encounter.

The Biden Harris team sought to take advantage of the banks of cameras at the Trump Trial in Manhattan. The campaign rolled out aged Liberal actor Robert DeNiro to calmly explain to us poor, benighted yokels why Donald Trump is bent on destroying the country. This went bad so many ways. The \"Eff Joe Biden\" chants and the blaring car alarm were the very least of the problems. DeNiro's deranged rant segued into arguing with a Trump supporter. It was so squirrelly I had to look away. The Biden people should be profoundly embarrassed.\n\nThe car alarm was flat annoying, but my favorite part was when Robert DeNiro said that everyone in Manhattan tolerated Donald Trump when he was just a \"grubby real estate developer\". That's such a snobby thing to say. Trump is a \"Bridge and Tunnel Guy\". Bridge and Tunnel people have to take a bridge or tunnel go get into Manhattan and \"are not our kind, dear\".\n\nI actually felt sorry for Biden Communications Director Michael Tyler. As he opened his mouth to speak, it seemed like he realized what a mistake they were making:\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign on Tuesday showed up outside former President Donald Trump's New York City criminal hush money trial in an effort to refocus the race on the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.\n\nBiden's team, which had largely ignored the trial since it began six weeks ago, was looking to capitalize on its drama-filled closing moments, sending actor Robert De Niro and some of the first responders at the Capitol that day. A top adviser said they weren't there to talk about the trial, rather to exploit the large media focus on the legal proceedings.\n\n\"We're not here today because of what's going on over there,\" said Biden campaign communication director Michael Tyler, gesturing toward the courthouse. \"We're here today because you all are here.\"\n\nMichael Tyler quickly introduced the star, Robert DeNiro. He began by calling Trump a \"thing\". Yes, that is Michael Fanone, the J6 lying cop, over DeNiro's shoulder:\n\nDeNiro's deranged mind tells him that Donald Trump wants to destroy the city and the country. Donald Trump built large parts of the city. DeNiro reads other people's words. Grubby real estate hustler, my Aunt Fanny. Biden/Harris actually tweeted \"grubby real estate hustler\".\n\nKarl Rove, not a Trump fan, was not best pleased by the Robert DeNiro media avail. From Mediaite:\n\nFox News contributor Karl Rove blasted the Biden campaign for holding a press conference featuring Robert De Niro outside of Donald Trump's trial on Tuesday morning, calling it a \"big mistake\" that should worry President Joe Biden's supporters.\n\n\"Stupid mistake by the Biden campaign! They wanted to get, while all the cameras were there, they wanted to get their moment in the sun. And it was a big mistake,\" began Rove.\n\nHe continued:\n\nIt politicized the trial -- better to have waited. And then what was said, with all due respect to Mr. De Niro, who's a wonderful, wonderful actor, I mean, really the people up for grabs in this election, are they going to be, \"Donald Trump wants to destroy New York, destroy America, and destroy the world. And if you reelect him, he's never going to leave office. He's going to make himself a tyrant for life.\" Are those the kind of credible statements that are going to cause people who don't like Biden and don't like Trump, but are trying to figure out who to vote for. are they going to cause people to say, \"Well, geez, you now told me you wanted to destroy our country? Of course he did.\" The people who believe that are already in the Biden camp. That's not who they should be trying to reach out to. He came close in a moment of talking about January 6 and talking about the two officers, but that might have had an impact. But this was so over the top as to simply be useless. And what a stupid mistake on the part of the Biden campaign. More reason why Democratic leaders are probably going to be concerned that he's the nominee, likely nominee of their party.\n\nThe De Niro press conference was held shortly after closing arguments began in Trump's NYC trial and comes on the heels of a new Politico report suggesting that Democrats are in a \"full-blown freakout\" over the state of Biden's campaign.\n\nKarl Rove is one of the few nimrods who believe that the J6 riot was Trump inspired, so this is huge.\n\nStock up on wine and scotch and whatever. The next couple months are going to be wild. These people are all deranged.\n\nFeatured Image: John Mathew Smith & www.celebrity-photos.com/flickr.com/cropped/Creative Commons", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House Communications Director"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridge (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Rove", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karl Rove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberal Party of Australia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fanone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fanone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First responder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediaite", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mediaite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Bridges_and_Tunnels", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Bridges and Tunnels", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604887", "eventUri": "eng-9604887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 3726, "textEnd": 3735}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

But after the chaotic press conference with De Niro, who has thrown his full support behind the Biden-Harris campaign, Miller had a new target: an Oscar-winning actor.\n\nHis choice of fighting words, however, for De Niro were pretty nonsensical:\n\nWhy is Joe Biden now making this a campaign event after months of weaponizing the legal system against President Trump? Because Joe Biden's numbers are in the tank. The headline for today in Politico very simply said \"Dems in freakout over Joe Biden.\" Joe Biden is losing nationally, he's losing in every single battleground state, and President Trump's numbers continue to rise.\n\nAnd the best that Biden can do is roll out a washed-up actor -- and don't worry, my remarks will be shorter than The Irishman, I won't make you suffer for three hours -- but the best they can do is roll out a washed-up actor. Last week, President Trump spoke in the Bronx. Right? Over 25,000 people show up to rally around him, and the best the Biden campaign could do was put out a web video with Robert De Niro. There is nothing behind the Biden campaign. Their numbers are in the toilet. Kamala Harris is a terrible alternative, and it's all an attempt to try to turn around the Biden campaign.\n\nRobert De Niro is generally regarded as one of the greatest actors of the modern era, and he has been nominated for nine Academy Awards and won two of them (for The Godfather and Raging Bull), and his most recent nomination was just this year, for Killers of the Flower Moon. He has so many awards and nominations that there is a separate Wikipedia page just for his awards and nominations. He is also starring in the upcoming Netflix series Zero Day, alongside several A-list actors including Angela Bassett, Jesse Plemons, Lizzy Kaplan, and Connie Britton, none of whom have ever been referred to as \"washed-up.\"", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(playwright)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (playwright)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irish people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killers_of_the_Flower_Moon_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Killers of the Flower Moon (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_(novel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Godfather (novel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Plemons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Plemons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connie_Britton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connie Britton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Bassett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Angela Bassett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raging_Bull_(roller_coaster)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raging Bull (roller coaster)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "The Bronx"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Acting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Acting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Screen_Actors_Guild_Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Awards/Screen Actors Guild Awards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Awards", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Americas-Newsroom-10_58_36-am-2024-05-28.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604887", "eventUri": "eng-9604887", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The fight still continues now. What happened that day was an attempt to halt, to overthrow an election. Donald Trump is the greatest threat to our democracy and the safety of communities across the country today. He has encouraged and continued to encourage political violence. We've been called traitors, just today. We were all called traitors on January 6 for doing our job. And yes, we protected Republicans, we protected Democrats alike. It's not about the story that we don't agree with. Political violence is never acceptable ... but you have a presidential candidate that champions it, that encourages it, that supports it. We cannot have that.\n\n'The fact that Harry Dunn, Fanone, and the others are going to do a swing-state tour with Biden is just fodder for those of us who know the truth of what they really did happen on January 6.'\n\nDunn also said, \"Americans need to wake up. This is not a drill,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe former cop -- who also recently lost a bid for a U.S. House seat -- added, \"We can't count on these institutions to stop Donald Trump. It's going to take us Americans at the ballot box to defeat him once and for all,\" the AP said.\n\nThe news conference also featured anti-Trump barbs from left-wing actor Robert De Niro, who called Dunn and another former Capitol Police officer, Michael Fanone, \"true heroes.\" A person standing close by called them \"traitors\" and said \"they lied under oath.\" That set off De Niro, who clearly didn't know what the person was talking about. The actor finally admitted, \"I don't know, I don't even know how to deal with you, my friend. I don't even know how to deal with you.\"\n\nBlaze News investigative journalist Steve Baker has penned multiple analyses pushing back against Dunn's many claims about January 6, such as \"January 6 and the N-word that wasn't,\" \"Harry Dunn's account of January 6 does not add up. At all.\" and \"Why did a powerful veterans' PAC endorse Harry Dunn, phony 'hero' of January 6?\"\n\nBaker offered Blaze News the following reaction to Tuesday's news conference:\n\nThe fact that Harry Dunn, Fanone, and the others are going to do a swing-state tour with Biden is just fodder for those of us who know the truth of what they really did happen on January 6. Watching this presser with De Niro when someone said, \"They lied under oath\" and \"they're traitors,\" and De Niro replied, \"I don't even know how to deal with you\" -- of course he doesn't know. He's unaware that we have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that some of those cops lied under oath, both in congressional and trial testimonies.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A&E_Networks", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A&E Networks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Dunn", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Dunn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Baker_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Baker (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fanone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael Fanone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perjury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_action_committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political action committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/former-capitol-cop-harry-dunn-subject-of-blaze-news-jan-6-investigation-calls-trump-greatest-threat-to-our-democracy.png?id=52334519&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C137", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604887", "eventUri": "eng-9604887", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 87, "textEnd": 93, "freq": 10}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

The people who believe that are already in the Biden camp.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nRove went on to say that the campaign should have used De Niro to reach out to voters who were on the fences -- and instead, his \"over-the-top\" anti-Trump screed had only appealed to those who would have voted for Biden regardless.\n\n\"This was so over the top as to simply be useless. And what a stupid mistake on the part of the Biden campaign.

The luxury traveler\u2014defined by McKinsey as someone who spends at least $500 per night on accommodations\u2014has been around for some time, but the demographics of this segment are shifting on various fronts. Unsurprisingly, about two-thirds of the $239 billion luxury travel market is powered by the affluent class. What McKinsey defines as \u201cultrahigh net-worth\u201d folks (worth more than $30 million) accounted for 15% of all luxury travel spending last year. \u201cVery high net-worth\u201d travelers worth between $5 million and $30 million represented 16% of the segment, and \u201chigh net-worth\u201d travelers worth between $1 million and $5 million accounted for a full third (33%) of luxury market spending in 2023. But the report also highlights \u201ca large and expanding base of aspiring luxury travelers\u201d whose net worths are significantly leaner\u2014between $100,000 and $1 million. Last year, 35% of spending in the segment was powered by these \u201caspiring luxury\u201d travelers, who collectively spent $84 billion on luxury travel\u2014more than any other cohort. \u201cIt\u2019s crucial to understand this non-millionaire segment for two reasons,\u201d write the report\u2019s authors. \u201cFirst, it is comparatively large. Second, its forays into select prestige elements present opportunities for brands that hope to attract its enduring loyalty\u2014especially as some of its members graduate into higher tiers of income and wealth.\u201d Spending on travel peaks between the ages of 40 and 50, but younger travelers are showing an increasing willingness and ability to spend at luxury levels, per the McKinsey survey. \u201cAspiring luxury\u201d travelers are typically under 40. Their salaries may not be astronomical. They may not own their own homes. So how do these younger, less affluent travelers afford champagne experiences on what used to be called a beer budget? By being willing to devote out-sized shares of their wealth on experiences. More than four in five non-millionaire luxury travelers are motivated to \u201cexplore someplace new,\u201d according to the survey, and nearly six in 10 said they were interested in taking a \u201ccultural or historical\u201d trip. In general, luxury travelers are more likely than mainstream travelers to take a specialty trip. They want novelty. Seventy-two percent of luxury travelers place importance on visiting a new destination, compared with 44% of other travelers, per the report. ForbesWhy The World's Top Travel Brands Are Betting Big On Indian TouristsBy Suzanne Rowan Kelleher The geographic source market for luxury travelers is also shifting, according to McKinsey. \u201cAlthough North America is still home to the most millionaires, it could be overtaken by Asia by the mid-2030s\u2014largely as a result of growing wealth in China,\u201d write the report\u2019s authors. Spurred by the growing wealthy class in Asia, the hospitality industry is responding with a boom in hotel construction. Last year, more than 40% of the global luxury-hotel pipeline was in Asia; of those, 43% were in China. By the end of the decade, McKinsey projects that the biggest spending cohort be high net-worth travelers worth between $1 million and $5 million, a group that will be spending $154 billion by 2030. Still, the next-biggest spending group will remain aspiring travelers, who will pour a not-so-shabby $107 billion into the luxury travel market by the end of the decade. Follow me on LinkedIn.

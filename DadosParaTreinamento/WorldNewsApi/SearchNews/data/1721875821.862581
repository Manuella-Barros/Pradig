{"id": 239753844, "title": "Review: Theatre Prospero's Anthem of Life Part 1 a magical creation story filled with dance", "text": "There\u2019s also a lot of dance, which seems appropriate for a show about creation. A combination of artistic avenues are used throughout, from shadow puppets to song and movement. It comes together in Anthem of Life Part 1 for a magical whole, a delight to behold. The massive masks used to represent the gods of the universe are especially beautiful, an incredible prop that lends a special pop to the creators. Each god has a gorgeously crafted mask, almost three feet long and dangling long strings and painted with incredible detail. Yet each mask is light enough that the cast can carry them around on stage with no trouble. A special shoutout also goes to the live African drumming ensemble that accompanies the show. It would have been easy to use recorded music, but the live drumming and performance add a very special and warm touch to the show. Anthem of Lif is only part 1 of Mollel\u2019s trilogy in re-imagining the Anthem of the Decades, so we don\u2019t get the full story of humanity. But what he and Theatre Prospero have created is a wonderous thing, a fusion of dance, music and storytelling. It\u2019s going to be exciting to see what the next two parts bring.", "summary": "Anthem of Life Part 1, playing at the Alberta Avenue Community Centre through July 6, combines dance and music as it tells a rendition of a South African creation myth.", "url": "https://edmontonjournal.com/entertainment/review-theatre-prosperos-anthem-of-life-part-1-a-magical-creation-story-filled-with-dance", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/edmontonjournal/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/theatre-prospero-24-anthem-of-life-part-1-production-photos-.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:09:42", "author": "Justin Bell", "authors": ["Justin Bell"], "language": "en", "source_country": "CA", "sentiment": 0.832}

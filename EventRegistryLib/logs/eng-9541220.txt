(Reuters) Xabi Alonso's rampaging Bayer Leverkusen will have an additional incentive in today's home second-leg Europa League semi-final against Roma: breaking a 59-year-old European football record.\n\nAvoiding defeat against Roma today will not only mean a trip to Dublin for the Europa League final, it will also extend their unbeaten run to 49 games - the best mark in European football history.\n\nA Eusebio-inspired Benfica went on a 48-game unbeaten streak between 1963 and 1965. The record has stood since, but Leverkusen have a golden chance of blowing it out of the water.\n\nAlonso's side has already overtaken Juventus' 43-match unbeaten run from 2011 to 2012, which was the best of a team in the top five European leagues.\n\nLeverkusen won 2-0 in Rome last week and could progress to the final even with a one-goal loss, but breaking the record would be yet another outstanding achievement in an already brilliant season.\n\nSpeaking after Leverkusen equalled Benfica's record with a 5-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday, Leverkusen goalkeeper and captain Lukas Hradecky said pursuit of an unbeaten season gave his side \"extra motivation\".\n\n\"It's close,\" said Hradecky after the game, explaining \"I can tell my granddaughter and grandson about this.\"\n\nThe Finn was referring to the league season, where Leverkusen have two more games to become the first team to go a Bundesliga campaign without defeat, but Leverkusen are just five matches away from an unbeaten treble.\n\nEven with Alonso forced to watch from the stands due to a yellow card suspension, Leverkusen were not troubled against Frankfurt.\n\nAlready crowned Bundesliga champions for the first time back in April, Leverkusen are through to the German Cup final, where they face second-division Kaiserslautern.\n\nAvoiding defeat today will set up a meeting with either Atalanta or Marseille in the Europa League final in Dublin.\n\nBefore the start of the season, Leverkusen had just two major trophies in their history.\n\nWith the Bundesliga already under their belt, Alonso's side could more than double their historical trophy haul in the Spaniard's first full season in charge of a top side.\n\nFormer Leverkusen coach and sporting director Rudi Voeller said the call to hire Alonso was \"brave and adventurous\", as well as a \"perfect decision\". Speaking with the Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger, Voeller praised Leverkusen's \"outstanding squad\" depth.\n\n\"It's rare in the football business that you not only strengthen in the top positions, but also in the areas behind them.\n\n\"That's the secret why Bayer is still unbeaten.\n\n\"The treble is still possible. But no matter what happens, it's still an outstanding season.\"\n\nLeverkusen have managed to keep their stunning run going despite Alonso deciding to rest players.\n\nAttacking midfielder Florian Wirtz and wing-back Alex Grimaldo were left out of the squad entirely on Sunday.\n\n\"They had small complaints in the last few days. We didn't want to take any risks,\" Alonso said.\n\n\"They'll train again from Tuesday.\" Leverkusen scored five despite missing Wirtz, their attacking midfield lynchpin, and assists machine Grimaldo.\n\nWirtz has four goals and four assists in nine Europa League games this season, including a goal in the first leg in Rome.\n\n\"He's still 21 and has a great future ahead of him,\" Alonso said after the Roma game.\n\nWirtz celebrated his 21st birthday at midnight just an hour after the match was over, with the team celebrating with the midfielder in the dressing room.\n\nWith close to a full-strength squad and playing at home\n\nfor the second-last time this\n\nseason, breaking Benfica's record on Thursday could be the next step in Wirtz and Leverkusen's great future.", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverkusen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Granit Xhaka initiated the scoring with a striking long-range shot from 18 meters into the top right corner at the 12-minute mark, leaving Frankfurt's goalkeeper Kevin Trapp unable to respond. Despite creating several more opportunities, Xabi Alonso's side initially struggled to capitalize further.\n\nFrankfurt momentarily found their footing when Fares Chaibi's corner kick set up Hugo Ekitike for a close-range header, leveling the score in the 32nd minute.

The visitors then solidified their advantage in the second half, beginning with Exequiel Palacios converting a penalty awarded for Niels Nkounkou's foul on Nathan Tella.\n\nThe scoring didn't stop there, as Jeremie Frimpong and Viktor Boniface both found the net, with Boniface's goal coming from another penalty, sealing the emphatic 5-1 win.\n\n\"We got a good result and played very professionally.

All odds are provided by our best-reviewed football betting sites. Odds are subject to change.\n\nWith a few weeks remaining, this is already the greatest season in Bayer Leverkusen's history.\n\nCrowned German champions for the first time in April, Xabi Alonso's side are through to the DFB-Pokal final and are on the brink of reaching the Europa League showpiece too.\n\nWhat is more, they are still unbeaten in all competitions. Never mind Leverkusen, this could yet become one of the most impressive seasons ever by any European team.\n\nSceptics will scoff that Leverkusen have not done anything yet in the Champions League. But the fact they could complete a treble without losing a single game in any tournament would be a feat for the ages, especially as Leverkusen are not exactly a European heavyweight.\n\nAlonso's team are in pole position to triumph in this tie. A 2-0 victory at the Stadio Olimpico last week means they are odds-on favourites to reach the final at the expense of Roma.\n\nAlonso took a gamble in making numerous changes to his side for Sunday's Bundesliga clash with Eintracht Frankfurt. Yet a much-changed XI strolled to a 5-1 win on the road. That sums up both their quality and confidence.\n\nLeverkusen have a maximum of five matches remaining this term. In the Bundesliga, only Bochum and Augsburg stand between them and the history books as Leverkusen seek to become the first German side ever to go an entire top-flight campaign undefeated.\n\nIn the DFB-Pokal final, second-tier Kaiserslautern are unlikely to be able to halt this juggernaut. And provided Leverkusen see off Roma on Thursday, they will be the favourites to overcome either Marseille or Atalanta in Dublin on May 22.\n\nRoma will feel they can at least cause Leverkusen some problems here. If they were to score the first goal on the night, the BayArena crowd could grow nervous.\n\nDeep down, though, Daniele De Rossi must know that his team has a mountain to climb.\n\nBayer Leverkusen hold a 2-0 aggregate advantage over Roma as they seek a place in the Europa League final.\n\nBayer Leverkusen delivered the perfect away performance in Rome last week. They had 19 shots compared to eight for their opponents, and crucially two of those attempts ended up in the back of the net.\n\nLeverkusen had less of the ball than Roma and there were times when they had to dig in defensively. But they did that with resolve and organisation, allowing them to depart the Stadio Olimpico with a 2-0 win.\n\nRealistically, Roma need to break the deadlock on Thursday to keep their hopes of progression alive. The concession of the first goal would surely doom De Rossi's division to defeat.\n\nThe maturity of this Leverkusen team means they will be able to manage the match and stay in control. As Roma get more and more desperate, the German champions have the attributes to pick them off on the break.\n\nGiven how well their season has gone, Leverkusen's players must have a huge amount of belief surging through their bodies. They can complete the job in style on Thursday - by beating Roma for a second time.\n\n\u26bd Tip Bayer Leverkusen to win at 3/5 with BetMGM \u26bd\n\nAlonso has shown throughout this season that he is a smart head coach. He has given Bayer Leverkusen an identity, but his team have a pragmatic side that has helped them go unbeaten for the entire campaign to date.\n\nWe should see another example of that on Thursday. With a two-goal aggregate advantage for comfort, Leverkusen will likely look to hold Roma at arm's length.\n\nDe Rossi has given the team he inherited from Jose Mourinho more attacking verve, but Roma are not exactly free-scoring.\n\nThe Italian outfit have scored more than one goal in only three of their last 11 encounters in all competitions.\n\nThat bodes ill for their chances of overturning a 2-0 deficit. All things considered, this could be a low-scoring match at the BayArena.\n\n\u26bd Go for under 2.5 goals at 11/10 with Sky Bet \u26bd\n\nVictor Boniface is Bayer Leverkusen's top scorer with 19 goals in all competitions. Five of those strikes have come in seven Europa League appearances, which means only four players have been more productive in this tournament.\n\nBoniface came off the bench to score a late penalty in Saturday's 5-1 demolition of Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nGiven he only played for 30 minutes at the weekend, the Nigeria international should be reasonably fresh for the visit of Roma.\n\nThirteen of Boniface's goals this term have come at the BayArena and he will fancy his chances of increasing that number on Thursday.\n\nRoma will struggle to keep a clean sheet against Leverkusen, especially in a game where they will have to put the ball at risk more than usual.\n\nBoniface will be desperate to reach the 20-goal mark for 2023/24. He might not have to wait too much longer.\n\n\u26bd Back Victor Boniface to score any time at 5/4 with BetMGM \u26bd\n\nCommercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to talkSPORT. 18+.

The record has stood since, but Leverkusen have a golden chance of blowing it out of the water.\n\nAlonso's men won 2-0 in Rome last week and could progress to the final even with a one-goal loss, but breaking the record would be yet another outstanding achievement in an already brilliant season.\n\nSpeaking after Leverkusen equalled Benfica's record with a 5-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt on May 5, Leverkusen goalkeeper and captain Lukas Hradecky said pursuit of an unbeaten season gave his side \"extra motivation\".\n\n\"It's close,\" said the Finn, explaining that \"I can tell my granddaughter and grandson about this\".\n\nHe was referring to the league season, where Leverkusen have two more games to become the first team to go a Bundesliga campaign without defeat, but they are also just five matches away from an unbeaten treble.\n\nAlready crowned Bundesliga champions for the first time back in April, Leverkusen are through to the German Cup final, where they face second-division Kaiserslautern.\n\nIn addition, avoiding defeat against Roma will set up a meeting with either Atalanta or Marseille - that clash is tied at 1-1 - in the Europa League final in Dublin.\n\nBefore the start of the season, Leverkusen had just two major trophies in their history.\n\nWith the Bundesliga already under their belt, Alonso's side could more than double their historical trophy haul in the Spaniard's first full season in charge of a top side.\n\nFormer Leverkusen coach and sporting director Rudi Voeller said the call to hire Alonso was \"brave and adventurous\", as well as a \"perfect decision\".\n\nSpeaking with the Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger, he praised Leverkusen's \"outstanding squad depth\".\n\n\"It's rare in the football business that you not only strengthen in the top positions, but also in the areas behind them. That's the secret why Bayer is still unbeaten,\" he said.\n\n\"The treble is still possible. But no matter what happens, it's still an outstanding season.\"\n\nLeverkusen have managed to keep their stunning run going despite Alonso deciding to rest some of his key players like attacking midfielder Florian Wirtz and wing-back Alex Grimaldo against Frankfurt.\n\nWith close to a full-strength squad, few would bet against Alonso's men breaking Benfica's record when they take on Roma.

Nothing is done and we've seen a lot of comebacks in football in the last year.\n\n\"You can never say the job is done.\"\n\nHow does Leverkusen's incredible unbeaten run compare?\n\nAlonso's side have been extending their record run since breaking the previous elite leagues mark of 44 games - set by Juventus in May 2012 - last month.\n\nThey made it 45 games unbeaten with the 1-1 draw with Borussia Dortmund, when they needed a 97th-minute equaliser by Josip Stanisic.\n\nOf their 48 undefeated games across all competitions, Leverkusen have won 40 of those.\n\nIt means they are now one game away from surpassing the unbeaten run a Eusebio-led Benfica side managed between December 1963 and February 1965.\n\nThat feat by the Portuguese giants stood alone as the longest unbeaten run since the advent of European competition, according to Uefa, until Leverkusen equalled it with their 5-1 thrashing of Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday.\n\nHas anyone else claimed an Invincible Treble?\n\nWinning a trophy treble of any sort in a season is an incredible and difficult achievement for any side, but to do it unbeaten takes it to another level.\n\nCeltic memorably claimed a domestic Treble in 2016-17 without losing a game but, as brilliant as that clean sweep was, they did taste defeat in the Champions League and went out at the group stage.\n\nAjax famously were unbeaten in the Eredivisie and Champions League in the 1994-95 season but had one defeat when they lost in the KNVB Cup.\n\nShould Leverkusen get to the end of the season unbeaten then they will have produced a campaign to live long in the memory - and in the record books.\n\nAny more records to be broken?\n\nAlonso's remarkable side are just two games away from going the entire league campaign unbeaten.\n\nLeverkusen last suffered defeat in a competitive game on 27 May 2023, and they may yet challenge some other notable runs.\n\nIn terms of Europe's elite divisions, Arsenal went 49 league games undefeated from May 2003 to October 2004, taking in their 'Invincibles' season.\n\nBut Leverkusen would need to stay unbeaten deep into next season to reach that mark, and further still to beat the record for the 'top five' leagues, which is held by AC Milan.\n\nFabio Capello's 'Invincibili' did not lose in 58 consecutive Serie A games from May 1991 until March 1993.\n\nLeaving it late - Leverkusen's last-ditch goals\n\nLeverkusen have left it late on a number of occasions to keep their incredible run going.\n\nStanisic's goal was one of 16 they have scored in the 90th minute or later across all competitions this season.\n\n\"It's not easy to explain what we did again in the last minute,\" Alonso said after Robert Andrich rescued a 2-2 draw against Stuttgart on 27 April.\n\n\"There's no explanation why it happens so often, but it's good for us.\"\n\nEuropean glory on its way back?\n\nOn Thursday, Bayer Leverkusen will look to seal their place in the final of the Europa League when they host Roma.\n\nThis has been a long campaign for Leverkusen with the pressure to win every game increasing as the end of the season draws closer, but they show no signs of wilting.\n\nThe 2-0 win in Italy last week was Roma's first home defeat in 14 Europa League knockout matches, and only their second home loss in 33 European fixtures at the Stadio Olimpico.\n\nThat victory is the reason why Leverkusen could lose their unbeaten record and still reach a first European final since they lost to Real Madrid in the 2002 Champions League showpiece match.\n\nLeverkusen are closing in on football immortality, though, so regardless of what their players might say, they will want to avoid any blemishes on what is already an incredible campaign.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverkusen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligue_1", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ligue 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFB-Pokal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DFB-Pokal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amine_Adli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amine Adli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

But we are always moving forward. We are always concentrating on the work and improving,\" Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso told reporters after Sunday's match.\n\nSomething special has happened at Bayer Leverkusen this season.\n\nDie Schwarzroten have already wrapped up the Bundesliga title - the first in the club's 119-year history, ending Bayern Munich's 11-year dominance in the process - reached the German Cup final and hold a 2-0 advantage going into their Europa League semifinal second leg.\n\nDoing all that without losing a single game has been one of the standout stories in world soccer this season.\n\nCredit goes to manager Alonso for instilling a never-say-die attitude into his players - the squad has become renowned for its propensity to pull late goals out when the odds seem stacked against it.\n\nBut the former Spain international is not content with his team's achievements to date and wants to continue the incredible run until the end of the season.\n\nLeverkusen still has two league games against ninth-ranked Augsburg and 14th-ranked VfL Bochum, the German Cup final against second division FC Kaiserslautern, the semifinal second leg against Roma and a potential Europa League final to come.\n\n\"It will be the perfect run. We will certainly try,\" Alonso said.\n\n\"We still have games to play to achieve our big goals in all competitions. The next game is important for us, the second leg of the Europa League semifinal: a chance to reach the final.\n\n\"In football, it's sometimes difficult to stop. You have to prepare for the next game. And the next game is a big game for us. Hopefully, we have the chance to be in a European final again.\"\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_church@aol.com", "name": "Ben Church", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverkusen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremie_Frimpong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeremie Frimpong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exequiel_Palacios", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exequiel Palacios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldstadion_(Frankfurt)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Waldstadion (Frankfurt)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eintracht_Frankfurt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eintracht Frankfurt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granit_Xhaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Granit Xhaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrik_Schick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrik Schick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

But we are always moving forward. We are always concentrating on the work and improving,\" Leverkusen manager Xabi Alonso told reporters after Sunday's match.\n\nLeverkusen's fans have not seen their side lose a game this season.

We will certainly try,\" Alonso said.\n\n\"We still have games to play to achieve our big goals in all competitions. The next game is important for us, the second leg of the Europa League semifinal: a chance to reach the final.\n\n\"In football, it's sometimes difficult to stop. You have to prepare for the next game. And the next game is a big game for us.

Granit Xhaka initiated the scoring with a striking long-range shot from 18 meters into the top right corner at the 12-minute mark, leaving Frankfurt's goalkeeper Kevin Trapp unable to respond. Despite creating several more opportunities, Xabi Alonso's side initially struggled to capitalize further.\n\nFrankfurt momentarily found their footing when Fares Chaibi's corner kick set up Hugo Ekitike for a close-range header, leveling the score in the 32nd minute. The home team looked to build momentum, yet their finishing was lacking, with Omar Marmoush missing crucial one-on-one opportunities against Leverkusen's goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky towards the end of the first half, reports Xinhua.\n\nLeverkusen regained the lead just before the halftime whistle, with Patrik Schick heading in Adam Hlozek's deflected effort, making it 2-1. The visitors then solidified their advantage in the second half, beginning with Exequiel Palacios converting a penalty awarded for Niels Nkounkou's foul on Nathan Tella.\n\nThe scoring didn't stop there, as Jeremie Frimpong and Viktor Boniface both found the net, with Boniface's goal coming from another penalty, sealing the emphatic 5-1 win.\n\n\"We got a good result and played very professionally. We started the game well, but after Frankfurt's equalizer we had some weaker minutes. Patrik Schick's goal before the break was very important. In the second half we defended well and were very effective up front,\" said Leverkusen coach Alonso.\n\nElsewhere in the Bundesliga, Bochum delivered a surprising 4-3 victory against Union Berlin, intensifying the latter's relegation fears, while Mainz remained in the relegation zone after a 1-1 draw with Heidenheim.", "source": {"uri": "mangalorean.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mangalorean.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverkusen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Trapp", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Trapp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eintracht_Frankfurt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eintracht Frankfurt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granit_Xhaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Granit Xhaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Marmoush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omar Marmoush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_kick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corner kick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrik_Schick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrik Schick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Nkounkou", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Niels Nkounkou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremie_Frimpong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremie Frimpong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exequiel_Palacios", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exequiel Palacios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1._FC_Union_Berlin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1.

Confirming that status with five games to go in the league, Xabi Alonso's side broke Bayern Munich's hegemony. Yet, the more impressive feat is the manner in which the Spanish manager has conducted this German orchestra in 2023/24. Bayer Leverkusen is yet to lose a game in all competitions this season.\n\nAssuming Leverkusen gets past Bochum and Augsburg in the last two matchday, Leverkusen would be the first German club to go an entire league season without a loss. Moreover, it would be the first team in Europe's top leagues to accomplish the feat since Juventus in 2011/12. However, the more direct comparison for success at Leverkusen this season has been Arsenal, generally seen as the best unbeaten run among Europe's top leagues. The Gunners did so 20 years before Leverkusen's current run.\n\nWhat Bayer Leverkusen has been able to do this season is among the most remarkable feats in modern soccer history. This is not a side rife with expensive signings, nor does it have the history where fans expect this sort of campaign. Bayer Leverkusen is in the middle of the most impressive feat in German soccer history. While there is a case that Arsenal's accomplishments in the Premier League are more valuable, Bayer Leverkusen's story is simply worth more plaudits based on the season as a whole.\n\nArsene Wenger's Invincibles did something that had not been done in the English top flight in 115 years. Going an entire season without losing a game against the likes of Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool was remarkable. Other Premier League sides have come close, including Manchester City's centurions of 2017/18 that lost just twice. In the following season, Liverpool lost just once. It still failed to lift the Premier League trophy. That indicates how difficult the Premier League is, and how impressive Arsenal's performance was in its Invincible season.\n\nEven then, Bayer Leverkusen has stretched this unbeaten run beyond just the domestic league. Champions of Germany, Leverkusen is in the semifinals of both the DFB-Pokal and the UEFA Europa League. No team in history has gone undefeated in an entire season when incorporating play in cups and European competition.\n\nJuventus, the last team to go unbeaten in a top European league, lost the Coppa Italia Final to Napoli. Additionally, Juventus did not compete in European tournaments that season. Porto won a treble like Leverkusen is on pace for this season while also going unbeaten in the Primeira Liga. However, that Porto side had losses in the Europa League, Taca de Portugal and the Taca da Liga.\n\nEven Arsenal, with the likes of Thierry Henry, Sol Campbell, Robert Pires and Kolo Toure capitulated in the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Champions League. Losses will happen, particularly when facing the quality of Arsenal's opposition. Leverkusen has great players like Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Alex Grimaldo, Victor Boniface and a rejuvenated Granit Xhaka. Even that talent pales in comparison to Arsenal's.\n\nYet, Leverkusen has not had an easy spell of fixtures in its games. Domestically, Leverkusen has done well against both Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund. Anyone questioning the quality of the team in the Bundesliga can point to the UEFA Champions League. Dortmund just qualified for the Final at Wembley on June 1. Bayern Munich is playing the second leg of its Champions League semifinal on Wednesday against Real Madrid. In the four league games against those two teams, Leverkusen secured six points.\n\nAs seen, Leverkusen drew three games out of the four against the two German giants. In total, Xabi Alonso's side has six draws in league play and a further two in the Europa League. In other words, Leverkusen has won 40 out of its 48 games. That is otherworldly.\n\nTo once again compare Leverkusen to Arsenal's 2003/04 campaign, the Gunners had 12 draws in the Premier League. Its point total of 90 that season does not crack the top 10 most points by a club in Premier League history. Leverkusen, on the other hand, can match the 90-point total from Arsenal in 2003/04 if it wins its last two games. Mind you, that features four fewer games than what Arsenal played.\n\nEven though Leverkusen will not set the Bundesliga's point record for one season, it will be the most impressive campaign in the history of the Bundesliga. So long as there is a case against Arsenal's achievement in the Premier League, whether that be Manchester City's 100-point season or Leicester's stunning title in 2015/16, it cannot rival what Xabi Alonso has done at Leverkusen this season.", "source": {"uri": "worldsoccertalk.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "World Soccer Talk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverkusen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juventus_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Juventus F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Augsburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Augsburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bochum", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bochum"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bochum"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

On Saturday, Leverkusen smashed Eintracht Frankfurt 5-1 in front of 58,000 visitors at sold-out Deutsche Bank Park thanks to goals by Granit Xhaka (12') Patrik Schick (41'), Exequiel Palacios (58' penalty) and Victor Boniface (89' penalty). Hugo Ekitike made it briefly 1-1 (32') but the strike by the French striker wasn't enough against a rampant Leverkusen side.\n\nJust days ahead of the second leg of the UEFA Europa League semifinal against Roma, Leverkusen remains on track for two records. First, Die Werkself can become the first Bundesliga side to play an entire league campaign undefeated. Second, undefeated in 48 games, Leverkusen is now just one game away from breaking the record for the most undefeated games across all competitions.\n\nThat record could fall against Roma on Thursday. In that case, Leverkusen would also be through to the Europa League final. After securing the league title, Leverkusen has already reached the DFB Pokal, where the club will face 2. Bundesliga side Kaiserslautern.\n\n\"We are fully aware of it,\" goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky said when asked about the potential of finishing the season unbeaten. \"We never thought it would get to this ahead of the season starting. But now that we are here, it is an extra motivation.\"\n\nIndeed, with the Bundesliga title wrapped up, playing for records is a much-needed goal as the club tries to keep the pressure up ahead of two or three crucial games in cup competitions.\n\n\"You don't even want to think about what happens if you finally lose a game,\" Hradecky said. \"It is best just to keep the run going. Then we don't have to experience what happens afterward.\"\n\nJust for the record. Leverkusen's last defeat was almost a year ago on May 27, 2027, on matchday 34 on the road against VfL Bochum (3-0). As it happens to be Bochum will be Leverkusen's next opponent.\n\n\"We are so close,\" Hradecky said. \"Historically, today was a very difficult game. Now comes a very difficult game in Bochum. They have a big chance to fight off relegation at home in front of their own fans. That will be a tough game, as we lost to them last time.\"\n\nThe same, however, can be said about Frankfurt. Leverkusen, in fact, lost 5-1 at the Deutsche Bank Park 18 months ago. It was Xabi Alonso's second game in charge. Since then, the Spanish head coach has transformed Leverkusen into an unbeatable machine.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive part of the run is the many tools with which Leverkusen can beat opponents. On Saturday, Alonso rested superstars Florian Wirtz and Alejandro Grimaldo ahead of the Roma fixture. In their stead, Brazilian wing-back Arthur made his starting XI debut, and the 21-year-old was indirectly involved in three of the five goals.\n\nThe ability to rotate his starting XI regularly might have been one of the main reasons for this season's success. Another aspect has been Alonso's uncanny ability to always develop the right tactical solutions whenever his team is in trouble.\n\nWith all that in mind, there is a pretty decent chance Leverkusen can continue their run this Thursday against Roma and set a record with 49 games unbeaten. That still leaves the Bundesliga record.\n\nTwo more wins there, and Leverkusen would become the first team in Bundesliga history to finish a season unfinished. If they also win the DFB Pokal final against Kaiserslautern, the record would move to 53 competitive fixtures unbeaten in 2023/24.\n\nAn incredible record, but what would it mean? \"How it will be evaluated at the end doesn't matter to us,\" Hradecky said. \"We are now just missing 180 minutes to get it, and we will give everything for it. It will give me something to tell my grandchildren if we manage it.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverkusen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldstadion_(Frankfurt)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Waldstadion (Frankfurt)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Avoiding defeat against Roma on Thursday will not only mean a trip to Dublin for the Europa League final, it will also extend their unbeaten run to 49 games -- the best mark in European football history. A Eusebio-inspired Benfica went on a 48-game unbeaten streak between 1963 and 1965. The record has stood since, but Leverkusen have a golden chance of blowing it out of the water.\n\nAlonso's side has already overtaken Juventus' 43-match unbeaten run from 2011 to 2012, which was the best of a team in the top five European leagues.\n\nLeverkusen won 2-0 in Rome last week and could progress to the final even with a one-goal loss, but breaking the record would be yet another outstanding achievement in an already brilliant season.\n\n'I can tell my grandchildren'\n\nSpeaking after Leverkusen equalled Benfica's record with a 5-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday, Leverkusen goalkeeper and captain Lukas Hradecky said pursuit of an unbeaten season gave his side \"extra motivation\".\n\n\"It's close,\" said Hradecky after the game, explaining \"I can tell my granddaughter and grandson about this.\"\n\nThe Finn was referring to the league season, where Leverkusen have two more games to become the first team to go a Bundesliga campaign without defeat, but Leverkusen are just five matches away from an unbeaten treble.\n\nEven with Alonso forced to watch from the stands due to a yellow card suspension, Leverkusen were not troubled against Frankfurt.\n\nAlready crowned Bundesliga champions for the first time back in April, Leverkusen are through to the German Cup final, where they face second-division Kaiserslautern.\n\nAvoiding defeat on Thursday will set up a meeting with either Atalanta or Marseille in the Europa League final in Dublin.\n\nBefore the start of the season, Leverkusen had just two major trophies in their history. With the Bundesliga already under their belt, Alonso's side could more than double their historical trophy haul in the Spaniard's first full season in charge of a top side.\n\nFormer Leverkusen coach and sporting director Rudi Voeller said Thursday the call to hire Alonso was \"brave and adventurous\", as well as a \"perfect decision\".\n\nSpeaking with the Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger, Voeller praised Leverkusen's \"outstanding squad\" depth.\n\n\"It's rare in the football business that you not only strengthen in the top positions, but also in the areas behind them. That's the secret why Bayer is still unbeaten.\n\n\"The treble is still possible. But no matter what happens, it's still an outstanding season.\"\n\nWirtz, Grimaldo to return\n\nLeverkusen have managed to keep their stunning run going despite Alonso deciding to rest players.\n\nAttacking midfielder Florian Wirtz and wing-back Alex Grimaldo were left out of the squad entirely on Sunday.\n\n\"They had small complaints in the last few days.

Granit Xhaka initiated the scoring with a striking long-range shot from 18 meters into the top right corner at the 12-minute mark, leaving Frankfurt's goalkeeper Kevin Trapp unable to respond. Despite creating several more opportunities, Xabi Alonso's side initially struggled to capitalize further.\n\nFrankfurt momentarily found their footing when Fares Chaibi's corner kick set up Hugo Ekitike for a close-range header, leveling the score in the 32nd minute. The home team looked to build momentum, yet their finishing was lacking, with Omar Marmoush missing crucial one-on-one opportunities against Leverkusen's goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky towards the end of the first half.\n\nLeverkusen regained the lead just before the halftime whistle, with Patrik Schick heading in Adam Hlozek's deflected effort, making it 2-1. The visitors then solidified their advantage in the second half, beginning with Exequiel Palacios converting a penalty awarded for Niels Nkounkou's foul on Nathan Tella.\n\nThe scoring didn't stop there, as Jeremie Frimpong and Viktor Boniface both found the net, with Boniface's goal coming from another penalty, sealing the emphatic 5-1 win.\n\n\"We got a good result and played very professionally. We started the game well, but after Frankfurt's equalizer we had some weaker minutes. Patrik Schick's goal before the break was very important.

They are still on course for a historic treble and boast a 2-0 lead from the first leg in Rome last week thanks to goals from Florian Wirtz and Robert Andrich.\n\nRoma have seen a dramatic upturn in form since Jose Mourinho was replaced by Daniele De Rossi on the touchline, although they are now without a win in three matches.

However, the Argentine should be fit enough to feature.\n\nDe Rossi didn't rest his key attackers against the Old Lady during the 1-1 draw on Sunday, although he did heavily rotate his backline.

The record has stood since, but Leverkusen have a golden chance of blowing it out of the water.\n\nAlonso's side has already overtaken Juventus' 43-match unbeaten run from 2011 to 2012, which was the best of a team in the top five European leagues.\n\nLeverkusen won 2-0 in Rome last week and could progress to the final even with a one-goal loss, but breaking the record would be yet another outstanding achievement in an already brilliant season.\n\n- 'I can tell my grandchildren' -\n\nSpeaking after Leverkusen equalled Benfica's record with a 5-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday, Leverkusen goalkeeper and captain Lukas Hradecky said pursuit of an unbeaten season gave his side \"extra motivation\".\n\n\"It's close,\" said Hradecky after the game, explaining \"I can tell my granddaughter and grandson about this.\"\n\nThe Finn was referring to the league season, where Leverkusen have two more games to become the first team to go a Bundesliga campaign without defeat, but Leverkusen are just five matches away from an unbeaten treble.\n\nBefore the start of the season, Leverkusen had just two major trophies in their history. With the Bundesliga already under their belt, Alonso's side could more than double their historical trophy haul in the Spaniard's first full season in charge of a top side.\n\nFormer Leverkusen coach and sporting director Rudi Voeller said Thursday the call to hire Alonso was \"brave and adventurous\", as well as a \"perfect decision\".\n\nSpeaking with the Koelner Stadt-Anzeiger, Voeller praised Leverkusen's \"outstanding squad\" depth.\n\n\"It's rare in the football business that you not only strengthen in the top positions, but also in the areas behind them. That's the secret why Bayer is still unbeaten.\n\n\"The treble is still possible. But no matter what happens, it's still an outstanding season.\"\n\n- Wirtz, Grimaldo to return -\n\nLeverkusen have managed to keep their stunning run going despite Alonso deciding to rest players.\n\nAttacking midfielder Florian Wirtz and wing-back Alex Grimaldo were left out of the squad entirely on Sunday.\n\n\"They had small complaints in the last few days. We didn't want to take any risks,\" Alonso said.\n\n\"They'll train again from Tuesday.\"\n\nLeverkusen scored five despite missing Wirtz, their attacking midfield lynchpin, and assists machine Grimaldo.\n\nWirtz has four goals and four assists in nine Europa League games this season, including a goal in the first leg in Rome.\n\n\"He's still 21 and has a great future ahead of him,\" Alonso said after the Roma game. Wirtz celebrated his 21st birthday at midnight just an hour after the match was over, with the team celebrating with the midfielder in the dressing room.\n\nWith close to a full-strength squad and playing at home for the second-last time this season, breaking Benfica's record on Thursday could be the next step in Wirtz and Leverkusen's great future.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverkusen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

The visitors then solidified their advantage in the second half, beginning with Exequiel Palacios converting a penalty awarded for Niels Nkounkou's foul on Nathan Tella.

They have vanquished opponents with little fuss for much of the campaign and there could still be more to come from Europe's most in-form side.\n\nHere are the many, many records that Bayer Leverkusen have smashed this season, as well as some of the feats they can still achieve before it's over.\n\nLeverkusen supporters would have snapped your hand off for any piece of silverware this season, but they have already claimed the most valuable trophy in their long history. By winning the Bundesliga title, something they did back in mid-April with a 5-0 win over Werder Bremen, they claimed their first ever German championship with a club record number of points.\n\nEuphoria and relief filled the BayArena in equal measure after that demolition of Bremen, with Leverkusen having finished runners-up in the German top flight on five occasions over the past three decades. In fact, the Bundesliga title was the first trophy the club had claimed since a DFB Pokal triumph in 1992/93, bringing a 31-year wait for silverware to an end.\n\nWhat is even more incredible about Leverkusen's triumph this season is that they have done it without being beaten. Not just in the Bundesliga but in all competitions. Their run without a loss currently stands at 48 competitive matches overall - matching Benfica's invincible European record from 59 years ago and setting a new record among Europe's top five leagues.\n\nThey are also the side with the longest unbeaten record among German teams in all competitions, surpassing a 34-game run perviously held by Bayern Munich, and they also became the first Bundesliga side ever to score two or more goals in their opening 12 matches.\n\nAlonso's free-scoring Leverkusen have also netted more goals in the Bundesliga this season than any other in their history, while accumulating more league wins than their previous record of 21.\n\nWhile Leverkusen's 2023/24 campaign has already been historic, they still have some gargantuan games to play. Alonso's men have two more league matches and if they avoid defeat to Bochum and Augsburg, they will become the first ever team to go unbeaten across an entire Bundesliga campaign. But victories in both games would still see them fall just one point short of the all-time Bundesliga points record for a single season, which stands at the 91 set by Bayern in 2012/13.\n\nLeverkusen are also in the DFB Pokal final this season, meaning they could win the trophy for only the second time, as well as one foot in the Europa League final. If they complete that treble, they would be the first side to win the Bundesliga, DFB Pokal and Europa League in a single campaign.\n\nIf they were to win the Europa League, it would be a first European trophy since the 1987/88 UEFA Cup, and their first European final since finishing runners-up in the Champions League in 2001/02.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Leverkusen matched Benfica's record for most unbeaten games across all competitions in Europe, a record they will surpass if they avoid defeat to Roma in their Europa League semi-final second leg on Thursday night.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xabi_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Xabi Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverkusen", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BayArena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BayArena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SV_Werder_Bremen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SV Werder Bremen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFB-Pokal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DFB-Pokal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bremen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bremen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bremen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treble_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treble (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augsburg", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Augsburg"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Augsburg"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Crunching the numbers", "body": "Ryan O'Hanlon is a staff writer for ESPN.com. He's also the author of \"Net Gains: Inside the Beautiful Game's Analytics Revolution.\"\n\nIt wasn't enough for Bayer Leverkusen to win the German Bundesliga. And not just to win the league, but to win the league for the first time in the club's 119-year history, to win the league by ending Bayern Munich's 11-season reign as defending champs, and to win the league by overcoming a team with a wage bill more than four times the size of theirs.\n\nIt wasn't enough just to do any of that, and it wasn't enough to reach the final of the DFB-Pokal cup, or German Cup. And it wasn't enough to beat AS Roma, 2-0, in the first leg of the Europa League semifinals, either.\n\nAll those accomplishments are great -- congrats to Leverkusen on doing all of those things. But rather, Leverkusen under coach Xabi Alonso have defined themselves by avoiding doing another thing: losing.\n\nWe're 48 games into Bayer Leverkusen's season. Provided they avoid a collapse at home against Roma this Thursday, there are five games left in their campaign, and no one has beaten them.\n\nJust how unlikely is Leverkusen's run? Where does it rank in the history of the greatest seasons of all time? And what are the chances that they take this streak all the way?\n\n* Live on ESPN+: Leverkusen vs. Bochum 1848 (Bundesliga, Saturday)\n\n* Live on ESPN+: Leverkusen vs. Kaiserslautern (German Cup, May 25)\n\nThe home team wins 45% of the time, the away team wins 30% of the time, and the remaining 25% of matches end up in a stalemate. Outside of the COVID period when there were no fans in the stands, this level of home-field advantage has remained relatively steady over the past decade-plus across all of Europe's \"Big Five\" top leagues.\n\nIn the average Bundesliga match, then, the likelihood of the home team avoiding a loss is 70%, while the away team escapes defeat 55% of the time. Based on those probabilities, there is a 0.00002% chance that the average Bundesliga team would go undefeated across a stretch of 16 home and 16 away matches. Or: a one-in-50,000 shot.\n\nSure, Leverkusen are not the average Bundesliga team. But just for fun, let's say we had a randomly chosen team of these players: Gianluigi Buffon in goal, Paolo Maldini at left-back, Virgil van Dijk and Franco Baresi in the center of defense, and Philipp Lahm on the right. At the base of midfield, drop in Sergio Busquets, and then throw Patrick Vieira and N'Golo Kant\u00e9 in front of them. Lionel Messi is out right, Cristiano Ronaldo out left, and the Brazilian Ronaldo is playing up top. All of these players will be in their primes. They'll all be willing defenders, they'll all be perfectly healthy for the entire season, and they'll all be managed by Pep Guardiola.\n\nWe'll throw this hypothetical team into the 2023-24 Bundesliga, give them Leverkusen's schedule, and say there was a 90% chance of them winning each game they played and a 5% chance of drawing. Given the low-scoring and relatively random nature of soccer, those numbers would make this the greatest soccer team of all time by a significant margin. (For reference, Manchester City's betting odds in their upcoming game -- a near fait accompli against a Fulham team with nothing to play for -- still only give them a 75% chance of winning and a 15% chance of drawing.) Were this the case, though, their likelihood of making it this far in the season without a loss would still be just 19%.\n\nTake that same all-time great hypothetical team and apply those numbers to the 48-game run Leverkusen are on, and the likelihood of Ronaldo and Messi emerging unscathed would still be just 8.5%. The chances of them taking it all the way to the end of the 53-game season without a loss would be 6.5%. And that's before adjusting for the fact that you can't draw either the DFB-Pokal or Europa League finals -- both of which would tamp down the probability of an undefeated season further.\n\nWhile Leverkusen's Granit Xhaka and Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong are great players, they're not quite on the same level as Vieira, Messi and Paolo Maldini. Although that 1-in-50,000 chance only concerns the Bundesliga -- and not the only other 16 games Leverkusen have played in other competitions thus far -- it's probably not far off from the likelihood that they'd go 48 games undefeated when you control for their talent level. The chances that they'd make it this far without losing a game are way closer to that 0.00002% than that 8.5%.\n\nWe have never seen this before in Europe's top leagues\n\nIf it's not clear already, this just does not happen. And by that, I mean: it has quite literally never happened before.\n\nIn Europe's \"Big Five\" leagues since 1965, the previous record for the number of unbeaten games to start a season was 42, ripped off by Antonio Conte's Juventus in 2011-12. Since they'd finished seventh the season prior, Juve weren't in European competition. They very nearly finished the entire season undefeated -- only to drop the last game of the season, the Coppa Italia final, to Napoli, 2-0.\n\nLeverkusen, of course, are already eight games past Juve's streak. And again, Leverkusen had never won the league before this season.\n\nDespite being relegated to Serie B in 2006 due to the Calciopoli match-fixing scandal, Juventus were the 13th-richest team in the world and the second-richest club in Italy, per Deloitte, for the 2011-12 season. They'd also won the title 27 times before doing it again in Conte's first season with the team. This is Leverkusen's first title, and their most recent revenues didn't even register in the top 30 richest clubs in the world. Leeds United, who were relegated last season, brought in more money than Leverkusen during the most recent accounting period.\n\nAcross all of Europe, and not restricted to one season, Leverkusen's win over Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday equaled Benfica's record of 48 consecutive unbeaten matches from December 1963 to February 1965. Prior to the advent of European competition in 1955, Celtic hold the all-time record for consecutive matches unbeaten, not losing for 62 games in a row between 1915 and 1917. In Belgium, Union Saint-Gilloise made it 60 games unbeaten between 1933 and 1935.\n\nSo, only two teams in the recorded history of professional European soccer have strung together longer streaks without losing than the one that Bayer Leverkusen is currently on. And no team -- since we started writing down schedules, keeping track of results, awarding winners, and codifying what body parts are allowed to touch the ball -- has made it this many matches into a season without losing a single game.\n\nUsing betting odds, we can try to estimate the probabilities of each match. Based on ESPN Bet's numbers for the Europa League semifinal, they're giving Roma a 16% chance of winning. And against Bochum, ESPN Bet sees a 23% chance that Leverkusen lose. Flipped around, Leverkusen have an 84% chance of making it past Roma unscathed and a 77% chance of getting beyond Bochum with at least a point. Take those two probabilities together, though, and there's a 64% chance that this time next week Leverkusen will still have a zero in the loss column.\n\nThe next game would then be home to FC Augsburg -- they're above Bochum in the table, but Bochum are still in danger of being relegated, while Augsburg both can't be relegated and can't qualify for Europe. When one team has something to play for and the other team has nothing to play for, there's evidence that the former outperforms expectations while the latter underperforms. (Shocking, I know.)\n\nTaking the Roma match as the baseline -- at Leverkusen, but a better team than Augsburg that also has to win -- let's adjust Leverkusen's non-loss probability for that game up to 94%. Throw that into the probability chain, and we're down to a 60% chance that Leverkusen remain undefeated through the following three matches.\n\nNext up: the Europa League final against either Marseille or Atalanta. We'll be generous here and say that the gap between Leverkusen and either of those teams is similar to the gap between Manchester City and Manchester United. ESPN Bet's odds give City an 82.5% chance of lifting the FA Cup trophy. (Shootout losses officially get recorded as draws, but c'mon. We want a true undefeated season here.) Throw that 82.5% into the mix, and we're down to a 50% chance that Leverkusen make it to the final game of the season unbeaten.\n\nAs for that game, the DFB-Pokal final against the 14th-place team in Germany's second division? Per ESPN Bet's odds, Leverkusen have a 93% chance of doing the domestic double. Combine that with the 50% number, and there's a 47% chance that Leverkusen push this season across the finish line without a single loss.\n\nThese are estimates, but they're estimates that are likely somewhat kind to Leverkusen, so the major takeaway here is that the most likely outcome for these final five games is that Leverkusen lose at least one. However, it's seems like Xabi Alonso & Co. would be pretty happy with those odds. One-in-about-two looks like a stone-cold guarantee when you compare it to the one-in-about-50,000 chance that they'd ever even make it this far.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_o_hanlon@espn.com", "name": "Ryan O'Hanlon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

Leverkusen came from 2-0 down both in the first leg in Azerbaijan (2-2) and the home return (3-2) with substitute Patrik Schick scoring twice in added time in the latter fixture. Bayer then defeated 2022-23 UEFA Europa Conference League champions West Ham in the quarter finals to reach a second successive Europa League semifinal.\n\nAS Roma: De Rossi successfully guided last season's runners-up past fellow Italian side AC Milan in the quarterfinals. A 1-0 first-leg win at San Siro was followed by a 2-1 home success despite Roma losing defender Zeki \u00c7elik to a 31st-minute red card as goals from Gianluca Mancini and Paulo Dybala had already extended Roma's advantage in the tie.\n\nTeam news\n\nAS Roma: Daniele De Rossi's main doubt is about Paulo Dybala, who is not at his best, but it's likely he will start on Thursday, with the Argentinian expected to make it in the starting lineup alongside Romelu Lukaku and Stephan El Shaarawy. Celik will be back in defense after the suspension.\n\nPossible AS Roma XI: Svilar; Celik, Mancini, Ndicka, Spinazzola; Cristante, Paredes, Pellegrini; Dybala, Lukaku, El Shaarawy.\n\nBayer Leverkusen: The German side is expected to line up with its ideal starting XI, with Florian Wirtz and Victor Boniface leading the attack, and with former AS Roma man Patrick Schick starting on the bench.\n\nPossible Bayer Leverkusen XI: Kovar; Stanisic, Tah, Tapsoba; Frimpong, Xhaka, Palacios, Grimaldo; Adli, Boniface, Wirtz.\n\nPrediction\n\nRoma are expected to start strong since they need to score at least two goals, but Leverkusen are still the strongest side and are expected to play the final in Dublin on May 22.

They have already mathematically secured the Bundesliga title, are set to contest the DFB-Pokal final in three weeks, and are 90 minutes from reaching the Europa League final.\n\nThey must remain resolute, as the aggregate scoreline is not all that matters to this club anymore, seeking such an historic and never-before-seen end to the year.\n\nRoma, meanwhile, are looking to assess the future viability of manager Daniele De Rossi, a legendary player at the club who signed on in January, but has had mixed results at his appointment. The club sits sixth in the Serie A table, barely clinging to a European place and on the precipice of elimination.\n\nUSA: Click here to see the latest odds for Bayer 04 vs AS Roma and bet Europa League matches\n\nBayer Leverkusen have flirted with ruin along their unbeaten season, especially through February and March, but have recovered well.\n\nThey dominated Roma in the first leg of this matchup, and under normal circumstances, the impetus would be on the Italian side to attempt a comeback on the road, but Leverkusen have the extra motivation from their potential unbeaten season to avoid defeat in each individual match alongside their aggregate aspirations.\n\nSimply put, Bayer Leverkusen's second half explosions have been well documented this season. Furthermore, they will likely sit on their aggregate lead and allow Roma to come at them in the beginning, tiring their opponents before striking late to put the game away.\n\nThis is a situation where thanks to their first-leg advantage, Leverkusen can take the chance to be reactive rather than proactive. Add in that Roma through the Serie A season have become more leaky at the back as matches go on, conceding 60 percent of their goals allowed in the second half, including 40 percent in the final 30 minutes of games, and they'll be ripe for the picking after the break.\n\nBayer Leverkusen have no desire to make this match a track meet, and will be looking to keep Roma hemmed in as possible. Roma are not a team with extreme verticality anyways, ranking in the bottom half of Serie A in corners won this season, and with the fourth-fewest since the calendar turned to 2024.\n\nThere were just six corners in the first leg, including four in the second half with Roma trailing, so don't expect much in the way of set pieces, where Bayer Leverkusen have been stingy this season at the back.\n\nThis match has been earmarked for network television in the United States, with the story of Bayer Leverkusen drawing eyeballs as the season nears a close. The game will be televised on CBS, which can be streamed on Fubo, who are offering a FREE trial for new users. It can also be streamed on Paramount+, where every match of the UEFA Champions League and Europa League can be found. Unimas, TUDN and ViX are the options for Spanish viewers.\n\nIn the UK, this match will be televised on TNT Sports 2, with streaming on discovery+.

Leverkusen vs. Roma - prediction, team news, lineups", "body": "Sports Mole previews Thursday's Europa League clash between Bayer Leverkusen and Roma, including predictions, team news and possible lineups.\n\nWith one foot in the Europa League final, unbeaten Bayer Leverkusen host Roma on Thursday evening, as they conclude their semi-final tie at the BayArena.\n\nFor the second season running these clubs are meeting in the semi-finals, but events in the first leg make the new German champions favourites to overturn last year's result.\n\nMatch preview\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nIn addition to gaining revenge for losing to Roma at this stage 12 months ago, Leverkusen took a giant stride towards meeting either Marseille or Atalanta BC in the Europa League final by running out 2-0 winners at Stadio Olimpico.\n\nHaving withstood a scare when Romelu Lukaku struck the crossbar, Die Werkself produced several chances themselves, so goals from star man Florian Wirtz and midfield engine Robert Andrich were just reward for their impressive performance in an intimidating arena.\n\nFollowing a ninth win from 11 Europa League fixtures this season, the Bundesliga winners are now only 90 minutes away from booking their place in Dublin later this month, and an historic treble remains very much on the cards for a team that simply refuses to be beaten.\n\nSensationally crowned German champions with several weeks to spare, Leverkusen have recently produced several late goals to keep their proud undefeated streak intact, but they easily extended that run to 48 games with a 5-1 victory over Eintracht Frankfurt on Sunday.\n\nBenfica's longstanding European record - set between December 1963 and February 1965 - has now been matched, so keeping Roma at bay would cement their place in history.\n\nA trip to Berlin for the DFB-Pokal final - where Leverkusen will meet second-tier strugglers Kaiserslautern - is also on the agenda, and becoming the first team to go through an entire Bundesliga campaign without losing would place the cherry on top.\n\nMuch-coveted coach Xabi Alonso has already confirmed he will stay in situ for another year at least, so everything is in place for the 1988 UEFA Cup winners and 2002 Champions League runners-up to make their first Europa League final appearance.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nDespite losing at home for just the second time in 33 UEFA competition matches, Roma have not abandoned their quest to make a third straight European final - but the outlook looks bleak for the Eternal City side.\n\nThen under Jose Mourinho, the Giallorossi's 1-0 aggregate win over Leverkusen in last year's Europa League semi-finals preceded defeat to Sevilla in the decider, and they had lifted the inaugural Europa Conference League trophy just 12 months previously.\n\nCurrent coach Daniele De Rossi, who is aiming to follow his predecessor's path in Europe and oversaw a quarter-final win over AC Milan, has suffered only four losses in 22 matches since taking charge, following Mourinho's mid-season exit.\n\nAfter a fluent start to his Roman reign, De Rossi's side have averaged a more modest one goal per game over their past 11 outings; slipping to sixth place in the Serie A standings, tied on points with fifth-placed Atalanta, who have one game in hand.\n\nLike Xabi Alonso, De Rossi recently agreed to continue his work into next season, but being held to a 1-1 home draw by Juventus at the weekend - despite taking the lead through Lukaku - means that a prized top-five finish is in some doubt.\n\nRoma could yet qualify for the Champions League via a Europa League win instead, but an improbable comeback is required if they are to become just the third team to reach successive finals in Europe's second-tier tournament.\n\nBayer Leverkusen Europa League form: W D W W D W\n\nBayer Leverkusen form (all competitions): W D D D W W\n\nRoma Europa League form: W W L W W L\n\nRoma form (all competitions): W L W D L D\n\nTeam News\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nXabi Alonso rotated his squad substantially against Frankfurt, making a total of eight changes to the team that started in Italy, but a much more familiar lineup will attempt to guide Leverkusen to second-leg success.\n\nUnburdened by injuries or suspensions, the Spanish coach is set to recall Jonathan Tah, Jeremie Frimpong, Alex Grimaldo and several others to the hosts' first XI.\n\nFlorian Wirtz enjoyed a rare rest at the weekend, but the Germany forward will also return: following his strike in the first leg, the 20-year-old has now netted 12 Europa League goals at this early stage of his career.\n\nHe has, however, still got a long way to catch competition specialist Romelu Lukaku, who has scored seven goals in this season's edition and 27 times overall.\n\nRoma's main marksman should be supported by Paulo Dybala and Stephan El Shaarawy in the visitors' final third, providing Dybala can overcome a minor muscular problem that saw him withdrawn halfway through Sunday's game against former club Juventus.\n\nRight-back Zeki Celik is available after serving a suspension last week, so Rasmus Kristensen - who is not on Roma's UEFA squad list - will make way, while Leonardo Spinazzola and Chris Smalling may both be brought back in to add experience and European know-how.\n\nBayer Leverkusen possible starting lineup:\n\nKovar; Tapsoba, Tah, Hincapie; Frimpong, Andrich, Xhaka, Grimaldo; Wirtz, Adli; Schick\n\nRoma possible starting lineup:\n\nSvilar; Celik, Mancini, Smalling, Spinazzola; Cristante, Paredes, Pellegrini; Dybala, Lukaku, El Shaarawy\n\nWe say: Bayer Leverkusen 1-0 Roma (Bayer Leverkusen win 3-0 on aggregate)\n\nRoma's away record is far from special, and Leverkusen are an immovable object, so an almighty upset is required to send the away side through.\n\nThough the Giallorossi possess plenty of nous, gleaned from their recent European exploits, Xabi Alonso's finely-tuned machine will find a way to win on the night and claim a place in the Europa League final.\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more for this match please click here.\n\nID:543082:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect14458:Previews by emailClick here to get Sports Mole's daily email of previews and predictions for every major game!", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_o_shea@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Jonathan O'Shea", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

The win also ended Leverkusen's five-match losing streak in away head-to-head matches against Frankfurt, further emphasising their dominance this season.\n\nWith the Bundesliga title already secured and a UEFA Europa League final on the horizon, Leverkusen's intent was clear from the outset. Granit Xhaka's thunderous strike from the edge of the area gave them an early lead within the first 15 minutes. Jonas Hofmann had an opportunity to double the advantage, but a last-ditch block from Willian Pacho kept Frankfurt in the game momentarily.\n\nFrankfurt's Hugo Ekitike equalised for the hosts with a well-taken goal from Fares Chaibi's measured delivery shortly after the half-hour mark. The momentum seemed to shift in Frankfurt's favour, and they wasted several promising chances, including a one-on-one opportunity squandered by Omar Marmoush. However, Patrik Schick's powerful header from Adam Hlozek's cross just before half-time put Leverkusen back in the lead.\n\nAfter the restart, Frankfurt's hopes of a comeback were dashed when Niels Nkounkou's moment of madness saw him pull Nathan Tella's shirt in the area, resulting in a penalty that was coolly converted by Exequiel Palacios. Leverkusen's dominance was further cemented when Jeremie Frimpong tapped home the fourth goal following a lightning-quick counter-attack, leaving Frankfurt with an insurmountable task.\n\nDespite their efforts at damage limitation, they conceded a fifth goal when Ansgar Knauff's foul on Frimpong led to another penalty, which Victor Boniface converted. The convincing victory leaves Frankfurt needing a win from their remaining two games to secure a top-six finish, while Leverkusen's unbeaten run now stands level with Benfica's 59-year European record. With the opportunity to write another piece of history when they face Roma in the UEFA Europa League final on Thursday, Leverkusen's remarkable season shows no signs of slowing down.", "source": {"uri": "thewillnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THEWILL NEWS MEDIA - Nigeria News, Nigeria Politics, Breaking News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jude_obafemi@thewillnews.com", "name": "Jude Obafemi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Frankfurt"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eintracht_Frankfurt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eintracht Frankfurt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granit_Xhaka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Granit Xhaka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_04_Leverkusen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bayer 04 Leverkusen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesliga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bundesliga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Marmoush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omar Marmoush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willian_(footballer,_born_1988)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willian (footballer, born 1988)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonas_Hofmann", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jonas Hofmann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverkusen", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrik_Schick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrik Schick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Boniface", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victor Boniface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_Nkounkou", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Niels Nkounkou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansgar_Knauff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ansgar Knauff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremie_Frimpong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeremie Frimpong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exequiel_Palacios", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exequiel Palacios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

The AC Milan winger was with then with Villarreal, who defeated Manchester United 11-10 on penalties following a 1-1 draw during regulation and extra time.\n\nSpartak Moscow forward Victor Moses holds the record for only N igerian who has won the competition twice in 2012/13 and 2018/19 with Chelsea, the latter triumph a 4-1 win at the expense of eternal rivals Arsenal, whose only goal was courtesy fellow Nigerian Alex Iwobi.\n\nMikel Obi (Chelsea) also won it once in the 2012/13 season.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2022 Joe Aribo and Calvin Bassey were runners-up following Glasgow Rangers' defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt on penalties in Seville, Spain.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Punch Newspapers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ebenezer_bajela@punchng.com", "name": "Ebenezer Bajela", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverkusen", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Leverkusen"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.S._Roma", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "A.S.

He has followed soccer closely for much longer and factors in managerial tactics, projected lineups and past performances to make the most-informed decisions possible, keeping his finger on the pulse of the game all over the globe.\n\nFor Leverkusen vs. Roma, Sutton is picking Under 2.5 goals to be scored for a +115 payout. The underdog Italians remain a defensive squad despite going through a coaching change midway through their season. As such, they have conceded two or fewer goals in all but one match across all competition dating dating back to Feb. 10 win they gave up four goals to Inter Milan.\n\nHowever, Leverkusen held Roma to just two shots on target in the first leg of this matchup and have kept a clean sheet in five of their last nine matches overall.\n\n\"They've given up just 23 goals in 32 matches in the Bundesliga, and I think they'll stifle Roma's attack on home soil on Thursday,\" Sutton told SportsLine.

Sutton, a former collegiate soccer player, has been SportsLine's top soccer editor for more than five years. He has followed soccer closely for much longer and factors in managerial tactics, projected lineups and past performances to make the most-informed decisions possible, keeping his finger on the pulse of the game all over the globe.\n\nFor Leverkusen vs. Roma, Sutton is picking Under 2.5 goals to be scored for a +115 payout. The underdog Italians remain a defensive squad despite going through a coaching change midway through their season. As such, they have conceded two or fewer goals in all but one match across all competition dating dating back to Feb. 10 win they gave up four goals to Inter Milan.\n\nHowever, Leverkusen held Roma to just two shots on target in the first leg of this matchup and have kept a clean sheet in five of their last nine matches overall.\n\n\"They've given up just 23 goals in 32 matches in the Bundesliga, and I think they'll stifle Roma's attack on home soil on Thursday,\" Sutton told SportsLine.

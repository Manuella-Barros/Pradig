month.\n\nThe press conference was South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's first in nearly two years\n\nSeoul, South Korea:\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held a rare press conference Thursday, admitting \"shortcomings\" after his party's recent electoral defeat, and laying out policies on issues from the country's low birthrate to Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe press conference was the president's first in nearly two years, and comes after his party suffered a drubbing in legislative elections last month.\n\nOn Ukraine, Yoon vowed to keep strong ties with Kyiv while maintaining a smooth relationship with Russia, ruling out direct weapons shipments and telling reporters that it was his \"firm stance\" not to send lethal arms to countries at war.\n\nOn South Korea's birthrate, one of the world's lowest, he unveiled plans to create a ministry to tackle the issue, which he described as \"a national emergency\".\n\nHis party's defeat in the April 10 parliamentary elections prompted calls for Yoon to change his policy direction and leadership style, as his approval ratings languish less than halfway through his five-year term.\n\nYoon said he has \"pondered a lot over what have been the shortcomings\" of his administration.\n\n\"Communication to explain policy drives and the extent of change people have felt has fallen short,\" he said.\n\nBirthrate ministry\n\nYoon won the 2022 presidential election by the narrowest margin in South Korean history, and his term has been hampered by a series of scandals and his party's lack of a parliamentary majority.\n\nThe president also issued an apology for what he called the \"unwise conduct\" of his wife, first lady Kim Keon Hee, after hidden camera footage last year appeared to show her accepting a luxury handbag in violation of government ethics rules.\n\nBut Yoon said the opposition's call for a special probe into the first lady was \"politically motivated\".\n\nHis plan to fix the country's woeful birthrate comes after it hit a record low in 2023, despite the government pouring billions of dollars into efforts to encourage women to have more children and maintain population stability.\n\nYoon said he would ask lawmakers to cooperate \"to set up the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter Planning\",\n\n\"We will be creating a low-birth planning department in order to establish a more aggressive and powerful control tower,\" he said.\n\n\"In order to overcome the low birth rate, which can be considered a national emergency, we will fully mobilise all of the state's capabilities,\" he added.\n\nThe country's fertility rate -- the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime -- dropped to 0.72 in 2023, down nearly eight percent from 2022, according to preliminary data from Statistics Korea in February.\n\nThat is far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain the current population of 51 million, which at these rates will nearly halve by the year 2100, experts estimate.\n\nArms policy\n\nYoon, who has taken a tough line with the nuclear-armed North, said his country's ties with Moscow had been strained by what Seoul and ally Washington say are arms shipments from North Korea to Russia.\n\n\"North Korea's export of offensive weapons not only supports the illegal waging of war in relation to Ukraine but also clearly violates UN Security Council sanctions resolutions related to North Korea's nuclear weapons,\" Yoon said.\n\nDespite tensions with Moscow over the purported arms shipments, Yoon said he aims to \"manage our relationship with Russia as smoothly as possible\".\n\nBut he said Seoul would not be revising its longstanding policy of not selling arms into active conflicts, which has prevented it from providing military aid to Ukraine.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nSeoul has long sought to join the ranks of the world's top arms exporters -- aiming to be the

Korea president admits 'shortcomings' in rare address", "body": "The party's defeat in April elections prompted calls for President Yoon Suk Yeol to change his policy direction and leadership style\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held a rare press conference Thursday, admitting \"shortcomings\" after his party's recent electoral defeat, and laying out policies on issues from the country's low birthrate to Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe press conference was the president's first in nearly two years, and comes after his party suffered a drubbing in legislative elections last month.\n\nOn Ukraine, Yoon vowed to keep strong ties with Kyiv while maintaining a smooth relationship with Russia, ruling out direct weapons shipments and telling reporters that it was his \"firm stance\" not to send lethal arms to countries at war.\n\nOn South Korea's birthrate, one of the world's lowest, he unveiled plans to create a ministry to tackle the issue, which he described as \"a national emergency\".\n\nHis party's defeat in the April 10 parliamentary elections prompted calls for Yoon to change his policy direction and leadership style, as his approval ratings languish less than halfway through his five-year term.\n\nYoon said he has \"pondered a lot over what have been the shortcomings\" of his administration.\n\n\"Communication to explain policy drives and the extent of change people have felt has fallen short,\" he said.\n\n- Birthrate ministry -\n\nYoon won the 2022 presidential election by the narrowest margin in South Korean history, and his term has been hampered by a series of scandals and his party's lack of a parliamentary majority.\n\nThe president also issued an apology for what he called the \"unwise conduct\" of his wife, first lady Kim Keon Hee, after hidden camera footage last year appeared to show her accepting a luxury handbag in violation of government ethics rules.\n\nBut Yoon said the opposition's call for a special probe into the first lady was \"politically motivated\".\n\nHis plan to fix the country's woeful birthrate comes after it hit a record low in 2023, despite the government pouring billions of dollars into efforts to encourage women to have more children and maintain population stability.\n\nYoon said he would ask lawmakers to cooperate \"to set up the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter Planning\",\n\n\"We will be creating a low-birth planning department in order to establish a more aggressive and powerful control tower,\" he said.\n\n\"In order to overcome the low birth rate, which can be considered a national emergency, we will fully mobilise all of the state's capabilities,\" he added.\n\nThe country's fertility rate -- the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime -- dropped to 0.72 in 2023, down nearly eight percent from 2022, according to preliminary data from Statistics Korea in February.\n\nThat is far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain the current population of 51 million, which at these rates will nearly halve by the year 2100, experts estimate.\n\n- Arms policy -\n\nYoon, who has taken a tough line with the nuclear-armed North, said his country's ties with Moscow had been strained by what Seoul and ally Washington say are arms shipments from North Korea to Russia.\n\n\"North Korea's export of offensive weapons not only supports the illegal waging of war in relation to Ukraine, but also clearly violates UN Security Council sanctions resolutions related to North Korea's nuclear weapons,\" Yoon said.\n\nDespite tensions with Moscow over the purported arms shipments, Yoon said he aims to \"manage our relationship with Russia as smoothly as possible\".\n\nBut he said Seoul would not be revising its longstanding policy of not selling arms into active conflicts, which has prevented it from providing military aid to Ukraine.\n\nSeoul has long sought to join the ranks of the world's top arms exporters -- aiming to be the fourth largest, behind the United States, Russia and France -- something that is now possible, industry research indicates.\n\nceb-kjk-hs/lb", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [],

Yonhap\n\nYoon hints at presidential veto on special counsel probe into Marine's deathBy Nam Hyun-woo\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol apologized to the public for his wife Kim Keon Hee's acceptance of a Christian Dior bag from a pastor in 2022, during a press conference to commemorate the second anniversary of his presidency, Thursday.\n\nThis was the first time he publicly apologized for the issue, as he had previously expressed regret rather than offering a formal apology.\n\nHowever, the president objected to the opposition's push to launch a special counsel probe on the issue and a separate allegation about Kim's involvement in a stock manipulation scandal, describing it as \"political maneuvering to conceal the truth.\"\n\nIt was Yoon's first press conference in 631 days, following his last meeting with reporters on August 17, 2022, to commemorate his first 100 days in office. Since then, Yoon had refrained from engaging with the press, but decided to hold one after promising to improve communication with the public following the ruling People Power Party's (PPP) crushing defeat in the April 10 general elections.\n\nAfter reviewing the past two years of his presidency and outlining new policy pledges in his opening remarks, Yoon took 20 queries from reporters during a 70-minute question and answer session. He addressed a wide range of topics including politics, foreign policy, economy, and society, including controversies surrounding his wife.\n\nReporters raise their hands to ask questions to President Yoon Suk Yeol during a press conference at the presidential office in Yongsan District, Seoul, Thursday. Yonhap\n\n\"I apologize for causing concern to the people because of the imprudent conduct of my wife,\" Yoon said, referring to the handbag scandal, which has exacerbated public sentiment against the administration for more than half a year. But he refrained from commenting further, stating that additional remarks could potentially impact the prosecution's ongoing investigation into the case.\n\nHowever, Yoon maintained a firm stance against the opposition's efforts to initiate a special counsel probe into Kim's acceptance of the bag and the stock manipulation scandal. In January, he vetoed a special counsel probe bill related to the scandal. Despite this, the opposition bloc intends to propose another bill addressing the allegations.\n\nThe president said a special counsel probe should be launched only if the prosecution's investigation appears insufficient.\n\n\"During the previous administration, the prosecution had already conducted a scrutiny for two and a half years targeting me, and I have to ask: did the prosecution go easy on me and were the investigations insufficient?\" the president said.\n\n\"Launching a special investigation after already conducting enough investigations seems to deviate from the essence and purpose of the special counsel system, and I believe this, at some point, is a political maneuver to conceal the truth.\"\n\nA TV screen at Seoul Station shows President Yoon Suk Yeol's press conference, Thursday. Yonhap\n\nYoon also expressed opposition to a separate special counsel probe bill regarding the government's alleged interference in the military's investigation into the death of a Marine during a rescue operation in July last year.\n\nThe case gained further attention after Yoon appointed then-Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup as ambassador to Australia, even though he was under investigation by the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials (CIO).\n\nThis raised suspicions that the president was aiding the minister to avoid accusations, and the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) unilaterally pushed the special counsel bill through the National Assembly on May 2, leveraging its majority.\n\n\"The police and the CIO are already investigating the case, and it will be handed over to the prosecution for indictment and trials of those involved,\" Yoon said. \"If these processes are completed, the investigative authorities will brief the public on the results. If the public deems the investigations unacceptable, I will be the first to call for a special counsel probe.\"\n\nThe president emphasized that he appointed the former defense minister to the ambassador position due to his expertise in arms exports to Australia. He expressed the view that disqualifying someone from public office solely because they were accused by the CIO would make it extremely challenging to appoint qualified individuals to such roles.\n\nThe press conference was anticipated to be a barometer predicting whether the Yoon administration would change its approach to handling state affairs and cooperate with the DPK following the election defeat. Although Yoon met with DPK Chairman Lee Jae-myung for the first time on April 29, partisan conflicts persist as the Yoon administration has rejected most of the demands proposed by Lee.\n\nYoon said, \"cooperation with the opposition does not come immediately after the meeting,\" but he will \"leave the door open\" for communication with opposition politicians.\n\nHe also emphasized the necessity of a Cabinet reshuffle to rejuvenate government organizations, but he said that he would not rush to appoint new faces.\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol delivers an opening remark for a press conference to commemorate the second anniversary of his presidency at the presidential office in Seoul, Thursday. Courtesy of presidential office\n\nRegarding foreign policy, the president fielded questions exclusively from foreign press correspondents.\n\nRegarding the potential for conflict between Korea and the United States over defense cost-sharing for U.S. Forces Korea under a new U.S. administration, Yoon said, \"Negotiations will proceed smoothly if both sides approach the issue based on their strong alliance.\"\n\nHe also reiterated that relations between Korea and Japan will be future-oriented and will overcome obstacles stemming from historical issues. Yoon added that he and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida have trust in each other.\n\nRegarding the war between Russia and Ukraine, Yoon emphasized that it is \"an attempt to change the status quo by force and an illegal invasion.\" He also reaffirmed that \"Korea does not provide lethal weapons to any other countries.\"\n\nWhen asked about Seoul's strained relations with Moscow, Yoon said Korea will manage its relations with Russia in a manner that fosters partnerships in potential areas of cooperation, while expressing opposition to issues that Korea stands against.\n\n\"Our goal is maintaining a harmonious relationship with Russia and pursuing economic cooperation or common interests together whenever possible,\" Yoon said.", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType":

It featured prominently in the political discourse ahead of the April 10 parliamentary elections, and though Yoon spoke to the issue in an interview with KBS TV in February -- claiming the problem was that his wife was \"unable to cold-heartedly reject\" the pastor -- the ruling People Power Party was routed in the elections, leaving the National Assembly under the control of the main opposition Democratic Party.\n\n\"I think the people's assessment of my running of state affairs until now was that it was greatly lacking,\" Yoon said during the press conference, referring to the election outcome.\n\n\"I think from now on, what's important is ultimately the economy. And while structural things, such as the growth of businesses and job creation, are important, I think it's important to actively find and solve the difficulties and inconveniences felt by each and every person in the field of people's livelihoods,\" he said.\n\nOn the opposition's calls for a special counsel investigation into separate allegations the first lady was involved in stock price manipulation, Yoon said such investigations should come only after those of the prosecution and other agencies are deemed insufficient.\n\nCalling for another investigation when enough has been done is a \"political offensive,\" he said.\n\nYoon expressed a similar position on the opposition's push to appoint a special counsel to investigate the military's response to a Marine's death last year, saying if the ongoing investigation by the police and the Corruption Investigation Office For High-ranking Officials is insufficient, he \"will be the first to call for a special counsel probe.\"\n\nOn why he appointed former Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup as ambassador to Australia, when Lee was under a travel ban in connection with the Marine's case, Yoon said not even the government knows about who is under a travel ban, as such details of an investigation are confidential.\n\nYoon fielded questions on a wide range of economic, social and foreign policy issues as well.\n\nWhen asked to respond to the possibility the United States will ask South Korea to pay more for the stationing of 28,500 American troops on the peninsula under a potential second Donald Trump presidency, Yoon said it would be inappropriate to answer based on a hypothesis.\n\n\"What's clear is that there is strong support for the South Korea-U.S. alliance from across the public and private sectors in the U.S., both parties, the Senate, the House, and the executive branch, and I am certain the firm alliance between South Korea and the U.S. will not change,\" he said. \"If we tackle issues based on that, I believe we will be able to smoothly resolve various negotiations and problems.\"\n\nOn Ukraine, Yoon said South Korea is doing its best to provide humanitarian and reconstruction aid to the war-torn country but stands by its policy of not providing offensive, lethal weapons to any nation.\n\nHe added that South Korea is in an \"uncomfortable\" relationship with Russia due to its war in Ukraine and purchase of North Korean weapons, but aims to cooperate with Moscow in the economy and other areas where there is a common interest.\n\nOn Japan, he acknowledged differences in opinion between the two countries on their shared history. Still, he stressed the need for cooperation for the sake of their future generations.\n\nOther topics he addressed during the press conference included the government's plans to further support the semiconductor industry, complete a pension system reform plan before the end of his term and employ all possible means to tame inflation, especially in the groceries and dining sectors.\n\nIn addition, he vowed to continue to persuade doctors to accept the government's decision to increase admissions to medical schools to address the country's shortage of doctors.\n\nThe press conference was Yoon's first since August 2022 and was seen as a demonstration of his commitment to improving his communication style in the wake of the recent election defeat.\n\nBefore entering the presidential office briefing room, Yoon gave an address to the nation from his office to reflect on the first two years of his term and present a plan for the remaining three years.\n\nIn the address, he said he will create a new ministry to tackle the country's low birth rate.\n\n\"In order to overcome the low birth rate, which can be considered a national emergency, we will fully mobilize all of the state's capabilities,\" he said.\n\nThe head of the new ministry, tentatively named the \"low birth response planning ministry,\" will double as the deputy prime minister for social affairs and draw up policies across the education, labor and welfare sectors that will become the national agenda, he said.\n\nYoon requested the active cooperation of the opposition-controlled National Assembly in revising the government organization law to enable the launch of the new ministry.\n\nHe further pledged to raise the basic monthly pension for senior citizens to the 400,000 won level from the current 330,000 won within his term.", "source": {"uri": "en.yna.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yonhap News Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lee_haye_ah@en.yna.co.kr", "name": "Lee Haye-ah",

said.\n\n\"In order to overcome the low birth rate, which can be considered a national emergency, we will fully mobilise all of the state's capabilities,\" he added.\n\nThe country's fertility rate -- the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime -- dropped to 0.72 in 2023, down nearly eight percent from 2022, according to preliminary data from Statistics Korea in February.\n\nThat is far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain the current population of 51 million, which at these rates will nearly halve by the year 2100, experts estimate.\n\n- Arms policy

Russia.\n\n\"North Korea's export of offensive weapons not only supports the illegal waging of war in relation to Ukraine, but also clearly violates UN Security Council sanctions resolutions related

possible\".\n\nBut he said Seoul would not be revising its longstanding policy of not selling arms into active conflicts, which has prevented it from providing military aid to Ukraine.\n\nSeoul has

Korea president admits 'shortcomings' in rare address", "body": "SEOUL, South Korea: South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held a rare press conference Thursday, admitting \"shortcomings\" after his party's recent electoral defeat, and laying out policies on issues from the country's low birthrate to Russia's war in Ukraine. The press conference was the president's first in nearly two years, and comes after his party suffered a drubbing in legislative elections last month. On Ukraine, Yoon vowed to keep strong ties with Kyiv while maintaining a smooth relationship with Russia, ruling out direct weapons shipments and telling reporters that it was his \"firm stance\" not to send lethal arms to countries at war.\n\nOn South Korea's birthrate, one of the world's lowest, he unveiled plans to create a ministry to tackle the issue, which he described as \"a national emergency\". His party's defeat in the April 10 parliamentary elections prompted calls for Yoon to change his policy direction and leadership style, as his approval ratings languish less than halfway through his five-year term.\n\nYoon said he has \"pondered a lot over what have been the shortcomings\" of his administration. \"Communication to explain policy drives and the extent of change people have felt has fallen short,\" he said.\n\nBirthrate ministry\n\nYoon won the 2022 presidential election by the narrowest margin in South Korean history, and his term has been hampered by a series of scandals and his party's lack of a parliamentary majority.\n\nThe president also issued an apology for what he called the \"unwise conduct\" of his wife, first lady Kim Keon Hee, after hidden camera footage last year appeared to show her accepting a luxury handbag in violation of government ethics rules. But Yoon said the opposition's call for a special probe into the first lady was \"politically motivated\". His plan to fix the country's woeful birthrate comes after it hit a record low in 2023, despite the government pouring billions of dollars into efforts to encourage women to have more children and maintain population stability.\n\nYoon said he would ask lawmakers to cooperate \"to set up the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter Planning\", \"We will be creating a low-birth planning department in order to establish a more aggressive and powerful control tower,\" he said.\n\n\"In order to overcome the low birth rate, which can be considered a national emergency, we will fully mobilise all of the state's capabilities,\" he added. The country's fertility rate -- the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime -- dropped to 0.72 in 2023, down nearly eight percent from 2022, according to preliminary data from Statistics Korea in February. That is far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain the current population of 51 million, which at these rates will nearly halve by the year 2100, experts estimate.\n\nArms policy\n\nYoon, who has taken a tough line with the nuclear-armed North, said his country's ties with Moscow had been strained by what Seoul and ally Washington say are arms shipments from North Korea to Russia. \"North Korea's export of offensive weapons not only supports the illegal waging of war in relation to Ukraine, but also clearly violates UN Security Council sanctions resolutions related to North Korea's nuclear weapons,\" Yoon said.\n\nDespite tensions with Moscow over the purported arms shipments, Yoon said he aims to \"manage our relationship with Russia as smoothly as possible\". But he said Seoul would not be revising its longstanding policy of not selling arms into active conflicts, which has prevented it from providing military aid to Ukraine.\n\nSeoul has long sought to

Yoon already in January had vetoed a bill calling for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate his wife's stock price allegation.\n\nDuring Thursday's conference, Yoon also made it clear that he opposes another Democratic Party-led push for a special investigation into suspicions surrounding the death of a marine who drowned during a search for flood victims in 2023.\n\nPeople watch a TV screen showing the live broadcast of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's press conference, at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Thursday, May 9, 2024. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)\n\nYoon called the marine's death heartbreaking, but stressed that police and an anti-corruption investigation agency have already been examining the case. Yoon said he would approve a new independent investigation if police and the anti-corruption investigation agency fail to address public suspicions over the case. Questions over why the marine was mobilized without safety gear and whether the government tried to prevent top officials from being held accountable have persisted.\n\nLast week, the opposition-controlled parliament passed a bill calling for an independent investigation of the death, after ruling party members boycotted a floor vote in protest.\n\nLater Thursday, the Democratic Party\u00b4s floor leader, Park Chan-dae, lambasted Yoon for rejecting its call for the special investigation of the marine\u00b4s death. \"I can\u00b4t help questioning whether he sympathizes with the public indignant over the wrongful death of the marine at all,\" Park said.\n\nParty spokesperson Han Min-soo also said Yoon\u00b4s opposition to his wife\u00b4s new investigation proves she is \"a sanctuary\" in criminal investigations.\n\nDespite the election defeat, Yoon's major foreign policy agenda is likely to be unchanged as he does not need parliamentary endorsements. Yoon has made a bolstered military alliance with the U.S. the heart of his foreign policy, while pushing to expand trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo cooperation to cope with North Korean nuclear threats and other challenges.\n\nDuring Thursday's conference, Yoon criticized North Korea\u00b4s alleged arms exports to Russia to fuel its warfighting in Ukraine and maintained that Seoul will stick to its principle of providing only non-lethal support to Ukraine.\n\n\"We have a very clear policy that we do not provide lethal, offensive weapons to any side\" in active conflict, Yoon said.\n\nSince the start of the war, South Korea has sold artillery rounds to the United States, saying that the rounds were meant to backfill depleted U.S. stocks. The country also signed several arms deals with European powers eager to bolster their defenses in the wake of Russia\u00b4s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"North Korea\u00b4s export of these weapons is not only an illicit activity to support the war in Ukraine, but also a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions over the North Korean nuclear issue,\" Yoon said. \"So, we are taking necessary actions in coordination with the U.N. and international community.\"\n\nPeople watch a TV screen showing the live broadcast of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's press conference, at the Seoul Railway Station in Seoul, South Korea, Thursday, May 9, 2024.

The issue is likely to weigh heavily on his attempts to win co-operation from the opposition-controlled parliament on policy priorities.\n\nYoon, who won the presidency in 2022 by a margin of less than one percentage point, has seen his support ratings plunge to a low of 21% in one public opinion poll.\n\nLawmaker Park Chan-dae, new floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, called Yoon's press conference and address \"bitterly disappointing\".\n\nHe said it reaffirmed that the president had \"neither the heart nor the will to protect the lives of the people\".\n\nKim Hyung-joon, a professor at Pai Chai University in the capital, said Yoon's comments suggest he may focus on more bipartisan issues such as spurring the birthrate, rather than sweeping changes to his agenda.\n\n\"He didn't seem to have a sense of urgency even after such a crushing election defeat -- no new policy initiative, or hardly any sign of drastic change in his way of doing things,\" he said.\n\nUncomfortable Russian ties\n\nOn foreign policy, Yoon declined to directly answer when pressed on former President Donald Trump's stance that he could revive demands for South Korea to pay more to maintain the roughly 28,500 US troops stationed in the country.\n\nYoon has staked the defence of South Korea against nuclear-armed North Korea on US \"extended deterrence\" provided by American military assets deployed on the peninsula and region, but that could be threatened if a dispute arises with Washington.\n\nHe said South Korea would maintain its stance to not supply lethal weapons to any country in active conflict, when asked if Seoul would consider helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia.\n\nDespite its emergence as a major arms exporter, South Korea has resisted pressure from Washington and Kyiv to provide weapons to Ukraine, as it is keen to avoid antagonising Russia.\n\nWhile Russia had been a good partner for quite some time, the war with Ukraine and Moscow's use of weapons from North Korea had made ties \"uncomfortable\", Yoon said.\n\nThe US and its allies have condemned what they called significant deliveries of North Korean weapons to Russia to help its war effort, including missiles that UN sanctions monitors said struck a Ukrainian city.\n\nRussia and North Korea have denied arms deals, but have vowed to deepen co-operation on military matters, among others.", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type":

Shares of South Korean companies related to baby products and services soared on Yoon's plans to increase the birthrate.\n\nThe president has little room to maneuver for the remainder of his single, five-year term after the election last month in which the opposition bloc led by the progressive Democratic Party increased its majority in parliament.\n\n\"For the next three years, we will listen closely to the voice of the people and work to improve their livelihoods,\" Yoon said. His government, which backs business-friendly policies, has fallen short in some areas but added there are \"green lights\" ahead for the economy, the president said.\n\nLast month, the central bank held its key rate at 3.5% for a 10th consecutive time, pledging to keep its focus on fighting inflation. The economy grew more than twice as fast as expected in the first quarter largely thanks to export growth and a rebound in construction investment.\n\nThe president sought to further boost ties with the U.S. and Japan, which have been a trademark of his tenure. He said this would help in ensuring security in the region to counter threats from the likes of North Korea and expand economic opportunities.\n\nYoon pledged to overhaul his administration after the election defeat and work with parliament to advance structural reform for the labor, education, pension and medical systems. But one of his most pressing tasks might be trying to thwart plans from the Democratic Party for probes that could embarrass his government -- including one concerning the first lady.\n\nThe Democratic Party has sought legislation to start an investigation of Yoon's wife, Kim Keon Hee, after a secretly recorded video surfaced several months ago that purportedly showed her receiving a Dior handbag. Yoon and his wife have denied any wrongdoing, and the president has said the bag was part of a \"political maneuver.\"\n\n\"I apologize for causing concern to the public due to my wife's unwise behavior,\" Yoon said at the news conference.\n\nOn Tuesday, Yoon appointed a former prosecutor as the new senior secretary to the president for civil affairs, a post he had previously removed, citing excessive power it could wield on government agencies, including the prosecutors' office. Yoon has said the move was aimed at better listening to public opinion but the opposition criticized the appointment as an attempt to control prosecutors.\n\nYoon took power after winning by a razor thin margin and has since seen his support fall to among the lowest for any South Korean president, reaching 23% in a weekly Gallup Korea tracking poll after the April election.\n\nThe election result derailed Yoon's plan to push through initiatives to benefit investors such as scuttling a capital gains tax, and it may have doomed his flagship policy of boosting stock valuations via the \"Corporate Value-Up\" program.\n\nPolicies being pushed by the Democratic Party include a 13 trillion won plan to extend cash handouts to households as a way to boost flagging consumer demand. Yoon has rejected the idea, saying it would spur inflation and strain the budget.\n\nAt the news conference, Yoon pledged support for companies that power the export-driven economy, especially the makers of semiconductors. He also called for opposition parties' cooperation to abolish the upcoming financial income tax, saying it would cause a huge amount of money to flow out of the stock market.\n\nThe president's main foreign policy initiatives include closer security cooperation with the U.S. and Japan, and taking a tough line with North Korea. Even though the Democratic Party has favored rapprochement with Pyongyang and improving relations with Beijing, it has little power in parliament to set a foreign policy agenda.\n\nYoon will face a test on the diplomatic front later this month when Seoul is set to host the first three-way summit since 2019 of figures from China, Japan and South Korea. There is also speculation he could have formal discussions in July with U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to build on their security cooperation.\n\n\"We must not miss this opportunity to revitalize the economy and open new avenues for diplomacy,\" Yoon said.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Yoon already in January had vetoed a bill calling for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate his wife's stock price allegation.\n\nDuring Thursday's conference, Yoon also made it clear that he opposes another Democratic Party-led push for a special investigation into suspicions surrounding the death of a marine who drowned during a search for flood victims in 2023.\n\nYoon called the marine's death heartbreaking, but stressed that police and an anti-corruption investigation agency have already been examining the case. Yoon said he would approve a new independent investigation if police and the anti-corruption investigation agency fail to address public suspicions over the case. Questions over why the marine was mobilized without safety gear and whether the government tried to prevent top officials from being held accountable have persisted.\n\nLast week, the opposition-controlled parliament passed a bill calling for an independent investigation of the death, after ruling party members boycotted a floor vote in protest.\n\nLater Thursday, the Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, lambasted Yoon for rejecting its call for the special investigation of the marine's death. \"I can't help questioning whether he sympathizes with the public indignant over the wrongful death of the marine at all,\" Park said.\n\nParty spokesperson Han Min-soo also said Yoon's opposition to his wife's new investigation proves she is \"a sanctuary\" in criminal investigations.\n\nDespite the election defeat, Yoon's major foreign policy agenda is likely to be unchanged as he does not need parliamentary endorsements. Yoon has made a bolstered military alliance with the U.S. the heart of his foreign policy, while pushing to expand trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo cooperation to cope with North Korean nuclear threats and other challenges.\n\nYoon also Thursday criticized North Korea's alleged arms exports to Russia to fuel its warfighting in Ukraine and maintained that Seoul will stick to its principle of providing only non-lethal support to Ukraine.\n\n\"We have a very clear policy that we do not provide lethal, offensive weapons to any side\" in active conflict, Yoon said.\n\nSince the start of the war, South Korea has sold artillery rounds to the United States, saying that the rounds were meant to backfill depleted U.S. stocks. The country also signed several arms deals with European powers eager to bolster their defenses in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"North Korea's export of these weapons is not only an illicit activity to support the war in Ukraine, but also a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions over the North Korean nuclear issue,\" Yoon said. \"So, we are taking necessary actions in coordination with the U.N. and international community.\"", "source": {"uri":

The news sparked public backlash after it was first reported on Nov. 29 by a liberal YouTube news channel.\n\nAt the same time, Yoon drew a line on a special counsel probe into another allegation that the first lady was involved in a stock price manipulation case, calling it inappropriate and politically motivated.\n\nHe said he would not comment further to prevent any \"misunderstandings,\" as he wouldn't want his remarks to have undue influence given that a prosecution investigation is currently underway.\n\nThe DP has pushed for an independent counsel to investigate allegations that the first lady was involved in a stock price manipulation case surrounding Deutsch Motors, a BMW car dealer in Korea.\n\nYoon said another independent investigation into the allegations is \"truly a political offensive\" and \"a political act that does not fit the essence or purpose of the special probes and is not intended to reveal the truth.\"\n\nPolitical kerfuffle\n\nThe press conference to mark the second anniversary of Yoon's presidency is his first such formal media encounter in 21 months. The last official presidential press conference was held on Aug. 17, 2022, marking Yoon's first 100 days after taking office on May 10, 2022.\n\nAt 10 a.m., Yoon first gave a 20-minute video address to the nation from his office desk on his accomplishments over the past two years and future policy plans for the remainder of his five-year term.\n\nThen, he held a rare and lengthy 70-minute question-and-answer session with members of the presidential press corps, which covered political, foreign affairs, security, economic and social matters.\n\nYoon also addressed the conservative People Power Party's (PPP) crushing defeat in last month's general election, with its rival Democratic Party (DP) securing a majority in the National Assembly again.\n\nWhen asked about the April 10 election defeat, he said he had been ruminating over what he had lacked. \"In the end, no matter how hard we tried to improve people's livelihoods, there was a lack of tangible change for the people,\" he said.\n\nAs a candidate, Yoon, a former prosecutor general who diverged from the image of traditional politicians, promised to become a president who communicates with the public and media more than his predecessors. However, he has been criticized for not following through on that pledge.\n\n\"I think there was a lot of lack of communication and explanation to the people about things like government policies,\" Yoon said. \"In the future, I will communicate more frequently with the media, and through the press, explain to the people and seek their understanding to address our insufficiencies and shortcomings.\"\n\nYoon has avoided customary presidential New Year's press conferences for two years, instead opting for interviews with the conservative Chosun Ilbo newspaper in 2023 and public broadcaster KBS earlier this year, which was prerecorded.\n\nThe exceptions were diplomatic communications, such as joint press conferences after summits with foreign leaders. Yoon also took a few limited questions from journalists recently during three unexpected press encounters late last month and this week to personally announce new presidential aides.\n\nYoon expressed regret over the handbag issue during the KBS interview aired in early February but stopped short of an apology.\n\nIn Thursday's press event, Yoon also expressed skepticism about the DP's call for a special counsel probe into the military's alleged intervention in the investigation into the death of a young Marine during flooding last year.\n\nYoon said that if the ongoing investigation by the police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (COI) is insufficient, he will be the first to call for a special counsel probe.\n\nWhen asked about the appointment of former Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup as ambassador to Australia when he was embroiled in the investigation into the Marine's death, Yoon denied he had prior knowledge of the travel ban imposed on Lee as such details are confidential.\n\nDuring his time as defense chief, Lee was accused of abusing power by allegedly exercising undue influence on a military investigation into the death of 21-year-old Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Chae Su-geun, who died after being swept away in a stream during a search for victims of flooding and monsoon rain in July last year.\n\nYoon said that the police and COI are investigating the case, which will be handed over to the prosecution. He said if the results of this investigation are unsatisfactory, he would be open to a special probe, indicating he will likely exercise his presidential veto if the DP-led National Assembly pushes for an independent counsel.\n\nYoon also played down reports of a falling out with former PPP chief Han Dong-hoon, his close confidant from their prosecutor days and a former justice minister. Han stepped down as PPP chief last month over the party's election defeat.\n\n\"I think he will do well walking the path of a politician in the future,\" Yoon said on Han.\n\nHe noted they can \"meet at any time,\" referring to their relationship of over 20 years.\n\nRegarding cooperation with the DP, Yoon said, \"I don't think that meeting DP chief Lee Jae-myung will completely change our atmosphere overnight and lead to cooperation.\"\n\nHe called for \"perseverance, patience, sincerity, trust in each other and dialogue,\" stressing the importance of having a mentality of \"never giving up on cooperation\" for the sake of governance.\n\nWhen asked if he would meet with former Justice Minister Cho Kuk, head of the minor Rebuilding Korea Party, Yoon replied, \"No politician draws lines, and I will always keep communication open.\"\n\nStatus quo on diplomacy\n\nYoon skirted an answer when asked about the possibility of Washington asking South Korea to pay more for the stationing of U.S. troops in Korea should former U.S. President Donald Trump be reelected in November.\n\n\"I am confident that the solid South Korea-U.S. alliance will not change,\" Yoon said, pointing to strong American support for this relationship across the public and private sectors, with bipartisan support in the U.S. Congress and the executive branch. He said he is confident that any issues will be able to be solved based on this alliance through various negotiations.\n\nWhen asked about the future of Korea-Japan relations as the two sides work to overcome the issue of compensation of Korean forced labor victims during World War II, Yoon said, \"To respond to North Korea's nuclear weapons threats and achieve economic cooperation between our two countries, we must cooperate for leadership in our shared agenda in the Indo-Pacific region and globally.\"\n\nHe said that he and Japanese Prime Minister Kishida have \"sufficient trust\" in each other and will work hard to develop the relationship between the two countries.\n\nYoon again reaffirmed that South Korea has no plans to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine in its war with Russia.\n\nHe said that North Korea's reported export of weapons to Russia has an \"aspect of supporting the waging of an illegal war and also violates UN Security Council's resolution on sanctions against North Korea,\" adding Seoul will be \"taking the necessary responses through the UN and the international community.\"\n\nSocioeconomic challenges\n\nThe president vowed to create a new ministry to tackle Korea's dismally low birthrate and renewed his commitment to medical and pension reform during his presidency.\n\n\"We will fully mobilize all capabilities of the state to overcome the low birthrate, which can be considered a national emergency,\" Yoon said, promising to ensure that maternity and child care leave can be used \"more freely and sufficiently.\"\n\nHe said that the government would ensure that the necessary support is provided to reduce the resulting burden on companies and work to institutionalize flexible work plans.\n\nYoon said he would establish a tentatively named \"low birthrate response planning ministry\" to address low fertility and the aging population.\n\nHe said the birthrate minister will \"establish policies encompassing education, labor and welfare, and make them a national agenda, going beyond a simple welfare policy.\"\n\nHe also promised to increase basic pension stipends to 400,000 won from the current 330,000 won within his term.\n\n\"As we enter the era of 10 million seniors, we will take more careful care of the lives of the elderly,\" Yoon said, vowing to also extend support for socially underprivileged and marginalized people.\n\nRegarding medical reform, including a hike in the medical school admissions quota, Yoon said he regretted the lack of a unified opinion in the medical community and said, \"We will step forward on the path of medical reform for the people according to the roadmap.\"\n\nHe also said people suffered as real estate prices soared during the previous administration and that he aims to \"ensure that all citizens, especially the middle class and working class, can receive stable housing security.\"\n\n\"For the government to take better care of people's livelihood, cooperation in the National Assembly is absolutely necessary,\" Yoon said. \"I believe that public sentiment calls for the government and rivaling parties to stop political strife and work together for the people's livelihood.\"\n\nHe acknowledged he has not been able to resolve all livelihood difficulties amid high inflation globally, high interest rates and high oil prices, saying policies have \"fallen far short of the people's expectations.\"\n\nDuring the press conference, which was twice as long as his 100-day session, Yoon answered some 20 questions.\n\n\"The next three years will be spent listening to the voices of the people,\" Yoon said.\n\nBY SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Yoon already in January had vetoed a bill calling for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate his wife's stock price allegation.\n\nDuring Thursday's conference, Yoon also made it clear that he opposes another Democratic Party-led push for a special investigation into suspicions surrounding the death of a marine who drowned during a search for flood victims in 2023. Yoon called the marine's death heartbreaking, but stressed that police and an anti-corruption investigation agency have already been examining the case. Yoon said he would approve a new independent investigation if police and the anti-corruption investigation agency fail to address public suspicions over the case. Questions over why the marine was mobilized without safety gear and whether the government tried to prevent top officials from being held accountable have persisted. Last week, the opposition-controlled parliament passed a bill calling for an independent investigation of the death, after ruling party members boycotted a floor vote in protest.\n\nLater Thursday, the Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, lambasted Yoon for rejecting its call for the special investigation of the marine's death. \"I can't help questioning whether he sympathizes with the public indignant over the wrongful death of the marine at all,\" Park said.\n\nParty spokesperson Han Min-soo also said Yoon's opposition to his wife's new investigation proves she is \"a sanctuary\" in criminal investigations.\n\nDespite the election defeat, Yoon's major foreign policy agenda is likely to be unchanged as he does not need parliamentary endorsements. Yoon has made a bolstered military alliance with the U.S. the heart of his foreign policy, while pushing to expand trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo cooperation to cope with North Korean nuclear threats and other challenges. During Thursday's conference, Yoon criticized North Korea's alleged arms exports to Russia to fuel its warfighting in Ukraine and maintained that Seoul will stick to its principle of providing only non-lethal support to Ukraine.\n\n\"We have a very clear policy that we do not provide lethal, offensive weapons to any side'' in active conflict, Yoon said.\n\nSince the start of the war, South Korea has sold artillery rounds to the United States, saying that the rounds were meant to backfill depleted U.S. stocks. The country also signed several arms deals with European powers eager to bolster their defenses in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n''North Korea's export of these weapons is not only an illicit activity to support the war in Ukraine, but also a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions over the North Korean nuclear issue,'' Yoon said. ''So, we are taking necessary actions in coordination with the U.N. and international community.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

Shares of South Korean companies related to baby products and services soared on Yoon\u2019s plans to increase the birth rate.\n\nThe president has little room to manoeuvre for the remainder of his single, five-year term after the election last month in which the opposition bloc led by the progressive Democratic Party increased its majority in parliament.\n\n\u201cFor the next three years, we will listen closely to the voice of the people and work to improve their livelihoods,\u201d Yoon said. His government, which backs business-friendly policies, has fallen short in some areas but added there are \u201cgreen lights\u201d ahead for the economy, the president said.\n\nLast month, the central bank held its key rate at 3.5 per cent for a 10th consecutive time, pledging to keep its focus on fighting inflation. The economy grew more than twice as fast as expected in the first quarter largely thanks to export growth and a rebound in construction investment.\n\nThe president sought to further boost ties with the US and Japan, which have been a trademark of his tenure. He said this would help in ensuring security in the region to counter threats from the likes of North Korea and expand economic opportunities.\n\nYoon pledged to overhaul his administration after the election defeat and work with parliament to advance structural reform for the labour, education, pension and medical systems. But one of his most pressing tasks might be trying to thwart plans from the Democratic Party for probes that could embarrass his government \u2013 including one concerning the first lady.\n\nThe Democratic Party has sought legislation to start an investigation of Yoon\u2019s wife, Kim Keon-hee, after a secretly recorded video surfaced several months ago that purportedly showed her receiving a Dior handbag. Yoon and his wife have denied any wrongdoing, and the president has said the bag was part of a \u201cpolitical manoeuvre\u201d.\n\n\u201cI apologise for causing concern to the public due to my wife\u2019s unwise behaviour,\u201d Yoon said at the news conference.\n\nOn Tuesday, Yoon appointed a former prosecutor as the new senior secretary to the president for civil affairs, a post he had previously removed, citing excessive power it could wield on government agencies, including the prosecutors\u2019 office. Yoon has said the move was aimed at better listening to public opinion but the opposition criticised the appointment as an attempt to control prosecutors.\n\nYoon took power after winning by a razor thin margin and has since seen his support fall to among the lowest for any South Korean president, reaching 23 per cent in a weekly Gallup Korea tracking poll after the April election.\n\nThe election result derailed Yoon\u2019s plan to push through initiatives to benefit investors such as scuttling a capital gains tax, and it may have doomed his flagship policy of boosting stock valuations via the \u201cCorporate Value-Up\u201d programme.\n\nPolicies being pushed by the Democratic Party include a 13 trillion won plan to extend cash handouts to households as a way to boost flagging consumer demand. Yoon has rejected the idea, saying it would spur inflation and strain the budget.\n\nAt the news conference, Yoon pledged support for companies that power the export-driven economy, especially the makers of semiconductors. He also called for opposition parties\u2019 cooperation to abolish the coming financial income tax, saying it would cause a huge amount of money to flow out of the stock market.\n\nThe president\u2019s main foreign policy initiatives include closer security cooperation with the US and Japan, and taking a tough line with North Korea. Even though the Democratic Party has favoured rapprochement with Pyongyang and improving relations with Beijing, it has little power in parliament to set a foreign policy agenda.\n\nYoon said his country\u2019s ties with Moscow had been strained by what Seoul and ally Washington say are arms shipments from North Korea to Russia, for use in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s export of offensive weapons not only supports the illegal waging of war in relation to Ukraine, but also clearly violates UN Security Council sanctions resolutions related to North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons,\u201d Yoon said.\n\nBut despite tensions with Moscow over purported arms deals with North Korea, Yoon said he would work with Russia.\n\n\u201cRussia is a country with which we have had a good relationship for a long time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDue to the recent war with Ukraine, we have different positions regarding the introduction of weapons to North Korea,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAs for our relationship with Russia, we will cooperate on a case-by-case basis, and we may oppose or be wary depending on differences in position, but we will manage our relationship with Russia as smoothly as possible.\u201d\n\nYoon will face a test on the diplomatic front later this month when Seoul is set to host the first three-way summit since 2019 of figures from China, Japan and South Korea. There is also speculation he could have formal discussions in July with US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to build on their security cooperation.\n\n\u201cWe must not miss this opportunity to revitalise the economy and open new avenues for diplomacy,\u201d Yoon said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Agence France-Presse", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news",

Shares of South Korean companies related to baby products and services soared on Yoon's plans to increase the birthrate.\n\nRead More: Why Experts Say South Korea Shouldn't Just Throw Cash at Its Low Birth Rate Problem\n\nThe president has little room to maneuver for the remainder of his single, five-year term after the election last month in which the opposition bloc led by the progressive Democratic Party increased its majority in parliament.\n\n\"For the next three years, we will listen closely to the voice of the people and work to improve their livelihoods,\" Yoon said. His government, which backs business-friendly policies, has fallen short in some areas but added there are \"green lights\" ahead for the economy, the president said.\n\nLast month, the central bank held its key rate at 3.5% for a 10th consecutive time, pledging to keep its focus on fighting inflation. The economy grew more than twice as fast as expected in the first quarter largely thanks to export growth and a rebound in construction investment.\n\nThe president sought to further boost ties with the U.S. and Japan, which have been a trademark of his tenure. He said this would help in ensuring security in the region to counter threats from the likes of North Korea and expand economic opportunities.\n\nRead More: The U.S. Is Beefing Up Alliances Across Asia -- But Don't Expect an 'Asian NATO' Anytime Soon\n\nYoon pledged to overhaul his administration after the election defeat and work with parliament to advance structural reform for the labor, education, pension and medical systems. But one of his most pressing tasks might be trying to thwart plans from the Democratic Party for probes that could embarrass his government -- including one concerning the first lady.\n\nThe Democratic Party has sought legislation to start an investigation of Yoon's wife, Kim Keon Hee, after a secretly recorded video surfaced several months ago that purportedly showed her receiving a Dior handbag. Yoon and his wife have denied any wrongdoing, and the president has said the bag was part of a \"political maneuver.\"\n\n\"I apologize for causing concern to the public due to my wife's unwise behavior,\" Yoon said at the news conference.\n\nRead More: South Korea's 'Dior Bag Scandal,' Explained\n\nOn Tuesday, Yoon appointed a former prosecutor as the new senior secretary to the president for civil affairs, a post he had previously removed, citing excessive power it could wield on government agencies, including the prosecutors' office. Yoon has said the move was aimed at better listening to public opinion but the opposition criticized the appointment as an attempt to control prosecutors.\n\nYoon took power after winning by a razor thin margin and has since seen his support fall to among the lowest for any South Korean president, reaching 23% in a weekly Gallup Korea tracking poll after the April election.\n\nThe election result derailed Yoon's plan to push through initiatives to benefit investors such as scuttling a capital gains tax, and it may have doomed his flagship policy of boosting stock valuations via the \"Corporate Value-Up\" program.\n\nPolicies being pushed by the Democratic Party include a 13 trillion won plan to extend cash handouts to households as a way to boost flagging consumer demand. Yoon has rejected the idea, saying it would spur inflation and strain the budget.\n\nAt the news conference, Yoon pledged support for companies that power the export-driven economy, especially the makers of semiconductors. He also called for opposition parties' cooperation to abolish the upcoming financial income tax, saying it would cause a huge amount of money to flow out of the stock market.\n\nThe president's main foreign policy initiatives include closer security cooperation with the U.S. and Japan, and taking a tough line with North Korea. Even though the Democratic Party has favored rapprochement with Pyongyang and improving relations with Beijing, it has little power in parliament to set a foreign policy agenda.\n\nYoon will face a test on the diplomatic front later this month when Seoul is set to host the first three-way summit since 2019 of figures from China, Japan and South Korea. There is also speculation he could have formal discussions in July with U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to build on their security cooperation.\n\n\"We must not miss this opportunity to revitalize the economy and open new avenues for diplomacy,\" Yoon said.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The issue is likely to weigh heavily on his attempts to win cooperation from the opposition-controlled parliament on policy priorities.\n\nYoon, who won the presidency in 2022 by a margin of less than one percentage point, has seen his support ratings plunge to a low of 21% in one public opinion poll.\n\nLawmaker Park Chan-dae, new floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, called Yoon's press conference and address \"bitterly disappointing\".\n\nHe said it reaffirmed that the president had \"neither the heart nor the will to protect the lives of the people\".\n\nKim Hyung-joon, a professor at Pai Chai University in the capital, said Yoon's comments suggest he may focus on more bipartisan issues such as spurring the birthrate, rather than sweeping changes to his agenda.\n\n\"He didn't seem to have a sense of urgency even after such a crushing election defeat - no new policy initiative, or hardly any sign of drastic change in his way of doing things,\" he said.\n\nRUSSIA TIES UNCOMFORTABLE\n\nOn foreign policy, Yoon declined to directly answer when pressed on former President Donald Trump's stance that he could revive demands for South Korea to pay more to maintain the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in the country.\n\nYoon has staked the defence of South Korea against nuclear-armed North Korea on U.S. \"extended deterrence\" provided by American military assets deployed on the peninsula and region, but that could be threatened if a dispute arises with Washington.\n\nHe said South Korea would maintain its stance to not supply lethal weapons to any country in active conflict, when asked if Seoul would consider helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia.\n\nDespite its emergence as a major arms exporter, South Korea has resisted pressure from Washington and Kyiv to provide weapons to Ukraine, as it is keen to avoid antagonising Russia.\n\nWhile Russia had been a good partner for quite some time, the war with Ukraine and Moscow's use of weapons from North Korea had made ties \"uncomfortable,\" Yoon said.\n\nThe United States and its allies have condemned what they called significant deliveries of North Korean weapons to Russia to help its war effort, including missiles that United Nations sanctions monitors said struck a Ukrainian city.\n\nRussia and North Korea have denied arms deals, but have vowed to deepen co-operation on

The issue is likely to weigh heavily on his attempts to win co-operation from the opposition-controlled parliament on policy priorities.\n\nYoon, who won the presidency in 2022 by a margin of less than one percentage point, has seen his support ratings plunge to a low of 21% in one public opinion poll.\n\nLawmaker Park Chan-dae, the new floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, called Yoon's news conference and address \"bitterly disappointing.\"\n\nHe said it reaffirmed that the president had \"neither the heart nor the will to protect the lives of the people.\"\n\nKim Hyung-joon, a professor at Pai Chai University in the capital, Seoul, said Yoon's comments suggested he might focus on more bipartisan issues such as spurring the birthrate, rather than sweeping changes to his agenda.\n\n\"He didn't seem to have a sense of urgency even after such a crushing election defeat -- no new policy initiative, or hardly any sign of drastic change in his way of doing things,\" he said.\n\nOn foreign policy, Yoon said South Korea would maintain its stance to not supply lethal weapons to any country in active conflict, when asked whether Seoul would consider helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia.\n\nDespite its emergence as a major arms exporter, South Korea has resisted pressure from Washington and Kyiv to provide weapons to Ukraine, as it is keen to avoid antagonizing Russia.\n\nWhile Russia had been a good partner for quite some time, the war with Ukraine and Moscow's use of weapons from North Korea have made ties \"uncomfortable,\" Yoon said.\n\nThe United States and its allies have condemned what they called significant deliveries of North Korean weapons to Russia to help its war effort, including missiles that United Nations sanctions monitors said struck a Ukrainian city.\n\nRussia and North Korea have denied arms deals, but have vowed to deepen cooperation on military matters, among others.", "source": {"uri":

Corporate growth and job creation are important too but what I think is more important is to try harder to look for what is inconvenient in the life of each and every person and to resolve them,\" he said.\n\nSouth Korea's economy beat most forecasts to grow 1.3% in the first three months of this year, though living costs have remained stubbornly high despite some progress tackling inflation.\n\nAs part of a new policy push, a government ministry would be created to address the record low birth rate and fast-ageing population, Yoon said in opening remarks from his office, behind a plaque which reads \"The Buck Stops Here.\"\n\n\"This is not a matter we can take time to work on,\" he said.\n\nSouth Korea's fertility rate, already the world's lowest, continued its dramatic decline in 2023, as women cited concerns about bearing most of the burden for raising children, lost career opportunities, and the financial cost of raising children as reasons to delay childbirth or to not have babies.\n\nYoon fronted the media after the heavy defeat of his People Power Party in an April 10 vote, which prompted calls for a change in his leadership style and policy direction to salvage a presidency not yet at the halfway point.\n\n\"I think it reflects the public's evaluation of my administration's work is far short of what is needed,\" Yoon said when asked about his party's election defeat.\n\nHe apologised for the first time for a controversy surrounding his wife accepting a pricey gift. The issue is likely to weigh heavily on his attempts to win cooperation from the opposition-controlled parliament on policy priorities.\n\nYoon, who won the presidency in 2022 by a margin of less than one percentage point, has seen his support ratings plunge to a low of 21% in one public opinion poll.\n\nHe has pledged to communicate better with the public and parliament, as some analysts warn that he had already slipped into lame-duck status.\n\nRUSSIA TIES UNCOMFORTABLE\n\nOn foreign policy, Yoon said South Korea would maintain its stance to not supply lethal weapons to any country in active conflict, when asked if Seoul would consider helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia.\n\nDespite its emergence as a major military exporter, South Korea has resisted pressure from Washington and Kyiv to provide more than humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as it is keen to avoid antagonising Russia.\n\nRussia had been a good partner for quite some time, Yoon said.\n\n\"But recently because of the war with Ukraine and taking weapons from North Korea, we are in a slightly different position and our ties are uncomfortable,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and its allies have condemned what they say have been significant North Korean weapons deliveries to Russia to help its war effort.\n\nRussia and North Korea have repeatedly denied such cooperation, though debris from a missile that landed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Jan. 2 was from a North Korean Hwasong-11 series ballistic missile, United Nations sanctions monitors told a Security Council committee in a report seen by Reuters on Monday.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc",

Korea vows strong Ukraine ties, smooth Russia relations", "body": "People at a Seoul railway station walk past a screen carrying live footage of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's Thursday press conference - Copyright AFP Jung Yeon-je\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said Thursday that Seoul would keep strong ties with Ukraine and a \"smooth\" relationship with Russia, while ruling out direct weapon shipments to Kyiv.\n\nAs a major arms exporter, Seoul has long been asked by US and European allies to do more to help Kyiv, with speculation that South Korea would change longstanding policy due to North Korea's alleged arms transfers to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nBut Yoon told reporters it was his \"firm stance\" not to provide lethal weapons to countries in conflict.\n\nYoon said his country was doing its \"best to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, in accordance with the spirit of the constitution\".\n\nYoon said his country's ties with Moscow had been strained by what Seoul and ally Washington say are arms shipments from North Korea to Russia.\n\n\"North Korea's export of offensive weapons not only supports the illegal waging of war in relation to Ukraine, but also clearly violates UN Security Council sanctions resolutions related to North Korea's nuclear weapons,\" Yoon said.\n\nDespite tensions with Moscow over the purported arms shipments, Yoon said he would work with Russia.\n\n\"Russia is a country with which we have had a good relationship for a long time,\" he said.\n\n\"Due to the recent war with Ukraine, we have different positions regarding the introduction of weapons from North Korea,\" he added.\n\n\"As for our relationship with Russia, we will cooperate on a case-by-case basis, and we may oppose or be wary depending on differences in position, but we will manage our relationship with Russia as smoothly as possible.\"\n\nSeoul has long sought to join the ranks of the world's top arms exporters -- aiming to be the fourth largest, behind the United States, Russia and France -- something that is now possible, industry research indicates.\n\nIt has also sold artillery shells to Washington -- but with a \"final user\" agreement in place meaning only the United States can use the munitions.\n\nExperts have said this allows the United States to then provide their own shells to Kyiv.\n\n- Birthrate ministry -\n\nSpeaking at his first press conference in nearly two years, the president, whose party suffered a drubbing in legislative elections last month, also unveiled plans to create a new ministry to deal with the country's sharply declining birthrate.\n\nYoon, whose party does not control the country's parliament, said he would ask lawmakers to cooperate \"to set up the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter Planning\", he said in a live address to the nation.\n\nSouth Korea's birth rate fell to a record low last year, official data shows, despite having poured billions of dollars into efforts to encourage women to have more children and maintain population stability.\n\nThe country's fertility rate -- the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime -- dropped to 0.72 in 2023, down nearly eight percent from 2022, according to preliminary data from Statistics Korea in February.\n\nThat is far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain the current population of 51 million, which at these rates will nearly halve by the year 2100, experts estimate.\n\nAt the rare press conference, the president also issued an apology for what he called the \"unwise conduct\" of his wife, first lady Kim Keon Hee, after hidden camera footage last year appeared to show her accepting a luxury handbag in violation of government ethics rules.\n\nSouth Korea's political opposition dismissed the president's press conference, held to mark his second year in office, as being \"filled with self-praise\".\n\nThe president \"still has no clue as to why nearly 70 percent of the public disapprove of his governing style,\" the spokesman of the Democratic party Han Min-soo said, referring to Yoon's approval ratings, which have typically hovered around 30 percent.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@digitaljournal.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse",

(Credit: @hola.__.m/LOCAL NEWS X /TMX)\n\nSouth Korea's president on Thursday dismissed calls for independent investigations into allegations involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals.\n\nAfter his conservative ruling party suffered a heavy loss in the recent April 10 parliamentary elections, President Yoon Suk Yeol faces what appears to be his biggest political challenge yet as opposition parties would extend their control of the National Assembly to 2028.\n\nThe opposition has recently stepped up its demand for an independent investigation into first lady Kim Keon Hee over various scandals, such as her alleged involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme and the release of spy camera footage showing her receiving a luxury bag from a Korean American pastor.\n\nSOUTH KOREA EXPLORES POSSIBILITY OF JOINING ALLIANCE FOR SHARING MILITARY TECHNOLOGY WITH US\n\nIn a news conference marking his two years in office, Yoon said he apologizes for what he calls \"my wife's unwise behavior\" in accepting the Christian Dior bag but refused to elaborate because the scandal is under investigation by prosecutors.\n\nYoon described the demand for a new, special investigation on Kim's shares price allegation as a political offensive, as Kim wasn't charged or convicted from investigations that began when the Democratic Party was in power. Yoon in January had vetoed a bill calling for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate his wife's stock price allegations.\n\nDuring Thursday's conference, Yoon also made it clear that he opposes another Democratic Party-led push for a special investigation into suspicions surrounding the death of a marine who drowned during a search for flood victims in 2023.\n\nYoon called the marine's death heartbreaking, but stressed that police and an anti-corruption investigation agency have already been examining the case. Yoon said he would approve a new independent investigation if police and the anti-corruption investigation agency fail to address public suspicions over the case. Questions over why the marine was mobilized without safety gear and whether the government tried to prevent top officials from being held accountable have persisted.\n\nLast week, the opposition-controlled parliament passed a bill calling for an independent investigation of the death, after ruling party members boycotted a floor vote in protest.\n\nLater Thursday, the Democratic Party's floor leader, Park Chan-dae, lambasted Yoon for rejecting its call for the special investigation of the marine's death. \"I can't help questioning whether he sympathizes with the public indignant over the wrongful death of the marine at all,\" Park said.\n\nParty spokesperson Han Min-soo also said Yoon's opposition to his wife's new investigation proves she is \"a sanctuary\" in criminal investigations.\n\nDespite the election defeat, Yoon's major foreign policy agenda is likely to be unchanged as he does not need parliamentary endorsements. Yoon has made a bolstered military alliance with the U.S. the heart of his foreign policy, while pushing to expand trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo cooperation to cope with North Korean nuclear threats and other challenges.\n\nYoon also Thursday criticized North Korea's alleged arms exports to Russia to fuel its warfighting in Ukraine and maintained that Seoul will stick to its principle of providing only non-lethal support to Ukraine.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We have a very clear policy that we do not provide lethal, offensive weapons to any side\" in active conflict, Yoon said.\n\nSince the start of the war, South Korea has sold artillery rounds to the United States, saying that the rounds were meant to backfill depleted U.S. stocks. The country also signed several arms deals with European powers eager to bolster their defenses in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"North Korea's export of these weapons is not only an illicit activity to support the war in Ukraine, but also a clear violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions over the North Korean nuclear issue,\" Yoon said. \"So, we are taking necessary actions in coordination with the U.N. and international community.\"", "source": {"uri":

In his first press conference in 21 months, Yoon pledged to focus on improving the economy and tackling what he called the national emergency of flagging birth rates over the three years he has left in office.\n\n\"I think the important thing going forward is indeed the economy,\" he said. \"Corporate growth and job creation are important too but what I think is more important is to try harder to look for what is inconvenient in the life of each and every person and to resolve them.\"\n\nSouth Korea's economy beat most forecasts to grow 1.3% in the first three months of this year, though living costs have remained stubbornly high, despite some progress in tackling inflation. In a new policy push, a government ministry will be set up to tackle the record low birth rate and fast-ageing population, Yoon said in opening remarks from his office, behind a plaque reading \"The Buck Stops Here.\"\n\n\"This is not a matter we can take time to work on,\" he said. South Korea's fertility rate, already the world's lowest, maintained its dramatic decline in 2023, as women cited concerns about bearing most of the burden for raising children, lost career opportunities, and the financial cost of raising children as reasons to delay childbirth or to not have babies.\n\nYoon's People Power Party suffered a heavy loss in an April 10 vote, which prompted calls for a change in his leadership style and policy direction to salvage a presidency not yet at the halfway mark. \"I think it reflects the public's evaluation that my administration's work is far short of what is needed,\" Yoon said when asked about his party's election defeat.\n\nPOLITICAL CONTROVERSIES He apologised for the first time for a controversy surrounding his wife's acceptance of a pricey gift. The issue is likely to weigh heavily on his attempts to win co-operation from the opposition-controlled parliament on policy priorities.\n\nYoon, who won the presidency in 2022 by a margin of less than one percentage point, has seen his support ratings plunge to a low of 21% in one public opinion poll. Lawmaker Park Chan-dae, new floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, called Yoon's press conference and address \"bitterly disappointing\".\n\nHe said it reaffirmed that the president had \"neither the heart nor the will to protect the lives of the people\". Kim Hyung-joon, a professor at Pai Chai University in the capital, said Yoon's comments suggest he may focus on more bipartisan issues such as spurring the birthrate, rather than sweeping changes to his agenda.\n\n\"He didn't seem to have a sense of urgency even after such a crushing election defeat - no new policy initiative, or hardly any sign of drastic change in his way of doing things,\" he said. RUSSIA TIES UNCOMFORTABLE\n\nOn foreign policy, Yoon said South Korea would maintain its stance to not supply lethal weapons to any country in active conflict, when asked if Seoul would consider helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia. Despite its emergence as a major arms exporter, South Korea has resisted pressure from Washington and Kyiv to provide weapons to Ukraine, as it is keen to avoid antagonising Russia.\n\nWhile Russia had been a good partner for quite some time, the war with Ukraine and Moscow's use of weapons from North Korea had made ties \"uncomfortable,\" Yoon said. The United States and its allies have condemned what they called significant deliveries of North Korean weapons to Russia to help its war effort, including missiles that United Nations sanctions monitors said struck a Ukrainian city.\n\nRussia and North Korea have denied arms deals, but have vowed to deepen co-operation on military matters, among others.\n\n(This story has not been edited by

He became a vice justice minister in 2015.\n\nHis appointment comes as Yoon has been criticized for often naming former prosecutors and Seoul National University graduates to administrations positions.\n\nA senior presidential secretary for civil affairs position is expected to manage personnel matters and exercise oversight on political trends and public sentiment.\n\nYoon, who advocated a slimmer presidential office during his campaign days, had previously abolished the post when he took office two years ago, arguing that it had been used to control opposition political forces in the past and intervene in investigations into civilians.\n\nYoon took several questions from reporters and addressed his decision to revive the post.\n\n\"I received a lot of advice that our ability to listen to public sentiment was too weak,\" Yoon said, adding that this was an issue that came up during his first meeting with Democratic Party Chairman Lee Jae-myung recently.\n\nAddressing the rival DP's claims that the reviving of the post is an attempt to protect against judicial risk factors, Yoon said, \"If there is anything raised against me, it is my job to explain and resolve it, and it is not the job of the senior secretary for civil affairs.\"\n\nThis is the latest presidential appointment Yoon has announced in person following the crushing defeat of the People Power Party (PPP) in the April 10 general election.\n\nOn April 22, Yoon introduced Chung Jin-suk as his new chief of staff and Hong Chul-ho as his new senior secretary for political affairs in two separate press briefings on one day. He also took a few questions from reporters.\n\nThis comes as Yoon is scheduled to hold his first official press conference to mark his second anniversary in office on Thursday.\n\nBY SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_National_University", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seoul National University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongsan_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yongsan District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yongsan District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Presidential_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior Presidential Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Chul-ho", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hong Chul-ho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chung_Jin-suk_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chung Jin-suk (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Power_Party_(South_Korea)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "People Power Party (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jae-myung", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jae-myung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Korea", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party of Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/data/photo/2024/05/07/fc0d526d-da02-4939-ba7c-be17e2fd1b35.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 1837, "textEnd": 1845}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 1868, "textEnd": 1876}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Yonhap\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol will kick off his third year in office this week amid mixed assessments of his foreign and domestic policies but a clear need to improve communication with the public after a resounding defeat in general elections seen as a midterm referendum on him.\n\nIn the past year, Yoon helped restore trilateral cooperation among South Korea, the United States and Japan to counter North Korea's nuclear and missile threats and pushed for medical reforms to address the chronic shortage of doctors in the country.\n\nWhile stronger South Korea-U.S.-Japan cooperation was welcomed by some, it was criticized by others for further alienating China, Russia and North Korea. Increasing the number of doctors, meanwhile, was popular with the general public but fiercely resisted by doctors' groups, leading to major disruptions to health care services.\n\n\"I agree with the direction in which he ran state affairs, but there was a lot lacking in the process of gaining the people's consent,\" said Shin Yul, a professor of political science at Myongji University.\n\nThe lack of effective communication proved to be costly.\n\nOn April 10, exactly one month before the administration's two-year mark, the ruling People Power Party suffered a crushing defeat in the general elections. With only 108 seats won in the 300-member National Assembly, the PPP again yielded control of parliament to the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, leaving Yoon to work with an opposition-controlled parliament for all five years of his term.\n\nYoon acknowledged the need to reset his running of state affairs.\n\n\"Although in the two years since my inauguration, I have looked only to the people and taken the path for our national interest, I fell short of the people's expectations,\" he said during a Cabinet meeting six days after the elections.\n\n\"I will communicate more with a humbler and more flexible attitude, and be the first to listen carefully to the public sentiment,\" he said.\n\nAmong other things, Yoon proposed a meeting with DPK leader Lee Jae-myung at the presidential office, the first time he agreed to sit down for talks with the opposition leader since taking office.\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol shakes hands with Lee Jae-myung, head of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, prior to their talks at the presidential office in Seoul, in this photo provided by presidential office, April 29. Yonhap\n\nThe two held wide-ranging discussions, including on the DPK's calls for a special counsel investigation into suspicions surrounding a Marine's death, but differed on almost every issue except for the need for medical reform.\n\nIn the days following the meeting, the ruling and opposition parties reached a compromise on a special bill mandating a new investigation into the 2022 Itaewon crowd crush that claimed 159 lives, a decision that was welcomed by the presidential office as the first fruit of the Yoon-Lee meeting.\n\nIn a sign of the difficulties that still lie ahead, however, the opposition-controlled National Assembly also passed a bill mandating a special counsel investigation into the military's response to the Marine's death, despite a boycott by the ruling party.\n\n\"Whether you like it or not, we're seeing a situation where the legislative authority and the executive authority have to be jointly responsible for the running of state affairs,\" Shin, the professor, said.\n\n\"Be it through another meeting between the president and the opposition leader, or through the formation of a consultative body involving the ruling and opposition parties and the government, they have to continue dialogue,\" he said. \"It's not a choice but a necessity.\"\n\nThe public's assessment of Yoon's job performance was shown not only in the election result but also in his low approval ratings throughout the last year.\n\nMost polls found Yoon's approval rating consistently hovering in the 30 percent range before it fell further to the 20 percent range after the elections.\n\nTo better gauge the public sentiment, Yoon revived the position of senior presidential secretary for civil affairs on Tuesday. On Thursday, he is set to hold his first press conference since August 2022.

SONG KYUNG-SEOK/Pool via REUTERS\n\nBy Josh Smith, Hyonhee Shin and Ju-min Park\n\nSEOUL (Reuters) -South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol conceded on Thursday that his ruling party's crushing election defeat last month reflected the government's failure to improve people's lives, and apologised for a scandal involving his wife.\n\nHe continued to reject calls by opposition lawmakers for a special probe into allegations that the First Lady had inappropriately accepted a pricey Christian Dior handbag as a gift last year, even as prosecutors begin investigating whether she broke any laws.\n\nIn his first press conference in 21 months, Yoon pledged instead to focus on improving the economy and tackling what he called the national emergency of flagging birth rates over the three years he has left in office.\n\n\"I think the important thing going forward is indeed the economy,\" he said.\n\n\"Corporate growth and job creation are important too but what I think is more important is to try harder to look for what is inconvenient in the life of each and every person and to resolve them.\"\n\nSouth Korea's economy beat most forecasts to grow 1.3% in the first three months of this year, though living costs have remained stubbornly high despite some progress in tackling inflation.\n\nIn a new policy push, a government ministry will be set up to tackle the record low birth rate and fast-ageing population, Yoon said in opening remarks from his office, behind a plaque reading \"The Buck Stops Here.\"\n\n\"This is not a matter we can take time to work on,\" he said.\n\nSouth Korea's fertility rate, already the world's lowest, maintained its dramatic decline in 2023, as women cited concerns about bearing most of the burden for raising children, lost career opportunities, and the financial cost of raising children as reasons to delay childbirth or to not have babies.\n\nYoon's People Power Party suffered a heavy loss in an April 10 vote, which prompted calls for a change in his leadership style and policy direction to salvage a presidency not yet at the halfway mark.\n\n\"I think it reflects the public's evaluation that my administration's work is far short of what is needed,\" Yoon said when asked about his party's election defeat.\n\nPOLITICAL CONTROVERSIES\n\nHis comments included the first explicit apology for the controversy surrounding his wife. The issue is likely to weigh heavily on his attempts to win cooperation from the opposition-controlled parliament on policy priorities.\n\nYoon, who won the presidency in 2022 by a margin of less than one percentage point, has seen his support ratings plunge to a low of 21% in one public opinion poll.\n\nLawmaker Park Chan-dae, new floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, called Yoon's press conference and address \"bitterly disappointing\".\n\nHe said it reaffirmed that the president had \"neither the heart nor the will to protect the lives of the people\".\n\nKim Hyung-joon, a professor at Pai Chai University in the capital, said Yoon's comments suggest he may focus on more bipartisan issues such as spurring the birthrate, rather than sweeping changes to his agenda.\n\n\"He didn't seem to have a sense of urgency even after such a crushing election defeat - no new policy initiative, or hardly any sign of drastic change in his way of doing things,\" he said.\n\nRUSSIA TIES UNCOMFORTABLE\n\nOn foreign policy, Yoon declined to directly answer when pressed on former President Donald Trump's stance that he could revive demands for South Korea to pay more to maintain the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in the country.\n\nYoon has staked the defence of South Korea against nuclear-armed North Korea on U.S. \"extended deterrence\" provided by American military assets deployed on the peninsula and region, but that could be threatened if a dispute arises with Washington.\n\nHe said South Korea would maintain its stance to not supply lethal weapons to any country in active conflict, when asked if Seoul would consider helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia.\n\nDespite its emergence as a major arms exporter, South Korea has resisted pressure from Washington and Kyiv to provide weapons to Ukraine, as it is keen to avoid antagonising Russia.\n\nWhile Russia had been a good partner for quite some time, the war with Ukraine and Moscow's use of weapons from North Korea had made ties \"uncomfortable,\" Yoon said.\n\nThe United States and its allies have condemned what they called significant deliveries of North Korean weapons to Russia to help its war effort, including missiles that United Nations sanctions monitors said struck a Ukrainian city.\n\nRussia and North Korea have denied arms deals, but have vowed to deepen co-operation on military matters, among others.\n\n(Reporting by Josh Smith, Hyonhee Shin, Ju-min Park, Hyunsu Yim; Writing by Jack Kim; Editing by Ed Davies, Clarence Fernandez and Raju Gopalakrishnan)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

This is a return to both a presidential campaign pledge and his early presidency, when he took questions from the press during his signature daily doorstepping sessions.\n\nOne such immediate measure is Yoon's first official press conference at the Yongsan presidential office on Thursday, the first of its kind in 21 months. Another is the revival of the position of senior presidential secretary for civil affairs earlier this week to better collect public sentiment. In an in-person press briefing, Yoon named former Vice Justice Minister Kim Joo-hyun to the post he scrapped when he took office in 2022, arguing at the time that the secretary was often mobilized to conduct surveillance on and control political dissidents in the past.\n\nReform hurdles\n\nAs a candidate of the conservative People Power Party (PPP), Yoon took office on May 10, 2022, as a breath of fresh air as a political newbie who vowed to take on a different path from the liberal Moon Jae-in administration, under which he served as prosecutor general.\n\nHe began his presidency by moving the presidential office to Yongsan in central Seoul and opening the Blue House in northern Gwanghwamun to the public, in line with his campaign pledge to become a president who is more accessible to the people and press.\n\nIn turn, he has scrapped some of the Moon administration's key policies, such as income-led growth and the nuclear phase-out scheme, platforms driven by the government rather than the market.\n\nYoon, in turn, has touted deregulation measures and policies based on market principles and a rules-based order.\n\nThe Yoon administration has especially pushed for labor, pension and education reforms.\n\nIn February, the Yoon administration announced plans to drastically increase the medical school admissions quota as a part of its pledge to provide better and more accessible health care nationwide, leading to the ongoing standoff between doctors and the government.\n\nHowever, his administration's reform plans face a significant hurdle as the liberal bloc holds a majority in the incoming National Assembly.\n\nTurbulence ahead\n\nYoon is already known for carrying out more presidential vetoes in the first two years than most Korean leaders.\n\nHe has previously vetoed a slew of bills, including one to establish an independent probe into the 2022 Itaewon crowd crush that resulted in 159 deaths and another one calling for an investigation into stock manipulation allegations into first lady Kim Keon Hee earlier this year.\n\nHe is also likely to veto a future DP-led special counsel probe into the death of a young Marine during flooding last year, which passed in the DP-led National Assembly on May 2. The DP alleges that the presidential office and the Ministry of National Defense interfered in a military investigation into the death of Marine Lance Corporal Chae Su-geun, who died during a post-flood rescue mission last July.\n\nYoon faces several legal headaches, including allegations against his wife.\n\nKim is accused of receiving a luxury handbag from a pastor in 2022. She has also been accused of involvement in a stock manipulation case.\n\nHowever, Yoon's foreign policy approach will likely not be affected by domestic difficulties, as they are more determined by the current geopolitical landscape.\n\nRegarding diplomatic achievements, Yoon has focused on values-based solidarity and touted himself as the country's \"No. 1 salesman,\" concentrating on prioritizing Seoul's strategic interests and economic security priorities.\n\nHe has made eight trips abroad, visiting 13 countries over the last year. This includes his surprise visit to Ukraine in July 2023, during a trip to Lithuania for the NATO summit and Poland.\n\nAfter his first year in office, Yoon highlighted diplomacy as his most outstanding achievement.\n\nHe strengthened the bilateral alliance with Washington by creating a Nuclear Consultative Group to strengthen U.S. extended deterrence in the region. He also normalized relations with Japan over the past year, resulting in stronger trilateral security cooperation with the United States in light of North Korea's increased nuclear and missile threats.\n\nNonetheless, the president will have to weather stormier seas as he heads into his third year, faced with having to find ways to cooperate with the DP coalition to push forward his reform and budget agenda.\n\nHis approval rating dipped below 30 percent in some recent polls, having generally remained under 40 percent for the past two years.\n\nHe will be the first president to deal with a rival party holding a majority in the parliament for all five years in office.\n\nNew leaf\n\nIn a move signaling more willingness to cooperate with the liberal political bloc, Yoon and DP Lee Jae-myung, his 2022 presidential election rival, held their first sit-down talks on April 29.\n\nIn Thursday morning's press conference, Yoon is expected to explain his stance on state affairs and major pending issues while highlighting communication and cooperation.\n\nThe president is expected to start off with with a 20-minute address to the nation explaining his administration's policies over the past two years and unveiling the direction of the remainder of his term, including his major reform agenda.\n\nHe could also address dire economic and social issues, including the country's low birthrate.\n\nIn a Cabinet meeting on April 16, days after the election, Yoon apologized to the public and said he \"will communicate better and more frequently,\" ordering his aides to do the same.\n\nThe next three years could testify to whether he keeps that vow.\n\nBY SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(Yonhap)\n\nJust as President Yoon Suk Yeol entered the briefing room filled with some 150 reporters in his office in Seoul on Thursday, for the first time in 631 days, one of the reporters asked Yoon to hold more frequent news conferences and boost communication with the public.\n\n\"I will,\" Yoon replied.\n\nAfter this, Yoon took 20 questions during the 73-minute press conference. The questions centered around politics, foreign policy, the economy and social affairs. He took more questions than he did in his first such conference in August 2022, when he answered 12 questions.\n\nThen, Yoon also admitted his shortcomings in communicating with the public about his policy directions.\n\nCritics have long accused Yoon of eroding press freedom in South Korea.\n\nIn the early stage of his term, Yoon promised to become a leader who \"frequently stands in front of reporters and takes reporters' questions,\" which he said in the first press conference held to mark his 100th day in office. He also held regular \"door-stepping\" sessions to take questions from reporters on his way to the office.\n\nIt was Yoon's hot-mic incident during his visit to the United States in September 2022 that put a strain on his relationship with the media. Out of his discontent toward MBC, which covered the incident, Yoon's office in November 2022 banned the broadcaster's reporters from boarding Air Force One during Yoon's next foreign trip.\n\nLater in November 2022, Yoon's office said he would no longer answer reporters' questions, after 61 occasions since his inauguration.

recent electoral defeat, and laying out policies on issues from the country's low birthrate to Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\nThe press conference was the president's first in nearly two years and comes after his party suffered a drubbing in legislative elections last month.\n\nOn Ukraine, Yoon vowed to keep strong ties with Kyiv while maintaining a smooth relationship with Russia, ruling out direct weapons shipments and telling reporters that it was his \"firm stance\" not to send lethal arms to countries at war.\n\nOn South Korea's birthrate, one of the world's lowest, he unveiled plans to create a ministry to tackle the issue, which he described as \"a national emergency\".\n\nHis party's defeat in the Apr 10 parliamentary elections prompted calls for Yoon to change his policy direction and leadership style, as his approval ratings languish less than halfway through his five-year term.\n\nYoon said he has \"pondered a lot over what have been the shortcomings\" of his administration.\n\n\"Communication to explain policy drives and the extent of change people have felt has fallen short,\" he said.\n\nYoon won the 2022 presidential election by the narrowest margin in South Korean history, and his term has been hampered by a series of scandals and his party's lack of a parliamentary majority.\n\nThe president also issued an apology for what he called the \"unwise conduct\" of his wife, first lady Kim Keon Hee, after hidden camera footage last year appeared to show her accepting a luxury handbag in violation of government ethics rules.\n\nBut Yoon said the opposition's call for a special probe into the first lady was \"politically motivated\".\n\nHis plan to fix the country's woeful birthrate comes after it hit a record low in 2023, despite the government pouring billions of dollars into efforts to encourage women to have more children and maintain population stability.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

To pursue these policies properly, I will launch a new government agency, tentatively called the 'low birth response planning ministry' to prepare for the low-birth, aging society.\"\n\nFollowing his 20-minute speech, Yoon met with reporters for more than an hour, addressing thorny issues his administration is facing, including suspicions related to his wife.\n\n[Sound bite: President Yoon Suk Yeol (Korean-English)]\n\n\"I apologize for causing concerns because of the less-than-wise behavior of my wife.\"\n\nFirst Lady Kim Keon-hee is a target of attacks by the opposition, which calls for the thorough investigation of her alleged involvement in a stock-price manipulation scandal as well as her alleged acceptance of a luxury handbag from an acquaintance, which was secretly filmed.\n\nHowever, Yoon refused the repeated call to launch an independent counsel probe into the case, saying that she was cleared of suspicion through exhaustive investigations by the previous government.\n\nHe also rejected the opposition-led bill for a special counsel probe into a controversial military report on a death of a Marine, regarding which ranking officials are suspected to have wielded their influence in a bid to protect the top brass of the Marine Corps.\n\nThe president said that he will agree to appoint a special prosecutor if the ongoing investigation turns out to be insufficient.\n\nKim Bum-soo, KBS World Radio News.", "source": {"uri": "world.kbs.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "KBS WORLD Radio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_bite", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sound bite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Bum-soo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim Bum-soo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Keon-hee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Keon-hee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KBS_World_Radio", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "KBS World Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brass", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 54}], "image": "http://worldimg.kbs.co.kr/src/images/news/202405/240509111607_31_e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 1551, "textEnd": 1559}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The issue is likely to weigh heavily on his attempts to win cooperation from the opposition-controlled parliament on policy priorities.\n\nYoon, who won the presidency in 2022 by a margin of less than one percentage point, has seen his support ratings plunge to a low of 21% in one public opinion poll.\n\nLawmaker Park Chan-dae, new floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, called Yoon's press conference and address \"bitterly disappointing.\"\n\nHe said it reaffirmed that the president had \"neither the heart nor the will to protect the lives of the people.\"\n\nKim Hyung-joon, a professor at Pai Chai University in the capital, said Yoon's comments suggest he may focus on more bipartisan issues such as spurring the birthrate, rather than sweeping changes to his agenda.\n\n\"He didn\u00b4t seem to have a sense of urgency even after such a crushing election defeat - no new policy initiative, or hardly any sign of drastic change in his way of doing things,\" he said.\n\nRUSSIA TIES UNCOMFORTABLE\n\nOn foreign policy, Yoon declined to directly answer when pressed on former President Donald Trump's stance that he could revive demands for South Korea to pay more to maintain the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in the country.\n\nYoon has staked the defense of South Korea against nuclear-armed North Korea on U.S. \"extended deterrence\" provided by American military assets deployed on the peninsula and region, but that could be threatened if a dispute arises with Washington.\n\nHe said South Korea would maintain its stance to not supply lethal weapons to any country in active conflict, when asked if Seoul would consider helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia.\n\nDespite its emergence as a major arms exporter, South Korea has resisted pressure from Washington and Kyiv to provide weapons to Ukraine, as it is keen to avoid antagonizing Russia.\n\nWhile Russia had been a good partner for quite some time, the war with Ukraine and Moscow's use of weapons from North Korea had made ties \"uncomfortable,\" Yoon said.\n\nThe United States and its allies have condemned what they called significant deliveries of North Korean weapons to Russia to help its war effort, including missiles that United Nations sanctions monitors said struck a Ukrainian city.\n\nRussia and North Korea have denied arms deals, but have vowed to deepen co-operation on military matters, among others.

Korea vows strong Ukraine ties, smooth Russia relations", "body": "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said Thursday that Seoul would keep strong ties with Ukraine and a \"smooth\" relationship with Russia, while ruling out direct weapon shipments to Kyiv.\n\nAs a major arms exporter, Seoul has long been asked by US and European allies to do more to help Kyiv, with speculation that South Korea would change longstanding policy due to North Korea's alleged arms transfers to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nBut Yoon told reporters it was his \"firm stance\" not to provide lethal weapons to countries in conflict.\n\nYoon said his country was doing its \"best to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, in accordance with the spirit of the constitution\".\n\nYoon said his country's ties with Moscow had been strained by what Seoul and ally Washington say are arms shipments from North Korea to Russia.\n\n\"North Korea's export of offensive weapons not only supports the illegal waging of war in relation to Ukraine, but also clearly violates UN Security Council sanctions resolutions related to North Korea's nuclear weapons,\" Yoon said.\n\nDespite tensions with Moscow over the purported arms shipments, Yoon said he would work with Russia.\n\n\"Russia is a country with which we have had a good relationship for a long time,\" he said.\n\n\"Due to the recent war with Ukraine, we have different positions regarding the introduction of weapons from North Korea,\" he added.\n\n\"As for our relationship with Russia, we will cooperate on a case-by-case basis, and we may oppose or be wary depending on differences in position, but we will manage our relationship with Russia as smoothly as possible.\"\n\nSeoul has long sought to join the ranks of the world's top arms exporters -- aiming to be the fourth largest, behind the United States, Russia and France -- something that is now possible, industry research indicates.\n\nIt has also sold artillery shells to Washington -- but with a \"final user\" agreement in place meaning only the United States can use the munitions.\n\nExperts have said this allows the United States to then provide their own shells to Kyiv.\n\n- Birthrate ministry -\n\nSpeaking at his first press conference in nearly two years, the president, whose party suffered a drubbing in legislative elections last month, also unveiled plans to create a new ministry to deal with the country's sharply declining birthrate.\n\nYoon, whose party does not control the country's parliament, said he would ask lawmakers to cooperate \"to set up the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter Planning\", he said in a live address to the nation.\n\nSouth Korea's birth rate fell to a record low last year, official data shows, despite having poured billions of dollars into efforts to encourage women to have more children and maintain population stability.\n\nThe country's fertility rate -- the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime -- dropped to 0.72 in 2023, down nearly eight percent from 2022, according to preliminary data from Statistics Korea in February.\n\nThat is far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain the current population of 51 million, which at these rates will nearly halve by the year 2100, experts estimate.\n\nAt the rare press conference, the president also issued an apology for what he called the \"unwise conduct\" of his wife, first lady Kim Keon Hee, after hidden camera footage last year appeared to show her accepting a luxury handbag in violation of government ethics rules.\n\nSouth Korea's political opposition dismissed the president's press conference, held to mark his second year in office, as being \"filled with self-praise\".\n\nThe president \"still has no clue as to why nearly 70 percent of the public disapprove of his governing style,\" the spokesman of the Democratic party Han Min-soo said, referring to Yoon's approval ratings, which have typically hovered around 30 percent.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Agence

(Yonhap)\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol spent his first two years in office facing persistent and intense political confrontations, public censure over his unilateral approach to communication, and controversies surrounding his wife that cast a shadow over his policy initiatives and foreign affairs activities.\n\nHaving been elected to South Korea's most powerful office only six months after entering politics, the 63-year-old former prosecutor has remained unpopular domestically for the past two years, with his approval rating in the low-30 percent range for most of his tenure.\n\nWith the ruling bloc's April general election defeat, chances to reverse course now appear scarce for the president, who never held an elected office before becoming president and is now floundering with his term less than halfway through.\n\n\"I think that the ruling bloc's defeat in the April National Assembly election wasn't a question of policy, but rather a result of a majority of South Korean voters disagreeing with President Yoon's leadership style,\" Ramon Pacheco Pardo, professor of international relations at King's College London.\n\nSince his inauguration in 2022, Yoon has had to work with an opposition-controlled National Assembly.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Yoon chose to focus on foreign affairs -- restoring ties with Japan, tilting to the United States, visiting 18 countries and holding 153 formal meetings with foreign leaders -- instead of resolving the domestic political hurdle.\n\nAlso, Yoon chose to give his political rivals the cold shoulder. Before the April election defeat, Yoon had never held formal talks with his political opponent, Rep. Lee Jae-myung, who chairs the Democratic Party of Korea.\n\nYoon was quoted as saying by Prime Minister Han Duck-soo in September that his meeting with a figure currently on criminal trial \"could be seen as unfair,\" given that Lee is facing multiple criminal allegations.\n\nIn return, Lee's party ramped up offensives against the ruling bloc by ramming through bills without the ruling party's consultation. Yoon responded by exercising his veto power nine times, the second-highest number of vetoes in the first two years of a presidency.\n\nThe main opposition also called for investigations into Yoon's family members including first lady Kim Keon Hee.\n\n\"With the result of the 2022 presidential election being so tight, I think that voters would have expected more dialogue between the president and his party on the one hand and the opposition on the other,\" Pacheco Pardo said.\n\nThe legislative gridlock has also delayed efforts at reform, such as to the public pension system. During Yoon's first two years, only 40 percent of government-proposed bills passed the parliament, compared to rates of between 80 and 90 percent over the past two decades.\n\n\"It is hard to determine how much his leadership actually hurt his party in the National Assembly, but it is safe to say that it didn't help,\" said Karl Friedhoff, fellow for Asia Studies at the US-based think tank Chicago Council on Global Affairs.\n\nYoon continues to face the risk of not being able to have a domestic policy breakthrough in the remaining three years, as the main opposition party is set to dominate the new National Assembly that kicks off next month.\n\nThe April general election also allowed budding parties seeking vengeance against Yoon to debut in the National Assembly.\n\nRebuilding Korea Party's Chair Cho Kuk fell from grace as Yoon, then prosecutor-general, led an investigation into his family's admissions forgery scandal. New Reform Party's leader Lee Jun-seok, was estranged from the People Power Party although his leadership yielded victories in both the presidential and local elections in 2022. Both figures won a seat at the April election, and so did a dozen of their party members combined.\n\nYoon's enemies are not limited to political opponents. Yoon's lingering standoff with doctors shows no signs of abating as Seoul has been moving to increase the number of doctors and doctors are against it.\n\nYoon also has a history of deadlocking with labor unions, pushing through back-to-work orders on striking truckers who protested the government's rejection of extending the freight rate hike.\n\n\"Many South Korean voters are tired of constant bickering over minor issues,\" said Pacheco Pardo.\n\nIn his first year of presidency, the conservative ruling bloc has largely gained public approval.\n\nFollowing Yoon's narrow victory against then-liberal candidate Lee Jae-myung in March 2022, the conservative party was also victorious in the local election in June 2022, winning 12 out of 17 metropolitan mayoral and gubernatorial posts.\n\nBut the ruling party suffered defeat in a by-election in September, an event that proved to be a bellwether for the April general election.\n\nThe People Power Party lost its bid to regain a Seoul district office seat, as it pushed ahead with its plan to let Kim Tae-woo of the People Power Party defend his seat.\n\nThe by-election was held to fill in the seat that Kim used to hold. Kim was forced out of the position after he was found guilty of leaking information about presidential office affairs during the former liberal Moon Jae-in administration as a special investigator. Yoon pardoned Kim in August, three months after he was convicted by the top court.\n\nFriedhoff argued that the ruling bloc's agenda-setting lacked consistency and substance through Yoon's first two years.\n\nHe said Yoon's presidential election pledge to disband the Ministry of Gender Equality, and the ruling party's proposal to expand Seoul to incorporate Gimpo suggest the ruling bloc is \"out of ideas and out of step.\"\n\n\"The question the public is asking is, 'Do the conservatives actually have an agenda?'\" Friedhoff said.\n\nYoon is expected to remain steadfast in his foreign policy in the remainder of his three years in office.\n\nOne of the most notable points in Yoon's foreign policy so far is mending ties with Japan. Yoon met his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida seven times in his first two years, more than his predecessors Park Chung-hee, Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo, Park Geun-hye and Moon Jae-in did throughout the term.\n\nBut experts noted that there are issues that need to be addressed to create a solid foundation for Seoul's restored ties with Tokyo and prepare for the US presidential election in November.\n\nFriedhoff said the historical issues were not fully settled between Seoul and Tokyo, contrary to Yoon's suggestions that Seoul is ready to make the difficulties a thing of the past.\n\n\"Relations with Japan need to be improved in a way that also takes care to address the underlying historical difficulties ... the ground will inevitably shift and revert in the future,\" Friedhoff said.\n\nFreidhoff added that Seoul will need to increase its pursuit of \"minilaterals\" -- activities involving small numbers of countries -- in order to brace for former US president Donald Trump's victory and the turbulence that comes with it.\n\n\"That could include Japan, but should also include countries like Australia, India and the Philippines, for example,\" he said.\n\nAttention is also being paid to whether Seoul would manage to successfully host the trilateral summit of Seoul, Beijing and Tokyo.\n\n\"I believe that South Korea will strive to talk to China, just as the US, Japan, France or Germany are also doing,\" Pacheco Pardo said. \"I think that this is normal.\"", "source": {"uri": "koreaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea

The issue is likely to weigh heavily on his attempts to win cooperation from the opposition-controlled parliament on policy priorities.\n\nYoon, who won the presidency in 2022 by a margin of less than one percentage point, has seen his support ratings plunge to a low of 21% in one public opinion poll.\n\nLawmaker Park Chan-dae, new floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, called Yoon's press conference and address \"bitterly disappointing\".\n\nHe said it reaffirmed that the president had \"neither the heart nor the will to protect the lives of the people\".\n\nKim Hyung-joon, a professor at Pai Chai University in the capital, said Yoon's comments suggest he may focus on more bipartisan issues such as spurring the birthrate, rather than sweeping changes to his agenda.\n\n\"He didn't seem to have a sense of urgency even after such a crushing election defeat - no new policy initiative, or hardly any sign of drastic change in his way of doing things,\" he said.\n\nRUSSIA TIES UNCOMFORTABLE\n\nOn foreign policy, Yoon declined to directly answer when pressed on former President Donald Trump's stance that he could revive demands for South Korea to pay more to maintain the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in the country.\n\nYoon has staked the defence of South Korea against nuclear-armed North Korea on U.S. \"extended deterrence\" provided by American military assets deployed on the peninsula and region, but that could be threatened if a dispute arises with Washington.\n\nHe said South Korea would maintain its stance to not supply lethal weapons to any country in active conflict, when asked if Seoul would consider helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia.\n\nDespite its emergence as a major arms exporter, South Korea has resisted pressure from Washington and Kyiv to provide weapons to Ukraine, as it is keen to avoid antagonising Russia.\n\nWhile Russia had been a good partner for quite some time, the war with Ukraine and Moscow's use of weapons from North Korea had made ties \"uncomfortable,\" Yoon said.\n\nThe United States and its allies have condemned what they called significant deliveries of North Korean weapons to Russia to help its war effort, including missiles that United Nations sanctions monitors said struck a Ukrainian city.\n\nRussia and North Korea have denied arms deals, but have vowed to deepen co-operation on military matters, among others.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@indianexpress.com", "name": "Reuters", "type":

Despite being anticipated as a pivotal moment to address pressing issues and set the tone for the remainder of his term, the conference left many disappointed. It lacked the decisive action and humility sought by the public.\n\nYoon was widely expected to demonstrate sincere accountability in response to significant recent controversies, including allegations about his wife Kim Keon Hee receiving a luxury gift and demands for special probes into her family's financial irregularities. Regrettably, Yoon's acknowledgment of public concerns regarding his wife's actions felt insufficient, lacking the depth of remorse needed to appease public discontent.\n\nMaking matters worse, Yoon's reluctance to fully accept the demands for special counsel probes into the allegations further aggravated disappointment. Although he conceded to conditional acceptance, emphasizing the requirement for specific allegations to justify such actions, many were hoping for a more sincere approach to addressing allegations of misconduct.\n\nThe expectations, however, fell flat as Yoon stopped short of offering a comprehensive apology. His remark, \"I apologize for causing concerns due to my wife's unwise behavior,\" was seen as a step forward compared to his previous statements. Yet, Yoon blatantly refused to accept the opposition's demands to initiate a special counsel investigation into possible irregularities involving his wife.\n\n\"A special attorney may be necessary only to address suspicions surrounding the investigations by law enforcement authorities, such as prosecutors and the police,\" he said. He also declined to comply with demands for a special investigation into the death of a Marine, claiming that it was necessary to wait and see the outcome of an ongoing probe. \"I would consider special investigations if there are suspicions raised by the public about the investigation results,\" Yoon said.\n\nLooking back over the past two years, the Yoon administration has prioritized shifting policy directions from those pursued under the previous Moon Jae-in administration. Notable successes include stabilizing real estate prices, implementing prudent fiscal policies, and fostering improved relations with Japan and the United States in the realm of security.\n\nHowever, these achievements have been largely overshadowed by missteps, particularly in media regulation attempts, coupled with failures in addressing major economic and social issues, such as the proposed expansion of enrollment quotas for medical colleges. Yoon's admission of his failure to communicate with the public and implementing tangible changes highlights the necessity of recalibrating governance strategies. Yoon should remember that his uncommunicative and erratic approach contributed to his ruling People Power Party's crushing defeat in the April 10 general elections.\n\nNotably, Yoon himself acknowledged his shortcomings in this regard. \"The election defeat means that the people have critically assessed my administration. We failed to achieve tangible changes that people could feel, and we lacked efforts to fully explain and communicate with the public.\"\n\nYoon now faces daunting tasks in carrying out state policies for the remaining three years of his term. A significant challenge arises from the sizable opposition Democratic Party of Korea, which holds 175 seats in the 300-seat 22nd National Assembly.\n\nThese political challenges further underscore Yoon's task of effectively advancing state policies and maximizing national interests. Yoon vowed to \"enhance communication with political parties and strengthen cooperation to improve the people's livelihoods.\"\n\nAs he moves into the next phase of his presidency, Yoon unveiled a plan to establish a new ministry dedicated to addressing the challenges of a low birth rate and an aging society, with its leader assuming the role of deputy prime minister.

Park Chan-dae, the floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea, speaks during a briefing in response to President Yoon Suk Yeol's press conference at the National Assembly in Seoul, Thursday. Yonhap\n\nBy Kwak Yeon-soo\n\nRuling and opposition parties showed mixed responses, Thursday, to President Yoon Suk Yeol's press conference marking his second year in office. This was Yoon's first press conference since August 2022, when he marked his first 100 days in office.\n\nDuring a 70-minute press conference, the president set out a new course for his government and presented his stance on politically contentious issues, including allegations that first lady Kim Keon Hee illegally accepted a luxury handbag in September 2022 and the opposition's push for a special counsel investigation into the government's suspected inteference in the military's investigation into a Marine's death during a search-and-rescue operation in a flooded area in July 2023.\n\nYoon also vowed to increase communication channels with political parties following the ruling party's crushing defeat in the general elections last month.\n\nThe ruling People Power Party (PPP) defended Yoon's remarks, saying it will work closely with the government to better heed public concerns and focus on improving people's livelihoods.\n\n\"President Yoon expressed regret over limited progress in resolving urgent matters related to people's livelihoods. He honestly acknowledged that there had been shortcomings in efforts to enhance the people's livelihoods and pledged to humbly accept public sentiment and strive to reform his administration,\" PPP spokesperson Rep. Jung Hee-yong said in a statement.\n\nYoon addresses wife's allegations, livelihood issues in somber, apologetic tone 2024-05-09 10:22 | Politics\n\n\"The president, the government and the ruling party will communicate and cooperate by prioritizing the issue of enhancing people's livelihoods.\"\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol speaks during a press conference marking the second anniversary of his presidency at the presidential office in Seoul, Thursday. Yonhap\n\nHowever, the main opposition Democratic People of Korea (DPK) criticized Yoon for using the press conference to praise himself and his government's response to controversial issues.\n\n\"Yoon has fallen short of our expectations for government reform. At today's press conference, we saw a president who remained stubborn despite hitting a new low in public opinion,\" said Rep. Park Chan-dae, the DPK's floor leader.\n\nHe pointed out that Yoon's rejection of a special counsel probe into the government's alleged interference in the military's investigation into the Marine's death suggests that the president has no will to care for or protect the lives of the people.\n\nLast week, the DPK railroaded a contentious bill, calling for a special counsel probe into allegations surrounding the Marine's case despite fierce protests from the ruling party.\n\nAccording to recent public surveys, nearly 70 percent of the public support the special counsel probe.\n\n\"We urge Yoon to accept the bill on a special counsel to investigate the Marine's death. If the president vetoes the bill now, he will be solely responsible for everything that happens once the bill is passed in the Assembly. We also ask PPP lawmakers to stand on the side of the people, not on the side of power,\" Park said.\n\nOther opposition parties also said that the president's speech and Q&A fell short of showing his commitment to taking a flexible approach toward state affairs.\n\nThe New Reform Party slammed Yoon, saying that he still lacks self-awareness given that there was no change in the president's stance on issues like the medical school quota expansion and the special counsel probe into the case of the Marine's death in 2023.", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yonhap News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Korea", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party of Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(South_Korea)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floor leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Purchasing power parity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Power_Party_(South_Korea)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "People Power Party (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_Unity_Party_of_Germany", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Socialist Unity Party of Germany"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parliamentary opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_Party_of_the_United_States_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reform Party of the United States of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/985a7973ba0e4d9da67e88f7e41c93c0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Despite being anticipated as a pivotal moment to address pressing issues and set the tone for the remainder of his term, the conference left many disappointed. It lacked the decisive action and humility sought by the public.\n\nYoon was widely expected to demonstrate sincere accountability in response to significant recent controversies, including allegations about his wife Kim Keon Hee receiving a luxury gift and demands for special probes into her family's financial irregularities. Regrettably, Yoon's acknowledgment of public concerns regarding his wife's actions felt insufficient, lacking the depth of remorse needed to appease public discontent.\n\nMaking matters worse, Yoon's reluctance to fully accept the demands for special counsel probes into the allegations further aggravated disappointment. Although he conceded to conditional acceptance, emphasizing the requirement for specific allegations to justify such actions, many were hoping for a more sincere approach to addressing allegations of misconduct.\n\nThe expectations, however, fell flat as Yoon stopped short of offering a comprehensive apology. His remark, \"I apologize for causing concerns due to my wife's unwise behavior,\" was seen as a step forward compared to his previous statements. Yet, Yoon blatantly refused to accept the opposition's demands to initiate a special counsel investigation into possible irregularities involving his wife.\n\n\"A special attorney may be necessary only to address suspicions surrounding the investigations by law enforcement authorities, such as prosecutors and the police,\" he said. He also declined to comply with demands for a special investigation into the death of a Marine, claiming that it was necessary to wait and see the outcome of an ongoing probe. \"I would consider special investigations if there are suspicions raised by the public about the investigation results,\" Yoon said.\n\nLooking back over the past two years, the Yoon administration has prioritized shifting policy directions from those pursued under the previous Moon Jae-in administration. Notable successes include stabilizing real estate prices, implementing prudent fiscal policies, and fostering improved relations with Japan and the United States in the realm of security.\n\nHowever, these achievements have been largely overshadowed by missteps, particularly in media regulation attempts, coupled with failures in addressing major economic and social issues, such as the proposed expansion of enrollment quotas for medical colleges. Yoon's admission of his failure to communicate with the public and implementing tangible changes highlights the necessity of recalibrating governance strategies. Yoon should remember that his uncommunicative and erratic approach contributed to his ruling People Power Party's crushing defeat in the April 10 general elections.\n\nNotably, Yoon himself acknowledged his shortcomings in this regard. \"The election defeat means that the people have critically assessed my administration. We failed to achieve tangible changes that people could feel, and we lacked efforts to fully explain and communicate with the public.\"\n\nYoon now faces daunting tasks in carrying out state policies for the remaining three years of his term. A significant challenge arises from the sizable opposition Democratic Party of Korea, which holds 175 seats in the 300-seat 22nd National Assembly.\n\nThese political challenges further underscore Yoon's task of effectively advancing state policies and maximizing national interests. Yoon vowed to \"enhance communication with political parties and strengthen cooperation to improve the people's livelihoods.\"\n\nAs he moves into the next phase of his presidency, Yoon unveiled a plan to establish a new ministry dedicated to addressing the challenges of a low birth rate and an aging society, with its leader assuming the role of deputy prime minister. The issue of low fertility has emerged as the most pressing problem facing the nation. The ruling and opposition parties should engage in dialogue and work closely together to navigate the challenges ahead.

Corporate growth and job creation are important too but what I think is more important is to try harder to look for what is inconvenient in the life of each and every person and to resolve them,\" he said.\n\nSouth Korea's economy beat most forecasts to grow 1.3% in the first three months of this year, though living costs have remained stubbornly high despite some progress tackling inflation.\n\nAs part of a new policy push, a government ministry would be created to address the record low birth rate and fast-ageing population, Yoon said in opening remarks from his office, behind a plaque which reads \"The Buck Stops Here.\"\n\n\"This is not a matter we can take time to work on,\" he said.\n\nSouth Korea's fertility rate, already the world's lowest, continued its dramatic decline in 2023, as women cited concerns about bearing most of the burden for raising children, lost career opportunities, and the financial cost of raising children as reasons to delay childbirth or to not have babies.\n\nYoon fronted the media after the heavy defeat of his People Power Party in an April 10 vote, which prompted calls for a change in his leadership style and policy direction to salvage a presidency not yet at the halfway point.\n\n\"I think it reflects the public's evaluation of my administration's work is far short of what is needed,\" Yoon said when asked about his party's election defeat.\n\nHe apologised for the first time for a controversy surrounding his wife accepting a pricey gift. The issue is likely to weigh heavily on his attempts to win cooperation from the opposition-controlled parliament on policy priorities.\n\nYoon, who won the presidency in 2022 by a margin of less than one percentage point, has seen his support ratings plunge to a low of 21% in one public opinion poll.\n\nHe has pledged to communicate better with the public and parliament, as some analysts warn that he had already slipped into lame-duck status.\n\nRUSSIA TIES UNCOMFORTABLE\n\nOn foreign policy, Yoon said South Korea would maintain its stance to not supply lethal weapons to any country in active conflict, when asked if Seoul would consider helping Ukraine defend itself against Russia.\n\nDespite its emergence as a major military exporter, South Korea has resisted pressure from Washington and Kyiv to provide more than humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, as it is keen to avoid antagonising Russia.\n\nRussia had been a good partner for quite some time, Yoon said.\n\n\"But recently because of the war with Ukraine and taking weapons from North Korea, we are in a slightly different position and our ties are uncomfortable,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and its allies have condemned what they say have been significant North Korean weapons deliveries to Russia to help its war effort.\n\nRussia and North Korea have repeatedly denied such cooperation, though debris from a missile that landed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Jan. 2 was from a North Korean Hwasong-11 series ballistic missile, United Nations sanctions monitors told a Security Council committee in a report seen by Reuters on Monday.\n\n(Reporting by Josh Smith, Hyonhee Shin, Ju-min Park, Hyunsu Yim; Writing by Jack Kim; Editing by Ed Davies and Stephen Coates)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Korea vows strong Ukraine ties, smooth Russia relations", "body": "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said Thursday that Seoul would keep strong ties with Ukraine and a \"smooth\" relationship with Russia, while ruling out direct weapon shipments to Kyiv.\n\nAs a major arms exporter, Seoul has long been asked by US and European allies to do more to help Kyiv, with speculation that South Korea would change longstanding policy due to North Korea's alleged arms transfers to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nBut Yoon told reporters it was his \"firm stance\" not to provide lethal weapons to countries in conflict.\n\nYoon said his country was doing its \"best to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, in accordance with the spirit of the constitution\".\n\nYoon said his country's ties with Moscow had been strained by what Seoul and ally Washington say are arms shipments from North Korea to Russia.\n\n\"North Korea's export of offensive weapons not only supports the illegal waging of war in relation to Ukraine, but also clearly violates UN Security Council sanctions resolutions related to North Korea's nuclear weapons,\" Yoon said.\n\nDespite tensions with Moscow over the purported arms shipments, Yoon said he would work with Russia.\n\n\"Russia is a country with which we have had a good relationship for a long time,\" he said.\n\n\"Due to the recent war with Ukraine, we have different positions regarding the introduction of weapons from North Korea,\" he added.\n\n\"As for our relationship with Russia, we will cooperate on a case-by-case basis, and we may oppose or be wary depending on differences in position, but we will manage our relationship with Russia as smoothly as possible.\"\n\nSeoul has long sought to join the ranks of the world's top arms exporters -- aiming to be the fourth largest, behind the United States, Russia and France -- something that is now possible, industry research indicates.\n\nIt has also sold artillery shells to Washington -- but with a \"final user\" agreement in place meaning only the United States can use the munitions.\n\nMore from this section Hummingbirds and hooves take over the red carpet at Met Gala Pro Sports Equality: League Commits to Charter Flights Stormy Daniels details alleged sexual encounter with Donald Trump at hush money trial\n\nExperts have said this allows the United States to then provide their own shells to Kyiv.\n\n- Birthrate ministry -\n\nSpeaking at his first press conference in nearly two years, the president, whose party suffered a drubbing in legislative elections last month, also unveiled plans to create a new ministry to deal with the country's sharply declining birthrate.\n\nYoon, whose party does not control the country's parliament, said he would ask lawmakers to cooperate \"to set up the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter Planning\", he said in a live address to the nation.\n\nSouth Korea's birth rate fell to a record low last year, official data shows, despite having poured billions of dollars into efforts to encourage women to have more children and maintain population stability.\n\nThe country's fertility rate -- the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime -- dropped to 0.72 in 2023, down nearly eight percent from 2022, according to preliminary data from Statistics Korea in February.\n\nThat is far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain the current population of 51 million, which at these rates will nearly halve by the year 2100, experts estimate.\n\nAt the rare press conference, the president also issued an apology for what he called the \"unwise conduct\" of his wife, first lady Kim Keon Hee, after hidden camera footage last year appeared to show her accepting a luxury handbag in violation of government ethics rules.\n\nSouth Korea's political opposition dismissed the president's press conference, held to mark his second year in office, as being \"filled with self-praise\".\n\nThe president \"still has no clue as to why nearly 70 percent of the public disapprove of his governing style,\" the spokesman of the Democratic party Han Min-soo said, referring to Yoon's approval ratings, which have typically hovered around 30 percent.\n\nceb-kjk-hs/cwl", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He has little room to move after the election in which the progressive opposition bloc led by the Democratic Party increased its majority to 192 seats in the 300-seat unicameral parliament.\n\nYoon pledged to overhaul his administration after the election loss and work with parliament to advance structural reform for the labor, education, pension and medical systems. But one of his most pressing tasks might be trying to thwart plans from the Democratic Party for probes that could embarrass his government -- including one concerning the first lady.\n\nThe Democratic Party has sought legislation to start an investigation of Yoon's wife Kim Keon Hee after a secretly recorded video surfaced several months ago that purportedly showed her being gifted a luxury Dior handbag. Yoon and his wife have denied any wrongdoing and the president has said the presentation of the bag was a \"political maneuver.\"\n\nRead more: The Dior Bag Uproar That Shook South Korean Politics: QuickTake\n\nOn Tuesday, Yoon appointed a former prosecutor as the new senior secretary to the president for civil affairs, a post he had previously removed citing excessive power it could wield on government agencies, including the prosecutors' office. Yoon has said the move was aimed at better listening to public opinion, but the opposition criticized the appointment as an attempt to control prosecutors.\n\nPolicies being pushed by the Democratic Party include a 13 trillion won plan to extend cash handouts to households as a way to boost flagging consumer demand. Yoon has rejected the idea, saying it would spur inflation and strain the budget.\n\n\"The Democratic Party's priorities are the special counsel probes and the cash handouts,\" said Kim Jung, a political science professor at the University of North Korean Studies.\n\nThe election result all but derailed Yoon's plan to push through initiatives to benefit investors such as scuttling a capital gains tax, and it may have doomed his flagship policy of boosting stock valuations via the \"Corporate Value-Up\" program. Yoon took power after winning by a razor thin margin and has since seen his support fall to among the lowest for any South Korean president, reaching 23% in a weekly Gallup Korea tracking poll after the April election.\n\nThe president's main foreign policy initiatives include closer security cooperation with the US and Japan, and taking a tough line with North Korea. Even though the Democratic Party has favored rapprochement with Pyongyang and warming up relations with Beijing, it has little power in parliament to set a foreign policy agenda.\n\nYoon will soon face tests on the diplomatic front with Seoul set to host later this month the first three-way summit since 2019 among China, Japan and South Korea. There is also speculation he could have a summit in July with US President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida to build on their security cooperation.\n\n\"Unless North Korea changes course and respond to calls for talks or the Biden administration fails to win the next presidency, there's no reason for Yoon to change his foreign policy in the near future,\" political science

The government has tried various incentives to help entice families to have children, including a cash allowance for newborns that was raised to roughly $750 per month at the start of the year.\n\nThursday's press conference was Yoon's first since August 2022 and comes in the wake of a landslide loss by his ruling People Power Party in mid-term parliamentary elections last month.\n\nThe opposition Democratic Party claimed 175 out of 300 seats in the National Assembly, holding onto a majority that will impede the conservative Yoon's agenda for the remaining three years of his mandatory single five-year term.\n\nYoon vowed Thursday to improve communication with the public across the remainder of his term.\n\n\"In the next three years, my government and I will listen to the voices of the people and take care of the people's livelihood more carefully,\" he said.\n\nThe former prosecutor laid out his policy agenda, including boosting private-sector economic growth and increasing pensions for senior citizens, while touting his administration's strengthened relationships with the United States and Japan.\n\nYoon also addressed the highly publicized scandal around First Lady Kim Keon Hee accepting the gift of a Dior bag, which has simmered for months and was seen as a factor in his party's defeat at the mid-term polls.\n\n\"I apologize for causing concern to

Korea vows strong Ukraine ties, smooth Russia relations", "body": "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said Thursday that Seoul would keep strong ties with Ukraine and a \"smooth\" relationship with Russia, while ruling out direct weapon shipments to Kyiv.\n\nAs a major arms exporter, Seoul has long been asked by US and European allies to do more to help Kyiv, with speculation that South Korea would change longstanding policy due to North Korea's alleged arms transfers to Russia for use in Ukraine.\n\nBut Yoon told reporters it was his \"firm stance\" not to provide lethal weapons to countries in conflict.\n\nYoon said his country was doing its \"best to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, in accordance with the spirit of the constitution\".\n\nYoon said his country's ties with Moscow had been strained by what Seoul and ally Washington say are arms shipments from North Korea to Russia.\n\n\"North Korea's export of offensive weapons not only supports the illegal waging of war in relation to Ukraine, but also clearly violates UN Security Council sanctions resolutions related to North Korea's nuclear weapons,\" Yoon said.\n\nDespite tensions with Moscow over the purported arms shipments, Yoon said he would work with Russia.\n\n\"Russia is a country with which we have had a good relationship for a long time,\" he said.\n\n\"Due to the recent war with Ukraine, we have different positions regarding the introduction of weapons from North Korea,\" he added.\n\n\"As for our relationship with Russia, we will cooperate on a case-by-case basis, and we may oppose or be wary depending on differences in position, but we will manage our relationship with Russia as smoothly as possible.\"\n\nSeoul has long sought to join the ranks of the world's top arms exporters -- aiming to be the fourth largest, behind the United States, Russia and France -- something that is now possible, industry research indicates.\n\nIt has also sold artillery shells to Washington -- but with a \"final user\" agreement in place meaning only the United States can use the munitions.\n\nExperts have said this allows the United States to then provide their own shells to Kyiv.\n\n- Birthrate ministry -\n\nSpeaking at his first press conference in nearly two years, the president, whose party suffered a drubbing in legislative elections last month, also unveiled plans to create a new ministry to deal with the country's sharply declining birthrate.\n\nYoon, whose party does not control the country's parliament, said he would ask lawmakers to cooperate \"to set up the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter Planning\", he said in a live address to the nation.\n\nSouth Korea's birth rate fell to a record low last year, official data shows, despite having poured billions of dollars into efforts to encourage women to have more children and maintain population stability.\n\nThe country's fertility rate -- the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime -- dropped to 0.72 in 2023, down nearly eight percent from 2022, according to preliminary data from Statistics Korea in February.\n\nThat is far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain the current population of 51 million, which at these rates will nearly halve by the year 2100, experts estimate.\n\nAt the rare press conference, the president also issued an apology for what he called the \"unwise conduct\" of his wife, first lady Kim Keon Hee, after hidden camera footage last year appeared to show her accepting a luxury handbag in violation of government ethics rules.\n\nSouth Korea's political opposition dismissed the president's press conference, held to mark his second year in office, as being \"filled with self-praise\".\n\nThe president \"still has no clue as to why nearly 70 percent of the public disapprove of his governing style,\" the spokesman of the Democratic party Han Min-soo said, referring to Yoon's approval ratings, which have typically hovered around 30 percent.\n\nceb-kjk-hs/cwl\n\nMore from this section\n\nNew Insurance Lead Generation Company Increases Online Visibility for Niche Insurance Agencies and Carriers IMG Travel

Kim received a Christian Dior handbag as a gift from a Korean American pastor in September 2022, first reported on Nov. 29 by a liberal YouTube news channel, sparking public backlash.\n\nAt the same time, Yoon drew a line on a special counsel probe into another allegation that the first lady was involved in a stock price manipulation case, calling it inappropriate and politically motivated.\n\nHe said another independent investigation into the allegations is \"truly a political offensive\" and \"a political act that does not fit the essence or purpose of the special probes and is not intended to reveal the truth.\"\n\nThis marks the president's first such formal media encounter in 21 months, following a press conference to mark his first 100 days in office.\n\nAt 10 a.m. Yoon first gave a 20-minute video address to the nation from his office on his accomplishments over the past two years and future policy plans for the remainder of his five-year term.\n\nThen, he took questions from the press in a rare and lengthy question and answer session with journalists, which covered political, foreign affairs and security, economic and social matters.\n\nYoon also addressed the conservative People Power Party's (PPP) crushing defeat in last month's general election, with its rival Democratic Party (DP) securing a majority in the National Assembly again.\n\nHe said he has been ruminating over what he had been lacking, when asked about the April 10 election defeat, and said, \"In the end, no matter how hard we tried to improve people's livelihoods, there was a lack of tangible change for the people.\"\n\n\"I think there was a lot of lack of communication and explanation to the people about things like government policies,\" Yoon said. \"In the future, I will communicate more frequently with the media, and through the press explain to the people and seek their understanding to address our insufficiencies and shortcomings.\"\n\nThe last official presidential press conference was held on Aug. 17, 2022, marking Yoon's first 100 days in office.\n\nBY SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com",

His proposals sparked a surge in shares of South Korean companies specialising in baby products and services.\n\nHowever, Yoon faces significant challenges in advancing his agenda, given the strengthened position of the opposition bloc following recent elections. Despite acknowledging his government's shortcomings, Yoon expressed optimism about the economy's future trajectory.\n\nThe president highlighted the importance of strengthening ties with the United States and Japan to bolster regional security amid threats from North Korea. Yoon emphasized his commitment to cooperation while addressing concerns about arms shipments from North Korea to Russia, straining relations with Moscow.\n\nYoon's efforts to revitalize the economy and pursue diplomatic initiatives, including hosting a three-way summit with China and Japan, demonstrate his determination to navigate complex geopolitical dynamics and revamp his administration's image.\n\nAs Yoon seeks to overcome domestic and international challenges, his administration's response to economic and diplomatic imperatives will shape South Korea's trajectory in the coming months.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_South_Korea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of South Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_(meeting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summit (meeting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Korean", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Korean", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-2024-05-09T130730.543-2024-05-ce6fda1cfe811cca6bbf2097190ef987.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5450980392156863, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Security Council sanctions resolutions related to North Korea's nuclear weapons,\" Yoon said.\n\nDespite tensions with Moscow over the purported arms shipments, Yoon said he would work with Russia.\n\n\"Russia is a country with which we have had a good relationship for a long time,\" he said.\n\n\"Due to the recent war with Ukraine, we have different positions regarding the introduction of weapons from North Korea,\" he added.\n\n\"As for our relationship with Russia, we will cooperate on a case-by-case basis, and we may oppose or be wary depending on differences in position, but we will manage our relationship with Russia as smoothly as possible.\"\n\nSeoul has long sought to join the ranks of the world's top arms exporters -- aiming to be the fourth largest, behind the United States, Russia and France -- something that is now possible, industry research indicates.\n\nIt has also sold artillery shells to Washington -- but with a \"final user\" agreement in place meaning only the United States can use the munitions.\n\nExperts have said this allows the United States to then provide their own shells to Kiev.\n\nBirthrate ministry\n\nSpeaking at his first press conference in nearly two years, the president, whose party suffered a drubbing in legislative elections last month, also unveiled plans to create a new ministry to deal with the country's sharply declining birthrate.\n\nYoon, whose party does not control the country's parliament, said he would ask lawmakers to cooperate \"to set up the Ministry of Low Birth Rate Counter Planning\", he said in a live address to the nation.\n\nSouth Korea's birth rate fell to a record low last year, official data shows, despite having poured billions of dollars into efforts to encourage women to have more children and maintain population stability.\n\nThe country's fertility rate -- the number of children a woman is expected to have in her lifetime -- dropped to 0.72 in 2023, down nearly eight percent from 2022, according to preliminary data from Statistics Korea in February.\n\nThat is far below the 2.1 children needed to maintain the current population of 51 million, which at these rates will nearly halve by the year 2100, experts estimate.\n\nAt the rare press conference, the president also issued an apology for what he called the \"unwise conduct\" of his wife, first lady Kim Keon Hee, after hidden camera footage last year appeared to show her accepting a luxury handbag in violation of government ethics rules.\n\nSouth Korea's political opposition dismissed the president's press conference, held to mark his second year in office, as being \"filled with self-praise\".\n\nThe president \"still has no clue as to why nearly 70 percent of the public disapprove of his governing style,\" the spokesman of the Democratic party Han Min-soo said, referring to Yoon's approval ratings, which have typically hovered around 30 percent.", "source": {"uri": "hurriyetdailynews.com",

Yoon also took a few questions from journalists on April 22, after holding two unexpected press encounters that day to personally announce his new chief of staff and senior secretary for political affairs.\n\nYoon plans to receive as many questions as possible in Thursday's conference without any restrictions on topics, a presidential official said Monday.\n\nThe official said that this is a part of the president's plans to expand communication with the media and \"explain in detail what the public wants to know and clarify any misunderstandings.\"\n\nBY SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Power_Party_(South_Korea)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "People Power Party (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Soo-kyung_(weightlifter)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kim Soo-kyung (weightlifter)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongsan_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yongsan District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yongsan District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(Luxembourg)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (Luxembourg)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(South_Korea)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supermajority"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chosun_Ilbo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Chosun Ilbo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Korean Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munhwa_Broadcasting_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public broadcasting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/data/photo/2024/05/06/56573f98-5e1d-4d4d-ba2c-193b9b4b4322.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 2054, "textEnd": 2062}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-08-", "textStart": 1025, "textEnd": 1032}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

AFP-Yonhap\n\n2 years in office, Yoon begins to see limits of overly US-aligned diplomatic strategyBy Lee Hyo-jin\n\nIn his first two years in office, President Yoon Suk Yeol focused on aligning with like-minded allies, such as the United States and Japan, to address security challenges posed by its nuclear-armed northern neighbor.\n\nCharacterizing its strategy as \"values-based diplomacy,\" the government worked hard to upgrade its security-focused alliance with the U.S. into the Global Comprehensive Strategic Alliance, while restoring diplomatic relations with Japan that had been strained for several years, a period of progress that has paved the way for a strengthened trilateral partnership between Seoul, Washington and Tokyo.\n\nHowever, this strategy has encountered a certain degree of pushback from other neighboring countries, in particular, China and Russia.\n\nBilateral relations with China faltered, while those with Russia arguably reached their lowest point since the establishment of diplomatic ties in 1990.\n\nThe Kim Jong-un regime, now backed by Moscow, responded with intensified aggression to the Seoul-Washington-Japan triliteral cooperation grouping. At the beginning of this year, the North singled out South Korea as its No. 1 enemy state and made it clear that the regime would no longer pursue reconciliation with South Korea.\n\n\"In essence, the past two years have seen the Yoon administration readjusting relations with the U.S., China and North Korea, abandoning the strategies implemented by the previous Moon Jae-in government that Yoon seems to have deemed as problematic,\" said Cho Han-bum, a senior research fellow at the state-run Korea Institute for National Unification.\n\n\"It is too early to determine whether this strategy is a success or not, but the next three years will be decisive in addressing the remaining tasks,\" he added.\n\nKim Heung-kyu, head of the U.S-China Policy Institute at Ajou University, pointed to bolstered trilateral cooperation with the U.S. and Japan as an achievement of Yoon's foreign policies. However, he questioned whether the government was ready to deal with the associated costs.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Chinese President Xi Jinping talk during their meeting on the sidelines of the Belt and Road Forum in Beijing, China in this Oct. 17, 2023 photo. AP-Yonhap\n\n\"It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that the Yoon administration is one of the most pro-American governments South Korea has ever seen,\" Kim said.\n\n\"Aligning with Washington could have been a successful strategy in the past when the U.S.-led world order held sway. However, in today's complex and multi-faceted international landscape, adopting an overtly pro-American stance entails greater costs.\"\n\nBusan's failed bid for the World Expo in 2030 last year underscored the limitations of the Yoon administration's diplomatic strategy based on the \"democracy versus authoritarianism\" narrative, Kim said.\n\nDuring the Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) vote in November to pick the host city for the 2030 edition, Busan won only 29 votes out of a total of 165, marking a significant voting disparity with Saudi Arabia's Riyadh, which secured 119 votes.\n\nThis was a dismal result considering the vigorous campaign launched by government officials and business leaders, who traveled to dozens of nations to engage in diplomacy over the span of 500 days leading up to the vote.\n\n\"Not only were the results disappointing, but what's worse was the fact that until the voting day, our government believed Busan had a fair chance, showing the misguidance of the Yoon administration's diplomatic strategies,\" Kim said.\n\nIn that sense, observers suggested that the government make necessary realignments in its foreign policy during the next few years to come.\n\nIn particular, improving relations with Russia is becoming increasingly crucial as the friendly nation to North Korea could play a bigger role in matters concerning the Korean Peninsula. Also, normalizing ties with China, South Korea's nation's largest trade partner, remains essential for the nation's export-driven economy.\n\nHowever, Kim expressed skepticism about seeing any changes from the Yoon administration on diplomatic fronts, saying, \"The government still seems to believe that it's on the right track.\"\n\nFollowing the ruling People Power Party's crushing defeat in the April 10 parliamentary elections, during which it managed to secure just 108 seats out of the total 300, Yoon initiated a significant reshuffle of his senior aides, in an apparent effort to better heed public's concerns.\n\nNevertheless, National Security Adviser Chang Ho-jin still remains in his post, Kim pointed out, indicating the president's firm belief in his foreign policy strategy.\n\n\"The government should reconsider its inflexible approach to diplomacy. Rather than solely pursuing short-term gains, it should embrace long-term policy objectives, recognizing that major countries are employing dual-track diplomacy tactics amid the U.S.-China strategic rivalry,\" Kim said.\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol and U.S. President Joe Biden raise hands together at an official state dinner during Yoon's visit to the White House in Washington, April 26, 2023.

Korea Times photo by Seo Jae-hoon\n\nPresident seeks to dispel criticism over lack of communicationBy Jun Ji-hye\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol is set to present his stance on multiple politically contentious issues in a press conference at the presidential office, Thursday, on the eve of the second anniversary of his inauguration, his office said Monday.\n\nThis will be his second press conference, following the first one held on Aug. 17, 2022, where he marked his first 100 days in office. Since then, Yoon has primarily communicated through pre-recorded interviews or public addresses without taking questions from reporters.\n\nThe decision to hold this rare press conference is viewed as a clear attempt to address public criticism regarding Yoon's perceived lack of communication and uncompromising approach, which were identified as some of the reasons behind the ruling People Power Party's (PPP) crushing defeat in the April 10 general elections. On April 16, the president interpreted the election outcome as a public evaluation of his governance style, underscoring the importance of effective communication with the people.\n\nThe success or failure of the event will largely depend on how convincing Yoon's arguments are regarding multiple controversies, such as corruption allegations involving the first lady, Kim Keon Hee, and the government's alleged interference in an investigation into the death of a Marine.\n\nAdditionally, his ability to address key policy issues, including plans to increase medical school enrollment quotas, will be crucial in determining the event's outcome. The president's ability to provide clear and satisfactory explanations and demonstrate effective leadership in addressing these contentious issues will be critical to winning back public trust and confidence.\n\n\"President Yoon has expressed his willingness to increase communication with the public through the media,\" an official at the presidential office said. \"The press conference is aimed at giving detailed explanations about what the public wants to know as well as some misunderstanding.\"\n\nDuring the event, Yoon will discuss his administration's performance over the past two years and outline his plans for the next three years in an address to the public. He will then move to a press conference venue for a question-and-answer session covering a wide range of topics.\n\nProsecutors speed up investigation into first lady's acceptance of luxury bag 2024-05-06 16:37 | Law & Crime\n\nOne of the biggest issues is the special counsel bill aimed at unearthing the truth behind the government's alleged interference in the military's investigation into the death of Marine Cpl. Chae Su-geun during a flood rescue operation in July 2023.\n\nThe bill was railroaded last week by the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), which controls the National Assembly, despite protests from PPP members.\n\nYoon is expected to point to legal issues and other problems related to the special counsel bill -- as claimed by the ruling bloc -- in a bid to justify his anticipated veto of the bill.\n\nHe is also expected to mention allegations that the first lady was involved in manipulating stock prices of Deutsch Motors, a BMW car dealer in Korea, between 2009 and 2012. Kim is mired in another controversy that she received a Dior handbag from a Korean American pastor in 2022.\n\nAs the DPK is pushing for another special counsel probe into those two issues surrounding the first lady, Yoon is likely to maintain a cautious tone and emphasize that state prosecutors have already initiated investigations into these matters.\n\nWith regard to his controversial plan to increase the medical school enrollment quota, the president is expected to continue to assert the need to raise the number of doctors as part of his medical reform initiative, and urge striking physicians to stop collective action and engage in dialogue with the government.\n\nThe plan has provoked a nationwide walkout by more than 10,000 trainee doctors and consequent disruptions to medical services since February.\n\nThe press conference comes as Yoon's approval rating has consistently remained in the lower 30 percent range.\n\nHis approval rating stood at 30.3 percent, a slight rebound after falling for three consecutive weeks -- from 32.6 percent to 32.3 percent and 30.2 percent -- according to a survey conducted by the polling agency Realmeter and released on Monday.\n\nThe survey of 2,004 adults from April 29 to May 3 had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.\n\nRespondents who disapproved of his performance accounted for 65.5 percent of the total, down 1.4 percentage points from the previous week.", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

reporters that it was his \"firm stance\" not to provide lethal weapons to countries in conflict.\n\nYoon said his country was doing its \"best to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance,

for use in Ukraine.\n\n\"North Korea's export of offensive weapons not only supports the illegal waging of war in relation to Ukraine, but also clearly violates UN Security Council sanctions resolutions related to North Korea's nuclear weapons,\" Yoon said.\n\nBut despite tensions with Moscow over purported arms deals with North Korea, Yoon said he would work with Russia.\n\n\"Russia is a

now possible, industry research indicates.\n\nIt has also sold artillery shells to Washington -- but with a \"final user\" agreement in place meaning only the United States can use the munitions.\n\nExperts have said this allows the United States to then provide their own shells to Kyiv.\n\nHostilities in the 1950 to 1953 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, and

Increasing the number of doctors, meanwhile, was popular with the general public but fiercely resisted by doctors' groups, leading to major disruptions to health care services.\n\n\"I agree with the direction in which he ran state affairs, but there was a lot lacking in the process of gaining the people's consent,\" said Shin Yul, a professor of political science at Myongji University.\n\nThe lack of effective communication proved to be costly.\n\nOn April 10, exactly one month before the administration's two-year mark, the ruling People Power Party suffered a crushing defeat in the general elections. With only 108 seats won in the 300-member National Assembly, the PPP again yielded control of parliament to the main opposition Democratic Party, leaving Yoon to work with an opposition-controlled parliament for all five years of his term.\n\nYoon acknowledged the need to reset his running of state affairs.\n\n\"Although in the two years since my inauguration, I have looked only to the people and taken the path for our national interest, I fell short of the people's expectations,\" he said during a Cabinet meeting six days after the elections.\n\n\"I will communicate more with a humbler and more flexible attitude, and be the first to listen carefully to the public sentiment,\" he said.\n\nAmong other things, Yoon proposed a meeting with DP leader Lee Jae-myung at the presidential office, the first time he agreed to sit down for talks with the opposition leader since taking office.\n\nThe two held wide-ranging discussions, including on the DP's calls for a special counsel investigation into suspicions surrounding a Marine's death, but differed on almost every issue except for the need for medical reform.\n\nIn the days following the meeting, the ruling and opposition parties reached a compromise on a special bill mandating a new investigation into the 2022 Itaewon crowd crush that claimed 159 lives, a decision that was welcomed by the presidential office as the first fruit of the Yoon-Lee meeting.\n\nIn a sign of the difficulties that still lie ahead, however, the opposition-controlled National Assembly also passed a bill mandating a special counsel investigation into the military's response to the Marine's death, despite a boycott by the ruling party.\n\n\"Whether you like it or not, we're seeing a situation where the legislative authority and the executive authority have to be jointly responsible for the running of state affairs,\" Shin, the professor, said.\n\n\"Be it through another meeting between the president and the opposition leader, or through the formation of a consultative body involving the ruling and opposition parties and the government, they have to continue dialogue,\" he said. \"It's not a choice but a necessity.\"\n\nThe public's assessment of Yoon's job performance was shown not only in the election result but also in his low approval ratings throughout the last year.\n\nMost polls found Yoon's approval rating consistently hovering in the 30 percent range before it fell further to the 20 percent range after the elections.\n\nTo better gauge the public sentiment, Yoon revived the position of senior presidential secretary for civil affairs on Tuesday. On Thursday, he is set to hold his first press conference since August 2022.", "source": {"uri": "en.yna.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yonhap News Agency"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Yonhap\n\nOpposition condemns appointment as power grab over prosecutionBy Nam Hyun-woo\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol on Tuesday appointed former Vice Justice Minister Kim Joo-hyun as senior secretary for civil affairs, reinstating the position Yoon himself abolished when taking office two years ago.\n\nWhile the president claims that the re-establishment of the position is aimed at \"hearing public opinions,\" the opposition describes it as an attempt to maintain control over the prosecution, police, and other investigative functions of the government in order to shield himself and his family from potential \"legal risks.\"\n\n\"During a media interview in July 2021, I said that I would abolish the position of senior secretary for civil affairs,\" Yoon said during a briefing introducing Kim. \"I have maintained that stance until now, but the (presidential office's) function of gauging public sentiment is not working well, and I've received a lot of advice about that.\"\n\nThe role of senior secretary for civil affairs has traditionally been one of the most influential positions within the Korean presidential office. This role entails overseeing various government agencies, including the prosecution, police, the National Tax Service and others with investigative powers. The secretary is also responsible for legal affairs, anti-corruption efforts, and gathering information on public sentiment, thereby managing highly sensitive domestic political information.\n\nDue to the power of handling legal affairs, former presidents mostly appointed ex-prosecutors to the position, except for President Moon Jae-in who appointed then-Seoul National University professor Cho Kuk.\n\nSenior presidential secretary for civil affairs Kim Ju-hyun / Yonhap\n\nDuring the Moon administration, Yoon conducted an investigation into the Cho family's alleged academic document fabrications, defying instructions from the president to suspend the probe. The conflict propelled Yoon to political prominence among the conservatives, and he pledged to abolish the position which he described is \"too powerful.\"\n\nThe reinstatement came after the ruling People Power Party (PPP) suffered a crushing defeat in the April 10 general elections. After the loss, Yoon said he accepts criticism that the administration had failed to reflect public sentiment and vowed to listen to people's voices more attentively.\n\n\"There are reasons why previous administrations had this position, and there are opinions that the current administration's civil affairs initiatives are not functioning effectively,\" Yoon said, citing the example of former President Kim Dae-jung, who abolished the position, but revived it two years into his term.\n\nKim is a former prosecutor who served as vice justice minister in 2015. Until Tuesday, he was employed at the law firm Kim & Chang.\n\nAs rumors about his appointment emerged recently, critics argue that the president aims to maintain his grip on the prosecution, even after the election defeat, by appointing a former prosecutor to the position. Moreover, there is speculation that this move is an attempt to shield his wife, Kim Keon Hee, from allegations related to a stock manipulation scandal and the receipt of a luxury handbag from a pastor under questionable circumstances.\n\nRegarding such speculation, Yoon said, \"If there are any allegations against me, I believe it's my responsibility to address and resolve them personally. It shouldn't be the duty of the senior secretary.\"\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Prosecutor General Lee One-seok vowed on Tuesday that the ongoing investigation into the first lady's handbag scandal would be \"conducted swiftly and strictly based solely on evidence and legal principles.\"\n\nThose comments triggered speculation regarding how the prosecution will navigate its relationship with the new senior secretary.\n\nFormer senior presidential secretary for civil affairs Woo Byung-woo, center, exits the Seoul High Court in this Feb. 4, 2021 photo. Yonhap\n\nDespite the president's explanation that the new position was established \"for the people,\" the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) characterized Yoon's actions as \"making an excuse\" to exert control over the prosecution.\n\n\"The office of civil affairs senior secretary has historically been used to consolidate presidential power by exerting control over the prosecution and the police, and this will be the case again,\" DPK spokesperson Choi Min-seok said.\n\n\"Kim served as the vice minister of justice during the conservative Park Geun-hye administration, which orchestrated control over investigative institutions alongside then-senior secretary Woo Byung-woo. In the end, the appointment obviously shows that Yoon seeks to strengthen his grip on investigative institutions following the election defeat.\"\n\nWoo was the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs under former President Park Geun-hye, who was impeached amid a corruption scandal. Woo resigned due to negligence in preventing Park's wrongdoings. He subsequently served over a year in prison for illegally investigating liberal figures.\n\nYoon was one of the prosecutors who spearheaded investigations into Woo. However, the president pardoned and reinstated him in 2023.\n\nThe minor progressive Rebuilding Korea Party, which is led by Cho, the former senior secretary, said in a commentary: \"Who will believe (Yoon's) comments that he will hear the public voice through a former prosecutor? ... it will only make way for the Yoon administration to control the prosecution the same way Woo Byung-woo did.\"", "source": {"uri": "koreatimes.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Dae-jung", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kim Dae-jung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yonhap News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Tax_Service_(South_Korea)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Tax Service (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Power_Party_(South_Korea)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "People Power Party (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Presidential_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senior Presidential Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yongsan_District", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yongsan District"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yongsan District"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Korean language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_&_Chang", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kim & Chang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cho_Kuk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cho Kuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anti-corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Korea", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party of Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Jae-in", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon Jae-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Chung_Hee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Park Chung Hee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Geun-hye", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Park Geun-hye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market manipulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/thumbnailV2/7ecd809cf09b4f20ba06b5b9df2e7875.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 2362, "textEnd": 2370}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

President Yoon Suk-yeol is scheduled to give his first press conference in 21 months here on May 9, 2024. (Yonhap)\n\nWill there be a change in how the country is being run, or will we see the same unilateral approach?\n\nAt 10 am on Thursday, President Yoon Suk-yeol of South Korea will hold a press conference to elaborate on his positions regarding various issues and policies. This press conference, coming on the eve of the two-year anniversary of Yoon being sworn into office, will be the first such press availability by the president since August 2022, when he held a press conference to commemorate his first 100 days in office.\n\nIn a press briefing on Monday, presidential spokesperson Kim Soo-kyung announced that Yoon would use the opportunity to \"expound on his governance throughout the past two years as well as the policies he will pursue going forward.\"\n\nThe upcoming press conference by the president will be a litmus test for determining how Yoon and his administration have interpreted the People Power Party's defeat in the recent general elections. On April 27, 2022, the presidential transition committee announced that it would base its governance on \"fairness, common sense, the national interest and pragmatism,\" while saying the incoming Yoon administration would \"approach all policies and national issues from the perspective of pragmatism and the national interest.\"\n\n\"Statecraft will be based not on ideology but on common sense and the interests of the majority of the Korean people. We will stand firm in the rule of law before which all are equal. We will not tolerate special interests or any violations from those in positions of privilege,\" the transition team said at the time.\n\nYet throughout the past two years of Yoon's administration, these principles seem to have vanished -- or at least been selectively applied. This has sowed seeds of distrust among the public. Many see the current administration as having taken Korea backward rather than pushing it forward.\n\nIn particular, the claims of \"fairness and common sense\" evaporated when it came to Yoon exercising his power to shield his wife from investigation and prosecution. He vetoed a bill that would assign a special prosecutor to investigate allegations that the first lady was involved in stock manipulation in Deutsch Motors. He also blocked an investigation into the first lady receiving a luxury handbag from a pastor, which he claims she begrudgingly accepted because she didn't want to be \"cold-hearted.\"\n\nHe then appointed former Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup as the ambassador to Australia while Lee was under investigation for alleged involvement in government interference in an investigation regarding the death of a Marine who died during a flood rescue mission in 2023. Many would question whether this is in line with the \"rule of law before which all are equal.\"\n\nYoon has been caught on tape using coarse language when talking about US President Joe Biden. He also refused to offer a proper apology regarding the government's blundering response to the Itaewon crowd crush. \"Common sense\" and governance geared toward the \"majority of the Korean people\" did not appear to apply here.\n\nHeavy-handed investigations into news outlets and reporters who raised suspicions surrounding government personnel appointments caused South Korea to drop 15 places in the Reporters Without Borders' annual world press freedom index, from 47th place in 2023 to 62nd in 2024.\n\nThe administration's pursuit of national interests and practicality has also been subsumed by ideology-based diplomacy and a slipshod maintenance of national affairs. For the past two years, a diplomacy that deepened the rift between two camps -- South Korea, the US and Japan on one side and North Korea, China and Russia on the other -- has heightened tensions on and around the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe administration has touted the improvement in South Korea-Japan relations as a legacy achievement, but its third-party compensation for victims of forced labor during Japanese colonial rule or the dumping of radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant into the ocean suggest that such actions were not made for the sake of national interest, but in order to absolve Japan of any and all blame for past historical wrongs.\n\nPolicies that were ordered without any prior preparation or game plans, such as the lowering of school entry age to 5 in his first year of office, the order to eliminate so-called \"killer questions\" in the College Scholastic Ability Test in June 2023, and the expansion in medical school admissions seats, have done nothing but push the public into chaos.\n\nWhile he insists on tax cuts for the wealthy and fiscal soundness, there is no clear solution to alleviating the cost-of-living crisis weighing on a public that is frantically trying to get by while facing high living expenses and interest rates.\n\nIn the end, whether or not Yoon is open to change is likely to determine whether we'll see a change in the way that national affairs are run in his remaining time in office.\n\nLee Kwan-hu, a politics professor at Konkuk University's Sang-huh College, said, \"It's important for the president to demonstrate change by empathizing with the public, actively working with the opposition party, and changing how he acts when running the country.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.hani.co.kr",

ruling out direct weapon shipments to Kyiv.\n\nAs a major arms exporter, Seoul has long been asked by US and European allies to do more to help Kyiv.\n\nFor all the latest headlines follow our Google News channel online or via the app.\n\nBut Yoon told reporters that it was his \"firm stance\" not to provide lethal weapons to countries in conflict.\n\nYoon said his country was doing its \"best to provide humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, in accordance with the spirit of the constitution.\"\n\nYoon said his country's ties with Moscow had been strained by what Seoul and ally Washington say are arms shipments from North Korea to Russia, for use in Ukraine.\n\n\"North Korea's export of offensive weapons not only supports the illegal waging of war in relation to Ukraine, but also clearly violates UN Security Council sanctions resolutions related to North Korea's nuclear weapons,\" Yoon said.\n\nBut despite tensions with Moscow over purported arms deals with North Korea, Yoon said he would work with Russia.\n\n\"Russia is a country with which we have had a good relationship for a long time,\" he said.\n\n\"Due to the recent war with Ukraine, we have different positions regarding the introduction of weapons to North Korea,\" he added.\n\n\"As for our relationship with Russia, we will cooperate on a case-by-case basis, and we may oppose or be wary depending on differences in position, but we will manage our relationship with Russia as smoothly as possible.\"\n\nHe declined to answer a question as to what he would consider a \"red line\" for Seoul to review its non-lethal weapons policy on Ukraine.\n\nSeoul has long harboured ambitions to join the ranks of the world's top arms exporters -- aiming to be the fourth largest, behind the United States, Russia and France -- something that is now possible, industry research indicates.\n\nIt has also sold artillery shells to Washington -- but with a \"final user\" agreement in place meaning only the United States can use the munitions.\n\nExperts have said this allows the United States to then provide their own shells to Kyiv.\n\nHostilities in the 1950 to 1953 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty, and Seoul remains technically at war with nuclear-armed Pyongyang.\n\nRead more:\n\nRussian court says US soldier charged with theft causing 'significant' damage\n\nKim Jong Un mourns

North.\"\n\n\"We will continue to manage our relations with Russia on a case-by-case basis, in a way that we can cooperate on issues where we agree and may oppose or be wary on issues depending on difference in position,\" Yoon told reporters at a news conference in Seoul.\n\n\"But we will manage our relationship with Russia as smoothly as possible and we can pursue economic cooperation and common interests together,\" said the South Korean president in comments on relations with Russia.\n\nMoscow and Pyongyang have strengthened ties in recent months with Kim Jong-un paying a state visit to Russia last year.\n\nWhile Moscow is said to have helped Pyongyang in its space missions, the US and its allies accused Pyongyang of supplying ammunition to Russia which it used against Ukraine.\n\nOn Kyiv, Yoon said South Korea was \"doing its best\" to provide humanitarian and reconstruction aid to the war-torn country \"but will adhere to its policy of not providing offensive, lethal weapons to any nation, including Ukraine,\" Seoul-based Yonhap News reported.\n\n\"North Korea's export of offensive weapons not only supports the illegal waging of war in relation to Ukraine but also clearly violates UN Security Council sanctions resolutions related to North Korea's nuclear weapons,\" Yoon added. -", "source": {"uri": "en.haberler.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

As part of a major policy push, Yoon also said a new government ministry would be created to address the country's record low birth rate and fast-ageing society.\n\n\"We will utilise all available national capabilities to overcome the low birth rate, which can only be said to be a national emergency,\" he said in opening remarks delivered from his office, behind a plaque which read \"The Buck Stops Here.\" Yoon's comments in his first news conference in 21 months come after the heavy defeat of his People Power Party in an April 10 vote, which prompted calls for a change in his leadership style and policy direction to salvage a presidency not yet at the halfway point.\n\n\"I think it reflects the public's evaluation of my administration's work is far short of what is needed,\" Yoon said when asked about his People Power Party's election defeat. Yoon, who won the presidency in 2022 by a margin of less than one percentage point, has seen his support ratings plunge to a low of 21% in one public opinion poll.\n\nHe has pledged to communicate better with the public and parliament, as some analysts warned that the poll outcome meant he had already slipped into lame duck status. The president pushed back on opposition parties' demand for a special prosecutor to investigate alleged improper conduct by the first lady, who was captured in a video that became public in November accepting a pricey bag as a gift in 2022.\n\nWhile First Lady Kim Keon Hee's behaviour had been unwise, the call by the opposition was a political attack, he said. The first lady has not been seen in public since Dec. 15, reflecting a view by some analysts and even some members of Yoon's party that she has become a political liability for the president and his PPP.\n\nThe creation of the ministry to address a fast declining and ageing population comes after the country's fertility rate, already the world's lowest, continued its dramatic decline in 2023, as women concerned about career advancement and the financial cost of raising children decided to delay childbirth or to not have babies. The average number of expected babies for a South Korean woman during her reproductive life fell to a record low of 0.72 from 0.78 in 2022, data from Statistics Korea showed.\n\nThat is far below the rate of 2.1 per woman needed for a steady population and the rate of 1.24 in 2015 when concerns about issues such as housing and education costs were lower.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Power_Party_(South_Korea)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "People Power Party (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Birth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_South_Korea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of South Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lame_duck_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lame duck (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentage_point", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Percentage point"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics_Korea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statistics Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_fertility_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Total fertility rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ageing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Population ageing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_of_raising_a_child", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cost of raising a child"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childbirth", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Childbirth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_16_57_55_697089.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 771, "textEnd": 779}, {"amb": false, "date": "-12-15", "textStart": 1837, "textEnd": 1844}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

President Yoon Suk Yeol will hold a press conference, Thursday, to commemorate the second anniversary of his inauguration that falls on Friday. Yonhap\n\nReform initiatives in labor, education, pension go adrift without outcomesBy Nam Hyun-woo\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol will mark the second anniversary of his inauguration on Friday, but the presidential office seems to be devoid of any celebratory mood, with Yoon's top initiatives of reforming Korea's labor, education and pension largely stalling amid ongoing partisan conflicts.\n\nAwaiting Yoon is a challenging political landscape for the remaining three years of his presidency, as opposition parties will hold 192 out of 300 seats in the 22nd National Assembly, set to convene later this month.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the president is advised to start by clarifying his political agenda and policy direction and subsequently begin talks with the opposition to prevent the country from wasting three more years in an unproductive political stalemate.\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol listens to Angolan President Joao Lourenco, not pictured, during their summit at the presidential office in central Seoul's Yongsan District, April 30. Joint Press Corps\n\nSince his inauguration in May 2022, Yoon has been stressing his reform initiative in the country's labor, education and pension systems, labeling them as \"the three major reforms.\"\n\nThe president said in his administration's first address at the National Assembly right after taking office that the three reforms are tasks which can no longer be postponed. He reiterated that message in his New Year addresses of last year and this year.\n\nDespite Yoon's push for the reform initiatives, experts are saying there have been no tangible outcomes so far, mostly because they started off without setting clear objectives.\n\nA student prepares to take the College Scholastic Ability Test at a high school in central Seoul's Yongsan District, Nov. 16. Joint Press Corps\n\nUnder the goal of setting up a sustainable and future-oriented labor market, Yoon attempted to extend the maximum workweek to 69 hours in March last year, but ended up facing strong opposition from not only civic groups but also the general public.\n\nAfter stirring controversy, related debates have lost traction, and in November, the government ultimately decided to maintain the current 52-hour workweek and add complementary measures.\n\nIn education, Yoon caused controversy in June after saying that the country's College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) should not contain extremely difficult questions most test-sitters could not solve on their own, in order to be fairer for students who cannot attend expensive cram schools. Additionally, the government launched tax audits on large cram schools later that month.\n\nHowever, the actual test in November was widely assessed as one of the most difficult CSATs in the country's history, and media interviews revealed that most of the top scorers had attended expensive cram schools.\n\nMedical students and professors of Pusan National University hold banners at the school's main building in Busan, Tuesday, to oppose the university's plan to expand the admissions quota of its medical school in line with the government's policy to increase the number of doctors in Korea. Yonhap\n\nThe pension reform effort is even criticized as being negligent. The government asked the Assembly to form a committee to debate and formulate a reform plan for the national pension.\n\nThe committee members initially narrowed their differences in the way of paying less premiums and receiving more compensation, but failed to reach an agreement on Tuesday after the ruling People Power Party (PPP) echoed the government's concerns over sustainability.\n\nDuring a meeting with main opposition Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) Chairman Rep. Lee Jae-myung, Yoon said that the pension reform should be discussed more in the next Assembly.\n\nStarting this year, Yoon added medical reform to his list, pushing his policy of increasing the number of doctors in the country by expanding the admissions quota of medical schools, despite a nationwide walkout by junior doctors and subsequent disruptions in major teaching hospitals' medical services.\n\n\"The fundamental problem is that the president is engaging in those reforms without setting up a clear agenda or policy directions with which he wants to guide the nation,\" said Ha Shang-eung, a politics professor at Sogang University.\n\n\"It is difficult to understand what the president wants and what the benefits of his reform push are.\"\n\nPrime Minister Han Duck-soo bangs the gavel during a Cabinet meeting at the Government Complex Seoul, Jan. 30, during which the government vetoed a special act on launching a special counsel to investigate the 2022 Itaewon crowd crush. Korea Times photo by Choi Joo-yeon\n\nWhile the reform initiatives have gone adrift, partisan conflicts worsened, leading the president and his staff to concentrate on countering the opposition's political offensives, rather than addressing state affairs related to people's livelihoods.\n\nIn doing so, Yoon refused to communicate with the opposition, rejecting nine bills that passed the Assembly upon the DPK's endorsement, including a nursing act in May last year and a pro-labor bill limiting companies from making damage claims against legitimate labor union disputes in December.\n\nIn January, Yoon also exercised his veto power on a bill launching a special counsel to look into first lady Kim Keon Hee's alleged involvement in a stock manipulation scandal and another to investigate the Itaewon crowd crush, which resulted in the deaths of 159 people in Seoul's Itaewon area in October 2022.\n\nWhile threatening to propose those bills again in the next Assembly, the DPK is now urging Yoon to accept a special counsel probe into the government's alleged interference in the military's investigation into the death of a Marine during a rescue operation. Marine Cpl. Chae Su-geun died in a flash flood during a search and rescue operation around a flooded stream last July.\n\nAmid the partisan conflict, the PPP suffered a crushing defeat in the April 10 general elections, securing only 108 seats in the 300-member Assembly, a result that forced Yoon to promise that he will change his political philosophy and way of running the government.\n\nWith the opposition bloc set to extend its legislative control for the next four years, political analysts are already casting a skeptical outlook over Yoon's ability to come up new policy tasks, and they suggest the president will have to find ways to cooperate with the opposition.\n\nWhile the opposition is increasing its pressure on Yoon, his grip on the ruling party is also waning, as its lawmakers-elect openly opposed a Yoon loyalist's bid to run for the PPP's floor leader post.\n\nYoon's press conference scheduled for Thursday is gaining attention as it could serve as a barometer showing how Yoon will handle state affairs in the future.\n\n\"There's no need to elaborate further on the importance of cooperation with the opposition,\" Ha said. \"However, before such cooperation can occur, he should clearly outline his political agenda and policy direction, so that the opposition can understand his objectives and work toward finding common ground through compromises.\"",

the post.\n\nKim Joo-hyun, a former prosecutor who served as vice justice minister in 2015, has been named senior secretary for civil affairs, Yoon told reporters at the presidential office.\n\nThe position, which had dealt with legal and anti-corruption issues, was abolished when Yoon took office two years ago amid accusations it was used to meddle in investigations by the prosecution and the police.\n\n\"The function of listening to the public sentiment has been too weak,\" Yoon said when asked why he decided to revive the office. \"There's a reason why all administrations do it, and because they said the civil affairs work was not functioning properly, I thought hard about it and decided it would be good to restore it.\"\n\nYoon cited the example of former President Kim Dae-jung, who abolished the office of the senior secretary for civil affairs before reviving it two years into his term.\n\nThe appointment is the latest measure Yoon has taken to reset his running of state affairs following the ruling party's crushing defeat in the April 10 parliamentary elections.\n\nLast week, he replaced his chief of staff and senior secretary for political affairs.\n\nWhen asked to address suspicions the new office could be used to control investigation agencies and respond to his own legal issues -- an apparent reference to allegations surrounding first lady Kim Keon Hee -- Yoon said the office was established \"for the people.\"\n\n\"If there are things raised against me, that would be for me to explain and resolve, not the job of the senior secretary for civil affairs,\" he said.\n\nKim, the new secretary, told reporters afterward that his office will oversee the secretary for civil affairs, a position to be newly established, as well as the offices of the secretary for civil service discipline and the secretary for legal affairs, which will be transferred from under the presidential chief of staff.\n\n\"I will listen to the candid public sentiment and

Yonhap\n\nPresident says medical reform cannot be postponed any longerBy Jun Ji-hye\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol said, Thursday, that he will create a new ministry dedicated to addressing the country's low birthrate and aging population, vowing to focus all possible capabilities on overcoming drastic changes in the demographic picture.\n\nHe said a deputy prime minister will lead the new ministry to set the unprecedentedly low birthrate as a state priority and formulate policies encompassing all related matters such as education, labor and welfare.\n\n\"I will mobilize all possible measures to overcome the low birthrate, as the issue amounts to a state of national emergency,\" Yoon said during a press conference marking the second anniversary of his presidency.\n\n\"The government will work to let people take maternity and child care leave more freely and sufficiently. We will expand support for companies to reduce their financial burden caused by these employees' leave.\"\n\nYoon asked the opposition parties, which control the National Assembly, to cooperate in revising the Government Organization Act for the establishment of the new ministry.\n\nSo far, matters involving the low birthrate have been handled by the Ministry of Health and Welfare and the Presidential Committee on Ageing Society and Population Policy. However, neither of them has managed to achieve a breakthrough in alleviating the country's demographic crisis.\n\nKorea is battling the world's lowest birthrate, being the only country to have its total fertility rate below 1 among the 38 OECD members as of 2021.\n\nYoon addresses wife's allegations, livelihood issues in somber, apologetic tone 2024-05-09 10:22 | Politics\n\nData by Statistics Korea showed that Korea's total fertility rate, which means the average number of expected births from a woman in her lifetime, hit 0.72 in 2023, down from the previous record low of 0.78 in the previous year.\n\nIn the October-December period in 2023, the rate fell to an all-time quarterly low of 0.65.\n\nAmid the falling birthrate, Statistics Korea estimated that the country's population would decrease to 36.22 million in 2072 from 51.44 million in 2023, and that more than half of the population would be aged 60 or older.\n\nRival parties appeared to both recognize the need to establish the new ministry overseeing the demographic crisis, as both the ruling People Power Party and the main opposition Democratic Party of Korea presented similar pledges during the lead-up to the April 10 general elections.\n\nMedical professionals walk down a hallway of a major hospital in Seoul, Thursday. Yonhap\n\nDuring his press conference, President Yoon stressed that his administration's medical reform initiatives, which include the controversial plan to increase the medical school admissions quota starting next year, was another effort to cope with the low birthrate.\n\n\"The medical reform plans, including the medical school quota hike, cannot be postponed any longer, considering an explosive increase in demand for health care services,\" Yoon said.\n\n\"The country needs better systems for essential medical treatment fields as well as for underserved areas, as many parents face difficulties seeing doctors when their children are sick.\"\n\nThe president made it clear, once again, that the government will continue to push for the medical reform policies despite fierce protests from doctors.\n\nSince February, over 90 percent of the country's 13,000 trainee doctors have been protesting the government's plan to increase the number of medical school seats by 2,000 for next year, claiming such a drastic hike will compromise medical education and training.\n\nThe Yoon administration has asked the doctors' community to present their unified measure regarding the range of the hike and engage in dialogue, but doctors have stuck to a position that the government should withdraw the plan and go back to square one.\n\n\"The refusal of the doctors' community to produce the unified measure has been a key sticking point for the dialogue to proceed,\" Yoon said. \"Consulting with doctors has been very difficult, but we cannot postpone it forever.\"", "source": {"uri":

Voter turnout was 67 per cent, the highest in over three decades.\n\nThe opposition is already making use of its majority, forcing a bill through parliament last week that aims to shed light on the death of Lance Corporal Chae Soo-geun, 20, who drowned during a search for flood victims in July last year.\n\nMembers of the opposition and Yoon\u2019s critics accused the presidential office of intervening in a military investigation into the death.\n\n\u201cIf the allegations turn out to be true, the president could be subject to impeachment for abuse of power,\u201d said Jhee Byong-kuen, a political-science professor at Chosun University in Gwangju.\n\nYoon is expected to veto the bill, citing the ongoing police investigation, and argue that the call for an investigation is politically motivated.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s media conference, Yoon will also face questions about his wife Kim Keon-hee, who has been accused of tax evasion and stock-price manipulation.\n\nKim has been keeping a low profile in recent months after a clip surfaced in November last year seemingly showing her receiving a Dior handbag worth about 3 million won (US$2,180) from a pastor in 2022.\n\nSouth Korean law prohibits the spouse of a public official from accepting gifts worth more than 1 million won (US$727) in a single instance, or that exceed a total value of 3 million won over one year. Those found guilty of violating the anti-corruption law can be sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison and fined up to 30 million won.\n\nYoon faced a backlash earlier this year after he seemed to defend his wife\u2019s actions, saying she could not \u201ccold-heartedly\u201d reject the gift \u2013 calling the interaction \u201cregrettable\u201d.\n\nThe president\u2019s recent adoption of a more muted tone was seen as a positive by Professor Jhee, however, who saw it as an attempt by Yoon \u201cto change his communication style to heed people\u2019s voices expressed through the election\u201d.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s press conference, Yoon is also expected to address the extended doctors\u2019 strike that has forced hospitals to cancel essential treatments and surgeries, and crippled the healthcare sector.\n\nThe walkout by thousands of trainee doctors began in response to a plan to boost annual admissions to medical schools by 2,000 from next year.\n\nThe government says the plan will ease doctor shortages in South Korea\u2019s ageing society, but medical professionals and trainees say it will erode the quality of both education and healthcare.\n\n\u201cThrough the press conference, Yoon should give a clear signal on how to end the doctors\u2019 strike,\u201d said Kim Hyung-joon, a political-science professor at Pai Chai University in Daejeon.\n\nHe also needs to change his perceived \u201carrogant and obstinate\u201d style of governance to work effectively with the opposition-dominated parliament, Kim said.", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType":

And meets YouTube hero, too", "body": "Ten-year-old Yoon San has never let go of his dream of sitting down for a good meal despite his chronic inability to digest food.\n\nSuffering from pseudo-obstruction since his birth, he's hardly tasted any food in his lifetime because his intestinal muscles and nerves fail to transport the food intake, although there is no physical blockage.\n\nWhen asked about his cravings, he answered, \"I want to taste ramyeon and risotto, which are my favorites.\"\n\nInstead of eating actual food, Yoon relies on intravenous fluid therapy to receive essential nutrients. His mother, Lim, routinely administers liquid nutrition formula to her son. A feeding tube and needle are his lifeline.\n\nNo medication or surgery can improve his condition.\n\nAlthough Yoon was able to have porridge and noodles several years ago, a soft food diet is no longer an option. He can no longer digest even soft foods because his intestines have grown over the years. He occasionally takes supplementary drinks to fulfill his nutritional needs.\n\nLim used to \"feel guilty\" when she had to eat next to her son. \"It hurts to say 'no' to my son when I cannot give him the food he wants.\"\n\nBorn with a chronic illness, Yoon is quite familiar with him being inside of hospitals. He underwent several operations even before turning one year old.\n\nYoon's father drives from South Jeolla to Seoul -- where Seoul National University Hospital is located -- each month to bring 15 boxes of nutritional fluid and other medications for his son. Each journey takes more than 10 hours.\n\nYoon and his mother sanitize the tube connected to his body every four days and replace the needle weekly. Despite all the dedicated efforts, Yoon suffers from an infection and high fever twice a year.\n\nYoon has received a total of 19 surgeries so far, including the replacement of his feeding tubes.\n\nYoon is currently in the hospital for a high fever and pneumonia. Yoon was set to be discharged from the hospital a day before Children's Day, which fell on Sunday.\n\nDespite the hardships, Yoon has not let his condition get him down. Despite being shorter and skinnier than his peers, he was elected a class president in his school. Over half of his classmates voted for him.\n\nYoon's three campaign promises of hosting Secret Santa games, having cookie parties and introducing metaverse technology to the classroom helped win voters' minds and hearts. His next chapter is running for head of the student council, a school-wide body.\n\nUnlike his friends, he wants no superpowers. He is delighted with himself.\n\n\"If I get to have an ability [that I do not have], I want to run fast and well,\" Yoon said. He cannot sprint because of two ostomy bags attached to his body.\n\nYoon dreams of becoming a computer engineer.\n\nHis mother has been studying computer coding with Yoon, believing her son can keep up hope if he lands the job he wants. She has become an eager learner to make her son's dream come true.\n\nRecently, Yoon was admitted to the Institute of Creative Convergence Education in South Jeolla, a regional educational institute for students showing academic talent in science and technology.\n\n\"The admission was unexpected, and I just made a bold promise to my son that he could meet YouTuber Heopop,\" his mother said, referring to the social media personality famous for his video experiments.\n\nThe 10-year-old boy wanted to meet the YouTuber and own a tablet computer.\n\nHis wishes were realized unexpectedly the day before Children's Day. On Saturday, the YouTuber surprised Yoon and gave him a tablet PC.\n\n\"My son couldn't believe it at first,\" Lim said.\n\nShe added that her son said he \"wants to become a grownup who shares good deeds like the YouTuber.\"\n\nLim understands that a miraculous cure will never appear. The family accepts that the illness will last Yoon's entire life, and they try to live each day to the fullest.\n\nLim thanked the medical staff, who congratulated Yoon on winning the classroom election and cheered him on for participating in a school sports festival. She also expressed her gratitude for her family.\n\nBesides health care professionals and relatives, the private sector has also helped keep Yoon's dreams and aspirations alive.\n\nA donation of 300 billion won ($220 million) from Samsung Group's owning family has driven advancements in treatments for pediatric patients with childhood cancer and rare diseases.\n\nThe project, named after the group's late chairman Lee Kun-hee, directly subsidized some 45 pediatric patients by providing 350,000 won per child. The \"Lee Kun-hee Project\" funded a long-term cohort study and formed a cooperative network between pediatric departments, pharmacists, nurses and nutritionists at 16 hospitals nationwide.\n\nProf. Moon Jin-soo, a pediatrician at Seoul National University Hospital overseeing the project's joint research, said that state funding was insufficient to conduct research on pseudo-obstruction -- a rare disease affecting less than 100 patients nationwide. Samsung's grant made an in-depth study possible.\n\n\"The donation will lay the groundwork for developing health policies and relevant laws,\" Moon added.\n\nMoon noted that children suffering from pseudo-obstruction can \"blend well into society if proper support is given to them and they have no problems other than their intestines.\"\n\nSoo-jin, a pseudonym, an eight-year-old girl also battling pseudo-obstruction, goes to an alternative school.\n\nAlthough she can digest a small amount of food, stomachaches frequently disrupt her food intake.\n\nHer mother is always \"on standby\" to rush to her daughter's school in case a mishap happens when her daughter replaces her ostomy bag. She also visits a hospital every two days to bring prescribed therapy fluid.\n\nSoo-jin's mother said her heart always shatters when her child asks \"when she will conquer the disease\" or \"why she is different from her friends.\"\n\nShe once considered home schooling her daughter, but she is now relieved that Soo-jin can get along with her friends in school.\n\nAnother pediatrician who participates in the project, Prof. Lee Kyung-jae, said that decadelong research and observation of the child patients \"will generate substantial research results -- including the numbers of patients, intestine transplant surgeries and occurrence of medical complications.\"\n\nLee added that the collected data could lead to substantial research findings and help create a home parenteral nutrition system -- a life-sustaining treatment for patients who cannot process food, such as in foreign countries.\n\nThe medical professors envision the project tackling the imbalance in health care services and accessibility and standardizing treatments nationwide.\n\n\"In the past, my daughter and children suffering from such illnesses might have had no chance to live,\" Soo-jin's mother said.\n\nBY HWANG SU-YEON, LEE SOO-JUNG [lee.soojung1@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gastrointestinal tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "YouTuber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_tube", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Feeding tube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Jeolla_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Jeolla Province"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_condition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chronic condition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul_National_University_Hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seoul National University Hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Children's Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intravenous_therapy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intravenous therapy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ramen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Porridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noodle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Noodle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nerve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tablet_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tablet computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nutrient"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nutrition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surgery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kun-hee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Kun-hee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer_and_Support", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Cheer and Support", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/data/photo/2024/05/06/48e9b082-9794-4711-9bb9-ce0827ff8680.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

(Yonhap)\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol on Thursday apologized over the controversy surrounding first lady Kim Keon-hee's alleged acceptance of a Dior bag as a gift.\n\nIn a press conference marking his two years in office, the president said he \"offers a deep apology to the South Korean people for causing concern due to my wife's unwise conduct.\"\n\nIn spy camera footage released last year by a YouTube channel, the first lady was seen being presented with a luxury bag from a man identified as a pastor. The presidential office at the time explained that the bag was being managed \"as government property.\"\n\nBut on the prospect of opening a special counsel investigation into the allegations, as claimed by the opposition Democratic Party of Korea, the president said the prosecutorial service was already on the case.\n\n\"To comment on an ongoing investigation could cause misunderstandings that may have some influence,\" he said, adding that he believes the prosecutors will \"handle (the investigation) fairly and strictly.\"\n\nHe said that the calls for launching a special counsel investigation at this point were \"a political maneuver\" that \"does not appear to be meant to determine the truth.\"\n\nOn the ruling People Power Party defeat in the April 10 general election for the National Assembly, the president said he accepted the results as people's evaluation of his performance as \"unsatisfactory.\"\n\n\"I've been thinking a lot about what I've been lacking,\" he said. \"In the end, no matter how hard I've tried to improve people's lives, I think I've not been able to make changes that can actually be felt by the people, and I think my efforts in communicating those changes to the people have also fallen short.\"\n\nHe said he would \"communicate with the press more often,\" and \"make more opportunities to explain to the people\" his policies and \"be more honest about where we're falling short.\"\n\nOn the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea, the president called Russia \"a country that has had good relations with us for a long time.\"\n\n\"Recently we have diverged on the war in Ukraine and bringing in weapons from North Korea,\" he said. He added that his administration does not plan on \"supplying lethal weapons to anywhere.\"\n\n\"We can work with Russia where we can, and where we disagree, we may disagree. In terms of economic cooperation, we can pursue common interests,\" he said.\n\nDuring his address, delivered minutes before the press conference, he pledged to establish a new ministry aimed at addressing the nation's declining birth rate.\n\n\"To confront the pressing issue of low birth rates, tantamount to a national crisis, we will harness the full spectrum of governmental resources,\" he said.\n\nThe leader of this forthcoming ministry, tentatively dubbed the \"Ministry for Low Birth Response Planning,\" will also serve as the deputy prime minister for social affairs.\n\nTheir mandate will encompass formulating policies spanning education, labor, and welfare sectors, slated to become integral components of the national agenda. Yoon urged the opposition-led National Assembly's active collaboration in amending the governmental organizational framework to facilitate the ministry's inception.", "source": {"uri": "koreaherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Korea Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kim_arin@koreaherald.com", "name": "Kim Arin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonhap_News_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yonhap News Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Espionage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_Power_Party_(South_Korea)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "People Power Party (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Korea", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party of Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birth rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://res.heraldm.com/content/image/2024/05/09/20240509050465_0.jpg?1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 1367, "textEnd": 1375}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

Korea's First Lady on Dior bag allegations set to begin", "body": "SEOUL: A high-profile probe zeroing in on first lady Kim Keon-hee is set to begin as the top prosecutor pledged on Tuesday (May 7) to carry out a \"speedy and strict\" investigation into accusations that she illegally received a luxury Christian Dior bag as a gift from a Korean American pastor in 2022.\n\n\"The prosecution plans to conduct a speedy and strict investigation (into the allegations against the first lady) based solely on existing evidence and legal principles,\" Prosecutor General Lee One-seok told reporters as he entered the Supreme Prosecutors' Office in southern Seoul in the morning.\n\nLee's pledge comes less than a week after he reportedly ordered the launch of a special task force dedicated to an in-depth investigation of the anti-graft violation allegations against the first lady.\n\nIt also comes as the main opposition party's growing calls to revive and pass a special bill mandating an investigation into multiple allegations against the first lady, following a landslide victory in the April 10 parliamentary elections, in which the Democratic Party of Korea and satellite Democratic United party secured a majority of 171 of the total 300 seats in the National Assembly.\n\nIn March, the Democratic Party drafted and railroaded an updated version of a special investigation Bill into the first lady, which looks into the anti-graft allegations on top of the accusations that Kim was involved in a stock manipulation scandal of Deutsch Motors, a local BMW car dealer here, some decade ago.\n\nThe previous version of the Bill, which only mandated a probe into the stock manipulation allegations, was vetoed by President Yoon Suk-yeol in January.\n\nThe Democratic Party's Park Chan-dae, the main opposition's new floor leader, revealed plans on May 5 to resubmit eight Bills vetoed by Yoon in the incoming Parliament, including the investigation Bill against the first lady.\n\nOn the other side of the political sphere, Kim Min-jeon, a scholar-turned-politician who was recently elected a ruling party lawmaker in the April 10 parliamentary elections called for a more comprehensive probe not only involving the current first lady, but similar allegations against Kim Jung-sook, wife of the former President Moon Jae-in, and incumbent main opposition leader Lee Jae-myung's wife, Kim Hye-kyung.\n\n\"What I want to demand of President Yoon and the ruling party leadership is to accept the request for probe on the three million won (US$2,200) luxury handbag, but at the same time, demand (to the opposition) to carry out similar investigations on (allegations that Kim Hye-kyung misused taxpayers' money) and suspicions that Kim Jung-sook purchased her clothes and accessories (also with taxpayers' money),\" she said in a Facebook post uploaded on May 7.\n\nIn November last year, local media outlet and YouTube channel Voice of Seoul, uploaded a video filmed through spy cam showing Kim receiving a Christian Dior handbag worth three million won from a Korean American pastor named Choi Jae-young. The video was shot in September 2022, but was uploaded some year later, the channel claimed.\n\nThe outlet's head has since filed a complaint against President Yoon and the first lady on suspicions of violating the country's bribery and anti-graft regulations, which forbid public officials and their spouses from receiving gifts valued at more than one million won at a time or a total of three million won in a single year from the same person.\n\nThe presidential office has defended the first lady by calling the video a trap set up by a \"pro-North Korean\" pastor, while some ruling party People Power Party lawmakers stressed that Kim has not used the bag once after storing it in the presidential repository.\n\nOn the possibility of the first lady being convicted for violating the anti-graft law, a legal expert, who requested anonymity, said it is highly unlikely at the moment.\n\n\"The main focus of the anti-graft law here is whether the public official violated the rules, though it does include their spouses as subjects,\" the expert said.\n\n\"The main agenda of the investigation would be to prove how much Yoon knew about the first lady's acceptance of the luxury bag and what he could have possibly gained from it,\" he added.\n\nKim has been absent from the public eye since mid-December, when she was last seen upon her return from the Netherlands alongside Yoon.\n\nThough there were reported sightings of her casting a ballot for the latest parliamentary elections, the presidential office has remained silent about her whereabouts. South Korea's first lady has been out of the public eye for five months.\n\nMeanwhile, Yoon on May 7 named a former prosecutor as the new senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, a position he scrapped two years ago to curb accusations that it meddles in probes by the prosecution and the police.\n\nOn suspicions that the position was revived to alleviate the risks tied to the accusations against the first lady, Yoon said, while introducing his new aide for civil affairs, that the role was designed to \"serve the people.\"\n\nHe added that any \"personal legal risks\" associated with him should be something \"that he should resolve himself\" and not through the revived position. - The Korea Herald/ANN", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "},

The previous version of the Bill, which only mandated a probe into the stock manipulation allegations, was vetoed by President Yoon Suk-yeol in January.\n\nThe Democratic Party's Park Chan-dae, the main opposition's new floor leader, revealed plans on May 5 to resubmit eight Bills vetoed by Mr Yoon in the incoming Parliament, including the investigation Bill against the first lady.\n\nOn the other side of the political sphere, Ms Kim Min-jeon, a scholar-turned-politician who was recently elected a ruling party lawmaker in the April 10 parliamentary elections called for a more comprehensive probe not only involving the current first lady, but similar allegations against Ms Kim Jung-sook, wife of the former President Moon Jae-in, and incumbent main opposition leader Lee Jae-myung's wife, Ms Kim Hye-kyung.\n\n\"What I want to demand President Yoon and the ruling party leadership is to accept the request for probe on the three million won (S$2,980) luxury handbag, but at the same time, demand (to the opposition) to carry out similar investigations on (allegations that Kim Hye-kyung misused taxpayers' money) and suspicions that Kim Jung-sook purchased her clothes and accessories (also with taxpayers' money),\" she said in a Facebook post uploaded on May 7.\n\nIn November last year, local media outlet and YouTube channel Voice of Seoul, uploaded a video filmed through spy cam showing Kim receiving a Christian Dior handbag worth three million won from a Korean American pastor named Mr Choi Jae-young. The video was shot in September 2022, but was uploaded some year later, the channel claimed.\n\nThe outlet's head has since filed a complaint against President Yoon and the first lady on suspicions of violating the country's bribery and anti-graft regulations, which forbid public officials and their spouses from receiving gifts valued at more than one million won at a time or a total of three million won in a single year from the same person.\n\nThe presidential office has defended the first lady by calling the video a trap set up by a \"pro-North Korean\" pastor, while some ruling party People Power Party lawmakers stressed that Ms Kim has not used the bag once after storing it in the presidential repository.\n\nOn the possibility of the first lady being convicted for violating the anti-graft law, a legal expert, who requested anonymity, said it is highly unlikely at the moment.\n\n\"The main focus of the anti-graft law here is whether the public official violated the rules, though it does include their spouses as subjects,\" the expert said.\n\n\"The main agenda of the investigation would be to prove how much Yoon knew about the first lady's acceptance of the luxury bag and what he could have possibly gained from it,\" he added.\n\nMs Kim has been absent from the public eye since mid-December, when she was last seen upon her return from the Netherlands alongside Mr Yoon. Though there were reported sightings of her casting a ballot for the latest parliamentary elections, the presidential office has remained silent about her whereabouts. South Korea's first lady has been out of the public eye for five months.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Yoon on May 7 named a former prosecutor as the new senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, a position he scrapped two years ago to curb accusations that it meddles in probes by the prosecution and the police.\n\nOn suspicions that the position was revived to alleviate the risks tied to the accusations against the first lady, Mr Yoon said, while introducing his new aide for civil affairs, that the role was designed to \"serve the people.\"\n\nHe added that any \"personal legal risks\" associated with him should be something \"that he should resolve himself\" and not through the revived position.

The press conference comes 21 months after his last one in August 2022, which coincided with his 100th day in office. After stopping his signature doorstep interviews in November that year, the president didn't have any Q&A sessions with the press until the April 10 parliamentary elections.\n\nThe press conference on Thursday carries significance as it represents his second bid to communicate with the public following his first face-to-face meeting with Democratic Party (DP) leader Lee Jae-myung last month since he was elected as president.\n\nWhat attracts our attention is the restoration of the office of the senior secretary for civil affairs, which he abolished to keep his campaign promise. President Yoon is expected to announce the re-establishment of the office as early as Tuesday. Former Vice Justice Minister Kim Joo-hyun will take the post.\n\nThe revival of the office will be a double-edged sword for the president. First of all, he can listen to various voices of the people through the office and reflect them as he runs the country. The office also can streamline the complicated screening system for candidates for senior posts, which is divided between the presidential office, the Justice Ministry and the police, and help restore public trust in the government.\n\nBut the office for civil affairs can make the president fall into the temptation of inspection and surveillance. Officials in Sejong City, the administrative capital of Korea, already fear upcoming reinforcement of public discipline. Strengthening discipline on government employees are necessary, but it can weaken the morale of officialdom, too.\n\nThe DP worries about the possibility of the presidential office trying to rein in the opposition after controlling the prosecution and the police. Some even express concerns that the office could serve as a mechanism to effectively defend the president from allegations against the first lady and the DP-proposed special act to revisit the mysterious death of a Marine.\n\nIf the president does not erase such misunderstandings, it could backfire, as seen during the Moon Jae-in and Park Geun-hye administrations. As a prosecutor, Yoon led investigations into the power abuse of the office of the senior secretary and brought justice to two senior presidential secretaries on the job.\n\nPresident Yoon most likely abolished the office for civil affairs to avoid criticism against the office for its high-handed approach to state affairs. If the president wants to reinstate the office to help his governance, he must instruct its new head to follow the rules. We hope the president to respect the office's main function: canvassing public opinion.", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Jae-myung", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lee Jae-myung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejong_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sejong City"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(Japan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Justice (Japan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Jae-in", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon Jae-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Geun-hye", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Park Geun-hye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/resources/images/common/ja_opengraph_img.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 376, "textEnd": 384}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

While appointing former Vice Justice Minister Kim Joo-hyun, a former prosecutor, as his senior secretary for civil affairs on Tuesday, President Yoon said, \"If I have judicial risks, I must address them, not the senior presidential secretary.\" The remark translates into his intention to explain the suspicions over his wife in the press conference.\n\nThe president's aides suggested that he will answer questions the people want to hear. We welcome it. But we hope the president avoids his one-sided arguments this time, just like he did in April, when he rambled on about the government's unilateral push to increase the admissions quota for medical schools.\n\nThe success of Thursday's press conference depends on the president's ability to show candidness with the people. Instead of resorting to legal rhetoric deeply rooted in his long career as a prosecutor, President Yoon must answer questions from journalists in an open-minded and convincing manner. He must not give obscure answers to their questions about the first lady's suspicious acceptance of a luxury handbag from a pastor, just like he did in a special interview with KBS in February. The press conference on Thursday will also serve as a barometer of whether the president's new chief of staff successfully delivered the deepening public concerns about the president to his boss.\n\nThe president must also answer questions about the opposition's demand for a special investigation into the mysterious death of a Marine on a rescue mission. Instead of reiterating, \"Let's wait until the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials comes up with its investigation results,\" the president must first show sympathy for the sad death of the soldier and pledge to listen to the voice of his parents. It could be even better if the president can explain why the military applied insubordination charges to the chief investigator of the Marine Corps.\n\nSincere empathy starts with understanding other people's position. If the president only pays attention to the voices of his allies and family, he cannot win the hearts of the people. We hope Yoon demonstrates his ability to sympathize with the general public. The future of his remaining three-year term depends on the conference.\n\nThe president's attitude will also matter. Audiences will pay heed to his every word, facial expression and gesture during the live-covered event. If the president once again attempts to lecture the people, it will backfire. But if he answers questions from reporters humbly and genuinely, the conference will offer him a chance to better his presidency over the next three years.", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\uc911\uc559\uc77c\ubcf4"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Presidential_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senior Presidential Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Justice_(Japan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Justice (Japan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Broadcasting_System", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Korean Broadcasting System"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief of staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pastor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhetoric"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_Investigation_Office_for_High-ranking_Officials", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Marine Corps"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/resources/images/common/ja_opengraph_img.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

I think such expansion of cooperation is meaningful for both South Korea and Japan.\"\n\nHayashi added that Japan \"will continue to communicate closely and respond with South Korea to ensure that cooperation between the two countries becomes more solid and broader in a way that benefits the people of both countries.\"\n\nIn response to questions about historical issues such as the Sado gold mines' World Heritage listing, Hayashi said that Japan is \"making efforts to have the mines' excellent value as a cultural heritage appreciated as a World Heritage\" and will pursue \"sincere and respectful discussions with South Korea\" regarding the matter.\n\nSouth Korea strongly opposes the Sado gold mines' World Heritage listing because approximately 1,500 Koreans were forcibly mobilized for labor at the mines starting in 1939.\n\nIn pushing for the mines to be named a World Heritage site, Japan has designated the heritage timeline for the mines as between the 16th and 19th centuries, drawing criticism that it is trying to circumvent the forced labor issue.\n\nMeanwhile, President Yoon said during a press conference on Thursday marking two years in office that \"Prime Minister Kishida and I have sufficient trust in each other and are fully prepared to advance the relationship between our two countries.\"\n\n\"In South Korea-Japan relations, there is a clear difference in the positions of the people of the two countries regarding history and current issues,\" Yoon said. \"We need to think about what to do for the future of both countries and future generations.\"\n\n\"I think we need to cooperate for our future, specifically to respond to North Korea's nuclear weapons and for economic cooperation between the two countries, and to secure leadership for the common agenda of South Korea and Japan in the Indo-Pacific region and the global community,\" continued Yoon. \"Many pending issues or history may become obstacles, but I think we must have a firm goal orientation and persevere in the direction we need to go.\"\n\nSouth Korea-Japan relations have thawed significantly during the Yoon administration.\n\nHowever, the opposition Democratic Party and parts of the public argue that South Korea has gained nothing from improved relations, as territorial disputes regarding the easternmost Dokdo islets and Japan's obstruction of facts about the colonial period in history textbooks continue.\n\nRecently, the Japanese government's request for Line Yahoo to reduce Korean company Naver's control over the widely used messenger app Line in Japan has led to further criticism that Yoon's Japan policy has yielded little fruit.\n\nBY LIM JEONG-WON [lim.jeongwon@joongang.co.kr]", "source": {"uri": "koreajoongangdaily.joins.com",

(courtesy of PSPD)\n\nThe number of search and seizure warrants requested during the past two years under the Yoon Suk-yeol administration was significantly higher than that of previous administrations, a new study has found. Further analysis reveals that the prosecutorial investigations during this period often targeted civic groups and labor unions, with investigations by prosecutors becoming a key pillar in the management of state affairs.\n\nThe number of searches and seizures carried out against political figures has also sharply increased. Among these investigations, 95% of them targeted people affiliated with the Democratic Party. Instead of living up to promises of \"compromise\" and \"communicating with the opposition,\" critics are saying that the Yoon administration is governing via raids, causing Korea's democracy to regress.\n\nThe civic group People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy released a report on the prosecution service under the first two years of the Yoon administration on Wednesday. According to the report, the current government is one \"of, by and for prosecutors, with a large amount of governance being regulated and reworked by prosecutors and the judiciary.\"\n\nThe report contains a summary of key prosecutorial investigations, the people that have led those investigations, and a list of the country's top prosecutors.\n\nAccording to the report, a total of 457,160 search and seizure warrants were requested last year, an increase of around 110,000 from 2021 (347,623). From May 10, 2022, to Nov. 10, 2023, 22 major prosecutorial investigations have targeted former administration figures, opposition party members, labor unions, civic groups, and media outlets. These investigations have resulted in 124 raids on anyone who appears to view things differently than the Yoon administration.\n\n\"By selectively targeting political opponents for criminal investigations, the Yoon administration has proactively ignored the parameters of a democratic system and distorted how our political apparatus works,\" the report stated.\n\nThe ballooning authority of prosecutors under Yoon can be seen in part in the number of prosecutors dispatched to other government departments, which has also increased compared to previous administrations. As of February 2024, the Supreme Prosecutors' Office has dispatched 50 prosecutors to 34 different government entities. Compared to March 2022 -- two months before Yoon took office -- this is four more prosecutors dispatched to three more state entities.\n\nUnder the Yoon administration, prosecutors were dispatched to agencies such as the Ministry of Employment and the Labor and Ministry of Education, which rarely had prosecutors dispatched to them before the Yoon administration's arrival. The report noted that a prosecutor had been dispatched to the Ministry of Health and Welfare, accusing the administration of \"utilizing the legal power of the prosecutors to solve the dispute with the medical community [over the increase in medical school admissions], as opposed to reaching a consensus through dialogue.\"\n\nData on raids on the National Assembly over the last 10 years provided by the office of Democratic Party lawmaker Jung Sung-ho shows a clear uptick in compulsory investigations of those in the political world and a stark political bias in the slant of investigations. From May 2022 to May 2024, prosecutors conducted 22 search and seizure raids of lawmakers' offices in the National Assembly. This is the same number of raids that occurred during the entire five years of the Moon administration. During the first two years of the Moon administration, only 12 raids on the National Assembly occurred.\n\nThe tendency for prosecutors to target the political opposition has grown worse during the Yoon administration. Among the 22 search and seizure raids conducted on National Assembly members during the past two years, 21 of them targeted members of affiliates of the Democratic Party. The raids began with one conducted on the offices of the then-leader of the Democratic Party, Jeong Jin-sang, on Nov. 9, 2022, by the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office. The raid was conducted in connection with corruption allegations linked to a real-estate development project in the Daejong neighborhood in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province. This was followed by four raids on the offices of Noh Woong-rae, who was facing suspicion of bribery, and six raids related to alleged vote-buying at the party convention.\n\nAlthough there was a clear bias during the Moon administration, it's gotten worse under Yoon. Under the Moon administration, 12 search and seizure raids targeted the opposition party while six of them targeted the Democratic Party.\n\nBy Go Na-rin, staff reporter; Lim Jae-woo, staff reporter", "source": {"uri": "english.hani.co.kr", "dataType": "news", "title": "\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Solidarity_for_Participatory_Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_seizure", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search and seizure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judicial Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(South_Korea)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Prosecutors'_Office_of_the_Republic_of_Korea", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Prosecutors' Office of the Republic of Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_District_(Kermanshah_County)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central District (Kermanshah County)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noh_Woong-rae", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noh Woong-rae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Education_(South_Korea)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Education (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Health_and_Welfare_(South_Korea)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Health and Welfare (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyeonggi_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gyeonggi Province"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gyeonggi Province"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seongnam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seongnam"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Seoul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://flexible.img.hani.co.kr/flexible/normal/861/1148/imgdb/original/2024/0509/8817152404301007.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-05-", "textStart": 1815, "textEnd": 1821}, {"amb": false, "date": "2010-11-", "textStart": 1832, "textEnd": 1839}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

From left to right are Yoon's elder brother-in-law Kim Jin-mo, Yoon's mother Ahn Mi-ja, and Yoon's older sister Yun Seon-yeong. (Baek So-ah/The Hankyoreh)\n\nYoon Seung-ju, a private in the Korean Army, was beaten to death on April 7, 2014. He had been relentlessly bullied by several higher-ranking soldiers in his unit until a final blow felled him for good.\n\nThe military said Yoon had suffocated to death after a dumpling got stuck in his throat. That's a lie his family members have spent the past decade combatting.\n\n\"Private Yoon\" has now become synonymous with victims of violence in the military.\n\nOn May 1, Yoon's mother Ahn Mi-ja, 69, his older sister Yoon Seon-yeong, 46, and her husband Kim Jin-mo, 49, sat down together for an interview in a fifth-floor conference room in the Hankyoreh office in the Gongdeok neighborhood of Seoul's Mapo District.\n\nThe very next day, the National Assembly passed a bill that would assign a special prosecutor to investigate the death of a Marine corporal surnamed Chae during a flood rescue operation last year.\n\nYoon's family members said that Chae's case was kept in the public eye by military institutions that have improved since Yoon's death, as well as thanks to the efforts of Col. Park Jeong-hun, who served as the head of the Marines' investigation team. But they're still concerned that powerful figures outside the military could step in to manipulate those institutions.\n\nAfter Chae's fatal accident, Yoon's mother said she sometimes finds herself wishing that her family had had someone like Park Jeong-hun to get involved after her son's death.\n\nBack in 2014, things were much different than they are today.\n\n\"In April 2014, when we asked the provost marshal [who was in the same position as Col. Park] whether anything had turned up in connection with the bruises, he accused us of trying to take over his investigation,\" said Kim Jin-mo, Yoon's brother-in-law. The bruises on Yoon's body were not consistent with the Army's claim that Yoon had died of asphyxiation.\n\n\"We heard the same thing from the commander, the military doctor, the coroner, the military prosecutor, the military police, Army Headquarters and the Ministry of National Defense. Internally, the case had been disposed of at lightning speed,\" Kim recalled.\n\n\"I think that the Private Yoon case was what made people like Park Jeong-hun possible. I'd figured there would be [more] bereaved families who would fight as we have, but I never knew there would be a provost marshal who would fight alongside them. It's an amazing step forward -- it's a miracle.\"\n\nAccording to Statistics Korea, a hundred or so Korean service members die each year.\n\n\"It was a relief to see the institutions that were set in motion after Yoon's death operating in the Corporal Chae case,\" Kim said.\n\nUnlike the past, investigations of deaths in the army are no longer kept under wraps by the military police. It's now possible for other people to at least check on what progress has been made.\n\nThe problem is when other figures meddle in the system.\n\nIn regard to the Corporal Chae case, various people are rumored to have been involved: Yu Jae-eun, a legal affairs officer at the Ministry of National Defense, Defense Minister Lee Jong-sup, and even the president himself.\n\n\"The problem is people. The military has a knack for exploiting loopholes. If you get complacent about the systemic reforms and stop watching closely, we might find ourselves going back a decade in time,\" Kim said.\n\nThanks to the Private Yoon case, the Corporal Chae case was brought to public awareness, and the special prosecution bill passed the National Assembly.\n\nBut in the Private Yoon case, no evidence has emerged to confirm allegations about a cover-up. Yoon's bereaved family members filed criminal complaints against the head of the investigation section at the military police, the provost marshal, the coroner, the military prosecutor and a support officer in the medical corps, but none of them were indicted. Five individuals were convicted of Yoon's murder and manslaughter, but nobody has been convicted in connection with the alleged cover-up.\n\nThe officer in charge of protecting human rights in the military at Korea's National Human Rights Commission, a position that was created after Yoon's case, rejected a petition to investigate those allegations and, when Yoon's family protested this move, then asked the authorities to investigate the family for obstructing his duties.\n\nThe battle over the past decade was led by Kim. \"Without my son-in-law, we would never have made it this far,\" said Ahn, Yoon's mother.\n\nOn the night of the accident, Yoon Seon-yeong, the victim's older sister, kneeled down before her husband and begged him to help the family. Kim promised his wife he would do one thing each day for the cause.\n\nOne of the results of his efforts is the information acquired through 470 freedom-of-information requests.\n\n\"It was extremely likely that [Yoon's death] would remain a mystery if we didn't do something. So we decided to spend a decade battling the military to get to the truth,\" he said.\n\nWhile that campaign began as a family affair, it's now intended to benefit all who suffer in the military.\n\n\"Lots of people are having a hard time, even if they don't get media coverage,\" said Ahn.\n\n\"It's important to show up at trials and cheer on the plaintiffs.

The bus was adorned with large yellow ribbons and inscribed with the words \"April 16 Truth Bus.\" The purpose of the bus was to inform people of the National Assembly citizens' petition submitted by civic groups, including 4/16 Sewol Families for Truth and A Safer Society (SFTSS). The petition calls on the government to enact the Special Act on Investigating the Truth of Social Disasters and Building a Safe Society (SDC Act) and release presidential records related to the tragedy.\n\nThe investigation by the Social Disasters Commission (SDC) will come to an end on Dec. 11, but the reasons behind the sinking and the lackluster rescue effort have still not been brought to light. The SDC does not have the investigative rights to compel [testimony] or the ability to view presidential records that could confirm negligence in the rescue effort. When a National Assembly citizens' petition obtains 100,000 signatures within a month, it must be subject to deliberation by the competent standing committee of the National Assembly.\n\nBeginning with the Blue House, the April 16 Truth Bus that Yoon boarded travelled to 27 cities throughout Korea in 21 days, stopping in Gwangju, Busan, Wonju and other locations. This was a journey of more than 3,100 kilometers. In an interview with the Hankyoreh on Oct. 29, Yoon noted that most of the people she met around the country mistakenly believed that the investigation into the truth surrounding the Sewol ferry sinking was \"making good progress.\"\n\nOne citizen she met in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, was glad to see the Truth Bus with Yoon on board, but was surprised to see the bereaved families of Sewol victims making such a trip. Upon hearing Yoon explain the lack of progress in the investigation, the person reportedly broke out in tears and said, \"I thought the investigation was going well.\" Those on the bus conducted publicity work and meetings from 6 am to 9 pm each day before climbing back on the bus late at night to travel to the next city. Yoon stated she would have been unable to cope with the brutal schedule were it not for the solidarity shown by other bereaved families.\n\nIn Daejeon, they received words of condolence and encouragement from the mother of Kim Dong-jun, a man who passed away after being the victim of workplace bullying while conducting rescue work. In Jeju, the father of Lee Min-ho, a victim of an industrial accident, joined the group in holding up placards. The group met with families of people killed in the May 18 Democratization Movement in Gwangju, and held a meeting in Jeju with relatives of victims in the Apr. 3 Jeju Uprising. \"Bereaved families had looked up the Truth Bus' schedule and came out to greet us,\" Yoon said. \"That gave us a lot of strength.\"\n\nCitizens that SFTSS met in the streets filled the canvas the group had brought with messages such as \"Is it too much to ask for a safe society?\" and \"We are sorry that the lack of progress in investigating the truth has brought pain to bereaved families.\" Yoon's earnest wishes and the power of solidarity eventually bore fruit. On the evening of Oct. 31, the petition submitted by SFTSS reached 100,000 signatures. This was the first step towards unveiling the truth. Yoon was reportedly overjoyed to hear the news. \"I know that bringing the truth to light and having those responsible punished won't bring our children back, but uncovering the truth is a necessary step towards preventing similar tragedies from happening again and building a safe country,\" Yoon told the Hankyoreh. \"I once again felt that a lot of people want the truth about the Sewol tragedy to come out, and I would like to thank everyone for rallying together.\"\n\nBy Kang Jae-gu, staff reporter\n\nPlease direct comments or questions to [english@hani.co.kr]", "source": {"uri":

May. 08, 2024 07:45. by \uc774\uc0c1\ud5cc, \uc7a5\uad00\uc11d dapaper@donga.com.\n\nPresident Yoon Suk Yeol has officially announced the creation of the position of Senior Secretary to the President for Civil Affairs, appointing former Vice Minister of the Justice Ministry, Kim Joo-hyun, as its inaugural secretary. This move has drawn criticism from opposition parties, who have denounced the revival of the civil affairs secretary position at a time when the Corporal Chae Special Prosecution Act has passed the National Assembly, and investigations into allegations that the First Lady, Kim Keon Hee, received a Dior handbag as a bribe are set to commence. The opposition accuses the presidential office of \"laying the groundwork for dominating the inspection agency and addressing legal risks.\" Lee Dong-wook, the spokesman of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, has been appointed as the inaugural Secretary for Civil Affairs, while Lee Won-mo, a former secretary for personal affairs, has assumed the role of Secretary for Civil Service Discipline, previously held by Lee Si-won who recently resigned.\n\nPresident Yoon personally announced Kim's appointment as Senior Secretary and explained to reporters, \"I have previously maintained my stance against establishing a civil affairs secretary office, but I now recognize that my administration did not sufficiently listen to the voice of the people. After carefully considering the shortcomings in my administration's civil affairs efforts, I have decided to reinstate the position.\" When asked if the creation of the civil affairs secretary position was intended to address legal risks related to himself, President Yoon responded that he believes legal risks related to him should be handled directly by him, not the civil affairs secretary. President Yoon's reinstatement of the civil affairs secretary, two weeks before the second anniversary of his inauguration, is seen as an effort to bolster his administration's weakened standing following the significant losses in the April 10 general elections. The civil affairs secretary's office will oversee civil service discipline, legal matters, and civil affairs. A ruling party member suggested that the new civil affairs secretary's office could potentially play a role in inspecting external entities such as state-owned organizations.\n\nThe Democratic Party of Korea has criticized the Civil Affairs Secretary's Office for historically being used to control inspection agencies like the prosecutors' office and the police and to strengthen the centralization of the presidential system. They argue that this time will be no different. The Rebuilding Korea Party has also expressed skepticism, stating that no citizen will believe the presidential office's pledge to listen to the voices of the people when the representative appointed has a background as a prosecutor.", "source": {"uri": "donga.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.donga.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Civil affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Dong-wook", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lee Dong-wook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Presidential_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senior Presidential Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(South_Korea)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (South Korea)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_(magazine)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Si-won", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lee Si-won"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Internal_Affairs_(Russia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inauguration of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-owned_enterprise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State-owned enterprise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_of_Korea", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party of Korea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Presidential system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Lobbying", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://dimg.donga.com/ugc/CDB/ENGLISH/Article/66/3a/af/0f/663aaf0f1fe9d273823e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-10", "textStart": 2086, "textEnd": 2094}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-05-", "textStart": 72, "textEnd": 79}], "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 101, "relevance": 1}

(Yonhap)\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol explained his choice to bring back the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs office on Tuesday as being based on \"listening to public sentiments.\"\n\nBut opposition parties and civil society came out the same day denouncing the revival of the office -- in a reversal of Yoon's previous pledge to abolish it -- as an \"attempt to increase control over inspection organizations and defend against judicial risks.\"\n\nAnnouncing former Vice Minister of Justice Kim Joo-hyun's appointment as senior secretary personally at the Yongsan presidential office that day, Yoon explained the reasons behind it by commenting that \"the opposition party delegation commented on the function in terms of listening to public opposition during my last meeting with [Democratic Party leader] Lee Jae-myung.\"\n\nHe also said that the late former President Kim Dae-jung \"initially had only a legal affairs secretary's office out of concerns about adverse effects but ended up reinstating the senior civil affairs secretary's office two years after taking office.\"\n\nIn his explanation, he stressed that the office's establishment was meant as a measure to listen to public opinion more closely and reflect comments made by the opposition parties and media in the past, adding that he was \"reinstating\" an organization that past administrations had uniformly operated.\n\nBut his explanation was not perceived as very convincing by many.\n\nIn a statement the same day, People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy said, \"The office of the senior secretary for civil society, which is really supposed to perform the role of listening to public opinion, is currently vacant.\"\n\n\"They have revived the senior secretary of civil affairs even when they were fully capable of hearing public opinions by strengthening the role of the senior secretary for civil society [as a figure communicating with the National Assembly and civil society],\" the group suggested.\n\nDemocratic Party spokesperson Choi Min-seok said, \"The idea of listening to public opinion through the senior secretary for civil affairs does not make any sense.\"\n\n\"They seem to want to use inspection agencies even to detect trends in public opinion,\" he added.\n\nThe reasons for the objections from opposition parties and civil society have to do with the role the senior secretary for civil affairs has performed in the past.\n\nOfficially, the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs performs duties related to vetting high-ranking officials, gathering public opinion on state affairs, examining trends in senior official service, managing issues related to relatives of the president, and communicating with inspection agencies.\n\nIn general, however, the focus has tended to be less on hearing out public opinions than on directing agencies tasked with carrying out investigations, inspections and audits.\n\nIt was for this reason that as president-elect, Yoon commented on March 14, 2022, about the office of the senior civil affairs society having \"controlled inspection agencies in the past and routinely used them to control political adversaries and opponents under a guise of lawfulness,\" adding that it had used \"examination of public opinion\" as a pretext to acquire personal information about members of the public and conduct background checks.\n\nYoon made a pledge to abolish the position, which he subsequently carried out. Political world observers suggested he had made the decision because as a former prosecutor general, he was more aware than anyone of the abuses by senior civil affairs secretaries in the past.\n\nHis move on Tuesday to revive the position and place a newly created a secretary position underneath it, along with a civil service discipline secretary and legal affairs secretary, sparked criticisms for backpedaling on his previous pledge -- along with controversy over the same issues with \"controlling inspection agencies\" that he himself had commented on.\n\nKim Joo-hyun, the figure appointed as senior presidential secretary, was a member of the 18th class at the Judicial Research and Training Institute, which makes him a senior to current Prosecutor General Lee One-seok (27th class) by nine terms.\n\nThe strong adherence to hierarchy in the prosecution makes it easier for it to be controlled by the presidential office through the senior secretary for civil affairs, raising concerns even among prosecutors.\n\n\"The senior secretary for civil affairs will be the actual power behind inspection agencies and will be the first to receive investigation reports,\" remarked a regional chief prosecutor.\n\nAnother chief prosecutor commented that the relationship between the senior secretary for civil affairs and the prosecution service will be \"taken back in time.\"\n\n\"The senior secretary will end up being very influential in the prosecutions' personnel,\" they said. \"I doubt that younger prosecutors will allow such an atmosphere to become prevalent.\"\n\nThe opposition strongly suspects that Yoon's intention in reviving the position of senior secretary for civil affairs is to \"save his family from being judged by the law by taking control of the prosecution,\" to quote the Democrats' spokesperson. Riding the wave of the opposition's sweeping victory in the April 10 general election, the National Assembly passed a special act on investigating the truth behind the death of a Marine corporal who died during a missing persons search during flooding, established a task force to investigate first lady Kim Keon-hee's acceptance of a luxury handbag, and signaled their intent to launch a special counsel investigation into Kim in the 22nd National Assembly, which would investigate allegations of stock price manipulation.\n\nAs such, the president's actions are seen as an attempt to take control of the inspection and audit agencies and prepare for possible legal judgments by placing a former senior prosecutor in the position of senior secretary for civil affairs.\n\n\"No other individual is fit to defend against the president's family and close aides against allegations of corruption,\" said Kim Min-jeong, spokesperson for the Justice Party. \"Yoon is blatantly placing allies in high offices to rein in inspection agencies as he tries to wriggle himself out of the crises he faces as a lame-duck, dead-duck, president.\"\n\nThe president's response to such criticism was to say that he would bear responsibility for any problems involving himself personally.\n\n\"Any judgments to be made are my responsibility, not the senior secretary of civil affairs'. I will try to explain and resolve any problems related to myself instead of making it the job of the senior secretary,\" he said.\n\nJung Hee-yong, a spokesperson for the People Power Party, also welcomed the revival of the position, saying that the \"entire focus of the new position lies in communication,\" and that the move \"demonstrates a strong will to listen to the public and reflect them in state management.\"\n\n\"It is urgent that an office that looks into the affairs of the first lady is established along with the revival of the senior secretary for civil affairs,\" wrote lawmaker Yoon Sang-hyun, who belongs to the ruling party's non-Yoon-aligned faction, on Facebook.\n\nIt is also of interest whether the senior secretary for civil affairs will take back the functions of vetting public officials, which were handed over to the Ministry of Justice when the position was abolished, or oversight over relatives of the president, which has been virtually neglected in the absence of the independent inspector general and the organization that looked after the affairs of presidential spouses.\n\nA senior presidential office official only said, \"It is up for future discussion.\"\n\nBy Lee Seung-jun, staff reporter; Son Hyun-soo, staff reporter; Lim Jae-woo, staff reporter; Jeong Hye-min, staff reporter", "source": {"uri": "english.hani.co.kr", "dataType":

Extreme friction between the ruling and the opposition parties is anticipated upon marking the opening of the 22nd session of the National Assembly; the Democratic Party has announced to propose of a special prosecution bill against \"Kim Gun Hee's Deutsche Motors Stock Manipulation Suspicions,\" which President Yoon exercised veto power over earlier this year.\n\nPresident Yoon, speaking at the \"Yoon Suk Yeol Administration's Two Year National Report and Press Conference\" held at the Yongsan Presidential Office on the same day, apologized for the controversy over his wife's Dior bag scandal, saying, \"I apologize for causing concern to the public due to my wife's unwise behavior.\" He also emphasized regarding the \"Kim Gun Hee Special Prosecutor bill,\" \"Even when there was divided public opinion on special prosecution cases, the argument I always made was that it is only appropriate to pursue a special prosecution when there are suspicions of leniency or inadequacy in the prosecution or police investigations.\"\n\nHe also commented on Private Chae's case, saying, \"Once all procedures are completed, the investigative authorities will explain the progress and results to the public in detail,\" and added, \"Observing the ongoing judicial process and trusting the mindset and attitude of the investigators would be the right thing to do.\" President Yoon revealed his negative perception of special prosecution: \"Until recently, most of the media coverage has been political articles about special prosecutor laws after the general elections.\"\n\nFollowing the president's press conference, Park Chan-dae, the floor leader of the Democratic Party, held an emergency press conference and criticized, \"As expected, it was as I feared,\" and strongly condemned the government's neglect of people's livelihoods and once again abandoning the lives of the people.\" He also announced, \"When the 22nd National Assembly begins, we will reintroduce a special prosecutor bill for various suspicions related to Kim Gun Hee, such as the Deutsche Motors stock manipulation allegations,\" and added, \"We are carefully considering whether to include suspicions related to the Seoul-Yangpyeong Expressway and her luxury bag.\"", "source": {"uri": "donga.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.donga.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Veto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoon_Suk_Yeol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yoon Suk Yeol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(Luxembourg)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (Luxembourg)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Republic_of_China", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of the Republic of China"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_opinion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public opinion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Floor leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_manipulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market manipulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun_Control", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gun Control", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://dimg.donga.com/ugc/CDB/ENGLISH/Article/66/3d/50/fe/663d50fe179cd273823e.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542496", "eventUri": "eng-9542496", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-05-", "textStart": 60, "textEnd": 67}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 452991593, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 143, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 143}}}

{"id": 231327898, "title": "ITV Emmerdale reveals prison twist for village favourite after evil lie as exit 'sealed", "text": "Emmerdale is set for upsetting scenes next week with one village favourite heading to prison. Samson Dingle was stabbed in huge scenes on Thursday night with Matty Barton to blame for what has happened after the knife he was holding ended up in Samson's stomach. In shocking scenes, Samson's new friend Josh confronted Matty after he poured their paid-for beers down the drain. He was furious over Josh constantly flirting with Amy, despite knowing that Matty and Amy were recently married. Things escalated when vile Josh started referencing Matty being transgender and in a furious confrontation, Matty warned them to leave - but Josh wasn't having it. He pushed Samson forward, and onto the knife that Matty was holding. In horrifying scenes, Samson was whisked away in an ambulance - whilst Matty found himself arrested. On Friday's episode, Matty was grilled by police and it was revealed that there was no CCTV at the HOP or the Hide due to cost-cutting measures, which meant there was no evidence to back up Matty's claims. To make matters worse, Josh threatened Samson to stick to his side of the story in order to keep themselves out of trouble. During the scene, Samson seemed very guilty as he pointed out that Matty is family. However, later on, Samson told the police that Matty had stabbed him with Cain Dingle, who is Matty's stepfather, furious as he vowed to get the truth. In spoilers for next week, Emmerdale has revealed a prison twist for Matty. In upcoming scenes, Moira Dingle comforts worried Matty at Keepers Cottage, while Samson faces accusations from Cain who demands he tells the truth. Things go from bad to worse when Matty confronts Samson, hoping to convince him to tell the truth. Matty is hopeful he's got through to Samson but he's soon left panicked when PC Swirling informs him that Samson has contacted the police, accusing Matty of putting pressure on him. Heartbroken over his family member's continuous betrayal, Matty angrily confronts Samson leading to a confrontation between the two but PC Swirling quickly catches them and marches Matty away towards a police car. And the confrontation runs deep into the Dingles as Cain glares at Sam over the chaos with battle lines clearly drawn between them. The next day, sat in his cell, Matty is nervous as an officer informs him he's leaving for court in an hour. Meanwhile, Moira is furious when Amy reveals Matty\u2019s solicitor was on the phone and the police have dropped the robbery investigation due to lack of evidence. News soon feeds back to Samson and he starts to panic when he learns that Matty is being kept on remand. Later, in a heartbreaking twist outside the court, a shell-shocked Matty is aware he's in danger as the police officer suggests he remains quiet about being transgender in prison. Meanwhile Matty's wife, Amy, fears he is a sitting target as she watches him being bundled into a police van. It comes as Samson is reportedly set to leave the ITV soap later this year. However, whatever happens, actor Sam Hall - who plays teenager Samson - has insisted he won't be killed off. He told Inside Soap: \"Well, I don't want to give too much away, but Samson has some really big stuff coming up. Don't worry, as he's definitely not being killed off! There are some good stories coming up for him, and I was very excited when I read the scripts.\" Emmerdale airs weeknights at 7:30pm on ITV1 and ITVX, with an hour-long episode on Thursdays.* Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.", "summary": "Emmerdale is set for upsetting scenes next week with one village favourite heading to prison in a heartbreaking twist after an evil lie", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/itv-emmerdale-reveals-prison-twist-32989229", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32989364.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Emmerdale-1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:14:46", "author": "Olivia Wheeler,Olivia-Wheeler", "authors": ["Olivia Wheeler", "Olivia-Wheeler"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.254}

(Photo by Alan Chapman/Dave Benett/WireImage) Alan Chapman/Dave Benett/WireImage As viewers are discovering, A Quiet Place: Day One features a cat named \u201cFrodo\u201d as a survivor of an alien attack. Now, director Michael Sarnoski is explaining why the feline is an essential part of the new film. A prequel to the 2018 and 2021 Quiet Place movies, A Quiet Place: Day One stars Lupita Nyong\u2019o stars as Samira\u2014aka Sam\u2014a terminally ill patient from a hospice center who is on field trip with other patients in New York City when aliens attack the buzzing metropolis. Like the two previous Quiet Place movies, the creatures are blind but hypersensitive to sound and viciously attack anything that makes a noise. After the initial attack, Sam happens upon Eric (Joseph Quinn), a British law student who commits to helping Sam on a personal mission before they join other survivors who are evacuating New York. Accompanying Sam and Eric on their harrowing trip through the dilapidated city is Sam\u2019s support cat, Frodo\u2014played by two tuxedo felines, Nico and Schnitzel\u2014who becomes a key part of the story. ForbesDoes 'A Quiet Place: Day One' Have An End Credits Scene?By Tim Lammers Sarnoski\u2014who wrote the story for A Quiet Place: Day One with original Quiet Place director and star John Krasinski\u2014told The Hollywood Reporter that Frodo \u201cgrew naturally out of Sam\u2019s character\u201d since he imagined the cat to represent the life she once knew before her illness.

Russia\u2019s War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine \u201cA hospice patient isn\u2019t necessarily aiming for survival during the end of the world, and this is a chance for her to reconnect with her life,\u201d Sarnoski told THR. \u201cFrodo became an extension of that. I always imagined that back when Sam lived in the city, Frodo was a savvy street cat, and she started leaving out a bowl of milk for him, and he became her pet.\u201d As such, Sarnoski added for THR, Frodo \u201cbecame the one thing she took with her when she left the city as her life neared its end. Frodo is a stand-in for her life that once existed. So when they return to the city together, they re-experience it together.\u201d Sarnoski Was Intent On Having A Real Cat In The Movie While discussing A Quiet Place: Day One with THR, Michael Sarnoski said since his screenplay called for a cat, the studio figured they could find the way around the obstacle in the digital space\u2014but he wasn\u2019t having any of it. \u201cThe initial reaction was, \u2018Okay, we\u2019re going to have a computer-generated cat. I guess we can pull that off.\u2019 But then I said, \u2018No, I really want to do all the cat stuff for real and not ever do a CG cat,\u2019\u201d the director recalled for THR. \u201cEveryone was like, \u2018We\u2019ll see about that.\u2019 But thankfully, we managed it with incredible cat trainers and incredible cat performers. Everyone assumed wouldn\u2019t be able to pull it off the old-fashioned way, but I\u2019m really happy we did.\u201d When THR asked Sarnoski why a cat was needed for the support animal role instead of a dog, the director said in the scenario he created for A Quiet Place: Day One, the feline had more of a natural fit for the surroundings of the Big Apple.

There\u2019s something about street cats and bodega cats and the survival instinct side of the city,\u201d the filmmaker explained to THR. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think a dog would do well in the Quiet Place universe \u2014 too barky. Cats are stalking predators and have a natural silence. So they make a lot of sense as a creature that would do well.\u201d While Sarnoski added that a cat complimented Sam\u2019s vibe in the film as a standoffish character until you got to know her, he said Lupita Nyong\u2019o in reality couldn\u2019t warm up to the idea of having a feline co-star at first because she\u2019s afraid of cats. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t just \u2018not a fan.\u2019 She was really frightened,\u201d Sarnoski revealed to THR. \u201cAnd in one of our first meetings, she was sitting on the floor of my office and slowly crawled towards the cat getting a little closer, a little closer, until she finally touched it, and then eventually she was petting it and could pick it up.\u201d Now, the director added, Nyong\u2019o has a cat of her own. In a studio production featurette for A Quiet Place: Day One, Nyong\u2019o talked of her prior fear of cats and likened them at the time to small lions. Then, she added, \u201cThat\u2019s how I felt before this movie ... I met Nico and Schnitzel\u2014the two cats who play Frodo in the film ... Now, somehow, I love them.\u201d A Quiet Place: Day One is new in theaters.

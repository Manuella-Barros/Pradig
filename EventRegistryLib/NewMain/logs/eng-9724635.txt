A man suspected of killing the wife and daughters of a BBC radio sports commentator with a crossbow is being treated in a hospital after being found injured in a cemetery. Kyle Clifford is suspected of attacking Carol Hunt, 61, and her daughters Hannah, 28 and Louise, 25. They were found dead at their home in Bushey, a suburban community northwest of London. (Jonathan Brady/PA via AP)\n\nA man suspected of killing two sisters and their mother in a crossbow attack was being treated in a major trauma center at a London hospital on Thursday as police carried out further searches of properties.\n\nTributes poured in for the three women who were found with serious injuries at their home in the quiet residential neighborhood of Bushey, northeast of the capital, on Tuesday evening. Police and ambulance crews tried to save Carol Hunt, 61, and her daughters Hannah, 28, and Louise, 25, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe women were the family of BBC radio's horse racing commentator John Hunt. The killings prompted a major manhunt that led to the capture of the suspect, Kyle Clifford, in a cemetery the following afternoon around 15 miles (22 kilometers) from the scene of the crimes.\n\nAt a vigil at St. James' Church nearby, shocked friends and neighbors gathered to pay tribute to the three women Thursday and to express their shock and anger. Some also laid flowers near the scene of the attack.\n\n\"We grew up together and were pregnant at the same time,\" said Lea Holloway, who had known Carol Hunt since she was 16. \"This is the stuff nightmares are made of ... I can't imagine what it would be like.\"\n\n\"They were the loveliest, gentlest family,\" said Su Kehinde, who lives nearby. \"They were the meekest human beings. They did not deserve this. They were beautiful souls.\"\n\nAfter a frantic search across a swath of London's northern fringe, Clifford was found Wednesday in the Enfield area of north London, near his home, with undisclosed injuries. Police officers, some wearing gloves and face masks, were seen at his address on Thursday.\n\nFootage from Sky News showed the suspect being carried on a stretcher out of Lavender Hill Cemetery. Armed police officers, forensic personnel and ambulance staff had massed around the cemetery through Wednesday. Police did not say how he was injured, but stressed that they had not fired any shots. They said Clifford has not yet been arrested.\n\nFurther searches were taking place at a house linked to Clifford's brother, Bradley Clifford, who was jailed for life with a minimum term of 23 years for the murder of moped passenger Soban Khan in 2018.\n\nPolice did not say how or whether Clifford was connected to the women, but said they believed the attack was targeted. British media reported that Clifford was an ex-boyfriend of one of the victims.\n\nThe BBC confirmed the victims were the family of its sports commentator John Hunt. Hunt is the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nBBC 5 Live's lead presenter Mark Chapman, who had regularly introduced Hunt's commentaries, struggled to hold back tears as he spoke about what had been \"a heartbreaking day.\"\n\nThe racing community also expressed its support for Hunt, with jockeys at Kempton Park Racecourse wearing black armbands and Newmarket Racecourse holding a minute's silence.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nThe new Labour Party government, which took office last week, said it would \"swiftly consider\" findings of a recently launched review into whether controls on owning crossbows should be tightened.\n\nSecurity Minister Dan Jarvis said Home Secretary Yvette Cooper would \"look clearly, very carefully at what happened yesterday - devastating events - and she will take a view in the near future.\"\n\nThe weapon has been used in several high-profile crimes in recent years.

Police and ambulance crews tried to save Carol Hunt, 61, and her daughters Hannah, 28, and Louise, 25, but they were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nThe women were the family of BBC radio's horse racing commentator John Hunt. The killings prompted a major manhunt that led to the capture of the suspect, Kyle Clifford, on Wednesday in a cemetery near his home in Enfield, around 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the scene of the crimes.\n\nClifford, 26, was taken away on a stretcher from Lavender Hill Cemetery with undisclosed injuries. Police said no shots had been fired.\n\nHertfordshire Police said in a statement on Thursday that Clifford is in \"a serious condition\" and has yet to speak to officers. It added that a crossbow has been recovered as part of the investigation.\n\n\"This was an unprecedented attack and we are determined to understand the full circumstances of what happened that evening and the events leading up to it,\" said Detective Superintendent Rob Hall, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit. \"We are wholly committed to seeking justice for the victims and their family.\"\n\nAt a memorial service at St. James' Church nearby, shocked friends and neighbors expressed their sympathies for John Hunt and his one remaining daughter. Others laid flowers near the scene of the attack, which remained cordoned off.\n\n\"We grew up together and were pregnant at the same time,\" said Lea Holloway, who had known Carol Hunt since she was 16. \"This is the stuff nightmares are made of ... I can't imagine what it would be like.\"\n\nIn a post on Facebook, Hannah Hunt's colleagues at The Anti-Ageing Clinic nearby said it was with \"deep regret and sadness\" that they learned of the \"horrific murder on Tuesday night of our skin therapist Hannah.\"\n\nOthers remembered Louise Hunt through her work as a dog groomer. \"RIP Louise. Reggie says thank you for making him look so handsome,\" said one card accompanying a floral tribute left near the crime scene.\n\nPolice have not yet said how or whether Clifford was connected to the women, but said they believed the attack was targeted. British media reported that Clifford was an ex-boyfriend of one of the victims.\n\nAs well as searching Clifford's house, police were also seen at a house linked to his brother, Bradley Clifford, who was jailed for life with a minimum term of 23 years for the murder of moped passenger Soban Khan in 2018.\n\nThe BBC confirmed the victims were the family of its sports commentator John Hunt, the main racing commentator for BBC 5 Live, the corporation's news and sports radio channel. His voice is known to millions through his coverage of the world famous Grand National and The Derby.\n\nBBC 5 Live's lead presenter Mark Chapman, who had regularly introduced Hunt's commentaries, struggled to hold back tears as he spoke about what had been \"a heartbreaking day.\"\n\nThe racing community also expressed its support for Hunt, with jockeys at Kempton Park Racecourse wearing black armbands and Newmarket Racecourse holding a minute's silence.\n\nPeople in Britain do not need a license to own a crossbow, but it is illegal to carry one in public without a reasonable excuse.\n\nThe new Labour Party government, which took office last week, said it would \"swiftly consider\" findings of a recently launched review into whether controls on owning crossbows should be tightened.\n\nSecurity Minister Dan Jarvis said Home Secretary Yvette Cooper would \"look clearly, very carefully at what happened yesterday - devastating events - and she will take a view in the near future.\"\n\nThe weapon has been used in several high-profile crimes in recent years.\n\nIn December 2021 a would-be assailant carrying a loaded crossbow broke into Windsor Castle seeking to kill Queen Elizabeth II. Jaswant Singh Chail pleaded guilty to a treason charge and was sentenced last year to nine years in prison.", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"},

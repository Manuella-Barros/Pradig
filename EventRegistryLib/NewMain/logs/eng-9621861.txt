He excelled in Naples, helping guide the club to its first league title since 1989-90 when Diego Maradona was starring for the team.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jenna_west@nytimes.com", "name": "Jenna West", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirving_Lozano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hirving Lozano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_MLS_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego MLS team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_Major_League_Soccer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Expansion of Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_Player_Rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated Player Rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachuca", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pachuca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pachuca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeppe_Tverskov", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeppe Tverskov"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Ingvartsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Ingvartsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Nordsj\u00e6lland", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Nordsj\u00e6lland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diego Maradona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

Lozano, who grew up in Laredo, Texas, is the first female Olympic fighter in any sport from her hometown, which sits near the border with Mexico. She hopes her Olympic qualification will give hope to many people in Laredo and Mexico that big things can be accomplished by people from small places.\n\nAt the end of her Pan American semifinal bout against Canada's McKenzie Wright, Lozano jumped and cried, knowing she had overcome many of the obstacles and cultural stereotypes she had encountered during her burgeoning boxing career. The win was a reward for this little girl who followed her dreams, even though many called her crazy for becoming a boxer. After hearing the final bell in her fight against Wright, Lozano immediately raised her hand, confident that she had qualified for the Olympics, and pointed to the sky in tribute to her grandmother, who died in 2017.\n\n\"It was such a great emotion that to this day I can't describe. I just thought about the great change it was going to be, not only in the city, but for the future generations of boys and girls who are from Laredo, who have that thought, that mentality that if you are born in Laredo, you die in Laredo,\" said Lozano, whose first started boxing to lose weight and little by little realized that she could stand out in tournaments. She tried other sports, such as soccer, basketball and track and field, but nothing excited her as much as boxing.\n\nUnder the guidance of Michelle and Eddie Vela, owners and coaches of Boxing Pride gym in Laredo, Lozano has become a rising star in U.S. boxing.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2019, she was champion of the National Junior Olympics and the National Golden Gloves. She also won the 50 kg at the 2023 Gee Bee International Tournament and gold at the 2022 USA Boxing Elite National Championship and the 2022 USA Boxing International Invitational.\n\n\"It's been a very long road,\" said Vela, her coach since age 11, when asked about qualifying for the Olympics. \"It was something we worked so hard for, so many years. It gives me chills just thinking about it. It was incredible to see that we finally made it.\"\n\nThe Boxing Pride gym taught Lozano the basics of pugilism and when she began defeating 16- and 17-year-olds when she was just 11, her trainer realized that \"La Traviesa\" could do great things. The gym became her home. She would stay for hours to train with Vela, forming a special relationship.\n\n\"We only have to give each other one look to know, 'OK, I know what you're telling me, I know what you're thinking.' We connect so well that a lot of people don't believe it. And we just always told each other everything. And I trust him a lot,\" the left-handed boxer said.\n\nLozano, the daughter of Rub\u00e9n Lozano and Yadira Rodr\u00edguez, natives of Tamaulipas, Mexico, earned her associate degree in 2021 from LBJ High School's innovative biotechnology and science academy amid her boxing training.\n\nThe hardest blow life dealt Lozano was at the age of 17, when she found her grandmother dead in her home in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico -- something that put her in \"a hole she felt she could never get out of.\"\n\nHer grandmother died in a shooting in her neighborhood, according to the boxer. Members of organized crime were searching for someone and shot at her grandmother's house, fatally wounding her. Lozano and her mother had not heard from her grandmother for days, so they decided to visit her in Nuevo Laredo. Upon arriving at the house, Lozano broke down a door and found her grandmother's lifeless body.\n\n\"I saw her body there on the floor and she was not in good condition,\" Lozano said. \"... I don't know, me and my mom never talked about it, but yes, that's how it happened.\"\n\nAfter her grandmother's death, Lozano said she felt a lot of resentment, depression and anxiety. She could not concentrate in school and was angry in the gym.\n\n\"I was so angry that I wanted to keep fighting. Out of four rounds we had to go, we ended up going eight or 12 rounds nonstop,\" Lozano said. \"I had a lot of bitterness, I wasn't focused or anything and it was very hard to get out of that hole I was in. It was very dark.\"\n\nA fight ultimately changed her focus.\n\nIn 2019, Lozano lost to Alyssa Mendoza at the USA Women's Youth National Championships. One punch in particular shook her up.\n\n\"I think it was a jab from her opponent that hurt her nose,\" Vela said, recalling the painful but important loss. \"That's when she realized that she had to come back, keep working and that was necessary to be in the place we are now.\"\n\n\"That's when I started to see things as they are and I got my act together,\" said Lozano, who realized after that loss that she couldn't be depressed.\n\nLozano focused on her mental health and thought she had to make a change. She thought of all the people who have gone through difficult times in her city. Most of all, she remembered the words of encouragement her grandmother would give her.\n\n\"She would tell me that I was going to do great things. That she loved me very much and that I should never forget her,\" said Lozano, who has tattooed in her mind the days when she used to watch Jackie Nava's fights with her grandmother and the flautas she made for her to eat.\n\n\"She told me: 'You'll see, mija, you'll see that you're going to be great. You keep working hard and working hard and it's all worth it.' \"\n\nAfter her 2019 loss, Lozano notched 11 straight wins in amateur boxing.\n\n\"What I learned is that you have to be thankful for who you have in front of you because you never, literally, never know if that's going to be the last time you see that person,\" she said.\n\nUSA Boxing also helped her recover mentally, just as it did with Jajaira Gonzalez, a Southern California boxer who also struggled with her mental health before qualifying for Paris 2024.\n\n\"Lozano is fantastic. She's had a difficult history as a child and the things that come with that. She's been focused, and she's had good fights,\" said USA Boxing's head coach, Billy Walsh. \"She's stood her ground, she hasn't let feelings get the best of her. She's very strong and has fought in the face of the toughest pressure, in the face of the biggest stress.\"\n\nLozano has helped other teammates, especially fellow Olympian Gonzalez, to be mentally strong.\n\n\"She's like my little sister. She pushes me and so like me just like her,\" Gonzalez said. \"She has a very strong mentality. I would like to be just as strong as her.\"\n\nWith her Olympic participation, Lozano said she wants to change the stigma that exists for people from South Laredo.\n\n\"We have a bad saying that what is from Laredo never progresses. That if you are born in Laredo you die in Laredo,\" said Lozano, who also is inspired by her sister Jessica, who moved to San Antonio to continue her education.\n\n\"I'm here to not only inspire and motivate, but equally to make a big change, not only in my city, but for all Hispanas, Latinas, Mexicans and all of Latin America. I want to be a global inspiration.\"", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirving_Lozano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hirving Lozano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Vela", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Vela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gym"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laredo,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Laredo, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Laredo, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_American_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pan American Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico\u2013United_States_border", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico\u2013United States border"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stereotype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santiago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santiago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gloves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golden Gloves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAU_Junior_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AAU Junior Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rodr\u00edguez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Rodr\u00edguez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

You keep working hard and working hard and it's all worth it.' \"\n\nAfter her 2019 loss, Lozano notched 11 straight wins in amateur boxing.\n\n\"What I learned is that you have to be thankful for who you have in front of you because you never, literally, never know if that's going to be the last time you see that person,\" she said.\n\nRead more: Emma Hayes aims to replicate her Chelsea success with U.S. women's soccer\n\nUSA Boxing also helped her recover mentally, just as it did with Jajaira Gonzalez, a Southern California boxer who also struggled with her mental health before qualifying for Paris 2024.\n\n\"Lozano is fantastic. She's had a difficult history as a child and the things that come with that. She's been focused, and she's had good fights,\" said USA Boxing's head coach, Billy Walsh. \"She's stood her ground, she hasn't let feelings get the best of her. She's very strong and has fought in the face of the toughest pressure, in the face of the biggest stress.\"\n\nLozano has helped other teammates, especially fellow Olympian Gonzalez, to be mentally strong.\n\n\"She's like my little sister. She pushes me and so like me just like her,\" Gonzalez said. \"She has a very strong mentality. I would like to be just as strong as her.\"\n\nWith her Olympic participation, Lozano said she wants to change the stigma that exists for people from South Laredo.\n\n\"We have a bad saying that what is from Laredo never progresses. That if you are born in Laredo you die in Laredo,\" said Lozano, who also is inspired by her sister Jessica, who moved to San Antonio to continue her education.\n\n\"I'm here to not only inspire and motivate, but equally to make a big change, not only in my city, but for all Hispanas, Latinas, Mexicans and all of Latin America. I want to be a global inspiration.\"\n\nThis article was first published in Spanish via L.A.

Lozano will remain with his current club, PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands, through the end of the year.\n\nLozano is the team's first Designated Player. Major League Soccer reserves that designation for high-priced stars whose lofty salaries do not count against the club's salary cap. According to ESPN, Lozano's salary will be in the range of seven to nine million - making him one of the highest paid players in the league.\n\n\"It's an honor to join San Diego FC as the Club's first Designated Player,\" said Lozano in the club's announcement. \"It's exciting to be part of history as we build a Club that will compete for championships in MLS.

SDFC will hold a public event for fans at the Rady Shell at 7 p.m.\n\nThe 28-year-old is perhaps most well known for his goal against Germany in Mexico's victory over the defending World Cup Champion in the 2018 World Cup. Lozano has over 70 caps and 18 goals since making his national team debut in 2016.\n\n\"Signing a player of the international stature of 'Chucky' Lozano is the biggest possible endorsement of our project in San Diego,\" said San Diego FC Owner and Chairman, Sir Mohamed Mansour in the team's announcement.\n\nHis club career began in Liga MX with Pachuca. In 149 matches Lozano netted 43 goals and 31 assists.\n\nIn 2017 he went overseas, joining PSV. His first season included 17 goals and 11 assists in 29 appearances. Lozano helped them take the Eredivisie title in 2018. He also helped them lift the Dutch league crown in May. In 112 games with PSV Chucky had 46 goals and 26 helpers.\n\nLozano has also spent time in Italy playing for Napoli, where he claimed the Serie A championship in 2023. While with Napoli he recorded 30 goals and 17 assists in 155 matches.\n\n\"'Chucky' is a world-class talent, and we couldn't think of a better star to be the face of our Club and represent our region,\" San Diego FC CEO Tom Penn said in the team's statement. \"We are thrilled to have him join our Club as we look to build a team that will challenge for trophies. 'Chucky' is one of the most decorated Mexican internationals in the world, and we look forward to seeing him shine in San Diego and MLS in 2025.\"\n\nTom Bogert is a Major League Soccer insider for The Athletic and told NBC 7 he believes Lozano could be a Top-10 player in the league.\n\n\"I can not say enough good things about this signing,\" Bogert said. \"In (his) prime, somebody who is gonna move the needle on the field first and foremost, that's most important. But off the field this is really gonna help with relevancy. This is really gonna help with pushing them center stage in the league and a way to announce to the rest of MLS, 'hey we're here'.\"\n\nLozano is the fourth player San Diego FC has signed. The first was San Diego native Duran Ferree - who played for the Loyal and is now in goal for Orange County SC of the USL. They also added forward Marcus Ingvartsen and midfielder Jeppe Tverskov from FC Nordsj\u00e6lland - a Danish club within the Right to Dream network that San Diego FC is now joining.\n\n\"That's obviously huge,\" Tverskov told NBC 7 about Lozano's addition. \"That's one of the things that they talked to us about, that they had a dream to bring a big star from Mexico and I think they brought the biggest one. So of course that's gonna be big for us, it's gonna be even more hype.\"\n\n\"A great player,\" Invgartsen added. \"Been doing well in his last couple of years, so yeah it will be fun to link up there.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsandiego.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 7 San Diego"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_MLS_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego MLS team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirving_Lozano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hirving Lozano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_Player_Rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Designated Player Rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liga_MX", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liga MX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.S.C._Napoli", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.S.C.

While this means that they're moving on an accelerated timeline to get things done, that isn't something that is slowing San Diego down as they've just announced a marquee signing in Mexican international and Scudetto winner Hirving \"Chucky\" Lozano. Lozano will become the first designated player in club history with a contract until the end of the 2028 MLS season. As the club won't join MLS until 2025, Lozano will remain at PSV through 2024 before coming to San Diego.\n\nJoining from PSV after winning the Eredivisie with them and scoring six goals in league play, Lozano will move stateside during a big period of soccer in North America. While Lozano won't be involved in Copa America play for Mexico this summer, this is the type of signing that makes sense with the World Cup coming to the United States, Canada, and Mexico in 2026, as he looks to potentially get back into the fold.\n\nSan Diego are well poised to take advantage of more signings like this but not just because of the World Cup. With executives like Tom Penn, who has been through building an expansion team before with Los Angeles FC, and academy connections, San Diego are looking to make a name in their first season using global connections as a base to get off the ground.\n\n\"Signing a player of the international stature of 'Chucky' Lozano is the biggest possible endorsement of our project in San Diego,\" said San Diego FC owner and chairman, Sir Mohamed Mansour.\n\nAs San Diego builds their roster, it's hard not to compare this signing to another one that Penn was involved with when Carlos Vela joined LAFC. Leaving Real Sociedad at the time, Vela took MLS by storm winning an MVP and breaking the league record for goals in a season with 34 while also lifting MLS Cup with the Black and Gold. If Lozano can have even half the impact that Vela did, they could take the league by storm in their inaugural season.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chuck_booth@cbssports.com", "name": "Chuck Booth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirving_Lozano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hirving Lozano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_MLS_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego MLS team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scudetto", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scudetto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_Player_Rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Designated Player Rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Mansour_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Mansour (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLS Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Vela", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlos Vela"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Expansion team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Sociedad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Sociedad"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/06/06/860b6426-fc39-46f8-9b37-da71f7b3943d/thumbnail/1200x675/ec387d2a9a4222657c71def601ed1ffe/loazno.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621861", "eventUri": "eng-9621861", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

'Chucky' is one of the most decorated Mexican internationals in the world, and we look forward to seeing him shine in San Diego and MLS in 2025.\"\n\nSan Diego FC will officially introduce Lozano to fans in San Diego on Thursday, June 13 during a press conference at Snapdragon Stadium.", "source": {"uri": "fox5sandiego.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSWB 5/69"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amber_coakley@fox5sandiego.com", "name": "Amber Coakley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_MLS_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego MLS team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirving_Lozano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hirving Lozano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KUSI-TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "KUSI-TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_Player_Rule", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated Player Rule"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Mansour_(businessman)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohamed Mansour (businessman)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Dream_Academy", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Right to Dream Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachuca", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pachuca"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pachuca"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mexico"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapdragon_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snapdragon Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Penn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Penn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eredivisie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eredivisie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONCACAF", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Sports", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/AFC", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/OFC", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://fox5sandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/06/AP24088109729630.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9621861", "eventUri": "eng-9621861", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-13", "textStart": 1870, "textEnd": 1877}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Two years later, Pachuca won the Liga MX championship.\n\nLozano left in 2017 for Europe and Dutch club PSV Eindhoven, which promptly won the league title.\n\nThe next stop was Italy and Napoli, which last spring won its first Serie A title in 33 years, since it had an Argentine midfielder named Diego Maradona.\n\nLozano transferred back to PSV Eindhoven over the summer ... and won another Dutch title, PSV's first since he left.\n\nThe diminutive midfielder with the demonstrative r\u00e9sum\u00e9 now comes to Major League Soccer expansion franchise San Diego FC in a marquee signing that becomes official this morning. A public welcome ceremony with Lozano is scheduled for June 13 at the Rady Shell.\n\nThe agreement, for a reported transfer fee of $12 million, allows Lozano to remain with PSV Eindhoven through the calendar year before joining San Diego FC ahead of its February 2025 launch. He signed a multiyear contract with San Diego worth an estimated $7 million annually as a \"designated player,\" one of three MLS clubs are allowed above and beyond the salary cap.\n\n\"It's very exciting to be the face of San Diego FC,\" Lozano told the Union-Tribune in Spanish in an exclusive interview. \"I haven't had that opportunity before. I'm looking forward to that. I have a championship mentality. I've won at every club I've been at. I'm looking to continue that here.\"\n\nOr as Enrique Meza, the former Pachuca and Mexico national coach who gave Lozano his professional debut, put it: \"I'm not saying it's all him, but Napoli hadn't been a champion in 30 years and then Chucky arrives and that club becomes a champion. He's a champion wherever he goes. He was just a champion in the Netherlands again. I don't think that's by chance.\"\n\nChucky -- pronounced \"CHOO-key\" and nicknamed for the horror film character because of his propensity to hide under blankets and scare people -- fits for other reasons. He's a small (5-foot-9, 154 pounds), speedy, silky outside midfielder who has scored goals in the World Cup and against some of Europe's biggest clubs. He's 28, at the height of his powers. He's from Mexico and can appeal to the county's soccer-literate Hispanic community.\n\nHe also, perhaps most importantly, can help sell the Right to Dream vision to millions of Mexican youths.\n\nSan Diego FC is owned by Egyptian billionaire Mohamed Mansour, who also has invested in the Right to Dream youth academy that started in Ghana and now has facilities in Denmark and Egypt. SDFC is building a $150 million campus on the Sycuan reservation -- Sycuan is also a majority owner of the club -- in the eastern portion of the county.\n\nRight to Dream offers a unique development model. The year-round, fully residential academy will start players at age 12. When players reach 17, the road forks -- to pro soccer or to an educational path through U.S. college soccer. Because the SDFC academy is located within 30 miles of Mexico, international rules allow it to pull players from both sides of the border.\n\nIt's a chief reason, Lozano says, why he opted to leave Europe while still in his 20s.\n\n\"Honestly, in my head, I thought I wanted to spend more time in Europe,\" Lozano said. \"But when San Diego approached me and gave me the option to join, it was a great option for me. It was a very important decision for me. Every part of the project, the people who have spoken to me, everything, was very special.\n\n\"I identified with this project a lot immediately. Right to Dream has helped so many youth players globally. We have the opportunity now to help Mexican youth and give them all the things that Right to Dream offers.\"\n\nSo San Diego FC was one reason. San Diego is another.\n\nHe plans to move his family here in the winter.\n\n\"The truth is, I hadn't really seen San Diego,\" said Lozano, who visited last weekend to finalize contract details. \"I had been to San Diego before with the national team, but I hadn't really seen it until a few days ago when I came and drove around and saw the city. We loved the city, we loved the people.\n\n\"The climate is amazing. You're close to Mexico, and that's important for me. There is a big Mexican-American community. I just love the city so much. It's a place where you can have a good life.\"\n\nLozano was hoping to be in San Diego next week for different reasons. Mexico's national team arrives Sunday for a training camp in Chula Vista ahead of the Copa America, the 16-team tournament for men's national teams from North, Central and South America that begins June 20 at 14 venues across the United States.\n\nBut coach Jaime Lozano (no relation) recently released his 31-player provisional roster, and Chucky, who scored 18 goals in 70 appearances for El Tri, was not on it. Neither were goalkeeper Guillermo \"Memo\" Ochoa, forward Raul Jimenez and several other veterans. Chucky Lozano took the high road, issuing a video on social media wishing the youngsters good luck.\n\n\"Truthfully, when I didn't get the call for the national team, I was mentally ready for it,\" he said. \"I was a little sad I wasn't going. Copa America is a tournament with a lot of great teams participating in it, and as a player you always want to be part of those great moments. But that was a personal decision for the coach.\"\n\nMLS has a mixed track record when it comes to call-ups to the Mexican national team. League MVP Carlos Vela was snubbed from the 2022 World Cup roster while leading Los Angeles FC to a championship, as was legendary Los Angeles Galaxy forward Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez.\n\n\"The main thing for me is doing my job well at the club level,\" said Lozano, who played in the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, scoring twice. \"I will continue to work hard and win my spot on the national team. I will give 100 percent every day, and I still think I have the possibility to be considered.\"\n\nAnd MLS?\n\n\"There's been a big change from when I was young, watching the league and seeing it now and how much it's grown,\" he said. \"It's been a huge change. There have been so many important players and big names who have played in this league. It's a league that has a big project in mind and big objectives.\n\n\"In the near future, it will be a very important league in the world. I want to be part of this project. ... And I'm at a great age to do great things in this league.\"\n\nFor Meza, who spotted Lozano in Pachuca's youth academy and gave him his senior debut, it's a natural move.\n\n\"Hirving has been in Europe for (seven) years, and I think he's maybe wanting to come closer to home,\" Meza said. \"San Diego offers him that. He's played for some of the top clubs in the world and in two World Cups. He's had an amazing career. I'm so, so happy for him to take this step.\n\n\"He's a champion wherever he goes. I hope he brings that to San Diego.\"", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_MLS_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego MLS team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirving_Lozano", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hirving Lozano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Dream_Academy", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right to Dream Academy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.F._Pachuca", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "C.F.

Read his archive here and follow him on Twitter: @cesarhfutbol.\n\nMexican winger Hirving \"Chucky\" Lozano has been announced as the first Designated Player (DP) signing for MLS expansion side San Diego FC, the club confirmed on Thursday.\n\nESPN reported earlier this week that Lozano will have a four-year contract and a proposed salary between the $7 to $9 million range. With the Mexico international as the team's first high-profile signing, San Diego FC and staff continue preparations for their debut MLS season in 2025.\n\n\"It's an honor to join San Diego FC as the club's first Designated Player,\" Lozano said in a news release.\n\n\"It's exciting to be part of history as we build a club that will compete for championships in MLS. In every country I have played, I always strive to leave a mark, and making an impact for San Diego and in MLS is very important to me.\n\n\"The club's project and plans for San Diego's Right to Dream Academy resonated deeply with the career path I've had in this sport. I identified with the project immediately and I am confident we will be able to help a lot of youth players from both sides of the border. I am beyond excited and look forward to finishing the year strong with PSV Eindhoven and joining San Diego FC at the start of 2025.\"\n\nLozano, who will have two option years with San Diego FC after the end of the 2028 season, will be introduced to fans and media next Thursday.\n\n\"Signing a player of the international stature of 'Chucky' Lozano is the biggest possible endorsement of our project in San Diego,\" said San Diego FC owner and Egyptian billionaire Sir Mohamed Mansour.\n\n\"His journey from Pachuca, Mexico, to the world stage resonates with how Right to Dream provides opportunities for talent everywhere, and we hope that story can inspire and motivate the next generation of talent in San Diego County and around the world.\"\n\nA product of Pachuca's famed academy, the 28-year-old has made a name for himself abroad through stints with Serie A's Napoli and the Eredivisie's PSV Eindhoven, where he has played twice. During his time in Europe, he's collected a Serie A trophy and two Eredivisie titles.\n\nSince his Mexican national team debut in 2016, Lozano has earned 70 caps and secured 18 goals along the way, but was recently left out of the 2024 Copa America roster --- along with a handful of other high-profile veteran players.\n\nAt San Diego FC, Lozano is just the fourth player to be signed after goalkeeper Duran Ferree, Jeppe Tverskov, and Marcus Ingvartsen. Tverskov and Ingvartsen play for San Diego FC sister club FC Nordsj\u00e6lland and are expected to arrive in the 2025 preseason camp with Lozano. Ferree, a U.S. youth international that was San Diego FC's first-ever signing, is on loan with the USL Championship's Orange County SC.\n\nThe MLS club has yet to announce a head coach or sporting director, and was recently linked with AS Monaco technical director Carlos Avi\u00f1a Ibarrola before talks fell through.\n\nAlong with Mansour, San Diego FC is owned by the Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation (the first Native American tribe to be part of an ownership group of a professional soccer team in the U.S.), San Diego Padres infielder Manny Machado, Zephyr Partners' Brad Termini, and the Right to Dream's Tom Vernon and Dan Dickinson.\n\nRun by Mansour's London-based Man Capital firm, the Right to Dream is an academy system that has locations in Ghana, Egypt, Denmark, and soon, San Diego.

Especially since three local high schools brought home NCA titles.\n\nBut what does it take to get there? A lot of hours in the studio with top tier communication skills. And that is exactly what Nixon's cheer captain Jasmeen Lozano did this past year.\n\nShe started cheerleading in the fifth grade, at a studio at Studio One. She transitioned into dance in middle school but she had to make the hard decision to transition back into cheer in high school.\n\nTo Lozano, it's more than just being on the mat or being on the sidelines of a football game. She feels that with cheer comes life skills, such as communication and leadership.\n\nThose core values of leadership were at the helm this past year since Lozano had the pleasure of being the Lady Mustangs' cheer captain. And becoming the cheer captain was no easy process, it wasn't handed over to just any senior, there was a whole audition.\n\n\"To become the cheer captain, you had to be on the team all four years and you had to come up with your own dance, like a routine. And you had to perform it for judges. Then from there we went through an interviewing process. I think the judges understood me and they were from out of town, so they had no idea who I was really but they really liked what I brought to the table. They asked me what my main goal was for the program and I responded, 'To bring home Nixon's first NCA title.'\"\n\nLucky enough for Lozano and the Nixon cheer team, they accomplished just that back in January. For the first time in program history, a NCA banner is flying in the Nixon gym.\n\nNo one was really expecting the cheer program to win a title. Of course Lozano knew they could do it but she carried an underdog mentality with her the whole season. The sponsors and coaches knew they could bring home a title as well. And the sponsors are newer to the program, over the last year the girls lost their old sponsors and had to work through the progress of finding new ones. Lozano was devastated when the sponsors were lost but she put a lot of faith into whoever would be coming into the program and she wanted to prove that as the captain she would be willing to adapt to whatever came her way.\n\n\"In the beginning, a lot of the girls were nervous for new leadership but I have always believed in motivation and I feel like I rallied around them and told them it was all going to be ok. To this day I think it all paid off because we now have such a strong love for our sponsors. And right now, since I'm graduating and moving on to college I told the new captain some tips and tricks I learned along the way. The program is going to be in great hands here on out,\" Lozano said. \"Briana Flores is going to be the new captain and I know she can do it. I see her leadership skills shine through every single day, even outside of cheer. She just knows what she wants and she is a go-getter.\"\n\nThe Nixon cheer program competed in the small, all-girls category at NCA, with 16 girls on the team. It was three days worth of competition with day two playing a huge role in overall scores to be able to bring home a title. There was a lot of judging and critiques along the way but in the end it didn't matter.\n\nIt was one of their best performances they've ever competed. And when it came down to the wire, a lot of the girls thought they got second place. A lot of them started to react as if they got second place but then it hit them that they were the overall winners.\n\n\"I have a very strong faith. Before every performance I invite the team to pray and that very day when the title was placed before us, we celebrated really quickly and then we all got in a circle, put the trophy in the middle and prayed again to say thank you, because I can't take any credit, no one can really. All the credit goes to God. This is a blessing and not everyone can achieve this moment. It was just an amazing moment,\" Lozano said.\n\nNow that she has graduated, Lozano's mindset is now on college. She will be attending TAMIU in the fall, looking to pursue business in international trade. She hopes to one day own her own business here in town. Lozano doesn't think cheer is in her future in college, although it may be the closing of one chapter, she has the opportunity to open a new book. Coaching might be in her future for the cheerleading youth around town.\n\nLozano wants to spend her time training and giving back to the next generation of cheerleaders because of the positive impact all of her coaches gave her along the way. It's a simple gesture she hopes to pursue in the next year.\n\nOne of those coaches or more formally, sponsors, that has seen Lozano thrive is Dr. Adelina Flores-Garza.\n\n\"Her concern, commitment, and consideration for others contribute directly to her sustained high morale. Lozano's genuine interest in people is displayed in her continuous participation in projects and organizations that support and promote diversity and teamwork.

{"id": 225011742, "title": "\u2018All Eyes on Rafah\u2019 Meaning and Origins", "text": "The slogan \u201cAll Eyes on Rafah\u201d has ricocheted across social media this week following an Israeli strike in the Gazan city that killed dozens of civilians and provoked international outrage. For months, the phrase has been a touchstone in the social and cultural dialogue around Israel\u2019s war against Hamas in the region. It has periodically trended on social media, particularly as Israeli military attacks in the city \u2014 located in the southern Gaza Strip, along the Egyptian border \u2014 have escalated. On Wednesday, the saying was once again trending, this time through what appears to be an A.I.-generated image showing a field of refugee tents spelling out \u201cAll Eyes on Rafah.\u201d One version of the graphic has been shared more than 38 million times on Instagram. The phrase may have originated in comments made in February by Rik Peeperkorn, who heads the World Health Organization\u2019s office for Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Mr. Peeperkorn was speaking at a news conference as the Israeli military intensified its campaign in the southern Gaza strip. \u201cAll eyes are on Rafah,\u201d Mr. Peeperkorn said at the time. The comment was almost immediately repurposed by pro-Palestinian and humanitarian groups to draw attention to Gaza and Rafah, which was one of the last remaining destinations for displaced Palestinians from other parts of the territory. Among them were Save the Children International, Oxfam and, later, pro-Palestinian lobbying groups like Jewish Voice for Peace. The saying was also heard at pro-Palestinian protests that swept across Western universities earlier this month. The deadly strike in Rafah on Sunday was quickly denounced by world leaders. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said the attack had killed two Hamas officials, and he called the civilian deaths a \u201ctragic accident.\u201d", "summary": "The slogan, which has been a touchstone for pro-Palestinian demonstrators for months, ricocheted across social media this week.", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/29/world/middleeast/all-eyes-on-rafah.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/05/29/multimedia/29mideast-crisis-rafah-social-media-1-btfp/29mideast-crisis-rafah-social-media-1-btfp-facebookJumbo.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:15:20", "author": "Ali Watkins", "authors": ["Ali Watkins"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.276}

{"id": 223745968, "title": "Ryon Sayeri is USC\u2019s future at kicker, but he wants to be the present", "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Ryon Sayeri positioned himself behind a tee, this dance perfectly choreographed by now. Once and twice and thrice, the USC commit slid to his left, his left leg locking, his face an immovable mass of stone. Once and twice and thrice, he strode toward the football, his plant-leg curving upon itself, torquing and delivering another 40-yarder through the uprights at Chaminade High. The afternoon rays scorched off the blue turf of his alma mater in the San Fernando Valley, threatening to melt another pair of Sayeri\u2019s cleats. He stayed, engrossed in the same routine. After an hour, trainer Cole Murphy issued a challenge to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. \u201cFive-ball scatter?\u201d he asked Sayeri. Sayeri nodded, expression unchanged. Murphy, a former Syracuse kicker, took five footballs out of a bin, tossing them at various points across the field. One landed by the left hashes on the 20-yard line. One landed at midfield on the 30. One landed back at the 42. One by one, Sayeri set up a tee, slid to his left, strode and nailed each, finishing with a 57-yarder that split the pylons with a cushion to spare. \u201cHe\u2019s a gamer,\u201d Murphy said while watching Sayeri kick, a kid needing little direction. Come fall camp, USC\u2019s kickers are set for perhaps the most quietly fascinating positional battle on the roster. The program converted just two-thirds of its field goals in 2023, ranking 109th in the country; head coach Lincoln Riley told reporters in early April that taking a step up at kicker had been \u201cone of our big offseason goals.\u201d In late April, USC nabbed Georgia Southern kicker Michael Lantz out of the portal, set to battle for the job with incumbents Denis Lynch and Tyler Robles. Sayeri is the future, the first All-American selection in Chaminade program history. But he\u2019s also trying to be the present. He had a handful of collegiate scholarships on the table this winter, with full rides from San Jose State and San Diego State, only to commit to USC as a preferred walk-on. The bet was simple, a quiet conviction: Sayeri believes, fully, that he\u2019ll be Lincoln Riley\u2019s kicker this fall. Chaminade coach David Machuca would try to impart upon Sayeri in his recruitment: Dude, you have a scholarship to SDSU and San Jose. Why not go and start there, on scholarship, and then transfer to USC? \u201cI straight-up told him,\u201d Sayeri said, \u201cI have faith that I could go to any school in the nation and start automatically.\u201d \u2018Make sure you\u2019re remembered\u2019 Five years ago, Sayeri entered Chaminade as a scrawny 13-year-old soccer convert who had never played football. But his right leg hummed with confidence, and Machuca couldn\u2019t help but notice. At that time, Chaminade\u2019s starting kicker was current Syracuse punter Jack Stonehouse. But Machuca, then an assistant at Chaminade, got in longtime coach Ed Croson\u2019s ear. \u201cHey,\u201d Machuca remembered telling Croson, \u201cI think the young guy\u2019s better than him.\u201d \u201cNah,\u201d Croson would hem, \u201che\u2019s a freshman.\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Machuca would counter, \u201che keeps making \u2019em.\u201d Five years later, Machuca and Sayeri walked into a USC spring practice in April, two months before Sayeri was set to move in. They chatted with Drew Fox, an assistant director of player personnel. They chatted with Zach Hanson, USC\u2019s tight ends coach. They chatted with other staffers. Machuca told them all the same thing: Sayeri was going to win the job as a freshman. It happened before, Sayeri beating out Stonehouse that freshman year at Chaminade en route to a standout high school career. And those around Sayeri are fully convinced it\u2019ll happen again at USC. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of kid that you can plug-and-play,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda tough to find a lot of those kids.\u201d In sessions with Murphy, Sayeri trains with two GoPros positioned on either side of him, capturing a front-and-back angle of his swing. His plant leg has become almost double-jointed, seemingly bending backward to snap power into his swing. It\u2019s built off a Murphy-ingrained philosophy of staying close to the ball, similar to the swing of legendary Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker. Technique, however, is secondary to sheer mentality as a collegiate kicker. There is an edge, a steadiness as a performer, that some kids simply don\u2019t have, Murphy said. He\u2019s sent plenty of trainees to see a sports psychologist. He\u2019s never needed to send Sayeri. \u201cI\u2019ve really never seen him get nervous before,\u201d Murphy said. Pressure, still, lingers in Sayeri\u2019s mind entering USC. It was always a goal to play a sport in college. But Sayeri bet on himself in picking USC. And with a starting job hanging in the balance, and more importantly a scholarship, want has become need. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things he wants to achieve there,\u201d Sayeri\u2019s dad, Matt, said. \u201cThat\u2019s our mindset, that\u2019s my \u2013 like, when you\u2019re going to go there, just make sure you\u2019re remembered.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not just some empty footsteps in a hallway.\u201d Gunning for the top job Sayeri knows competition will be fierce, particularly as USC\u2019s incumbent is one of the most beloved faces on the roster. In September, in the midst of his second year as USC\u2019s starting kicker, Lynch was finally put on scholarship. When Riley announced the news to the team in the fall, they \u201cerupted,\u201d Riley remembered, requesting Lynch come up for a speech. In the days to come, reporters asked members of the program exactly what Lynch said. Nobody was able to put it into words, Lynch was an unsolvable enigma, a kid whose go-to drink at Starbucks \u2013 as described by Murphy, who has also long worked with Lynch \u2013 is an iced chocolate milk. \u201cIt was really bizarre,\u201d Riley remembered, \u201cand then at the end it was like, \u2018And thank you,\u2019 and walked off. That\u2019s just Denis for you.\u201d Lynch, the dripped out, milk-drinking favorite, is the \u201cking of the hill\u201d for USC\u2019s job at the moment, as Murphy described. But USC\u2019s staff, particularly special teams analyst Ryan Dougherty, has been clear to the faces in the room, Murphy said: To win the job, you have to separate yourself. In April, Dougherty told Sayeri he wanted all of USC\u2019s kickers to be above 80% accuracy. Sayeri\u2019s entire mentality since has shifted in his workouts, suddenly keeping track of every single make or miss. If USC wanted 80%, Sayeri figured, he\u2019d shoot for 90%. \u201cThe coach made it clear, like, \u2018We wanted change,\u2019\u201d Sayeri said. \u201cLike, \u2018We want to be a top specialist school.\u2019 And I think we could do that, and that\u2019s my goal.\u201d Lynch has been hit-or-miss on field goals for a couple of years, hovering around 70%, but has been solid on extra points. Incoming transfer Lantz nailed 23 of 28 tries (82.1%) last year at Georgia Southern. But Sayeri isn\u2019t focusing on anyone but himself, he said, quietly leaning against a bench after his workout. \u201cI think, if I kick how I did today, any single day,\u201d Sayeri said, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any doubt in my mind.\u201d", "summary": "The All-American from Chaminade High is determined to start as a true freshman as the Trojans recognize the need to improve at kicker.", "url": "https://www.ocregister.com/2024/05/26/ryon-sayeri-is-uscs-future-at-kicker-but-he-wants-to-be-the-present/", "image": "https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/LDN-L-PREP-VP-CHAM-1111-16.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:30:58", "author": "Luca Evans", "authors": ["Luca Evans"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.023}

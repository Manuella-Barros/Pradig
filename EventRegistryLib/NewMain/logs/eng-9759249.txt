Here's a list of states that have passed resolution against NEET. West Bengal Assembly Passes Resolution Against NEET, Wants to Revert to Old System.\n\nOn Wednesday, the West Bengal Assembly passed a resolution to scrap NEET and replace it with a state-level entrance exam for medical studies. State Education Minister Bratya Basu criticised the centralisation of exams, recalling initial opposition to NEET from Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he was Gujarat's Chief Minister. Basu argued that NEET undermines the federal structure and disadvantages students from rural areas. NEET 2024 Row: Tamil Nadu Assembly Passes Resolution Again Urging Centre To Exempt State From National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test.\n\nThe Tamil Nadu Assembly has urged the Union government to abolish NEET and revert to state-based medical admissions using Class 12 marks. Chief Minister M.K. Stalin argued that the pre-NEET admission method was more inclusive for rural students and made medical education affordable. The resolution emphasized that NEET affects students' opportunities from rural areas and diminishes state governments' rights to manage medical college admissions.\n\nKarnataka's Cabinet approved a resolution to scrap NEET, proposing a new entrance exam for undergraduate and postgraduate medical students. Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar highlighted the serious irregularities in NEET and called for states to conduct their own entrance tests. He emphasised that the Centre's mishandling of NEET has jeopardized the futures of lakhs of students.\n\nThe Kerala Legislative Assembly passed a resolution seeking a comprehensive investigation into NEET and UGC NET exam irregularities by the National Testing Agency (NTA). Higher Education Minister Dr. R Bindu condemned NTA's conduct, citing unscientific grace marking and repeated examination lapses. Bindu urged the Union government to address the concerns of students and parents and ensure the integrity of medical admissions.\n\nThe resolutions from these states reflect widespread dissatisfaction with NEET, particularly following claims of a question paper leak in the NEET-UG 2024 exam. The Supreme Court recently ruled out a re-test, stating there was no conclusive proof of a breach. However, the growing chorus of state-level opposition signals significant discontent with the centralised examination system and calls for a return to state-managed admissions processes.\n\n(The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Jul 24, 2024 05:13 PM IST.

ANI file\n\nA day after the Supreme Court pronounced its judgment on the NEET-UG row, West Bengal on Wednesday passed a resolution to scrap the exams over distrust of the National Testing Agency.\n\nThe Trinamool Congress-led West Bengal government has moved to replace the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test with its own state-run medical exams for students who wish to pursue a career in medicine.\n\nWhile passing the resolution in the state assembly, West Bengal's Education Minister Bratya Basu said that they were never in favour of conducting an all-India examination. The resolution also slammed the NTA over its inability to conduct free and fair entrance tests.\n\nBasu said, \"When the exams were handed over to the Centre in brazen step of dismantling the federal structure, there were protests from our side. The then Chief Minister of Gujarat Narendra Modi had said that NEET exams should not be handled by the Centre.\"\n\nWB joins TN, K'taka\n\nWith this, Bengal has joined the ranks of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to ban the exams in their respective states.\n\nThe first state to do so was Tamil Nadu which unanimously passed a resolution against NEET in the assembly. The resolution allowed state governments to undertake medical admissions based on class 12 marks, as was done before NEET's implementation.\n\nEarlier, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MP K. Kanimozhi reiterated the demand to \"exempt\" Tamil Nadu from NEET, conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA) for medical admissions across the country.\n\n\"Tamil Nadu has been consistently saying that we do not want NEET. Now it is proved that NEET is not a fair examination, and students are losing so much because of NEET,\" Kanimozhi said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Karnataka, the cabinet, earlier this week, approved a proposal to scrap the medical exams in the state.

In 2019, the responsibility for conducting NEET was handed over to the National Testing Agency (NTA), an agency specifically created to handle national-level entrance exams. Despite its intended benefits, NEET has faced significant opposition and controversy since its inception.\n\nFrom the beginning, several states, including Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, voiced their objections to NEET. They argued that a single, standardised exam could not fairly accommodate the diverse educational systems, languages, and syllabi across India. Each state has its unique education system, and imposing a uniform exam threatened to exacerbate the rural-urban divide. Critics feared that NEET would favour urban students who have better access to educational resources, English-medium instruction, and specialised coaching centres. Furthermore, states were concerned that NEET might undermine their local reservation policies designed to benefit disadvantaged populations, potentially denying these groups preferred admissions.\n\nDespite these concerns, NEET brought about several improvements in the medical admission process. It standardised the admission procedure, reducing discrepancies across states. NEET also lessened the financial burden on students and their families by eliminating the need for multiple entrance exams.\n\nUnequal playing field\n\nHowever, the implementation of NEET was not without its shortcomings. The primary issue lies in the mismatch between the NEET syllabus and the state board syllabi. NEET primarily follows the CBSE curriculum, which differs significantly from many state board curricula. This discrepancy puts students from state boards at a disadvantage, as they may not be adequately prepared for the NEET. Though NEET was conducted in multiple languages, the quality and availability of study material and coaching for languages other than English and Hindi are limited. This creates an additional hurdle for students from rural areas and those who study in regional languages, and is perhaps one of the major reasons for the alleged malpractices.\n\nThe dependency on expensive coaching centres also increased, creating an unequal playing field for students from economically weaker sections who cannot afford such coaching. The high-stakes nature of a single exam determining the students' future causes stress and pressure, negatively impacting their mental health. Furthermore, students in rural and remote areas faced challenges in reaching designated exam centres, which were often far from their homes. This added logistical and financial burdens, adversely impacting rural students.\n\nInclusive syllabus, multiple exams in a year could help\n\nSeveral potential alternatives and improvements can address these issues. Firstly, making the NEET syllabus inclusive of different state board syllabi would level the playing field for all students. Improved regional language support, with high-quality study material and coaching available in all regional languages, is crucial. Conducting NEET multiple times a year could reduce the pressure on students and provide them with more opportunities to perform well. Ensuring robust counselling and mental health support for students would help them cope with the stress associated with the exam. Increasing the number of exam centres in rural and remote areas would make the exam more accessible to all students. Provision of scholarships and financial aid for students from economically weaker sections would enable them to access necessary coaching and study material.\n\nWhile these improvements could create a more equitable and effective medical entrance examination system in India, there is a need to address more fundamental and systemic issues. This applies not only to NEET but to all entrance exams in India. The shift to the plus-two system has significantly increased educational commercial activity, particularly private coaching. The recent controversies surrounding paper leaks, despite the enactment of central laws to prevent such malpractices, highlight the need to examine the fairness and justice of testing and evaluation systems.\n\nThere are reports indicating that the syllabi for entrance examinations for both engineering and medical courses cover only about half of what is taught in Classes 11 and 12 across various states. Furthermore, there is a lack of adequately trained professionals for teaching, testing, and evaluation. In some technical universities, millions of answer sheets need to be checked annually, yet there are no trained teachers or professionals available for such a monumental task. This results in perfunctory evaluations and encourages malpractices, such as fake certificates and paid evaluations.\n\nMoreover, it is well-known that many Indian students who do not perform well in national or state entrance exams excel in international exams, such as the SAT, GRE, and GMAT. This discrepancy is because these international exams test students on what they have been taught or should know at an appropriate level, and the evaluation burden is minimised.\n\nImprovements, systemic reforms\n\nLong-term reforms in testing and evaluation are necessary to end controversies like the ongoing NEET issue. Ensuring that school syllabi are aligned with entrance exams in a manner that eliminates the need for additional private coaching is crucial. Legislative measures to contain the unethical proliferation of coaching centres and \"Kota factories\" are also essential. Children should be tested on what they have been taught or should know at an appropriate level. Testing should be commensurate with knowledge imparted in schools.\n\nNEET was designed to test students on the knowledge and skills they have acquired up to the 12th standard, with a syllabus based on topics covered in physics, chemistry, and biology (botany and zoology) in Classes 11 and 12, following the NCERT curriculum. However, this alignment is not always accurate, particularly for schools in rural and semi-urban areas and non-English medium schools, where teaching standards need improvement and learning outcomes are low and require constant monitoring.\n\nThough NEET was introduced with the objective of making several positive changes to the medical admission process in India, it is essential to address its inherent flaws and disparities. The NTA should evolve decentralised structures of implementation without conceding any space to mischief-mongers to manipulate the distant centralised systems. With these improvementSs and systemic reforms, India can move towards a more equitable and effective medical entrance examination system, ultimately ensuring fair opportunities for all aspirants. sureshkumarnangia@gmail.com", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Syllabus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEET", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NEET"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Regional language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Board_of_Secondary_Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Board of Secondary Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Testing_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Testing Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reservation in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medical school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telangana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telangana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andhra Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_Nadu", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tamil Nadu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bengal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Bengal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scholarship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scholarship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hindi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Welfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rural area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Council_of_Educational_Research_and_Training", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Council of Educational Research and Training"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Institute of technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_test", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Standardized test"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SAT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kota,_Rajasthan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kota, Rajasthan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kota, Rajasthan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Education", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/22/1600x900/A-student-holds-a-placard-demanding-re-examination_1721676933924.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9759249", "eventUri": "eng-9759249", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Mr. Chattopadhyay alleged corruption in the NEET examination this year and said it was the biggest corruption in the education system.\n\nParticipating in the discussion, Education Minister Bratya Basu said NEET had put the fate of 24 lakh examinees in jeopardy. The Minister said Prime Minister Narendra Modi opposed NEET when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat. Mr. Basu added that before 2016 when the entrance examination to medical colleges was held by the States there were no allegations of irregularities.\n\nThe BJP legislators opposed the resolution. Participating in the debate, BJP legislator Sankar Ghosh said the Trinamool Congress had no moral right to speak about irregularities or corruption in the education system, particularly at a time when the Central agencies are probing recruitment scam in State-run schools. The BJP chief whip in the House alleged that transparency and Trinamool Congress did not go hand in hand.

Thus, so many students stood first in NEET-UG,\" Basu said.\n\n\"The credibility of NTA is in question now. Why were all students given grace marks? NTA is unable to give details about the grace marks,\" Basu further said. \"Last year, 50 students received 700 marks but this time, it is 300.

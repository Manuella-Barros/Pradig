Meanwhile, HD's Revanna's son and Prajwal Revanna was issued Blue Corner Notice by the Interpol.\n\nThe SIT officials had arrested HD Revanna on May 4 in a kidnapping case registered against him. The leader was arrested from his father, former Prime Minister and JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowde's house in Padmanabha Nagar in Bengaluru. SIT is also investigating allegations of rape against HD Revanna and Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna in the obscene videos case.\n\nThe charges against HD Revanna erupted after a complaint was filed by a woman's son, accusing him of kidnapping and illegally confining his mother, who is a mother of three. Following the rejection of his bail plea, Revanna was remanded to SIT custody after a medical examination at Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital.\n\nPrajwal, who is also a JD(S) MP from Hassan and was a BJP-JD(S) candidate for the Lok Sabha seat, is facing charges including rape and molestation.\n\nThe abduction complaint against HD Revanna was lodged by the victim's son, who claimed that a close aide of the MLA, Sathish Babanna, had taken his mother away on a motorcycle under false pretenses. Allegations of coercion to prevent the victim from speaking to the police were also made.\n\nFollowing this, a series of FIRs registered, including one accusing HD Revanna of abduction and illegal detention. In the first case in Holenarasipura, the cook and relative of the Revannas complained that H D Revanna and his son Prajwal had molested her, as reported by PTI. In the second complaint at CID Bengaluru, a JD(S) leader accused Prajwal of raping her at gunpoint, videographing the incident and then blackmailing her. The third complaint is against HD Revanna pertaining to the abduction and illegal detention of a woman.\n\nBefore his court appearance, Revanna denied any involvement, labeling the accusations as a \"political conspiracy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Prajwal Revanna remains abroad, with efforts underway to bring him back to India.

He was arrested after a kidnapping complaint was lodged against him by one victim's son at the KR Nagar Police station in Bengaluru.\n\nA Blue Corner Notice has been issued against JD(S) MP Prajwal Revanna, facing sexual abuse allegations, said the Karnataka government on Sunday. His MLA father HD Revanna was remanded to custody in a related case.\n\nMeanwhile, the Congress sharpened its attacks on on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the matter, asking him to break his 'silence' on the issue in which the BJP's alliance party (JD-S) leader is accused.\n\nThe Congress-led Karnataka government announced financial assistance to those were allegedly sexually assaulted by Prajwal.\n\n\"Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has announced financial assistance to the rape victims who are in hundreds, since it is a unique case which has never happened in the last 75 years,\" Congress general secretary and the party's Karnataka in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala said at a press conference in the presence of the state CM, in Bengaluru.\n\nWith Prajwal stated to have left the country, a Blue Corner notice has been issued against him and the Interpol's help is being taken to bring the NDA's Hassan Lok Sabha candidate back to India, Karnataka Home Minister Dr G Parameshwara said.\n\nWhat is Blue Corner Notice?\n\nA Blue Corner Notice is issued by the international police cooperation body to collect additional information from its member countries about a person's identity, location or activities in relation to a crime.\n\n\"Already Blue Corner notice has been issued. The Interpol will inform all the countries and locate him,\" Parameshwara told reporters.\n\nExplicit video clips allegedly involving the 33-year-old Prajwal, grandson of JD(S) patriarch and former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda, had started making the rounds in Hassan in recent days, following which the state government constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the sexual abuse allegations against the MP.\n\nMeanwhile, on Sunday, Prajwal's father and JD(S) MLA, HD Revanna was remanded to police custody till May 8 by a Bengaluru court in connection with a case of alleged kidnapping and illegal confining of a woman.\n\nRevanna was arrested on Saturday by the SIT after his bail plea was rejected in the case related to kidnapping and illegally confining a woman who is the mother of three children. Police had also arrested one Sathish Babanna in connection with the abduction and secured the victim from a farmhouse.\n\nThe FIR was registered against the 66-year-old Revanna based on a complaint by the woman's son on Thursday. After his medical examination at the Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital here, the former minister was produced before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, who remanded him to the custody of the SIT.\n\nThe SIT was formed by the Karnataka government on the recommendation of the Karnataka State Commission for Women chief Nagalakshmi Chowdhary after a huge cache of explicit videos of Prajwal, allegedly sexually abusing women, became public.\n\nThere are three FIRs registered in connection with the sexual abuse allegations, involving the father and son, in total. In the first case in Holenarasipura, the cook and relative of the Revannas complained that the two had molested her. In the second complaint at CID Bengaluru, a JD(S) leader accused Prajwal of raping her at gunpoint, videographing the incident and then blackmailing her.\n\nThe third complaint is against HD Revanna pertaining to the abduction and illegal detention of a woman. Before being produced before the magistrate, Revanna claimed there is no evidence of his involvement. \"There are no evidences pertaining to the May 2 complaint. It's a big political conspiracy...A conspiracy was hatched against me,\" Revanna told reporters at the Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, where he was taken for a medical checkup. The Congress on Sunday once again targeted PM over the issue and asserted that its women's wing will keep raising its voice until Prajwal is brought back to India to face the law.\n\nAll India Mahila Congress chief Alka Lamba slammed Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani and National Women Commission Chairperson Rekha Sharma for being silent on the case. \"Today half the population of the country is demanding that Smriti Irani and Rekha Sharma break their silence,\" she said at a press conference at the AICC headquarters in New Delhi. Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge has also expressed concern over the matter and former party chief Rahul Gandhi has written a letter to the Karnataka chief minister, asking for strict action, Lamba said.\n\n\"Prime Minister, break your silence. Until PM Modi brings Prajwal Revanna from Germany and hands him over to the Karnataka government, Mahila Congress will raise its voice from every corner of the country.

Revanna is the son of former Prime Minister and JD(S) patriarch HD Deve Gowda. His arrest comes after his bail plea was rejected in a case related to kidnapping and illegally confining a woman who is the mother of three children.\n\nThe arrest came after an FIR was filed against 66-year-old Revanna based on a complaint by the woman's son on Thursday. The SIT was formed by the Karnataka government on the recommendation of the Karnataka State Commission for Women chief Nagalakshmi Chowdhary after a huge stock of obscene videos of Revanna's son, JD(S) MP from Hassan Prajwal Revanna went viral. Let's take a look at all the latest updates in the case:\n\nThe victim's 20-year-old son filed a complaint STATING that HD Revanna's close aide, Sathish Babanna, abducted his mother on April 29 on a motorcycle, claiming that the JD(S) leader wanted to see her. The complaint was filed with the KR Nagar police.\n\nPrajwal Revanna, the BJP-JD(S) candidate of Hassan Lok Sabha constituency, has been booked under charges of rape and molestation. A case against Revanna has been registered under sections 354A, 354D, 506, and 509 of the IPC on charges of sexual harassment, intimidation, and outraging the dignity of a woman. As per the complaint, the victim has claimed that Prajwal Revanna and his father HD Revanna had sexually assaulted her.\n\nThere are three FIRs registered in connection with the sexual abuse allegations, involving the father and son, in total. In the first case in Holenarasipura, the cook and relative of the Revannas complained that H D Revanna and his son Prajwal had molested her.\n\nALSO READ: Congress Leader Charanjit Singh Channi Calls Poonch Attack A 'Pre-Planned Stunt' To Win Polls; BJP Hits Back\n\nIn the second complaint at CID Bengaluru, a JD(S) leader accused Prajwal of raping her at gunpoint, videographing the incident and then blackmailing her.\n\nThe third complaint is against HD Revanna pertaining to the abduction and illegal detention of a woman.\n\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) issued a Blue Corner Notice against the grandson of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda. The notice has been issued after the JDS leader who reportedly left for Germany a day after the Lok Sabha polls, failed to appear before the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the allegations.\n\nSoon after being arrested by the Karnataka Police, JDS leader HD Revanna said on Sunday that a \"political conspiracy\" was being played against him. Revanna's remarks came as he was being taken for a medical examination during the day.", "source": {"uri": "english.jagran.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jagran English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(Secular)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (Secular)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Deve_Gowda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "H.

Instead, they are expressing outrage against the Congress, saying that there is a political conspiracy behind these cases.\n\nHowever, it is surprising that BJP leader Ashoka has spoken harsh words in this case. Also, this has given a shock to the leaders and workers of the allied party JD(S).\n\nR Ashok also talked about the effect of the Prajwal case and Revanna's arrest on the alliance and said, \"Alliance is at the centre level. It is the superiors who decide on the continuation of the alliance.\"\n\nEarlier, reacting to the arrest of JD(S) MLA HD Revanna, Union Minister and BJP leader Shobha Karandlaje said on Sunday that crimes against women will not be tolerated.\n\nShe said this while holding a door-to-door campaign for Kalaburagi Lok Sabha constituency BJP candidate Umesh Jadhav here.\n\n\"SIT has been formed. He (HD Revanna) has been arrested. The case will go to the court. Law and order is a state issue. The law will take its course. The case will go further because we will not tolerate any crime against women,\" Karandlaje, who is also the BJP candidate from Bengaluru North Lok Sabha seat, said.\n\nHD Revanna was taken into custody by Special Investigation Team (SIT) officials on Saturday in connection with a kidnapping case registered by the KR Nagar police in Mysuru involving the survivor of a sexual assault allegedly by his son, Hassan JD(S) MP, Prajwal Revanna, who remained at large.

Three FIRs registered, including one against H D Revanna for abduction and illegal detention.\n\nThe Karnataka government on Sunday said a Blue Corner Notice has been issued against JD(S) MP Prajwal Revanna, facing sexual abuse allegations, while his MLA father was remanded to custody in a related case. The Congress party kept up the attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the matter, asking him to break his 'silence' on the issue in which the BJP's alliance party leader is accused.\n\nThe Congress-led Karnataka government announced financial assistance to those were allegedly sexually assaulted by Prajwal.\n\n''Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has announced financial assistance to the rape victims who are in hundreds, since it is a unique case which has never happened in the last 75 years,'' Congress general secretary and the party's Karnataka in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala said at a press conference in the presence of the state CM, in Bengaluru.\n\nWith Prajwal stated to have left the country, a Blue Corner notice has been issued against him and the Interpol's help is being taken to bring the NDA's Hassan Lok Sabha candidate back to India, Karnataka Home Minister Dr G Parameshwara said.\n\nA Blue Corner Notice is issued by the international police cooperation body to collect additional information from its member countries about a person's identity, location or activities in relation to a crime.\n\n''Already Blue Corner notice has been issued.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, Prajwal's father and JD(S) MLA, HD Revanna was remanded to police custody till May 8 by a Bengaluru court in connection with a case of alleged kidnapping and illegal confining of a woman.\n\nRevanna was arrested on Saturday by the SIT after his bail plea was rejected in the case related to kidnapping and illegally confining a woman who is the mother of three children.

It's a big political conspiracy...

The JD(S) MLA was arrested soon after a Bengaluru court rejected his anticipatory bail plea.\n\nThe former minister was picked up from the Padmanabhanagar residence of his father, JD(S) supremo and former prime minister H D Deve Gowda, and brought to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) office.\n\nOfficials said a case was registered against Revanna, a former Minister and son of JD(S) patriarch and former PM H D Deve Gowda and his confidant Sathish Babanna in Mysuru on Thursday night for allegedly abducting a woman, who is also reportedly a victim of alleged sexual abuse by his son and MP Prajwal Revanna.\n\nThe SIT had later rescued the alleged victim from a farmhouse owned by one Rajasekhar, a close aide of Revanna, in Kalenahalli area, police said, adding that the woman's statement will be recorded soon.\n\nThe incident came to light after the woman's son filed a complaint, claiming that his mother, who worked as a maid at the house of HD Revanna for almost five years, had been kidnapped from her house by the MLA's relative, Satish Babanna on April 29.\n\nThe complainant stated his mother is being held captive at a farmhouse owned by Rajasekhar in Kalenalli, following which a SIT, which is probing the sexual abuse allegations against the father-son duo, mounted a rescue operation and freed her.\n\nBabanna has already been arrested in connection with the case.\n\nRevanna has been charged under Section 364(a) (kidnapping for ransom, etc), 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine a person) and 34 (the acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).\n\nMeanwhile, Karnataka Home Minister Parameshwara Sunday said a \"Blue Corner Notice\" has been issued against Prajwal Revanna to locate the whereabouts of the Hassan MP who reportedly fled the country after allegations of sexual assault surfaced against him.", "source": {"uri": "india.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "India News, Breaking News, Entertainment News | India.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(Secular)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (Secular)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holenarasipura", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holenarasipura"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Holenarasipura"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Deve_Gowda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "H.

Revanna being brought for medical check-up at a government hospital. ( Image Source :PTI )\n\nNew Delhi: Holenarasipura MLA H D Revanna on Sunday called his arrest over the allegations of abducting a woman, whom Revanna's son is alleged to have sexually abused, an outcome of a political conspiracy. This comes as Bengaluru's 17 ACMM court has sent Revanna to SIT custody till May 8, news agency ANI reported. The former minister, who is the son of former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda, is facing the charge of kidnapping and unlawfully confining a woman who is the mother of three children.\n\nThe complaint was lodged by the woman's son on Thursday. Revanna claimed there is no evidence of his involvement in the case based on the complaint against him registered on May 2.\n\nNotably, HD Revanna was brought to Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospital for medical examination after he was arrested yesterday by SIT officials in a kidnapping case registered against him.\n\nAccording to news agency ANI, he said, \"It's a political conspiracy going on against me. In my 40 years of political life, I have never seen anything like this.\"\n\n\"There are no evidences pertaining to the May 2 complaint. It's a big political conspiracy... A conspiracy was hatched against me,\" he told reporters at the Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, where he was taken for a medical checkup before being produced in court, news agency PTI reported.\n\nA case was registered against former minister H D Revanna and his associate Sathish Babanna in Mysuru on Thursday night for allegedly kidnapping a woman. The complaint, filed by the woman's son, also alleges that H D Revanna's son, Prajwal Revanna, who is the BJP-JD(S) candidate for the Hassan Lok Sabha seat, sexually abused the woman, reported PTI.\n\nALSO READ| 26/11 Martyr Hemant Karkare 'Not Killed By Terrorists': Maha Cong Leader Sparks Row, Draws Flak From BJP\n\nBabanna has been arrested in connection with the case, which involves allegations of kidnapping to prevent a woman from testifying against Prajwal Revanna, according to police sources. H D Revanna faces charges under Sections 364(a) (kidnapping for ransom, etc), 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent to secretly and wrongfully confine a person), and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nSeeking anticipatory bail in the case, H D Revanna had approached the Special Court for Elected Representatives, which dismissed his plea on Saturday. H D Revanna's advocates promised the court that he would attend interrogation by the SIT if the bail plea was granted. However, the SIT public prosecutor objected to his bail application.\n\nOn Saturday, police officials rescued the abducted woman from a farmhouse, allegedly belonging to an aide of H D Revanna at Kalenahalli village in Hunsur taluk of Mysuru district. So far, two FIRs have been registered against H D Revanna.\n\nTwo separate FIRs have been filed against Revanna and his son Prajwal. The first case, lodged at the Holenarsipura police station in Hassan district, involves allegations of sexual harassment made by a woman who previously worked at the Revannas' residence. The second FIR, registered in Mysuru, accuses H D Revanna and his confidant Babanna of abducting the same woman, who is also reported to be a victim of sexual abuse.\n\nThe emergence of explicit video clips purportedly involving 33-year-old Prajwal Revanna in Hassan has led the state government to establish an SIT to investigate the alleged sexual abuse allegations against the MP, as per PTI.\n\nPrajwal Fled Country Under Nose Of PM Modi & Amit Shah: Rahul Gandhi\n\nThe sexual abuse allegations surrounding Prajwal have escalated into prompting a political showdown between the Congress and the BJP-JD(S) alliance. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi led the attack, alleging that Prajwal Revanna fled the country under the very nose of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah.\n\nGandhi further demanded an apology from PM Modi, alleging support for a \"mass rapist\" and claiming that Prajwal Revanna had sexually abused nearly 400 women\n\nChief Minister Siddaramaiah has urged PM Modi to cancel Prajwal's diplomatic passport.The BJP has rejected the Congress' charge and distanced itself from the episode, stating that it concerns only the MP and law will take its course.\n\nIn a counter-attack, Shah accused the Siddaramaiah government of allowing Prajwal Revanna to leave the country by not taking timely action.Fourteen Lok Sabha constituencies in Karnataka will go to polls on May 7.", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(Secular)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (Secular)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Trust_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Press Trust of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_News_International", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asian News International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holenarasipura", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holenarasipura"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Holenarasipura"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Deve_Gowda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "H.

The episode has stirred a huge controversy in the state ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. Voting for the 14 Lok Sabha seats is scheduled to be conducted on Tuesday (May 7). His son Prajwal Revanna, who is the sitting JD(S) MP and NDA candidate from Hassan Lok Sabha constituency is the prime accused in the sex videos case. Prajwal Revanna has fled the country and a Blue Corner notice has been issued against him.

HD Revanna is maintaining that he has no connection with the kidnapping of the victim. The SIT has also recorded the statements of the second accused in the kidnap case, Satish Babu and HD Revanna's PA Rajgopal.\n\nThe victim's son has said in his complaint to the police that Satish Babu, who is HD Revanna's relative, took the victim on his bike on the behest of the MLA.\n\nThe development had taken place after the video containing the footage of the lady being sexually assaulted by Prajwal Revanna surfaced. Rajgopal had allegedly kept the lady in his farm house as per the direction of HD Revanna.\n\nSources explained that the SIT will further grill HD Revanna, based on the statements by other accused in the case.\n\nHD Revanna is in the custody of the SIT till May 8. The court is likely to take up his bail petition only after May 8, considering the developments surrounding the case.

The Congress party kept up the attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the matter, asking him to break his 'silence' on the issue in which the BJP's alliance party leader is accused.\n\nThe Congress-led Karnataka government announced financial assistance to those were allegedly sexually assaulted by Prajwal.\n\n\"Chief Minister Siddaramaiah has announced financial assistance to the rape victims who are in hundreds, since it is a unique case which has never happened in the last 75 years,\" Congress general secretary and the party's Karnataka in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala said at a press conference in the presence of the state CM, in Bengaluru.\n\nWith Prajwal stated to have left the country, a Blue Corner notice has been issued against him and the Interpol's help is being taken to bring the NDA's Hassan Lok Sabha candidate back to India, Karnataka Home Minister Dr G Parameshwara said.\n\nA Blue Corner Notice is issued by the international police cooperation body to collect additional information from its member countries about a person's identity, location or activities in relation to a crime.\n\n\"Already Blue Corner notice has been issued. The Interpol will inform all the countries and locate him,\" Parameshwara told reporters.\n\nExplicit video clips allegedly involving the 33-year-old Prajwal, grandson of JD(S) patriarch and former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda, had started making the rounds in Hassan in recent days, following which the state government constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the sexual abuse allegations against the MP.\n\nMeanwhile, on Sunday, Prajwal's father and JD(S) MLA, HD Revanna was remanded to police custody till May 8 by a Bengaluru court in connection with a case of alleged kidnapping and illegal confining of a woman.\n\nRevanna was arrested on Saturday by the SIT after his bail plea was rejected in the case related to kidnapping and illegally confining a woman who is the mother of three children. Police had also arrested one Sathish Babanna in connection with the abduction and secured the victim from a farmhouse.\n\nThe FIR was registered against the 66-year-old Revanna based on a complaint by the woman's son on Thursday.\n\nAfter his medical examination at the Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital here, the former minister was produced before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, who remanded him to the custody of the SIT.\n\nThe SIT was formed by the Karnataka government on the recommendation of the Karnataka State Commission for Women chief Nagalakshmi Chowdhary after a huge cache of explicit videos of Prajwal, allegedly sexually abusing women, became public.\n\nThere are three FIRs registered in connection with the sexual abuse allegations, involving the father and son, in total.\n\nIn the first case in Holenarasipura, the cook and relative of the Revannas complained that the two had molested her. In the second complaint at CID Bengaluru, a JD(S) leader accused Prajwal of raping her at gunpoint, videographing the incident and then blackmailing her.\n\nThe third complaint is against H D Revanna pertaining to the abduction and illegal detention of a woman.\n\nBefore being produced before the magistrate, Revanna claimed there is no evidence of his involvement.\n\n\"There are no evidences pertaining to the May 2 complaint. It's a big political conspiracy... A conspiracy was hatched against me,\" Revanna told reporters at the Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, where he was taken for a medical checkup.\n\nThe Congress on Sunday once again targeted PM over the issue and asserted that its women's wing will keep raising its voice until Prajwal is brought back to India to face the law.\n\nAll India Mahila Congress chief Alka Lamba slammed Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani and National Women Commission Chairperson Rekha Sharma for being silent on the case.\n\n\"Today half the population of the country is demanding that Smriti Irani and Rekha Sharma break their silence,\" she said at a press conference at the AICC headquarters in New Delhi.\n\nCongress President Mallikarjun Kharge has also expressed concern over the matter and former party chief Rahul Gandhi has written a letter to the Karnataka chief minister, asking for strict action, Lamba said.\n\n\"Prime Minister, break your silence. Until PM Modi brings Prajwal Revanna from Germany and hands him over to the Karnataka government, Mahila Congress will raise its voice from every corner of the country. Not only us, half the population of the country (women) will ask you questions,\" she said.\n\n\"Mahila Congress will 'gherao' PM Modi everywhere, because we are not afraid of your power and police machinery,\" she said.

The BJP leader also welcomed the arrest of JD(S) leader and Prajwal Revanna's father HD Revanna by the SIT in connection with the case.\n\n\"If Karnataka's intelligence was intact, they wouldn't have left him, whose mistake is this, being a state government you would have written a letter to stop him from leaving,\" Ashoka said.\n\n\"I welcome the action taken by the SIT arresting HD Revanna, they must take strict action against him, this is our stand,\" he added.\n\nHe also pointed out Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's previous social media posts from 2019 supporting Prajwal Revanna when the Congress and JD(S) were in alliance.\n\n\"On 17.04.2019, Siddaramaiah sought votes for JDS, he also praised Prajwal Revanna.

Now let Siddaramaiah tell why he supported him, he's still an MP who had a coalition with Congress,\" he added.\n\nRevanna was booked in the case on April 28 based on a complaint lodged at Holenarasipura Town police.\n\nThe case was registered under sections 354A, 354D, 506, and 509 of the IPC on charges of sexual harassment, intimidation, and outraging the dignity of a woman. As per the complaint, the victim claimed that Prajwal Revanna and his father HD Revanna had sexually assaulted her. A look out notice has been issued against Prajwal Revanna who is currently claimed to be in Germany.\n\nPrajwal Revanna is the grandson of JD(S) party supremo and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda.\n\nSpeaking on the alleged obscene video case earlier this month, Amit Shah said that BJP stands with the 'Matr Shakti' while criticising the ruling Congress government in Karnataka for allegedly delaying action.\n\n\"BJP's stand is clear that we stand with the 'Matr Shakti' of the country.

While speaking exclusively to Republic Media's Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami, Amit Shah said that the case will backfire on the grand-old party and not on the BJP.\n\nAlleging that Congress was trying to protect Revanna, Shah said they released the videos two days after the Vokkaliga belt voted and waited for Revanna to flee the country.\n\nHe said that Congress calculated the political gains and losses and then released the video late.\n\nShah said,\" The case will affect Congress, not us. Congress definitely hid the video. Due to political reasons, losses and gains, they took the steps late.\"\n\nShah said Prajwal must be punished and those involved should not be spared.\n\nHe said,\" I myself had posted the stance of my party that strict actions should be taken against the accused and no one involved should be spared, even though it is our comrade .\"\n\nThe emergence of Prajwal's obscene videos and arrest of his father and MLA, HD Revanna, have proved to be a setback for the Janata Dal (Secular) (JDS) and HD Kumaraswamy, his uncle and former Karnataka Chief Minister, who is aiming to rebuild the party from grassroots levels by joining hands with BJP this election season.\n\nAccording to sources in the party, many party members are in dilemma to continue their association with the Deve Gowda's party following the sleaze episode of Prajwal which can have a bearing on the Vokkaliga community's backing on the party in the state. The sex scandal is said to have loosened the grip of the Revanna family over the Vokkaliga community, biggest backer of JDS.\n\nSIT Gets 4-Day Custody of HD Revanna\n\nMeanwhile, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the scandal was on Sunday granted four-day custody of Prajwal's father and tainted JDS leader HD Revanna, also an accused in the case. HD Revanna, who is the son of former prime minister HD Deve Gowda, was produced before magistrate Ravindra Kumar B Kattimanni at his residence where SIT officials had sought five-day custody of the Holenarasipura MLA.\n\nHD Revanna was on Saturday arrested over charges of abducting and illegally confining a woman (also mother of three children), whom his son and primary accused in the case - Prajwal Revanna - is alleged to have sexually abused. The complaint was lodged by the woman's son on Thursday.\n\nRevanna called his arrest an \"outcome of a political conspiracy\", and claimed there is \"no evidence\" of his involvement in the case based on the complaint against him registered on May 2.\n\nAll About Sex Videos Case Involving Prajwal Revanna\n\nPrajwal Revanna, 33-year-old grandson of JD(S) supremo and former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda, was the NDA candidate in the Hassan Lok Sabha constituency, which went to polls on April 26. JDS is contesting the elections in alliance with the BJP in the state.\n\nRevanna is currently embroiled in an alleged sex scandal as many sex videos allegedly featuring him with multiple women have been doing the rounds in recent days.\n\nKarnataka government constituted a Special Investigation Team to probe an alleged sex scandal involving Revanna. The SIT is headed by Additional Director General of Police (CID) Bijay Kumar Singh. The other two are Assistant Inspector General of Police Suman D Pennekar and Mysuru Superintendent of Police Seema Latkar.\n\nRevanna escaped to Germany shortly after polling in the first phase of elections in the state got over on April 26. He is the sitting MP from Hassan and has been fielded by the NDA in this Lok Sabha elections.

There was no free supply of sanitary napkins and no facility to dispose of used napkins; they did not even have sturdy cots to sleep on.\n\nThe Revanna family faces escalating challenges as the Special Investigation Team (SIT) has ramped up its international search for the absconding , a sitting JD(S) MP and candidate for Hassan. In the wake of 's arrest on Saturday, three additional victims of the alleged have come forward to approach the .\n\nSources indicate that these victims presented themselves to the SIT following HD Revanna's arrest, with plans for their statements to be recorded soon. Further details on this development are pending. Speculation is rife that Prajwal Revanna, the prime accused in the case and son of JD(S) MLA HD Revanna, may surrender to authorities following his father's arrest. A dedicated team from the SIT has already embarked on a mission abroad, specifically Budapest, Hungary, to apprehend Prajwal Revanna based on intelligence regarding his movements. His frequent changes in location have made tracking him a challenge.\n\nThere are reports suggesting Prajwal Revanna might arrive at Mangaluru International Airport, although conflicting information implies his return may coincide with the conclusion of the Lok Sabha elections, possibly a tactic to mislead authorities. The SIT, taking no risks, has heightened vigilance across all airports nationwide.\n\nAdditionally, the SIT is expected to file another FIR related to the and sexual assault of an elderly woman, allegedly by Prajwal Revanna. She is currently in SIT custody after being rescued from a farmhouse belonging to HD Revanna's PA Rajagopal in Mysuru district.\n\nThe video depicting the ordeal of the rescued woman portrays Prajwal Revanna disregarding her pleas and committing acts of sexual assault despite her fervent protests, including reminders of her service to his family. The distressing footage sparked widespread public outcry after circulating on social media.\n\nIn a separate incident recounted in the second FIR, another victim, a local JD(S) leader who is married, narrated her harrowing experience. She disclosed in her CID complaint that Prajwal Revanna had threatened to release a rape video if she dared to report him. The initial FIR against Prajwal Revanna stemmed from a complaint forwarded by the State Women's Commission.\n\nCong plans financial assistance for victims\n\nDuring Sunday's press conference, Congress general secretary and Karnataka's party in-charge, Randeep Singh Surjewala, announced that the Congress government in Karnataka would extend financial assistance to individuals allegedly sexually assaulted by Prajwal Revanna. Surjewala highlighted the demand made by former Congress president Rahul Gandhi for appropriate actions against the accused. \"Chief Minister Sidda-ramaiah has pledged financial support to the numerous victims of sexual assault, an unprecedented case in the last 75 years,\" Surjewala remarked during the conference.\n\nSurjewala also expressed concerns regarding the actions taken by the External Affairs Ministry, questioning why Prajwal was not prevented from fleeing abroad and why his diplomatic passport was not canceled by the Prime Minister. He further inquired about the absence of a blue corner notice through Interpol to facilitate Prajwal's return. In response to these concerns, Sidda-ramaiah assured that a blue corner notice would indeed be issued to bring Prajwal back to India.\n\nHelpline set up\n\nThe Special Investigation Team (SIT) initiated a helpline for victims involved in the Prajwal Revanna sexual abuse case. Previously established to address sexual harassment cases in Hassan district, the SIT discovered additional victims related to the incident. Victims or informants seeking legal aid, security, or assistance can reach out to the helpline at 6360938947, ensuring confidentiality. Home Minister, Dr G Parameshwara, announced the issuance of a blue corner notice and having solicited Interpol's assistance in apprehending Prajwal.

He then filed a kidnapping complaint against HD Revanna and his associate Babanna.\n\nThe Holenarsipura MLA and his associate were booked under Sections 364A (kidnapping for ransom), 365 (kidnapping with intent to cause harm), and 34 (common intention) of the IPC.\n\nThe FIR, registered by KR Nagar police, also lists HD Revanna as accused number one and another man, identified as Babanna, as accused number two.\n\nHD Revanna and his son, Prajwal Revanna, who is the sitting MP and candidate from Hassan Lok Sabha constituency, are facing a probe by a Special Investigative Team (SIT), constituted by the Karnataka government, over allegations of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation following a complaint by a woman who worked in their household.\n\nKarnataka has 28 Lok Sabha seats and elections in the state are being held in two phases. Voting for 14 seats concluded on April 26 and the remaining 14 seats will undergo polling on May 7. The counting of votes is scheduled for June 4.\n\nIn 2019, BJP almost swept the state by winning 25 out of 28 seats, while Congress and JD-S -- who were running a coalition government in the state -- could only win one seat each.\n\nThis time BJP and JD-S are in coalition with the former fighting on 25 seats, while the latter is contesting on three seats.

The Interpol will inform all the countries and locate him,\" Parameshwara told reporters.\n\nExplicit video clips allegedly involving the 33-year-old Prajwal, grandson of JD(S) patriarch and former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda, had started making the rounds in Hassan in recent days, following which the state government constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the sexual abuse allegations against the MP.\n\nMeanwhile, on Sunday, Prajwal's father and JD(S) MLA, HD Revanna was remanded to police custody till May 8 by a Bengaluru court in connection with a case of alleged kidnapping and illegal confining of a woman.\n\nRevanna was arrested on Saturday by the SIT after his bail plea was rejected in the case related to kidnapping and illegally confining a woman who is the mother of three children. Police had also arrested one Sathish Babanna in connection with the abduction and secured the victim from a farmhouse.\n\nThe FIR was registered against the 66-year-old Revanna based on a complaint by the woman's son on Thursday.\n\nAfter his medical examination at the Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital here, the former minister was produced before the Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, who remanded him to the custody of the SIT.\n\nThe SIT was formed by the Karnataka government on the recommendation of the Karnataka State Commission for Women chief Nagalakshmi Chowdhary after a huge cache of explicit videos of Prajwal, allegedly sexually abusing women, became public.\n\nThere are three FIRs registered in connection with the sexual abuse allegations, involving the father and son, in total.\n\nIn the first case in Holenarasipura, the cook and relative of the Revannas complained that the two had molested her. In the second complaint at CID Bengaluru, a JD(S) leader accused Prajwal of raping her at gunpoint, videographing the incident and then blackmailing her.\n\nThe third complaint is against H D Revanna pertaining to the abduction and illegal detention of a woman.\n\nBefore being produced before the magistrate, Revanna claimed there is no evidence of his involvement.\n\n\"There are no evidences pertaining to the May 2 complaint. It's a big political conspiracy... A conspiracy was hatched against me,\" Revanna told reporters at the Bowring and Lady Curzon Hospital, where he was taken for a medical checkup.\n\nThe Congress on Sunday once again targeted PM over the issue and asserted that its women's wing will keep raising its voice until Prajwal is brought back to India to face the law.\n\nAll India Mahila Congress chief Alka Lamba slammed Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani and National Women Commission Chairperson Rekha Sharma for being silent on the case.\n\n\"Today half the population of the country is demanding that Smriti Irani and Rekha Sharma break their silence,\" she said at a press conference at the AICC headquarters in New Delhi.\n\nCongress President Mallikarjun Kharge has also expressed concern over the matter and former party chief Rahul Gandhi has written a letter to the Karnataka chief minister, asking for strict action, Lamba said.\n\n\"Prime Minister, break your silence. Until PM Modi brings Prajwal Revanna from Germany and hands him over to the Karnataka government, Mahila Congress will raise its voice from every corner of the country. Not only us, half the population of the country (women) will ask you questions,\" she said.\n\n\"Mahila Congress will 'gherao' PM Modi everywhere, because we are not afraid of your power and police machinery,\" she said.

They criticize Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani and NCW Chairperson Rekha Sharma for their silence on the matter. Congress president Kharge and Rahul Gandhi have expressed concern, demanding strict action. The Mahila Congress threatens to protest until Prajwal Revanna is extradited from Germany. A BJP leader had reportedly informed the party about the case, which the Congress believes implicates PM Modi in defending Prajwal Revanna. The JD(S) has suspended Prajwal, and his father H D Revanna has been arrested in a related kidnapping case. A Blue Corner notice has been issued, and Interpol's assistance is sought to bring Prajwal Revanna back to India.\n\nThe Congress on Sunday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to break his ''silence'' on Karnataka's alleged sex scandal involving JD(S) leader Prajwal Revanna, and asserted that its women's wing will keep raising its voice until he is brought back to India to face the law.\n\nAll India Mahila Congress chief Alka Lamba slammed Women and Child Development Minister Smriti Irani and National Women Commission Chairperson Rekha Sharma for being silent on the case.\n\n''Today half the population of the country is demanding that Smriti Irani and Rekha Sharma break their silence,'' she said at a press conference at the AICC headquarters here.\n\nCongress President Mallikarjun Kharge has also expressed concern over the matter and former party chief Rahul Gandhi has written a letter to the Karnataka chief minister, asking for strict action, Lamba said.\n\n''Prime Minister, break your silence. Until PM Modi brings Prajwal Revanna from Germany and hands him over to the Karnataka government, Mahila Congress will raise its voice from every corner of the country. Not only us, half the population of the country (women) will ask you questions,'' she said.\n\n''Mahila Congress will 'gherao' PM Modi everywhere, because we are not afraid of your power and police machinery,'' she said.\n\nLamba said a BJP leader had written a letter to the Karnataka BJP state president informing him about Prajwal Ravanna's involvement in the ''mass rape case.'' The BJP already knew about thousands of his ''obscene'' videos, she claimed.\n\n''Yet PM Modi asks for votes for Prajwal Revanna and Prajwal and his father are seen standing with HD Revanna,'' she said and played out the video of Modi campaigning for them.\n\n''All this shows that PM Modi is defending Prajwal Revanna,'' she alleged.\n\nShe said that a delegation of Mahila Congress had met the NCW on April 30 over the case and sought action.\n\n''Today is May 5, but no response has come from the National Commission for Women,'' she said.\n\nPrajwal and his father H D Revanna, a former Karnataka minister, were booked by police on Sunday on charges of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation based on a complaint from a woman, who worked in their household.\n\nPrajwal is the grandson of former prime minister H D Deve Gowda and a nephew of Karnataka former chief minister H D Kumaraswamy.\n\nFaced with unrelenting attack from the Congress and other political parties, the JD(S), an ally of the BJP, has suspended Prajwal.\n\nKarnataka JD(S) MLA H D Revanna was arrested by sleuths of a Special Investigation Team on Saturday in a kidnapping case linked to sexual abuse allegations against his son Prajwal, officials said. He was arrested soon after a court here rejected his anticipatory bail plea.\n\nKarnataka Home Minister Dr G Parameshwara on Sunday said a 'Blue Corner' notice has been issued and Interpol's help is being taken to bring NDA's Hassan Lok Sabha candidate Prajwal Revanna back to India.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rekha_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rekha Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smriti_Irani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smriti Irani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(Secular)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (Secular)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Mahila_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All India Mahila Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Commission_for_Women", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Commission for Women"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallikarjun_Kharge", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mallikarjun Kharge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Extradition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Karnataka", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of Karnataka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Congress_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All India Congress Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._G._Parameshwara", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dr. G.

The success of the SIT investigation now entirely depends on the cooperation of the Central Government. It is imperative for the Central Government to cooperate in extraditing the accused Prajwal Revanna, who is said to be abroad. BJP, which still maintains a political alliance with JD(S), needs to clarify its stance,\" he stressed reiterating the demand for Prajwal Revanna's extradition.\n\nMeanwhile, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar also rebuffed claims made by Devaraj Gowda, labelling them as \"bundles of lies.\" Shivakumar remarked, \"He tried to meet me and he said he would reveal all the truths about pen drive, internal issues of BJP and many other things.\"\n\n\"BJP and JDS are doing this kind of conspiracy, let them do whatever they want,\" he alleged, as quoted by ANI.\n\nALSO READ | What Is A Blue Corner Notice?

Narendra Modi-ji and JD(S) leaders are protecting a mass rapist when the Prime Minister was aware that the candidate of his party and an ally is a serial abuser of thousands of women. A BJP leader in December 2023 approached PM Modi and Amit Shah with all the evidence,\" Surjewala told reporters in Belagavi on Sunday.\n\nRaising 10 questions of Prime Minister Modi and Union Home Minister Shah, the Congress leader said, \"Firstly, why did they join hands with the Janata Dal (Secular)? Secondly, why did they make him a candidate of the BJP and Janata Dal? Thirdly, why did PM Modi visit Hassan and raise his hands saying Prajwal Revanna's win will give him more strength? The fourth question is why did Modi-ji, Amit Shah-ji, the BJP and JD(S) hide this truth about Prajwal Revanna even after knowing everything?\n\n\"Fifth, when Prajwal Revanna was trying to fly out of India, didn't Modiji's external affairs ministry or the passport control board know that a mass rapist is fleeing the country? Why did Modi-ji and Amit Shah-ji allow him to flee?\"\n\n\"Sixth, the SIT wrote to the CBI and the Modi government on bringing him back wherever he is, why hasn't Modi-ji or Amit Shah-ji responded to it? Seventh, the chief minister wrote to Modi-ji to cancel Prajwal Revanna's diplomatic passport, why hasn't it been done yet? Eighth, our SIT wrote to the CBI, requesting it to ask Interpol to issue a blue-corner notice so that we know where he is. Why did Modiji not do this?\"\n\n\"Ninth, if a mass rapist flees the country, who should take the onus of bringing him back? Is the state or the central government? If its the central government, then what has Modi-ji and Amit Shah-ji been doing other than accusing Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar? Why are they not telling the truth? Lastly why is Prime Minister Modi so afraid to question Prajwal Revanna? Answer these 10 questions,\" Surjewala added.\n\nSurjewala added that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has sought justice for the victims and has written to the CM to ensure the same, while urging Prime Minister Modi and Union Home Minister Shah to answer his \"10 questions.\"\n\nEarlier, on Saturday evening, Janata Dal (Secular) party leader and Prajwal Revanna's father, HD Revanna was taken into custody by Special Investigation Team (SIT) officials in Karnataka. The arrest is related to a kidnapping case filed against him at the KR Nagar police station in Bengaluru in connection with the alleged obscene video case.\n\nRevanna was booked in the case on April 28 based on a complaint lodged at Holenarasipura Town police.\n\nThe case was registered under sections 354A, 354D, 506, and 509 of the IPC on charges of sexual harassment, intimidation, and outraging the dignity of a woman. As per the complaint, the victim claimed that Prajwal Revanna and his father HD Revanna had sexually assaulted her. A look out notice has been issued against Prajwal Revanna who is currently claimed to be in Germany.\n\nPrajwal Revanna is the grandson of party supremo and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda.\n\nSpeaking to ANI on Sunday about the arrest, Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara said, \"The SIT have been doing things as per the procedure. I can't disclose more than that as even I don't have information regarding everything. Due to the seriousness of the case, we have constituted an SIT and have given full freedom to them to deliver justice.\"\n\n\"A blue-corner notice has already been issued (to Prajwal Revanna). They'll locate him wherever he is and after that, procedurally whatever is required, SIT will do that to bring him here\" he added.\n\nDy CM DK Shivakumar declined to comment on the matter saying that the law will take its course.\n\n\"The law will take its course. We are in an election campaign and I don't know what he said. I have not read about it. I have only looked at the newspaper and apart from that I don't know,\" Shivakumar said.\n\nSpeaking on the alleged obscene video case earlier this month, Amit Shah said that BJP stands with the 'Matr Shakti' while criticising the ruling Congress government in Karnataka for allegedly delaying action.\n\n\"BJP's stand is clear that we stand with the 'Matr Shakti' of the country. I want to ask Congress and Priyanka ji who is demanding action, whose government is there? The government is of Congress Party. Why they have not taken any action till now? We do not have to take action on this as this is a law and order issue of the state, state government has to take action on it,\" he said.

JDS leaders and some BJP leaders have expressed outrage against the Congress saying that there is a political conspiracy behind this case. On the other hand, opposition leader R Ashok, who has spoken harshly about Prajwal and Revanna, is surprising. Speaking to reporters in Bengaluru, Ashok said that the arrest of former minister HD Revanna was correct. Prajwal Revanna has not won in our alliance yet. He said that if he wins, we will take action. This has created a stir in state politics.\n\nAshok, who spoke about Revanna's arrest in the woman kidnapping case, said it was right to arrest former minister HD Revanna. I appreciate the work of the police. He clarified that strict action should be taken against the arrested HD Revanna.\n\nCommenting on the case of Prajwal Revanna, Ashok said, \"We will take strict action against Prajwal if he wins.\" We will expel them. Prajwal Revanna is yet to win in our alliance. If Prajwal wins, let his party leaders take action. He said sternly that we will also take legal action.\n\nOur new alliance is with JDS. Thus Prajwal has been given a ticket and JDS has already suspended him. But will Prajwal become a JDS MP after winning? Or there is confusion whether he will become an NDA MP. We will get clarification from high command about this. He clarified that we will discuss the action against Prajwal after looking at it.\n\nIn 2016, Siddaramaiah himself campaigned by sitting next to Prajwal Revanna. Siddaramaiah had campaigned for Prajwal at the APMC ground in Kadur. Prajwal is young, he works, so he asked to make him win. He also tweets and praises Prajwal. Through this, he told Siddaramaiah asked to vote for the JDS that day.\n\nIn any case, it is true that the ally BJP is not agreeing to the case of Prajwal Revanna and HD Revanna. Instead, they are expressing outrage against the Congress that there is a political conspiracy behind these cases. However, it is surprising that Ashok has spoken harsh words in this case. Also, this has given a shock to the leaders and workers of the allied party JDS.\n\nSpeaking about the effect of Prajwal case, Revanna's arrest on alliance, Ashok said, I don't know what HD Kumaraswamy and Amit Shah have discussed about this. Alliance is at the center level. It is the superiors who decide on the continuation of the alliance.

The case against HD Revanna was filed at the KR Nagar police station in Bengaluru.\n\nFacing new challenges, HD Revanna and his son Prajwal Revanna are implicated in a case following a complaint by a youth alleging the abduction of his mother. This complaint emerged after a video purportedly showing the youth's mother being tied and assaulted by Prajwal surfaced.\n\nPrajwal, the incumbent JD(S) MP from Hassan, is accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nTo investigate the matter, the state government has formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) following the circulation of numerous explicit videos allegedly involving the 33-year-old MP in recent days.\n\nPrajwal contested the Hassan Lok Sabha constituency as the NDA candidate in the April 26 elections. The JD(S) aligned with the NDA in September of the previous year.\n\nAlready facing a molestation case filed against them at the Holenarasipura police station, the father-son duo now faces another complaint, as revealed by State Home Minister G Parameshwara.\n\nIn the latest case filed on Thursday night, a 20-year-old complainant from Krishnaraja Nagar town in Mysuru district claimed that his mother was kidnapped by Revanna. According to the complainant, his mother used to work at Revanna's residence in Holenarasipura six years ago but returned to her hometown three years ago. The complainant alleged that Revanna's confidant, Sathish Babanna, visited their house and warned them not to divulge any information to the police. The complainant further stated that on April 29, Sathish Babanna took his mother away on a motorcycle, and since then, her whereabouts remain unknown. The complainant received information on May 1 that a video surfaced showing his mother being tied with a rope while Prajwal allegedly assaulted her.

Narendra Modi-ji and JD(S) leaders are protecting a mass rapist when the Prime Minister was aware that the candidate of his party and an ally is a serial abuser of thousands of women. A BJP leader in December 2023 approached PM Modi and Amit Shah with all the evidence,\" Surjewala told reporters in Belagavi on Sunday.\n\nRaising 10 questions of Prime Minister Modi and Union Home Minister Shah, the Congress leader said, \"Firstly, why did they join hands with the Janata Dal (Secular)? Secondly, why did they make him a candidate of the BJP and Janata Dal? Thirdly, why did PM Modi visit Hassan and raise his hands saying Prajwal Revanna's win will give him more strength? The fourth question is why did Modi-ji, Amit Shah-ji, the BJP and JD(S) hide this truth about Prajwal Revanna even after knowing everything?\n\n\"Fifth, when Prajwal Revanna was trying to fly out of India, didn't Modiji's external affairs ministry or the passport control board know that a mass rapist is fleeing the country? Why did Modi-ji and Amit Shah-ji allow him to flee?\"\n\n\"Sixth, the SIT wrote to the CBI and the Modi government on bringing him back wherever he is, why hasn't Modi-ji or Amit Shah-ji responded to it? Seventh, the chief minister wrote to Modi-ji to cancel Prajwal Revanna's diplomatic passport, why hasn't it been done yet? Eighth, our SIT wrote to the CBI, requesting it to ask Interpol to issue a blue-corner notice so that we know where he is. Why did Modiji not do this?\"\n\n\"Ninth, if a mass rapist flees the country, who should take the onus of bringing him back? Is the state or the central government? If its the central government, then what has Modi-ji and Amit Shah-ji been doing other than accusing Siddaramaiah and DK Shivakumar? Why are they not telling the truth? Lastly why is Prime Minister Modi so afraid to question Prajwal Revanna? Answer these 10 questions,\" Surjewala added.\n\nSurjewala added that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has sought justice for the victims and has written to the CM to ensure the same, while urging Prime Minister Modi and Union Home Minister Shah to answer his \"10 questions.\"\n\nEarlier, on Saturday evening, Janata Dal (Secular) party leader and Prajwal Revanna's father, HD Revanna was taken into custody by Special Investigation Team (SIT) officials in Karnataka. The arrest is related to a kidnapping case filed against him at the KR Nagar police station in Bengaluru in connection with the alleged obscene video case.\n\nRevanna was booked in the case on April 28 based on a complaint lodged at Holenarasipura Town police.\n\nThe case was registered under sections 354A, 354D, 506, and 509 of the IPC on charges of sexual harassment, intimidation, and outraging the dignity of a woman. As per the complaint, the victim claimed that Prajwal Revanna and his father HD Revanna had sexually assaulted her. A look out notice has been issued against Prajwal Revanna who is currently claimed to be in Germany.\n\nPrajwal Revanna is the grandson of party supremo and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda.\n\nSpeaking to ANI on Sunday about the arrest, Karnataka Home Minister G Parameshwara said, \"The SIT have been doing things as per the procedure. I can't disclose more than that as even I don't have information regarding everything. Due to the seriousness of the case, we have constituted an SIT and have given full freedom to them to deliver justice.\"\n\n\"A blue-corner notice has already been issued (to Prajwal Revanna). They'll locate him wherever he is and after that, procedurally whatever is required, SIT will do that to bring him here\" he added.\n\nDy CM DK Shivakumar declined to comment on the matter saying that the law will take its course.\n\n\"The law will take its course. We are in an election campaign and I don't know what he said. I have not read about it. I have only looked at the newspaper and apart from that I don't know,\" Shivakumar said.\n\nSpeaking on the alleged obscene video case earlier this month, Amit Shah said that BJP stands with the 'Matr Shakti' while criticising the ruling Congress government in Karnataka for allegedly delaying action.\n\n\"BJP's stand is clear that we stand with the 'Matr Shakti' of the country. I want to ask Congress and Priyanka ji who is demanding action, whose government is there? The government is of Congress Party. Why they have not taken any action till now? We do not have to take action on this as this is a law and order issue of the state, state government has to take action on it,\" he said.

The member of parliament allegedly fled to Germany using his diplomatic passport after allegations of sexual assault were made against him.\n\nOn Sunday, the home minister of the southern Indian state of Karnataka, G. Parameshwara, announced that a Blue Corner notice - an instrument used by Interpol to share alerts and requests for information worldwide - was issued against Revanna by the state government. The notice authorizes Interpol to collect information about a person's identity, location, or activities related to a criminal investigation.\n\nRevanna, the 33-year-old grandson of former Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, is a sitting member of the Indian Parliament and is running in the ongoing parliamentary election from Karnataka.\n\nHe is being investigated on charges of sexually assaulting hundreds of women over several years. Nearly 2,900 explicit videos allegedly recorded by Revanna to blackmail his victims surfaced last month, triggering an investigation. Several cases were registered by police against him last week\n\nSome of the clips surfaced online days before voting was held in Hassan, his constituency. Revanna initially claimed that the videos being circulated were \"morphed\" and aim to \"tarnish his image and poison the minds of voters,\" in a police complaint cited by Indian media. However, news18 reported on Monday that Prajwal has been advised to surrender by his lawyer and his father, H.D. Revanna, who is also a member of the Karnataka state Legislative Assembly from the same party.\n\nOn Sunday, H.D. Revanna was arrested in an abduction case for allegedly orchestrating the kidnapping of one of the victims of his son. He was remanded in three-day police custody of the Special Investigation Team (SIT), which is investigating the father-son duo. The woman once worked at the Revannas' farmhouse and claimed she was sexually assaulted, Indian media reported. The woman was tracked down to a Revanna aide's house in Hunsur, Karnataka.\n\nREAD MORE: The bloodline: How political dynasties are threatening the world's largest democracy\n\nThe Revannas head the Janata Dal (Secular) party, a key ally of the PM Narendra Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the ongoing general election.\n\nThe episode has sparked a massive political row in the state and across the country.

He accused Congress of allowing Prajwal to flee the state and videos were released only after he left the country.\n\nPrajwal Revanna, the suspended Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S) leader is the incumbent MP from the Hassan constituency. He is seeking re-election as an NDA candidate from the same seat. Polling on the seat was completed on April 26.\n\nIn an interview with Times Now, PM Modi said, \"I am of the clear view that there should be zero tolerance against such people. Stringent punishment should be given using all the legal options available.\"\n\nPrime Minister Modi further stated that it is a law and order issue and whichever party is in government in the state, is responsible for taking action.\n\n\"It is a law-and-order issue. If such an incident took place in Bengal, then the Bengal government would be responsible. If it happened in Gujarat, then the Gujarat government is responsible. If it happened, then Andhra then Andhra government would be responsible. If it happened it Karnataka, then Karnataka government is responsible to take action,\" he further said.\n\nPrime Minister Modi alleged that the videos were recorded when Congress was in power in the state in alliance with JD(S) and were released only after the Vokkaliga voters exercised their franchise during the second phase.\n\n\"However, these thousands of videos would not be of single day which implies that it is of the time when JD(S) was in alliance with Congress. These videos were gathered when they were in power. They released it during the election after Vokkaligas exercised their franchise,\" the Prime Minister said.\n\n\"The videos were released after he was sent out of the country. You allowed him to go from the state. This is very suspicious,\" he added.\n\nHD Revanna and his son, Prajwal Revanna are facing a probe by a Special Investigative Team (SIT), constituted by the Karnataka government, over allegations of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation following a complaint by a woman who worked in their household.\n\nHD Revanna is under Special Investigation Team (SIT) custody till May 8 in kidnapping case linked to \"obscene video case\", while Prajwal Revanna has fled to another country.\n\nVoting for 28 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka is being held in two phases. While 14 seats were polled on April 26, the remaining 14 will go to polling on May 7. The counting of votes is scheduled for June 4.\n\nIn the 2019 elections, the BJP almost swept the state by winning 25 out of 28 seats.

Interpol will disseminate information to all countries to locate him,\" Dr Parameshwara informed reporters in Bengaluru.\n\nHe further lauded the SIT's efforts in investigating the case, emphasising that the team has meticulously adhered to legal protocols based on the received complaints. He pointed to the recent arrest of Prajwal's father, HD Revanna, in connection with an abduction case related to sexual abuse allegations.\n\nRevanna, a JDS MLA, is facing charges of molestation and kidnapping. He was apprehended by the SIT on Saturday following the dismissal of his anticipatory bail plea by a local court.\n\nThe sexual abuse case, which involves explicit video clips allegedly depicting the 33-year-old Prajwal, grandson of JDS patriarch and former Prime Minister Deve Gowda, has sparked controversy in Hassan.\n\nConsequently, the state government formed the SIT to conduct a thorough investigation into the allegations against the MP.

Parameshwara confirmed that a blue-corner notice has been issued to locate Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna, who is accused in a sexual harassment and abduction case.\n\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), through Interpol, issued this notice upon the request of the Special Investigation Team (SIT).\n\nA blue-corner notice is a part of Interpol's elaborate system of colour-coded notices which enable countries to \"share alerts and requests for information (on wanted persons/ crimes) worldwide.\" This sharing of critical crime-related information is crucial for tackling internationally spread-out criminal activities.\n\nDr. Parameshwara emphasised that the State Government has granted full autonomy to SIT to conduct a thorough investigation into the case. Prajwal Revanna is the accused in the alleged sex scandal case being investigated by SIT.\n\nYesterday, a Special Court refused to grant anticipatory interim bail for MLA H.D. Revanna, father of Prajwal Revanna, accused of kidnapping a woman. Following this, the SIT arrested Revanna from his father former PM H.D. Deve Gowda's Padmanabhanagar residence last evening.\n\nAddressing reporters in Bengaluru this morning, Dr. Parameshwara stated, \"The SIT is adhering to proper procedures, and a fair investigation will be carried out. We have entrusted the SIT with complete freedom to conduct an impartial investigation and they are actively engaged in their duties.\"\n\nRegarding reports of the blue-corner notice issued for Prajwal Revanna, who has fled the country, Parameshwara affirmed, \"It is indeed true that a blue-corner notice has been issued to locate him. The authorities concerned are working to track him down and we are endeavouring to repatriate him. The SIT is making every effort to bring him back to India following the prescribed procedures.\"\n\nPrajwal to surrender today?\n\nPrajwal Revanna's reported decision to surrender to the SIT upon his arrival at Bengaluru International Airport or Mangaluru Airport today is believed to be based on advice from his legal counsel to pre-empt the issuance of the blue-corner notice.\n\nIt's anticipated that Prajwal will arrive from Dubai around 3 pm today. SIT personnel have been monitoring flights from Dubai and Frankfurt at the Bengaluru International Airport since last night in preparation for his arrival.\n\nIn other developments, the SIT is likely to present former Minister H.D. Revanna before the Court around 2 pm today.\n\nFollowing Revanna's arrest, about 40 Police personnel conducted a search at the JD(S) leader's farmhouse in Kalenahalli, Hunsur, last night.\n\nMeanwhile, Revanna's residence in Holenarasipur, which is typically bustling with activity, appeared deserted. Additionally, a Karnataka State Reserve Police platoon has been deployed to monitor activities in and around the residence.\n\nFurthermore, the State Government has reportedly appointed eight more Police officials, including a Superintendent of Police (SP), to augment the existing 21-member Special Investigating Team handling the case.\n\nTalks with Amit Shah\n\nAmidst the ongoing turmoil within former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's family, especially with the arrest of his son and former Minister H.D. Revanna, JD(S) State President and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy engaged in discussions with Union Home Minister Amit Shah at a private hotel in Bengaluru.\n\nAmit Shah, who was en route to Andhra Pradesh, stayed overnight in Bengaluru yesterday. During their meeting, the duo is reported to have discussed the latest developments in the Prajwal Revanna case.\n\nSources indicate that Kumaraswamy expressed concerns about the Congress-led State Government targeting his family in an attempt to undermine their political careers.\n\nFurthermore, it is reported that Amit Shah suggested terminating the coalition between JD(S) and BJP for the mutual benefit of both parties. It's believed that Kumaraswamy is considering Amit Shah's suggestion to dissolve the coalition.", "source": {"uri": "starofmysore.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star of Mysore"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Kumaraswamy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "H.

He, also attacked the Congress party over the issue, stating that these thousands of videos are not of one day. He accused Congress of allowing Prajwal to flee the state and videos were released only after he left the country.\n\nPrajwal Revanna, the suspended Janata Dal-Secular (JD-S) leader is the incumbent MP from the Hassan constituency. He is seeking re-election as an NDA candidate from the same seat. Polling on the seat was completed on April 26. In an interview with Times Now, PM Modi said, \"I am of the clear view that there should be zero tolerance against such people. Stringent punishment should be given using all the legal options available.\"\n\nPrime Minister Modi further stated that it is a law and order issue and whichever party is in government in the state, is responsible for taking action. \"It is a law-and-order issue. If such an incident took place in Bengal, then the Bengal government would be responsible. If it happened in Gujarat, then the Gujarat government is responsible. If it happened, then Andhra then Andhra government would be responsible. If it happened it Karnataka, then Karnataka government is responsible to take action,\" he further said.\n\nPrime Minister Modi alleged that the videos were recorded when Congress was in power in the state in alliance with JD(S) and were released only after the Vokkaliga voters exercised their franchise during the second phase. \"However, these thousands of videos would not be of single day which implies that it is of the time when JD(S) was in alliance with Congress. These videos were gathered when they were in power. They released it during the election after Vokkaligas exercised their franchise,\" the Prime Minister said.\n\n\"The videos were released after he was sent out of the country. You allowed him to go from the state. This is very suspicious,\" he added. HD Revanna and his son, Prajwal Revanna are facing a probe by a Special Investigative Team (SIT), constituted by the Karnataka government, over allegations of sexual harassment and criminal intimidation following a complaint by a woman who worked in their household.\n\nHD Revanna is under Special Investigation Team (SIT) custody till May 8 in kidnapping case linked to \"obscene video case\", while Prajwal Revanna has fled to another country. Voting for 28 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka is being held in two phases. While 14 seats were polled on April 26, the remaining 14 will go to polling on May 7. The counting of votes is scheduled for June 4.\n\nIn the 2019 elections, the BJP almost swept the state by winning 25 out of 28 seats. While, Congress and JD-S -- who were in coalition in the state government -- could only win one seat each.

Revanna faces two cases, one involving the molestation of a cook, with his son Prajwal also accused, and another concerning the alleged kidnapping and confinement of a woman. The Special Investigation Team probing the case against JD(S) MLA H D Revanna in connection with the alleged kidnapping and illegal confining of a woman carried out a spot inspection at his residence at Basavanagudi in Bengaluru on Monday. In the absence of the Revanna family, the SIT team summoned his lawyer, Gopal, for the spot inspection.\n\nTwo days ago, the SIT had inspected the MLA's house at Holenarasipura in Hassan district.\n\nRevanna, son of former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda, is facing two cases. One pertains to the molestation of the cook in which Revanna's son Prajwal is also an accused.\n\nThe second one is a kidnapping case registered on May 2. The victim's son charged that Revanna's aide Sathish Babanna took his mother on a bike on April 29 and put her in an illegal confinement after videos surfaced showing Prajwal allegedly tied and raped her.\n\nThe woman has been rescued. The police team is going around the places where she was allegedly sexually brutalised.\n\nMany explicit videos and photographs of several women have surfaced who were allegedly raped, molested and filmed by Prajwal.\n\nThe SIT took the two complainants to various locations where the rape and molestation took place.\n\nMeanwhile, Revanna's lawyer Gopal alleged that the SIT team did not let him inside the JD(S) leader's Basavanagudi house.\n\nHe charged that he was given notice for the spot inspection but the SIT did not allow him inside.\n\n\"I am not allowed inside though I should have been present there. Illegal things are going on. I am not against spot inspection. When the SIT served me a notice to be present here, why I was kept outside? Did I say that I will not cooperate?\" Gopal sought to know.\n\nStating that a list of seized items has to be provided, he wondered whom the SIT will hand over to.\n\n\"Shouldn't you (SIT) provide it to the person authorised for spot inspection? The SIT is doing it in a one-sided manner. They are doing it keeping the process away from my glare,\" the lawyer said.\n\nMeanwhile, security personnel are on the alert at the Kempegowda International Airport anticipating the arrival of Prajwal from abroad.

Revanna, the son of former PM H.D. Deve Gowda, on Sunday said that there is no evidence against him in the sex video scandal kidnapping case and that it was a \"conspiracy\" against him.\n\nTalking to the media, while being taken for a medical test before being produced in front of a court here, Revanna stated that a kidnapping case had been lodged against him though he does not have 'one black mark' against him in his entire career of 40 years.\n\n\"Without evidence, I have been targeted... All allegations against me are false. My arrest has been made out of ill intention,\" he claimed.\n\n\"The case was lodged on April 28, then, they did not have any evidence. Later, the fake evidence was created on May 2 and I was fixed,\" he alleged.\n\nHome Minister Dr G. Parameshwara stated on Sunday that a Blue Corner notice has already been issued against Revanna's son and MP Prajwal Revanna, the prime accused in the sex video scandal, as he is believed to be abroad.\n\n\"The Interpol will communicate to all nations and he will be located. Once he is located, the SIT will take a call on how he should be secured and brought back to India,\" he added.\n\nRevanna was arrested on Saturday on charges of kidnapping one of the victims of the sex video scandal.\n\nParameshwara further maintained that the arrest of Revanna has saddened JD-S leaders and if action was not taken, the SIT would be blamed too.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge refused to comment on the alleged sex video scandal involving Prajwal Revanna.\n\nAbout Revanna's arrest, he said that the SIT would initiate action as per the law. \"Those indulging in such acts must be taught a lesson and justice should be given to the families of victims.

However, as of now, there have been no indications of his return, even as airports across Karnataka remain on high alert.\n\nThe 33-year-old parliamentarian reportedly departed for Germany shortly after Chairperson Nagalakshmi Chowdhary of the Karnataka State Commission for Women wrote to the Chief Minister, urging an investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations against Prajwal. These allegations surfaced following the circulation of numerous explicit videos and images on social media platforms.\n\nIn response, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) was swiftly constituted to probe the matter, serving two notices to Prajwal.\n\nMeanwhile, Prajwal's father and MLA, HD Revanna, has been apprehended and placed in police custody in connection with a kidnapping case associated with the sexual abuse allegations. Additionally, Revanna's associate, Sathish Babanna, was also remanded to police custody today by a city court in relation to the abduction case.\n\nThe state government has disclosed that a blue corner notice has been issued in the attempt to locate Prajwal, who currently remains untraceable. The SIT conducted an on-site inspection at Revanna's residence in Basavanagudi, with the victim present, as part of their ongoing investigations.\n\nThis situation continues to unfold amid mounting pressure for accountability and justice in the face of these serious allegations.

If a \"mass rapist\" flees the country, who is responsible to bring him back: the state government or Centre?\n\n(10.)

While Prajwal left the country soon after polling in Hassan on April 26, his father, H D Revanna, MLA from Holenarasipur, was arrested on Saturday in connection with the abduction of a woman, allegedly to prevent her from approaching the Special Investigation Team (SIT).\n\n\"The entire district is in H D Revanna's control.

None of them wanted to be named.\n\nThe first FIR against Prajwal was filed on April 28, based on the complaint of a woman whose family has now left their home. \"The woman worked at Revanna's house as a house help. Some of her videos started to circulate and then, her house was seen locked. We don't know when she left,\" said a neighbour.\n\nIn a nearby village, where a former zilla panchayat member who filed a rape case against Prajwal lived, a local JD(S) leader said many woman who worked for the party earlier are now incommunicado. \"We noticed many of the party women deleting their photos with Prajwal on social media. In some instances, men are questioning their wives about their association with the MP. It is shattering the lives of many women in the district,\" he said.\n\nIn her complaint, the zilla panchayat member alleged that she was raped for three years, and videos were recorded. She has since left her home. \"She was here on April 24... The videos came out the next day.... Since then, we have not seen the family,\" a local leader said.\n\nWith the video clips revealing the women's identities, several other families have also left Hassan.\n\nWhen an SIT team reached the Revanna residence, party workers gathered outside were heard talking about the women. \"I know this woman, she lived close to our residence and was very active in JD(S) activities. Her house is locked... she has small children,\" said one. \"She is my neighbour's relative and attended one of our family functions,\" said another.\n\n\"It was really wrong to reveal the faces of the women. I know some of them, and they have gone into hiding. We don't know whether they can return,\" a shopkeeper said. He said these families didn't want to file cases as \"it is impossible to survive in Hassan while fighting a case against Revanna's family\".\n\nWhile many local JD(S) leaders expressed shock at the videos, some also sympathised with Deve Gowda. \"What Prajwal did is an unpardonable crime. Deve Gowda built his political legacy by sacrificing more than four decades of his life, and it just collapsed by Prajwal's criminal acts,\" said a party worker.\n\nIn Paduvalahippe village, where Deve Gowda cast his vote, a JD(S) leader said the party did not campaign after the video clips started circulating. \"The youth in this constituency had the videos on their mobile phones. How can we face people and ask them to vote for Prajwal?\" he asked.\n\nThe village is home to a large farmhouse, fortified with an eight-foot wall, which the SIT also visited. According to a police officer, Prajwal often visited the farmhouse, where some of the videos were allegedly recorded. A police constable stands guards outside.\n\n\"Prajwal used to come here with friends and party, but we don't know anything other than that,\" said an employee, refusing to speak any further.\n\nSpeaking on the condition of anonymity, a police officer said the district intelligence unit was aware of the video clips, but didn't know of the magnitude of the issue. \"The pen drive in question has been doing the rounds before the Karnataka Assembly elections in 2023, but the videos did not come out at the time,\" the officer said.\n\nPrajwal had got a gag order from the Bengaluru civil court on June 1, 2023 against 86 media outlets and three private persons in connection with the video clips. One of the private persons was advocate and local BJP leader G Devaraje Gowda. Prajwal's former driver, Karthik, has said that he shared the pen drive with Devaraje Gowda.\n\n\"In January this year, Devaraje Gowda had called a press conference where it was speculated that he would release the videos, but the press conference was abruptly cancelled,\" the officer said, adding, \"Until the videos started to come out, all we knew was there could be a sex video of Prajwal Revanna, but not that this pen drive contained more than 2,900 files involving multiple women.\"", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kiran_parashar@indianexpress.com", "name": "Kiran Parashar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Deve_Gowda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "H.

One pertains to the molestation of the cook in which Revanna's son Prajwal is also an accused.\n\nThe second one is a kidnapping case registered on May 2. The victim's son charged that Revanna's aide Sathish Babanna took his mother on a bike on April 29 and put her in an illegal confinement after videos surfaced showing Prajwal allegedly tied and raped her.\n\nThe woman has been rescued. The police team is going around the places where she was allegedly sexually brutalised.\n\nMany explicit videos and photographs of several women have surfaced who were allegedly raped, molested and filmed by Prajwal.\n\nThe SIT took the two complainants to various locations where the rape and molestation took place.\n\nMeanwhile, Revanna's lawyer Gopal alleged that the SIT team did not let him inside the JD(S) leader's Basavanagudi house.\n\nHe charged that he was given notice for the spot inspection but the SIT did not allow him inside.\n\n\"I am not allowed inside though I should have been present there. Illegal things are going on. I am not against spot inspection. When the SIT served me a notice to be present here, why I was kept outside? Did I say that I will not cooperate?\" Gopal sought to know.\n\nStating that a list of seized items has to be provided, he wondered whom the SIT will hand over to.\n\n\"Shouldn't you (SIT) provide it to the person authorised for spot inspection? The SIT is doing it in a one-sided manner. They are doing it keeping the process away from my glare,\" the lawyer said.\n\nMeanwhile, security personnel are on the alert at the Kempegowda International Airport anticipating the arrival of Prajwal from abroad.

It is a ploy to avoid investigation with malicious intent to protect criminals. SIT is working in full transparency. The government is bound to prosecute the culprits, no matter how influential they are. It is with this objective in mind that SIT has been formed by including selected efficient officers,\" he added\n\nSiddaramaiah said that BJP leaders should refrain from blaming Prime Minister Narendra Modi's and tarnishing his reputation for the sexual assault case involving MP Prajwal Revanna.\n\n\"There is no point in BJP leaders now shouting that the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's name is being tarnished because of this case, this should have been thought of while forming an alliance with JD (S). The success of the SIT investigation is now entirely dependent on the cooperation of the Central Government. The central government should cooperate in bringing the accused Prajwal Revanna, who is said to be abroad, to India.

But any of them has hardly spoken about the sexual abuse of hundreds of women in Hassan,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking to media representatives at his residence in Kalaburagi on May 5, Mr. Priyank questioned why Prajwal Revanna, the leader of Janata Dal (Secular) which had a pre-poll alliance with BJP and incumbent Lok Sabha Member from Hassan, was given a ticket even after knowing his sexual abuse of women.\n\n\"JD(S) leaders knew about the Prajwal Revanna's sexual crimes much earlier.

Believed to be in Germany, the Hassan MP, grandson of former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, skipped the summons from the SIT, which has now got a lookout circular issued at all entry points to the country. He is charged with rape.\n\nPrajwal's 2024 election campaign from Hassan has been marred by the now infamous 'pen drives' that has changed the course of election narrative in Karnataka and has put his party, founded by his grandfather, as well as the alliance partner BJP, in a quandary. Prajwal, as the NDA candidate, is facing the Congress' Shreyas Patel, the grandson of former legislator Puttaswamy Gowda, who fought Mr. Deve Gowda in many election battles.\n\nAt the centre of the 'biggest sex scandal' so far that has rocked the State, he faces accusation of sexual assault on women from various social and economic background, and recording the act on his mobile phones, in some cases despite opposition by his victims.\n\nThe pen drive floating around Hassan has 2,976 files, the bulk of which are screenshots of chats, video calls with several women and nearly 100 videos. It also includes two videos -- one of a housemaid, who has now allegedly been kidnapped at the behest of Prajwal's father, and another video of a farm labourer being raped allegedly by the MP. Police are estimating the number of women victimised by the incumbent MP to be over 90. These pen drives, released four days before the elections on April 26, containing explicit videos and without masking the identity of the victims, appeared mysteriously in public places.\n\nThe 2019 parliamentary elections saw the rise of Prajwal in Hassan's political landscape in Karnataka. First member of the third generation in the Gowda clan to taste election success, the 28-year old was among the young Parliamentarians in the country in 2019. The rest of the family, however, was not as lucky. Mr. Deve Gowda, who had vacated his home turf Hassan to his grandson and moved to neighbouring Tumakuru, tasted defeat in his last electoral battle while another grandson Nikhil Kumaraswamy lost from Mandya, the hotbed of Vokkaliga politics in the Old Mysore region.\n\nThough publicly Prajwal was seen as \"an arrogant young man with a feudal mindset\", long-time observers of the Gowda family say his public actions were mostly aimed at cementing his place politically in the district and challenging the power of his uncle and former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy within the party structure. Though there were murmurs in Hassan about sex tapes after he sought injunction from the court in June 2023, to prevent airing or publishing any explicit content, the magnitude of the scandal has sent shock waves among the public, and apparently within the family and party too.\n\nPowerful father\n\nHis father H.D. Revanna, a former Minister and elder brother of Mr. Kumaraswamy, has run the party affairs in Hassan with an iron grip. Prajwal and his elder brother Sooraj Revanna, an MLC, have been part of the electioneering process of their father as well as their mother Bhavani Revanna, a former member of Hassan Zilla Panchayat. He was a toddler when his grandfather became the PM and his father became a Cabinet Minister, and a teenager when his uncle became the Chief Minister of Karnataka in 2006.\n\nAn engineering graduate, Mr. Prajwal has always been interested in politics. He has often courted controversies, too, many of which were aimed at his uncle. When he was denied ticket to contest from Hunsur in the 2018 assembly elections, his remark that \"hardworking people get to sit in the back but those with suitcases get front seats\", aimed at Mr. Kumaraswamy, rattled the party leadership. Not hesitating to express his displeasure, Mr. Deve Gowda had said, \"The boy's future does not seem bright if he continues to talk like this.\" However, he later vacated his seat to his grandson, and Prajwal was also made the party's general secretary.\n\nAfter 2019 elections, though he publicly offered to resign and allow his grandfather to recontest, it did not happen. His rival A. Manju, who is now a JD (S) legislator, had accused Prajwal of providing incomplete details in affidavit on assets and liabilities besides accusing him of booth capturing and proxy voting. Though the Karnataka High Court declared his election as null and void in September 2023, the Supreme Court stayed the order.\n\nIn the run-up to the 2024 elections, the former Prime Minister's family was divided over giving ticket to Mr. Prajwal as allegations of sexual misconduct had come out in the open. Mr. Kumaraswamy is learnt to have opposed his candidature, but the Revanna family's wish prevailed. During the campaign, Prajwal often referred to the 'mistakes' that he had committed in five years and apologised. However, he did not disclose what those 'mistakes' were.\n\nThe family had also anticipated trouble since G. Devaraje Gowda, the BJP candidate who lost to Mr. Revanna in the 2023 assembly polls from Holenarasipura, had told the media about the presence of a large number of videos. He is learnt to have written to BJP state President B.Y. Vijayendra in December 2023, warning him of problems if Mr. Prajwal was given a ticket.\n\nIn a tight election that has become hard to predict, the issue has also given ammunition to the Congress to attack the BJP, and PM Narendra Modi has been questioned for sharing dais with a rape accused and allowing him to escape from the country.\n\nBJP leaders, including Home Minister Amit Shah, have tried to turn the tables by accusing the Congress of allowing him to flee. As the blame game rages ahead of another round of elections on May 7, Prajwal's return to the country to face a probe is awaited.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Deve_Gowda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "H.

But what is this notice and what does it mean. Let's understand.\n\nFirst of all let us delve deep into the case. an FIR has been filed against Prajwal and his father, Revanna, by their house help. She alleges that they sexually harassed her multiple times between 2019 and 2022.\n\nIn her complaint, the woman claimed that HD Revanna and Prajwal Revanna used to sexually assault women workers in their homes. Infact Whenever Revanna's wife wasn't there, he used to call the women to the storeroom and touch them while giving them fruits. He used to remove saree pins and sexually assault women\n\nNow it is alleged that Revanna is in Germany and he skipped the summons from SIT as well. So in response Revanna has been issued a blue corner notice.\n\nA Blue Corner Notice is a special alert used by Interpol, which is like an international police network. It helps countries share important information about crimes and ask for cooperation from other countries.\n\nThough There are seven types of notices - Red, Yellow, Blue, Black, Green, Orange, and Purple.\n\nA Blue notice is served to collect additional information about a person's identity, location or activities in relation to a criminal investigation.\n\nBut now with this, does it mean that Revanna is in big trouble? Revanna is alleged to have flown abroad on April 27, a day after the first phase of Lok Sabha polls in Karnataka was held. His advocate had sought for seven days' time for him to appear before the Special Investigation Team that's SIT , to which the investigating team has replied it is not possible as there is no such provision.\n\nThe Karnataka government set up a SIT to look into the sexual abuse accusations against him.\n\nStay tuned to India.com as we bring you the latest updates on this developing story.\n\n#prajwalrevanna #prajwalrevannavideo #prajwalrevannapendrivecase\n\nAbout Channel:\n\nYour daily dose of videos for the latest and exclusive news from India and the rest of the world.

It was only a few days ago that she was told by her family that her sister Mridula* was in the 3,000-odd video clips that were allegedly recorded by Prajwal, JD(S) Hassan MP and NDA candidate. But even before the family realised that Mridula was one of the victims, she had been taken away by a henchman and relative of the Revanna family -- Satish Babanna.\n\nIt was only a couple of days later when relatives and friends told Mridula's son about the videos that they realised what had happened to her: She had been sexually assaulted and videographed years ago and now kidnapped.\n\nMridula and her husband worked in Prajwal's father HD Revanna's Gannikada farm in Holenarasipura as farm hands for six years. They quit three years ago and returned to work in their village in Mysuru district to take care of one of their daughters who was pregnant. \"Even after leaving the job, she never told anyone about the assault. Maybe she feared that we would blame her. But she was raped. She didn't do anything wrong, but people will think it was her fault. We don't know how to face people even though we did nothing wrong,\" Mala said, breaking down. Mala and her husband were also working for HD Revanna, but on another farm that belonged to the family in Kamenahalli in Holenarasipura. HD Revanna has been the Holenarasipura MLA for 24 years and is the son of JD(S) supremo and former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda.\n\nSatish was arrested on May 3 and the police rescued Mridula on May 4 and took her to Bengaluru. Later that day, they arrested Revanna after the court rejected his anticipatory bail application. Prajwal is absconding despite the Special Investigation Team (SIT) having issued two lookout notices for him over the allegations.

Following Karnataka JD(S) MLA HD Revanna's arrest on Saturday by a Special Investigation Team that's also investigating Prajwal, the scandal is expected to weaken the JD(S)' long-standing leverage in the state and denuding its claims of being a kingmaker, political analysts said.\n\nOn May 1, at a rally in Hubbali, Union home minister Amit Shah said that the BJP cannot remain with those who \"commit atrocities against women\", making it the first public display of the saffron party distancing itself from the JDS. The ruling Congress government in turn has constituted a special investigation team (SIT) at the behest of the Karnataka State Commission for Women chairperson Lakshmi Chowdhary to investigate the cache of explicit files allegedly involving Revanna. More than 2,000 videos allegedly showing Revanna have gone viral on social media since April 28, when the clips were leaked to the media.\n\n\"With Prajwal being the grandson of former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, the JD(S) is left with no room for negotiation. His uncle and former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy's statements calling this incident a crisis involving Prajwal's reputation reveals the broader anxiety of the party over the long shadow the scandal might have on the party and its supporters,\" said Kishore K Swamy, an electoral strategist.\n\nThis is troubling news for the Vokkaligas, which account for 15% of Karnataka's population according to the 2011 Ccensus. The Gowda community belong to the landed gentry and warrior caste who predominantly inhabit southern Karnataka or the Mysuru Karnataka region and have been constituents of the Deve Gowda-founded JD(S) since 1999. The JD(S) has considerable influence over the community and, therefore, is believed to have sway over the first 14 seats that went to polls on April 26.\n\nThe impact of a party member from the JD(S)' first family being involved in a scandal of this scale is seen to be wide and deep. When HD Kumaraswamy called for \"merciless action\" a day after the videos came to light and refused to defend his nephew, it exposed the rift amongst the family members.\n\nA similar tussle between HD Revanna, Prajwal's father, and HD Kumaraswamy broke out on the issue of ticket distribution last year during the assembly elections. Revanna's wife Bhavani Revanna wanted to contest from Hassan, whereas Kumaraswamy wanted Hassan MLA HP Swaroop to contest on the back of the party workers' demand. For weeks, the matter remained unresolved because Bhavani refused to back down even after 91-year-old Deve Gowda offered to nominate her as a member of the legislative council (MLC). Although the ticket was given to HS Swaroop, Bhavani had announced herself as the Hassan candidate until a stern warning was sent out by the senior Gowda. Brokering peace between two of his children fighting for political supremacy, Deve Gowda allowed his elder son Revanna to take control over Hassan and let Kumaraswamy have a say over the neighbouring Ramnagara district. Kumaraswamy's wife Anitha too contested from Ramnagara in 2018 and subsequently vacated it for her son Nikhil in the 2023 assembly elections.\n\n\"The fissures are deep and though Deve Gowda's sons have nursed ambition, they do not possess the political acuity that the old war horse has always had since 1996 when he perched himself on the PM's seat,\" said Kishore Swamy. In fact, party workers say that the two brothers and their wives have rarely been known to display any cordiality because the fight for political supremacy has continued even to the third generation. Prajwal and Nikhil have fought hard for their Lok Sabha seat in Hassan and Mandya, despite the public perception of JD (S) being an \"Appa - Makkala party\", or a father-son party.\n\nGiven this backdrop, retired IAS officer Balachandran who closely tracks Karnataka politics said, \"The JD(S) is after all a one-community, one-state party. They have never contested outside the state or attempted to woo any other community in Karnataka. This puts them at great risk because the Congress has tall Vokkaliga leaders such as former CM and Union minister SM Krishna and current Karnataka Pradesh Congress chief DK Shivakumar.\" It was amply clear when the results of the assembly election were announced in May last year that the Congress ate into the JD(S) vote bank and snatched more than a fair share of Vokkaliga votes. The Mysuru Karnataka region that usually supports the JD(S) chose to truck with the Congress in last year's assembly election. As a result, the JD(S) reported its lowest vote share of 14% in 19 years. The party's best performance was recorded in 2004 when it enjoyed a 20.8% vote share winning 58 seats. Election after election since 2004, the JDS' vote share has been waning.\n\nIt is because of these falling numbers and Kumaraswamy's announcement that 2028 would be his last assembly election, that the party's political prospects are in jeopardy, noted Balachandran and Swamy. Both analysts say that Prajwal's departure to Germany after the videos went viral has dented his image among the public. The JD(S)' reputation as a turncoat for constantly changing loyalties since its founding in 1999 has eroded public trust, the analysts say.\n\nThe Congress and the BJP have been watching this development closely. Karnataka had a stable government until 1977 when Devaraj Urs was its chief minister. The Congress has been present in the government since the formation of the state in 1954. However, post that, the government was dissolved at least thrice and the President's rule was imposed in 1977, 1979, and 2007. From 1994 onwards, the JD(S) began to use its leverage and partnered with the BJP and the Congress to suit its political needs. In the 2019 election, the JDS chose the Congress as its partner and this year, it is with the BJP.\n\nAfter being asked about the timing of this tape leak, Congress spokesperson Kavitha Reddy said, \"Yes, we are using this politically because the honour of more than 2,900 women is involved in this case. It is not enough if the PM speaks of mangalsutras of women. We are waiting to see how the BJP takes action against its partner.\"\n\nThe case aside, Congress party persons who did not wish to be quoted expect an inflow of JD(S) workers into the grand old party after the general elections. \"Do not forget that Siddaramaiah is a former JDS man. He knows the party too well and could engineer defections from the JDS to the Congress,\" said one Congressman.\n\nHistorical data shows that the Vokkaligas have voted between the Congress and the JD(S), with the Lingayats largely going with the BJP. So, it would not be wrong to surmise that a weaker JD(S) would be the Congress' dream.\n\nHowever, the BJP's immediate castigation of the JDS is read by many in the political arena as an expected move. A Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh leader who oversees units in both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu said, \"The BJP will gain at the regional parties' loss just as it has in Telangana at the Bharat Rashtra Samithi's loss after its senior leader K Kavitha's jailing and the split in the Nationalist Congress Party in Maharashtra.\"\n\nThe heft of the national parties and their clandestine appeal for the Vokkaliga community's votes will be put to the test on May 7 when the rest of the 14 seats will go to polls.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Kumaraswamy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "H.

Revanna booked in kidnap case after woman goes missing - Star of Mysore", "body": "Bengaluru: Former Minister and JD(S) MLA H.D. Revanna was implicated in a kidnapping case on Thursday, following a complaint filed by a 20-year-old man.\n\nThe complainant alleged that an associate of Revanna abducted his mother, who was reportedly among the women featured in alleged sex tapes involving Revanna's son, JD(S) Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna.\n\nThe Police registered a case against Revanna and Satish Babanna, a resident of K.R. Nagar Taluk in Mysuru district, under several sections of the Indian Penal Code, including charges related to kidnapping.\n\nAccording to the First Information Report (FIR), the incident occurred on Apr. 29. The woman had previously worked at Revanna's residence and farmhouse in Holenarasipura for six years before quitting three years ago to work as a daily wage labourer.\n\nAs per the FIR, a few days before the first phase of the Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka on Apr. 26, Babanna visited the woman's residence and claimed that Revanna's wife Bhavani needed her for some work. Subsequently, the woman returned home on Apr. 26.\n\nLater, as per the FIR, Babanna allegedly cautioned the family against speaking to the Police if they visited their residence and warned them of potential legal repercussions. On Apr. 29, around 9 am, Babanna reportedly approached the family, informing them that the woman would face legal consequences if apprehended by the police. He then took her with him, stating that Revanna had summoned her, as per the woman's son's account in the FIR.\n\n\"While I was searching for my mother, on May 1, a couple of my friends inquired about my mother's involvement in the alleged sex tapes of Prajwal. I contacted Satish over the phone to ascertain my mother's whereabouts and he informed me that a case had been filed against her and that she needed to obtain bail,\" the woman's son stated in the FIR.", "source": {"uri": "starofmysore.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star of Mysore"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_information_report", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First information report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(Secular)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (Secular)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidnapping", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kidnapping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Legislative_Assembly_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehsil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tehsil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore_district", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mysore district"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mysore district"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holenarasipura", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holenarasipura"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Holenarasipura"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Penal_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Penal Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://starofmysore.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/News-29.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538622", "eventUri": "eng-9538622", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-29", "textStart": 633, "textEnd": 640, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 903, "textEnd": 910, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-01", "textStart": 1552, "textEnd": 1557}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Revanna on the charges of kidnapping a woman, who was one of the hundreds of victims of alleged sexual abuse involving his son and JD-S MP Prajwal Revanna, comes as a crude reminder as to the extent Indian politics has become criminalised, although it is a longstanding phenomenon. The incident, along with the CBI issuing a blue corner notice for Mr Prajwal, sends a wake-up call to law enforcement agencies.\n\nThat Mr Revanna was arrested from the house of his father H.D. Deve Gowda, who held the office of the highest political executive in this country, shows up the reasons behind why he and his son, the prime accused in the case, have been able to dodge the arms of the law for so long. How outrageous it is that, despite warnings from its leaders in Karnataka about the young MP's immoral behaviour, the BJP went ahead with the alliance with his party! It led to a scenario wherein Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared the dias with Mr Prajwal and asked the people to vote for him.\n\nThough hundreds of women are alleged to have been exploited by the junior Revanna, only a few have come forward to register complaints. It must send a chill down the spine of all right-thinking that the politically powerful family of the accused thought fit to kidnap the victim in order to escape the clutches of the law. That the MP fled the country as soon as the news of the thousands of videos he had allegedly made of his victims started leaking is a reflection on the impunity with which such people operate while destroying the lives of others.\n\nIt defies logic that the alleged systematic torture of women that had been ongoing over the last few years was completely hidden from the eyes of the state police. The political patronage Mr Prajwal enjoyed must surely have seen to it that he was allowed to continue with his crass pursuits undisturbed. That his party was part of the alliances that ruled the state and the Centre had supposedly come in handy. It is now incumbent upon the state government, which has formed a special investigation team, to get on the case with all the seriousness that it demands.\n\nIf it is a shame that Prajwal was allowed to escape from the country, it's all the more shameful if he is not brought home and made to face the law. The Union government has to take expeditious steps to ensure the compliance of the law by a citizen, however mighty they may be. The recent history of the BJP, which refused to act against its own MP who faced allegations of sexual abuse by sportspersons including Olympic medal-winners, does not inspire confidence. This party, in fact, made its own avowed commitment to Nari Shakti, or woman power, a farce by granting ticket to the son of the very same politician to contest the Lok Sabha election. If it wants to get a good result, therefore, it has no choice but to redeem itself and what better way to do it than by displaying some basic commitment to women's rights and the rule of law?", "source": {"uri": "deccanchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deccan Chronicle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dc_comment@deccanchronicle.com", "name": "Dc Comment", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Deve_Gowda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "H.

Deve Gowda in Hassan for his criminal acts.\n\nIn a complaint filed against the Janata Dal (S) leader on May 1, a woman alleged that she was raped at his official residence on R.C. Road in Hassan. The residence is located next to the office of the Superintendent of Police, Hassan.\n\nThe building has been referred to as \"MP's quarters\" by office-bearers of the JD(S). However, this was allotted to the former Prime Minister on his request, when he was representing Hassan in the Lok Sabha.\n\nWhen The Hindu contacted Hassan Deputy Commissioner C. Sathyabhama, the official after verifying the files from the Public Works Department (PWD), said that the structure was constructed by the government and was allotted to \"former PM and Lok Sabha member\" on March 7, 2018. It remained with him. \"There has been no fresh order allotting the structure to the current MP, Prajwal Revanna,\" she added.\n\nGowda's request\n\nEarlier, Mr. Gowda, during his visit to Hassan, would stay at his relative, Kale Gowda's, place. He had requested the district administration for a suitable accommodation in the city, as he wished to spend more time in Hassan.\n\nThe administration chose the PWD quarters, next to the office of Hassan Superintendent of Police, on R.C. Road. By then, the PWD had demolished the old structure, and planned to construct an officer's quarters. In 2017, the PWD officers were told to allot the same to Mr. Gowda and upgrade the design to suit the requirements of the former Prime Minister.\n\nInterestingly, it is said, the design was finalised by Mr. Deve Gowda's son H.D. Revanna, on the advice of a 'vaastu' expert. A few parts of the structure were removed to suit the revised design.\n\nAfter the building was ready, Mr. Gowda used to stay there during his visits to Hassan. He contested for Lok Sabha from Tumakuru in 2019 and lost. A year later, in June 2020, he was elected to the Rajya Sabha.\n\nMr. Prajwal Revanna, who was elected to the Lok Sabha on the JD(S) ticket in 2019, stayed at the two-storeyed building regularly. He often met party workers there. Former Minister Mr. Revanna regularly met the press in the office.\n\nCriminal act\n\nThe woman, in her complaint, said that in 2021, she visited the 'MP's office and quarters' with regard to admission of girls to a hostel. The accused, Mr. Prajwal Revanna, locked her up in a room and raped her. He allegedly threatened her that he would kill her husband with the gun he possessed if she did not cooperate with him.

He instead shifted focus to questioning the motives behind the leak, accusing Congress leader and deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar of orchestrating the leak and even making an emotional plea about the scandal's impact on his father and former prime minister HD Deve Gowda.\n\nHowever, party insiders indicated these moves may be more about the party's survival than familial concerns, hinting at an underlying power struggle within the regional political landscape.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, a close associated of Kumaraswamy quoted him as saying that it appeared that Deve Gowda was more supportive of Prajwal than Nikhil (Kumaraswamy's son).\n\n\"The senior Gowda also had a soft corner for HD Revanna and his children. Even though Kumaraswamy has been running the regional party, Revanna still has control of the politics of Hassan because he has his father's blessings,\" said the leader.\n\nWith HD Deve Gowda ailing and even Kumaraswamy struggling with health issues, getting the third generation of the family into the thick of politics has been a focus point over the past few years. Kumaraswamy's son Nikhil and Revanna's son Prajwal are the two main contenders in the race.\n\nWhile the struggle for power within the party has been behind closed doors for several years, the first visible rift emerged in 2013 during the assembly elections. Kumaraswamy's wife Anitha and Revanna's wife Bhavani both sought to contest the polls, but only Anitha was granted a ticket, leaving Bhavani sidelined. This pattern repeated in 2018, when Anitha contested and won from Ramanagara assembly constituency, a seat vacated by her husband, while Bhavani was once again denied the opportunity.\n\n\"In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Deve Gowda's decision to step aside from Hassan to allow his grandson Prajwal Revanna to contest was a conscious decision to mend familial fences. But this decision led to Kumaraswamy to push his son Nikhil into politics,\" said a JD(S) legislator close to the party's first family, on condition of anonymity.\n\n\"Since Nikhil lost the elections in 2019 against Sumalatha and Prajwal won the election, there was a power tilt. Nikhil losing the assembly elections made Prajwal politically strong,\" the leader added.\n\nWhile internal power struggles were contained within the family, tensions surfaced openly when Revanna's sons Prajwal and Suraj questioned Kumaraswamy's authority in the party. The trigger was Kumaraswamy's decision to deny Bhavani a ticket in the 2023 assembly elections, despite her aspirations for the Hassan seat.\n\nRevanna's elder son Suraj was the first to challenge Kumaraswamy. He said the decisions regarding Hassan are the prerogative of Deve Gowda and HD Revanna, not Kumaraswamy's. Prajwal echoed this sentiment, adding that Bhavani contesting from the seat was important for reclaiming the seat.\n\nThe discontent was a result of perceived favouritism shown towards Kumaraswamy's family since Anitha was allowed to become an MLA, while Nikhil was made president of the JD(S) youth wing.\n\n\"Since Nikhil is yet to win an election, another victory for Prajwal (in 2024) would have changed the power dynamics in Revanna family's favour, but the sexual harassment case has now effectively started the political downfall of this family. Even if they come out of a case, rebuilding their political influence will be hard with all the bad PR,\" said a former IAS officer, who had worked closely with the Gowda family, on the condition of anonymity.\n\nMuzaffar Assadi, political theorist and a former professor of political science at the University of Mysore, however, pointed out that the sexual harassment case would not just be a Revanna family problem but a JD(S) problem. \"The USB drives have not become a state and even a nationwide issue. It will certainly have an impact on Mandya and other parts of the state. So, Kumaraswamy has a hard task of saving the party from the scandal, which will be high on his list,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Kumaraswamy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "H.

Addressing the press conference at Belagavi on Sunday, he queried how Modi and union home minister Amit Shah could accept making the accused of hundreds of rapes an alliance candidate of BJP-JD(S), despite knowing the truth about him with all the proofs provided by their own party leaders, even in the month of December.\n\nSurjewala also questioned how Modi praised the accused, Prajwal, and sought votes for him. Why did Modi and the BJP hide the truth about Prajwal despite knowing about his deeds well in advance? How did the external affairs ministry and passport control authorities permit such a dangerous rape accused to flee abroad? Why is the Modi government not cooperating in the search for Prajwal despite the SIT, constituted by the Karnataka government, writing about this to the CBI?\n\nRandeep Surjewala stated that CM Siddaramaiah demanded the cancellation of the diplomatic passport of the accused, Prajwal Revanna, but questioned why the Modi government is not responding properly. He mentioned that the state government is requesting Interpol to issue a Blue Corner Notice to arrest Prajwal, but questioned why that hasn't been done so far. He also asked whose responsibility it is to bring back an accused who fled abroad after committing a crime in the country.\n\nSurjewala said the Siddaramaiah government has taken the case very seriously, as it's a unique one, and has also decided to support the victims by all means, including financially. He mentioned that Rahul Gandhi has written to CM Siddaramaiah to protect the victims in the case.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ravindra_uppar@timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "name": "Ravindra Uppar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randeep_Surjewala", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Randeep Surjewala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgaum", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belgaum"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgaum"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Secretary_of_the_Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Congress_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All India Congress Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amit Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_of_Home_Affairs_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minister of Home Affairs (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State governments of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Karnataka", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Karnataka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Gandhi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rahul Gandhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddaramaiah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Siddaramaiah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpol", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interpol"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/Suicide", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-109856709,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-155007,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538622", "eventUri": "eng-9538622", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belgaum"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Patil's remarks that Revanna will be arrested even if he is in the 'Pataal Lok' (netherworld), Ashoka said that this would have not been required if the Congress government would have arrested Revanna while he was in the state.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashoka", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ashoka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leader of the Opposition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Indian_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019 Indian general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240413107.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9538622", "eventUri": "eng-9538622", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-06", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 16}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

Did former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna, the BJP-JDS alliance's candidate from Hasan in Karnataka allegedly have sex with nearly 3,000 women as recorded in the pen drive in circulation in the capital city?\n\nWas this pen drive a miniscule part of a much larger underground pornographic industry, known to thrive in southern states and in which politicians are known to have financial interests?\n\nWas the issue of the sleazy videos (already in circulation for months befor the LS election) raked up deliberately to embarrass Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP?\n\nDr Nagalakshmi Chaudhary, chairperson of Karnataka State Commission for Women has jumped into the controversy by saying, \"The day this video came to my table, I immediately forwarded it to CM Siddaramaiah. I then organised a press meeting (April 25th) to warn the public such a video should not be put in the public domain, given the sensitivity of the victims whose faces are often visible. The Election was held in Karnataka on April 26th. I understand Prajwal Revanna cast his vote on 26th and left for Germany. He is reported to be in Munich.\"\n\nOn May 7, an election for the remaining 14 of the 28 seats will be held.\n\nSo far, three complaints have been made, the first by a 47-year-old woman from Hassan who lodged a complaint against the father-son duo for allegedly sexually harassing her and her daughter between 2019 and 2022. This complaint was made at the Holenarsipura police station on April 28th. Another complaint was lodged with the SIT by a former panchayat member who accused the father-son duo of holding her at gunpoint after threatening to kill her husband and then proceeding to rape her. Her husband worked as a former aide of Prajwal.\n\nWhat Dr Nagalakshmi Choudhary finds especially shocking is that, \"Prajwal did not hesitate to record these selfies while having sex with the women. This is disturbing. What kind of a man is he?\" she asked. The problem is most women in the videos have chosen to go underground and do not want to come forward and give evidence before the SIT.\n\nBengaluru-based feminist activist Madhu Bhushan, member of SIEDS said, \"Women are reluctant to come forward because the Gowdas are a powerful political family. Also, if they do, it will be a shame and horror for their families. They are scared. That is why so many of them have gone underground or just left the city.\"\n\nIt is for this reason a group of woman NGOs have decided to come together and undertake a low-key investigation by meeting the women individually, recording their evidence in their homes, and then putting it together in a report.\n\n\"No identities will be revealed and they will not be asked to come into the public domain to give any evidence. We will submit this report to SIT,\" said Sumithra Acharya, a Bengaluru-based advocate, who works with acid attack victims and their rehabilitation. Bengaluru-based Congress activist and entrepreneur Dipali Sikand believes the videos have only served to muddy the reputation of the state.\n\n\"The videos are so morbid... It is completely unacceptable. It shows how people in power victimise women,\" said Sikand.\n\nBack in December 2023, Karnataka BJP leader Devaraje Gowda from Hassan allegedly warned the state leadership about allegations that Prajwal was sexually abusing women. In a letter, purportedly to state party chief BY Vijayendra, he wanted the matter to be brought to the attention of national leaders. But Gowda's letter was ignored.\n\nPolitical analysts believe the videos were reportedly used by BJP to arm twist JDS to enter into an alliance with them. BJP is now trying to distance itself from the controversy with Karnataka BJP president BY Vijayendra stating his party has nothing to do with allegations against Prajwal, and his party does not interfere with the selection of candidates of their alliance partners.\n\nBut former vice-chancellor of Lucknow University, Dr.Roop Rekha, who has organised a hashtag petition against Prajwal calling for his immediate arrest, said, \"This government is known to give its tacit support to alleged rapists. Take the case of BJP MP Brij Bhushan Sharma. He has been accused of sexual misconduct by woman wrestlers, but no action has been taken. Instead, the party has fielded his son Karan Bhushan Singh from Kaiserganj in UP or take the case of the BHU woman student who was stripped and raped and the accused rapists video-recorded it. It happened on November 1st but what punishment has been meted out to the criminals?\" asked Dr Roop Rekha.", "source": {"uri": "freepressjournal.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Free Press Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnataka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Karnataka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajwal_Revanna", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prajwal Revanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Deve_Gowda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "H.

The woman, who worked as a house help at Revanna's farmhouse for six years, was among the many victims who featured in the alleged sex tapes of HD Revanna's son and Hassan MP Prajwal Revanna.\n\nThe police have registered a case against Revanna and one Satish Babanna under several sections of the Indian Penal Code on charges related to kidnapping, among others.\n\nRevanna and his son have also been booked for sexual harassment based on the complaint of another former maid in their house. HD Revanna has sought anticipatory bail in that case.\n\nOn May 2, a complaint was lodged by one Raju HD at KR Nagar Police Station in Mysuru district, alleging that his mother had been missing since April 29 and later, videos of her being sexually harassed went viral on social media.\n\nIn his complaint, Raju said he and his mother worked at Revanna's residence and farmhouse in Holenarasipura for six years. However, she quit the job three years ago.\n\nAround 3-4 days before the second phase of the Lok Sabha election on April 26, Raju claimed a person known to them, called Satish, came to their residence and said Revanna's wife Bhavani had called his mother for some work.\n\nRaju said Satish brought his mother back on April 26. However, Satish asked Raju to elope with his mother if the police came to their house.\n\n\"Make sure you're not there. If they (police) come to you, let me know, I will come and take you away,\" Raju was allegedly told by Satish.\n\nAfter three days, on April 29 at around 9 pm, Raju claimed that Satish came to their residence again and forcibly took away his mother, saying Revanna ordered her to be brought to him.\n\n\"He told us that if my mother is caught by the police, a case would be registered and all of us would go to jail,\" Raju said in his complaint.\n\nOn May 1, Raju said he learnt from his friends that his mother's sexual assault video had gone viral. Later, his relatives told him that in the video, his mother's legs could be seen tied, and she was being sexually harassed.\n\nThe same day, Raju said he called Satish to find out about the whereabouts of his mother. However, Sathish told him that a case had been registered against her, and she had to get bail.

The Padmanabhanagar house in Bengaluru has been a power center and fulcrum of state, and for a brief period, national politics too.\n\nThe residence commanded both envy, scorn, and respect amongst opponents and followers of the Gowda family, accustomed to getting visitors amongst the high and mighty. However, few would have imagined that cops would descend to arrest a family member.\n\nFor more than a year rumours had been swirling about the alleged sexual escapades of Gowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna, the sole Lok Sabha member of the party in the outgoing house. However a gag order he obtained from courts meant that nobody could say anything on record.\n\nBut after pendrives containing his alleged dalliances went viral, a few women came forward to formally accuse him of exploiting them. By that time, his seat had gone to the polls, and he had flown to Germany for a holiday.\n\nThis episode has set off tremors within Karnataka political circles, with some even questioning whether the 25-year-old party will survive the serious scandal facing members of its first family. 91-year-old family patriarch HD Deve Gowda suffers from kidney disease. Of his six children, two sons, Revanna and Kumaraswamy, apart from their sons Prajwal and Nikhil, respectively, are in politics, apart from various other relatives.\n\nEven before the polls, JDS was clutching at the coattails of the BJP for survival, having got only 19 seats in the 224-member assembly in the last year's polls. Kumaraswamy, who has been twice CM, has undergone multiple heart surgeries, including one just before the LS polls. With Revanna behind bars for allegedly abetting his son, questions are being raised about whether the party will survive its current challenges.\n\nJDS spokesperson and party MLC T A Sharavana refused to comment when Businessline contacted him, citing that the matter is subjudice. However, another senior leader who did not want to be identified said, 'The charges are very grave and affect the reputation of our party's first family. With Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy not in the best of health, 10 of the 19 legislators had carried out a mini-revolt, insisting on the suspension of Prajwal and they had to agree to it. It pains me to see Appaji (as Gowda is fondly called) suffer because of the actions of his son and grandson.'\n\nThe JDS leader went onto claim that if the outcome of the LS polls was not favourable to NDA and JDS, the party may disintegrate. \"Some of them are looking at Congress, and others at the BJP. Congress and BJP leaders refused to comment on the JDS future, saying it was too early,\" political analyst Harish Ramaswamy said. split is possible, depending on how the investigations go. Survival maybe based on the outcome of the investigations.'\n\nAnother seasoned political watcher, Sandeep Shastri, said, \"I will be hesitant to write off any political force. Yes, the Prajwal Revanna episode has damaged the party, and beyond doubt, it is a setback for the party. But does it therefore mean that the party goes into political oblivion? I would not take that stand. In the past, the JDS has bounced back from critical challenges it has faced.\"\n\nPolitical circles in the State, though, are agog that the outcome of the LS results on June 4 and investigations may decide the party's future. For the first family of JDS, the challenge is to keep it as a going concern.\n\ninputs by BL Intern by Nivasini Azagappan\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 6, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "@businessline"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Deve_Gowda", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "H.

According to police sources, he told his interrogators that he handed over the woman to Revanna's wife Bhavani.\n\nMeanwhile, chief minister Siddaramaiah said he has directed police to trace the missing woman.\n\nKR Nagar police registered a case under IPC Sections 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent to secretly and wrongfully confine a person) and 364 (kidnapping for ransom). Revanna is named as accused no. 1 and Babanna as accused no. 2.\n\nAccording to the complainant, his mother worked as a maid in Revanna's Holenarsipur residence for about six years. She quit the job three years ago and began working as a daily-wage labourer.\n\n\"Four days before April 26, Satish Babanna came to our house saying Bhavani was calling my mother. He took my mother with him and she returned home on voting day. Before leaving, he said police could visit us for some reason and we shouldn't tell them anything. Also, he threatened that some case could be registered against us,\" he said.\n\n\"Again, on April 29 night, Babanna came to our home and asked my mother to accompany him. He said Revanna had sent him to bring my mother. He also said if a case was registered against my mother, we would be in trouble and could be jailed. He took her on his motorbike. On May 1 afternoon, my friends told me that my mother was seen in a sex video. My brother-in-laws too called me saying that in the video, Prajwal rapes my mother in spite of her pleading with him to spare her. They told me it was turning out to be a big case. I called Babanna, asking him where my mother was and to bring her back immediately,\" the complainant said.\n\nHe said Babanna told him a criminal case was registered against his mother and they should bail her out.

Kumaraswamy has already spoken to Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP President J.P. Nadda multiple times since the case broke out. \"Mr. Kumaraswamy has briefed Mr. Shah about the developments.

The JD(S) remains vulnerable from Congress at this point in time. But JD(S) leaders have been told not to defend Prajwal publicly,\" sources said, adding that the JD(S) required BJP for its survival rather than the other way round.\n\nThough there are allegations that former BJP MLA Preetham Gowda was among those behind the distribution of pen drives with videos of Prajwal Revanna, BJP sources said that it would be difficult for the Gowda family to seek action against him from the BJP leadership at this juncture.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janata_Dal_(Secular)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Janata Dal (Secular)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._D._Kumaraswamy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "H.

It is learnt that the investigation agency got strong leads that the MP, who was believed to be in Germany, kept changing places and had moved to Dubai, from where he had booked a flight to Bengaluru.\n\nFollowing the information, a team of SIT officials arrived at KIA and camped there from 1 pm on Sunday. The police officials were monitoring the status of the flight, in which the MP had purportedly booked a seat. But there was no sign of the MP alighting even after the said flight landed. After waiting for hours, the SIT officials left the airport in the night.\n\nThough Bengaluru has direct flights from Dubai, the SIT had alerted immigration officials at other airports across the country to keep track of arrivals from the Gulf. \"There was also suspicion that he could opt for another flight and land at some other airport at the last moment. That was the reason this step was taken,\" an official explained.\n\nThough most members of the SIT returned, some officials are still stationed at the airport to check on later arrivals from Dubai. Since the MP is still on the run, the SIT has continued their probe to find out where he is.

Shivaramegowda has said that the top leaders of the BJP including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and members of H.D. Deve Gowda family were aware of the alleged sexual atrocities perpetrated by JD(S) MP Prajwal Revanna in Hassan district.\n\n\"But still he was given ticket to contest the elections from Hassan Lok Sabha Constituency. Now, Prajwal's sexual exploitations are making headlines across the globe. It is possible that the atrocities committed against women by Prajwal Revanna may damage the prospects of the BJP in the LS elections as he was contesting as an NDA alliance candidate. Hence, the BJP must immediately remove the JD(S) from its list of NDA partners,\" urged Shivaramegowda while speaking to the media at Mandya on Friday.\n\n\"LS polls will be held till the end of this month across the country and Prajwal's case may damage the prospects of BJP. God should not have given such a pain to JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda at this advanced age. His family members finished the political careers of leaders like me and are now facing these situations,\" added the former Mandya MP.\n\nShivaramegowda recalled that former Prime Minister Deve Gowda carried a portrait of journalist Kanchanahalli Gangadhara Murthy on his head during his protest march from Bellur to Kanchanahalli to implicate him in the murder case of Gangadhara Murthy.\n\n\"But the Court ruled that I had no role in the murder and gave punishment to the guilty. But Deve Gowda organised a massive protest to finish my political career,\" alleged the BJP leader.\n\nContinuing, he said that he as an MLA gave his support to JD(S) when H.D. Deve Gowda became the Chief Minister of Karnataka and he made him as the Chairman of the Bengaluru Development Authority (BDA).\n\n\"I joined JD(S) in 2017 and worked for the success of K. Suresh Gowda, who was the party candidate for the Assembly elections from Nagamangala. I was given the JD(S) ticket to the Mandya LS by-election and spent Rs. 32 crore in the election to be an MP for a period of just five and a half months. But, in the general elections held in 2019, they refused ticket to me to install his son as the MP from Mandya. The Government must immediately arrest both Holenarasipur MLA H.D. Revanna and MP Prajwal Revanna\" said Shivaramegowda.\n\nDeve Gowda and his son H.D. Kumaraswamy, also an ex-CM, have destroyed the political careers of many Vokkaliga leaders including him and are now paying for their various misdeeds, he added.

Risa Hontiveros, chair of the Senate women's committee, ruled to cite Guo and others in contempt upon the separate motions of Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada and Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian.\n\nHontiveros also ruled to issue a warrant of arrest against Guo, which would still need to be signed by the Senate president before it takes effect.\n\nEstrada moved to cite Guo in contempt after saying he found her letter explaining her absence due to mental health issues \"unacceptable.\"\n\nBesides Guo, these are the individuals who were cited in contempt for skipping the hearing:\n\nIn the letter Guo's camp sent to the Senate on Tuesday, the suspended Bamban mayor said she is not \"physically and mentally fit\" to attend the Senate hearing. She said he has been the \"subject of malicious accusations\" and targeted with death threats, causing her to seek professional help.\n\nGuo said she could not find a medical professional to issue her a medical certificate because they \"fear that they may also experience the humiliation and ridicule that I am going through.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Hontiveros said that while the panel recognizes the importance of mental health, Guo is being compelled to testify due to the gravity of the accusations against her.\n\nThe Senate can also arrange for a government doctor to attend to Guo, if requested, the senator added.\n\n\"We do not want to set a precedence where mental health is invoked to skirt the obligation to appear before a Senate committee,\" Hontiveros said, adding that she and other senators find her claims in her letter \"devoid of credibility.\"\n\nGatchalian said he considers the absence of the invited resource speakers as a \"sign of guilt\" as this is already the committee's fourth hearing into POGO hubs' illegal activities.\n\n\"Not attending the hearing will be their loss because it removes the opportunity for them to explain their side,\" Gatchalian said in Filipino.\n\n\"This is a sign that they have something they do not want to reveal or that they have something to hide,\" the senator added.\n\nEscudero on Tuesday vowed to sign an arrest warrant against Guo if issued by Hontiveros, reminding Guo and her legal camp that the subpoena issued against her requires her to face the senators out of \"compulsion of law.\"\n\nGuo did not attend the previous hearing on June 26 due to what her legal counsel said was health reasons, which took place less than a week after she was charged with qualified human trafficking before the Department of

Wesley Guo, Sheila Guo and Seimen Guo are believed to be her siblings.\n\nGuo had previously informed the committee of her inability to attend, saying she was \"not physically and mentally fit.\"\n\nAdditionally, the Senate panel issued a subpoena to Alberto Rodulfo \"AR\" de la Serna, the former executive assistant of Harry Roque, a former presidential spokesperson. De la Serna gained attention after documents found in a raided POGO hub in Porac, Pampanga, suggested that Roque sponsored his trip to Europe in 2021.\n\nIn an affidavit, Roque justified taking De la Serna along as a travel companion due to his health issues such as diabetes, a coronary stent, and acute spinal stenosis.\n\nDe la Serna, a Business Administration graduate of Holy Name University in Tagbilaran City, Bohol, and Mr. Supranational Philippines 2016, held the position of Executive Assistant III in the Office of the Presidential Spokesperson.\n\nThe Senate panel also issued subpoenas to Jaimielyn Cruz, Roderick Paul Pujante, Juan Miguel Alpas, Katherin Cassandra Ong, Jonathan Mendoza, Ronelyn Baterna, Michael Bryce Mascarenas, Stephanie Mascarenas, Rodrigo Banda, Jing Gu, Daniel Salcedo Jr., Chona Alejandre and Duanren Wu.\n\nAn arrest warrant was sought for Alice Guo for her absence at the Senate investigation. Senator Hontiveros expressed her intention to write to Senate President Francis Escudero, to urge action against Guo and seven others allegedly involved in illegal activities at the raided Lucky South 99, despite having been subpoenaed.\n\n\"I will immediately write to the Senate President so it reaches his desk today,\" Hontiveros said. She reiterated Escudero's readiness to sign Guo's arrest warrant upon her panel's request.\n\nExplaining the Senate rules, Hontiveros emphasized that the investigation, aimed at legislation, follows the issuance of subpoenas. Continuous non-compliance could result in contempt charges and, ultimately, arrest warrants.\n\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Senator Win Gatchalian requested the committee to cite Mayor Guo, Gamo, Cunanan, Lin, Seimen Guo, Jian Zhong Guo, Wesley Guo and Sheila Guo for contempt due to their failure to attend the fourth hearing on Lucky South 99's illegal operations.\n\nGatchalian expressed disappointment, calling their actions disrespectful to the Senate and its processes. He emphasized that ignoring subpoenas undermines the institution's efforts to uncover the truth.\n\nSenate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada moved to issue an arrest warrant against Alice Guo after reviewing her excuse letter for missing the hearing.\n\nIn her letter, Guo cited ongoing mental health issues: \"Since then, my condition has not improved and even worsened. Truth be told, I have already sought professional help but the medical professionals that I have consulted refused to issue a medical certificate stating my condition for fear that they may also experience the humiliation and ridicule that I am going through.\"\n\nEstrada dismissed Guo's explanation as unacceptable and proposed she be evaluated by a government doctor to ascertain the truth. He moved to issue an arrest warrant for her attendance at the next hearing, a motion approved by Hontiveros.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Nancy Binay criticized Guo's use of mental health issues as a reason for skipping the investigation, stating, \"It's unfair to those with genuine mental health conditions. Mental health is a serious issue and should not be used as an excuse for dishonesty.\"", "source": {"uri": "tribune.net.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She has not been charged with any crime related to illegal gambling. Guo did not respond to Reuters' request for comment but wrote to the senate that she was the subject of \"malicious accusations\".\n\nGuo's case comes at a time of growing Philippine suspicion about China's activities following an increasingly tense dispute over reefs and shoals in the busy waterway of the South China Sea, where both nations have claims.\n\nIt has boosted calls for a crackdown on Philippine offshore gambling operators, or POGOs, mostly run by Chinese nationals to serve clients in China, which flourished during the tenure of former President Rodrigo Duterte, but have since drawn scrutiny.\n\nThe senate cited Guo in contempt for failing to appear and Senator Risa Hontiveros, who is leading the investigation, said she would set in motion steps to get a warrant for her arrest. Guo's legal team on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to nullify the summons.\n\n\"To Alice Guo, we will arrest you and you will attend the next hearing,\" said Hontiveros, who told a previous hearing that Guo might have been born in China, although she gave no proof.\n\nRaid raises questions\n\nThe investigation began after a police raid revealed a scam center operating out of a facility built on land partially owned by Guo. It was one of many that have sprung up across Southeast Asia in recent years.\n\nThe raid uncovered hundreds of trafficked workers including foreign nationals, spurring a human trafficking complaint against Guo from an agency battling organized crime.\n\nGuo has said she sold her stake in the business before she was elected in 2022 and had no knowledge of criminality.\n\nOfficials have turned a searchlight on her background since.\n\nThe senate heard testimony on Wednesday that appeared to contradict Guo's account, with senator Sherwin Gatchalian saying records had been found that showed Guo attended grade school in the Philippines registered as a Chinese national. Guo has said she was home-schooled.\n\nHer lawyer was not present at the hearing and did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe National Bureau of Investigation said Guo's fingerprints matched those of a Chinese national who entered the country as a teenager.\n\nThe solicitor general is seeking to cancel her birth certificate and she has been suspended from her post during the investigation.

Our system may be brittle, but it is not broken.\"\n\nHontiveros said the answer she wanted to hear at the Senate probe are: \"Who are enabling her and these POGOs?

Risa Hontiveros, who is leading the probe as chair of the Senate committee on women, children, family relations and gender equality, on Wednesday cited Guo in contempt after she failed to appear at the hearing for the second time.\n\nREAD: Alice Guo and 7 others cited for contempt, ordered arrested\n\nAlso held in contempt were Guo's siblings Sheila, Seimen and Wesley; their supposed parents, Chinese nationals Jian Zhong Guo and Lin Wenyi; Nancy Gamo, the accountant of the companies owned by Guo's family, and Dennis Cunanan, who had served as the authorized representative of Hongsheng Gaming Technology Inc. that the Philippine Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) raided in Bamban.\n\nHontiveros said she would immediately write a letter asking Senate President Francis Escudero to issue arrest warrants against Guo and the others.\n\n\"Under the rules of the Senate, the practical implication of [a person] being cited in contempt is the issuance of the warrant of arrest,\" Hontiveros told reporters after the hearing that lasted five hours.\n\n\"We will look for them. And we will find them eventually,\" she warned.\n\nSen. Sherwin Gatchalian, who made the motion to hold Guo and the others in contempt, said the controversial mayor's decision not to participate in the hearing only proved her direct involvement in the activities of illegal Pogos.\n\n\"It is dismaying that we invited these important resource persons to give them a chance to give their side. But it seems that they do not respect the Senate and its institution,\" Gatchalian lamented.\n\n\"Their failure to attend is a sign of guilt,\" he stressed.\n\nThe senators did not buy Guo's excuse that her worsening mental health and physical condition prompted her to again skip the hearing.\n\n\"It's unfair to those with genuine mental health conditions. Mental health is a serious issue and should not be used as an excuse for dishonesty,\" Sen. Nancy Binay said.\n\nViolated rights\n\nOn the same day as the Senate hearing, Guo's lawyers filed a petition for certiorari at the Supreme Court, seeking to stop the Senate committee from inviting her to appear in the hearings.\n\nIn a 78-page petition, Guo asked the high tribunal to junk the subpoena issued by the Senate panel for her to appear in the public hearings.\n\nThe suspended local official also appealed for an issuance of a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction against Hontiveros, arguing that the lawmaker committed grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, when she subjected Guo to \"public prosecution and humiliation\" during an earlier public hearing.\n\n\"With due respect, the inquiries, as apparent as it could be on the transcripts, did not really pinpoint how it can help the committee in crafting relevant laws in regulating Pogo, in cyber fraud and in human trafficking,\" the petitioner said through her legal counsel.\n\nGuo's camp claimed that in conducting the inquiries, the Senate committee violated her constitutional rights, right to due process, and right to privacy.\n\nWhile she was invited as a resource person to share her knowledge on the alleged illegal activities of Pogos in her jurisdiction, the petition argued that she was \"never afforded any opportunity to sufficiently explain her side\" whenever a certain issue was raised.\n\n\"Although she was being asked questions relative to the issues against her, her side of the story was never considered for she was already branded, called and concluded to be a 'liar,' 'spy,' and 'Pogo operator,'\" it said.\n\nThe petition also pointed out that the questions asked of her did not touch on her official duties but focused on her private life.\n\n\"Arguably, the fact that she can speak another foreign language or that she cannot speak another native language, the fact that she was homeschooled in her prime years, the fact that she owns properties and businesses, or that she does not know or she never met her mother, have nothing to do with these inquiries as these are all private concerns of a private citizen,\" it said.\n\n\"On top of all the cases filed against Guo, it is the Public Respondent's act as if it were a court, instead of a Senate inquiry with the aim of aiding legislation, which puts Guo in a position as if she were a criminal,\" it pointed out.\n\nMore damning evidence\n\nDuring the resumption of the Senate hearing, Gatchalian presented another set of documents to belie Guo's earlier claim that she did not have any formal education since she was just homeschooled in a pig farm owned by her father.\n\nAccording to him, Guo actually completed the first three years of her basic education at Grace Christian High School in Quezon City from 2000 to 2003.\n\nThe senator, who also attended the same school, presented copies of her report card.\n\n\"Apparently, Guo Hua Ping, or Alice Guo, did not grow up on a farm and was not homeschooled,\" Gatchalian surmised.\n\n\"She really studied [here]. And as I recall, there was no farm in our school. There were just buildings,\" he added, eliciting chuckles from those who attended the hearing.\n\nGatchalian also showed copies of an alien certificate of registration from the Bureau of Immigration (BI).\n\nThe documents were issued to one Guo Hua Ping, whom authorities believed was Guo's real identity based on the fingerprint analysis conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation and other government records.\n\nOne of the travel documents, which had a photo of a young girl, showed that the BI had issued an alien certificate of registration to Hua Ping on Dec. 9, 1999.\n\nThe bureau again granted Hua Ping with the same certificate on Nov. 8, 2004.\n\nGatchalian noted that the document had a picture of a teenage girl who looked like a young Guo.\n\nThe NBI had earlier said that Hua Ping first entered the country as a 13-year-old on Jan. 12, 2003, using a special investor resident visa.", "source": {"uri": "globalnation.inquirer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inquirer"},

She has not been charged with any crime related to illegal gambling. Guo did not respond to Reuters' request for comment but wrote to the senate that she was the subject of \"malicious accusations\".\n\nGuo's case comes at a time of growing Philippine suspicion about China's activities following an increasingly tense dispute over reefs and shoals in the busy waterway of the South China Sea, where both nations have claims.\n\nIt has boosted calls for a crackdown on Philippine offshore gambling operators, or POGOs, mostly run by Chinese nationals to serve clients in China, which flourished during the tenure of former President Rodrigo Duterte, but have since drawn scrutiny.\n\nThe senate cited Guo in contempt for failing to appear and Senator Risa Hontiveros, who is leading the investigation, said she would set in motion steps to get a warrant for her arrest. Guo's legal team on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to nullify the summons.\n\n\"To Alice Guo, we will arrest you and you will attend the next hearing,\" said Hontiveros, who told a previous hearing that Guo might have been born in China, although she gave no proof.\n\nRAID RAISES QUESTIONS\n\nThe investigation began after a police raid revealed a scam centre operating out of a facility built on land partially owned by Guo. It was one of many that have sprung up across Southeast Asia in recent years.\n\nThe raid uncovered hundreds of trafficked workers including foreign nationals, spurring a human trafficking complaint against Guo from an agency battling organised crime.\n\nGuo has said she sold her stake in the business before she was elected in 2022 and had no knowledge of criminality.\n\nOfficials have turned a searchlight on her background since.\n\nThe senate heard testimony on Wednesday that appeared to contradict Guo's account, with senator Sherwin Gatchalian saying records had been found that showed Guo attended grade school in the Philippines registered as a Chinese national. Guo has said she was home-schooled.\n\nHer lawyer was not present at the hearing and did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe National Bureau of Investigation said Guo's fingerprints matched those of a Chinese national who entered the country as a teenager.\n\nThe solicitor general is seeking to cancel her birth certificate and she has been suspended from her post during the investigation. The senate committee urged the immigration agency to stop Guo from leaving the Philippines.\n\nEarlier hearings grilled Guo about her background. After she was unable to recall details of her childhood, Hontiveros asked if she was an \"asset\" for China.\n\nIn May, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr told reporters, \"No one knows her. We wonder where she came from. That's why we are investigating this, together with the Bureau of Immigration, because of the questions about her citizenship.\"\n\nThe mayor has denied she is a spy, saying in a television interview that she was a simple Philippine citizen, the love child of her Chinese father with a maid who had grown up \"hidden\" on a pig farm, with no friends.\n\nReporting by Neil Jerome Morales and Poppy

In her petition, the Bamban mayor wants the Court to scrap the subpoena issued to her by the Senate committee on women, children, family relations, and gender equality chaired by opposition Senator Risa Hontiveros.\n\nGuo also wants the SC to direct the Senate committee from further inviting her to the hearings.\n\nThe Bamban mayor was put into the national spotlight for her alleged ties with an illegal Philippine offshore gaming operator (POGO) raided in her town. Her nationality was questioned at the height of the Senate hearings, with Hontiveros even asking whether she is an \"asset\" of China to infiltrate local politics. Guo was also questioned for not remembering basic details about her personal life, including her childhood.\n\nGuo skipped the Senate panel's hearing on June 26, which prompted Hontiveros to issue a Subpoena Ad Testificandum against Guo, compelling her to appear before the legislative body.\n\nIn her petition, Guo claimed the Senate panel committed grave abuse of discretion when it allegedly violated the mayor's constitutional rights, her right to due process, and Guo's right to privacy, among others.\n\nIt was not the first time that an embattled figure has sought the SC's help to stop a Senate order. Fugitive doomsday pastor Apollo Quiboloy, who faces criminal cases, was also ordered arrested by the Senate committee on women, children, family relations, and gender equality after snubbing the panel's probe into his alleged abuses. Early this year, Quiboloy went to the High Court to stop the \"unjust and unconstitutional\" Senate warrant.\n\nThe Constitution empowers the Senate to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation. That is the legal basis for the Rules of the Senate, under which the upper house can summon witnesses and ask them to bring documents to the inquiry. The legislature's contempt powers are limited and the SC has already reminded the Senate it can only detain a person held in contempt only for as long as an inquiry was ongoing.\n\nAside from the Senate probe, Guo faces a string of other problems.\n\nGuo currently faces a non-bailable qualified trafficking complaint, which stemmed from her alleged involvement in the illegal POGO where human trafficking violations were allegedly committed. If the prosecutors find enough basis to pursue the case and charge her and fellow respondents for qualified trafficking, a judge will decide if warrants of arrest will be issued.\n\nThe National Bureau of Investigation also confirmed that the fingerprints of Guo and and a certain Guo Hua Ping had matched. Guo, the mayor, is suspected of actually being Guo Hua Ping. This opened more questions about the Bamban mayor's real identity and nationality.\n\nLast week, on July 5, a petition was filed with a local Tarlac court seeking to cancel Guo's birth certificate. Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, whose office filed the petition, said if Guo's birth certificate is canceled, she will lose her most important defense evidence about her identity.\n\nThe cancellation of the birth certificate can also be used in a quo warranto case. If the quo warranto succeeds, Guo would be stripped of Filipino citizenship, which is a prerequisite to holding public office.\n\nBecause of her absence in Wednesday's Senate hearing, the upper chamber has cited Guo in contempt, which could pave the way for the Senate order to arrest her. - Rappler.com", "source": {"uri": "rappler.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rappler"}, "authors":

Risa Hontiveros to compel suspended Bamban Mayor Alice Guo to face the Senate women and gender equality committee, warning Guo of a potential arrest warrant against her if she skips the next hearing.\n\nIn a press conference on Tuesday, Escudero said he would sign a possible warrant of arrest against Guo if this is formally requested by Hontiveros, chair of the Senate panel investigating the illegal Philippine offshore gaming operator (POGO) hub in Bamban.\n\n\"Nasa kamay ni Senator Risa kung siya ay magre-request kung ma-issue ng warrant of arrest para sila ay pwersahang padaluhin sa pagdinig ng Senado,\" he said. \"At pipirmahan ko ang warrant of arrest na iyon kapag ni-request ni Senator Risa.\"\n\n(It is in the hands of Senator Risa whether she will request the issuance of a warrant of arrest to compel them to attend the Senate hearing, and I will sign that warrant of arrest if Senator Risa requests it.)\n\nThe Senate will resume its probe on the Bamban POGO hub and Guo's alleged involvement in its operations on July 10, making it the fourth hearing into the matter.\n\nGuo did not attend the previous hearing on June 26 due to health reasons, according to her legal counsel, which took place less than a week after she was charged with qualified human trafficking before the Department of Justice.\n\nHer absence led Hontiveros to issue a subpoena against her, which her camp has yet to receive as she was nowhere to be found in her alleged farm in Bamban, Tarlac, where only the farm helper was present, according to Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Roberto Ancan.\n\nOn Tuesday, Guo's lawyer Stephen David said that the suspended Bamban mayor may again skip the next Senate probe after she was \"traumatized\" by the \"Senate's treatment\" of her during the previous committee hearings.\n\nEscudero chided Guo's legal camp and said it is not up to them to decide whether or not to attend the next hearing as a subpoena falls under \"compulsion of law.\"\n\n\"Kapag nag-issue ng subpoena, ang husgado man, ang Senado, ang Kongreso, obligado ang testigo na sundin at sundan ito. Hindi ako kumakatig sa kaniyang sagot, o sagot ng abogado niya, na desisyon nila 'yan at call nila 'yan,\" said Escudero.\n\n(When a subpoena is issued, whether by the court, the Senate, or Congress, the witness is obliged to comply and follow it.

Ngayong na wala na siyang lusot, nagpapa-victim siya (Now that she has no excuse, she is playing the victim),\" Hontiveros said.\n\n\"If she doesn't honor the subpoena, the Senate is well within its rights to issue an arrest order.

Ako, as much as possible, hinihikayat ko siya. Ang problema kasi masyado siyang traumatized sa pagpapahiya sa kanya. Physically and emotionally draining sa kanya lalo na 'yung mga bashers 'nya,\" David said.\n\n(I spoke to her yesterday morning. As much as possible, I'm encouraging her to attend. The problem really is she is traumatized by her being shamed [during the hearings]. It's physically and emotionally draining for her, especially by what bashers say about her.)\n\nDavid said that Guo is still in the country. \"Magkausap kami sa phone, she assured me na nasa Pilipinas siya. Ako naniniwala ako na nasa Pilipinas lang siya,\" he said. (I spoke with her via phone call and she assured me that she's still in the Philippines. I believe she's still here.)\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Hontiveros said that Guo and her lawyers should respect the laws of the country. The senator was reacting to the statement from Guo's camp that they do not expect a \"fair\" hearing at the Senate, and that it's only in court where they \"expect a fair trial.\"\n\n\"Our jurisprudence is clear and consistent. The Supreme Court has recognized that the invocation of the right against self-incrimination can only be done when a question is being asked,\" she said.\n\nOn June 27, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) confirmed that the fingerprints of the suspended mayor and Guo Hua Ping - the Chinese woman who is suspected to be the real identity of the local official - match, meaning they are \"one and same\" person, according to Hontiveros.\n\nHontiveros said that the NBI finding was the \"strongest evidence\" to strip Guo of her elective post. She also urged the Office of the Solicitor General \"to expedite its filing of a quo warranto case against\" Guo.\n\nThe Bamban mayor is under preventive suspension ordered by the Ombudsman. The suspension was due to a graft case filed by the Department of the Interior and Local Government over serious illegal acts and her link to illegal activities of POGOs. - Rappler.com", "source":

Truth be told, I have already sought professional help but the medical professionals that I have consulted refused to issue a medical certificate stating my condition for fear that they may also experience the humiliation and ridicule that I am going through,\" she wrote in her letter.\n\nBut, Estrada did not buy Alice Guo's explanation.\n\n\"I suggest that she be attended by a government doctor so we can know the whole truth. I think this letter of explanation is totally unacceptable. Therefore, I would like to move that we issue a warrant of arrest against Mayor Guo for her to attend the next hearing if there is one,\" Estrada said.\n\nHontiveros approved Estrada's motion.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Nancy Binay, who also made a manifestation to cite Guo in contempt, slammed Guo's use of mental health issues to skip the Senate investigation.\n\n\"Ang sa akin lang, nakakahiya naman po sa mga tunay na may mental health condition. Seryosong usapin ang mental health at hindi po ito dapat ginagamit na dahilan para magsinungaling (It's unfair to those with genuine mental health conditions. Mental health is a serious issue and should not be used as an excuse for dishonesty),\" Binay lamented.\n\nThe Senate panel also cited in contempt and issued subpoenas to supposed Lucky South 99's incorporators, including Jaimielyn Cruz, Roderick Paul Pujante, Juan Miguel Alpas, Katherine Cassandra Ong, Alberto Rodulfo dela Serna, Jonathan Mendoza, Ronelyn Baterna, Michael Mascarenas, Stephanie Mascarenas, Rodrigo Banda, Jing Gu, Xiang Tan, Daniel Salcedo Jr., Chona Alejandre, and Duanren Wu.\n\nMeanwhile, Hontiveros invited former Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque to attend the next inquiry on the matter.

That's why we are investigating this, together with the Bureau of Immigration, because of the questions about her citizenship.\"\n\nThe mayor has denied she is a spy, saying in a television interview that she was a simple Philippine citizen, the love child of her Chinese father with a maid who had grown up \"hidden\" on a pig farm and homeschooled, with no friends.\n\nGuo's case comes at a time of growing Philippine suspicion about China's activities following an increasingly tense dispute over reefs and shoals in the busy waterway of the South China Sea, where both nations have claims.\n\nIt has boosted calls for a crackdown on Philippine offshore gambling operators, or POGOs, mostly run by Chinese nationals to serve clients in China, which flourished during the tenure of former President Rodrigo Duterte, but have since drawn scrutiny. -

Risa Hontiveros approved the motion to have Guo cited in contempt for skipping yesterday's resumption of the investigation on illegal POGO scam hubs in Bamban, Tarlac and Porac, Pampanga.\n\nIn a 78-page petition for certiorari, Guo asked the high court to annul the subpoena ad testificandum issued by the Senate panel.\n\nShe argued that the Senate committee committed grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction, when it subjected the suspended mayor to \"public persecution and humiliation, disregarding her constitutional rights.\"\n\nIn an ambush interview after the hearing, Hontiveros expressed confidence that Senate President Francis Escudero would sign the arrest warrant that her committee would request against Guo over her contempt citation.\n\nThe senators found as unacceptable Guo's excuse that she is suffering from mental health problems, the same reason she used for not attending the June 26 hearing.\n\nHontiveros said Guo's letter does not contain a medical certificate diagnosing her mental health condition. \"We find her claims in the letter devoid of credibility,\" she added.\n\nSen. Nancy Binay said Guo's alibi mocks the situation of other people who actually have mental health issues, adding that mental health \"should not be used as a reason to lie.\"\n\n\"Her reason for not attending is not acceptable. Mayor Guo or Guo Hua Ping is the one who opened the door for the POGO hub to enter Tarlac,\" added Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian.\n\nMayor Guo's parents - Jian Zhong Guo and Wen Yi Lin as well as siblings Seimen, Sheila and Wesley - were also cited in contempt for ignoring the Senate panel's summons to attend the hearing.\n\nGatchalian also moved to summon the officials of both Lucky South 99 and Whirlwind Corp., the company which leased its 10-hectare property to the Porac POGO hub.\n\nGuo not homeschooled\n\nContrary to her previous testimony, Mayor Guo was not homeschooled, Gatchalian said yesterday.\n\nDuring yesterday's hearing, Gatchalian presented various school records of Guo or Guo Hua Ping from Grade 1 to Grade 3 at the Grace Christian High School in Quezon City.\n\n\"Apparently neither Guo Hua Ping nor Alice Guo grew up on the farm. She wasn't homeschooled either. She attended school,\" Gatchalian revealed.\n\n\"Because her real name is beyond hearing, she studied at the same school as me - at Grace Christian High School from Grades 1, 2 and 3. Year 2000 to 2003. So she was not homeschooled... She really studied. And what I remember of our school, there was no farm there, only buildings,\" he said.\n\nThe senator presented the alien certificate of registration that matched the document from the Bureau of Immigration. He also showed a copy of Guo Hua Ping's birth certificate from China.\n\n'Ignorant'\n\nPorac, Pampanga Mayor Jaime Capil admitted he did not receive a letter from the Philippine National Police-Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) regarding illegal activities at a hotel operated by Lucky South 99 Corp.\n\nCapil made the statement after CIDG Pampanga chief Maj. Arvin Hosmillo said he sent a letter to the Office of Business Permit and Licensing Office on July 14, 2021, when a former employee of Royal Hotel reported to police about illegal activity.\n\nCapil maintained that he did not receive any letter from CIDG Pampanga.\n\n\"With all honesty and with due respect, no letter has actually reached me,\" Capil said on questioning by Gatchalian.\n\nGatchalian said it appears that Lucky South 99 has \"special treatment\" despite the red flags from CIDG but Capil denied this. -- Mayen Jaymalin, Emmanuel Tupas, Daphne Galvez, Cecille

Risa Hontiveros, chairman of the committee, issued the ruling upon the separate motions of Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada and Sen.

And we found out that the actual residents of 138 Kalantiaw Street are spouses Perry and Josefina Publico.

But we were able to talk to the barangay secretary of barangay Toro, and he claimed that the clustering of streets is named after mountains and planets. So, there is no Kalantiaw [Street],\" he added.\n\nGatchalian said documents he obtained showed that Guo did not grow up on a farm in Bamban town. And she was \"not also homeschooled\" as she claimed.\n\nThe senator said Guo studied at the Grace Christian High School, where he also studied from Grades 1 to 3 and from 2000 to 2003. \"So, she was not homeschooled by [a certain teacher] Rubilyn.

Guo did not respond to Reuters' request for comment but wrote to the senate that she was the subject of \"malicious accusations\".\n\nOn Wednesday, the senate cited Guo in contempt for failing to appear and Senator Risa Hontiveros, who is leading the investigation, said she would set in motion steps to get a warrant for her arrest.\n\n\"The chair has ruled to cite them in contempt,\" said Hontiveros, who told a previous hearing that Guo might have actually been born in China and be a Chinese \"asset\", although she gave no proof.\n\nRAID RAISES QUESTIONS\n\nThe investigation began after a police raid revealed a scam centre operating out of a facility built on land partially owned by Guo. It was one of many that have sprung up across Southeast Asia in recent years.\n\nThe raid uncovered hundreds of trafficked workers including foreign nationals, spurring a human trafficking complaint against Guo from an agency battling organised crime.\n\nGuo has said she sold her stake in the business before she was elected in 2022 and had no knowledge of criminality.\n\nOfficials have turned a searchlight on her background since.\n\nThe National Bureau of Investigation said Guo's fingerprints matched those of a Chinese national who entered the country as a teenager.\n\nThe solicitor general is seeking to cancel her birth certificate and she has been suspended from her post during the investigation. The senate committee urged the immigration agency to stop Guo from leaving the Philippines.\n\nGuo's attorney, Stephen David, told radio station DWPM she had been \"traumatised\" by previous sessions but had assured him she was still in the Philippines.\n\n\"If she gets arrested and detained at the senate, then she will testify,\" he said.\n\nEarlier hearings grilled Guo about her background and a lack of records regarding her presence in the Philippines. After she was unable to recall details of her childhood, Hontiveros asked if she was an \"asset\" for China.\n\nIn May, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr told reporters, \"No one knows her.

At least one senator accused her of being a Chinese spy, an allegation which she has denied.\n\nGuo's case has arisen against the backdrop of heightened tensions between Manila and Beijing in their territorial dispute in the South China Sea. Various Philippine security officials had also raised concerns that Beijing could be using illegal gaming operations to stir up trouble in the Southeast Asian country amid the maritime row.\n\nGuo, along with a dozen people including her family members, skipped the Senate hearing into alleged criminal activities involving Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs), despite having been subpoenaed.\n\n\"This committee is ordering the arrest of the persons cited in contempt to be submitted to the Senate President [Francis Escuero] for his signature,\" said Sen. Risa Hontiveros, chairwoman of the Senate panel on women, children, family relations and gender equality, which is conducting the probe.\n\nHontiveros said Guo had sent a letter to the committee saying she could not attend the hearing due to \"health and mental concerns,\" but the mayor did not present a medical certificate, raising questions among senators.\n\n\"[The] question we want to answer here today, and perhaps the question we are capable of answering: Who is enabling her and these POGOs? Are there protectors within our government?\" the senator asked.\n\nPOGOs are online gaming firms that cater to foreign customers, especially nationals from China, where gambling is illegal.\n\nPhilippine authorities suspect some POGOs are illegal and serve as fronts for criminal operations.\n\nIn February and March, authorities raided two POGOs operating in a Bamban property allegedly owned by Guo's company.\n\nDocuments presented to the Senate allegedly showed that Guo had personally applied for one of the two firm's business permits in 2020.\n\nGuo had previously acknowledged that she once owned half of the company that owned the property where the two POGOS were operating. However, Guo said she had divested from the business before running for public office in 2022.\n\nGuo is currently suspended from office after the government filed a graft case against her over her alleged links to POGOs.\n\nOn the day the Senate ordered her arrest, Guo's camp filed a petition before the Supreme Court to prevent the Senate from further compelling her to attend its hearings.\n\nQuestions about Guo's identity\n\nDuring Wednesday's hearing, Hontiveros also said a probe conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation had discovered that Guo was a Chinese national named Guo Hua Ping, and therefore she should not have been qualified to run as a mayor in the Philippines.\n\nGuo won the 2022 mayoral election in Bamban, a town in central Luzon.\n\n\"Is Guo ... an 'asset' that China sent to enter our government for them to have an influence in Philippine politics?\" Hontiveros asked in an earlier probe. Guo has asserted she is a citizen of the Philippines.\n\nSubject to government regulation, POGOs flourished under the administration of former President Rodrigo Duterte (2016-2022).\n\nPOGOs hired at least 69,000 Chinese nationals for their language skills during the previous administration.\n\nSome lawmakers, however, believe that number may be higher if undocumented Chinese nationals working in POGOs were included.\n\nIn recent years, Philippine authorities have accused some POGOs of being involved in various crimes such as human trafficking, hacking, and online scams.\n\nOver 250 POGOs are also suspected to be operating without a license, according to the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (PAGCOR), a government-owned entity. By comparison, 46 operate legitimately in the country.\n\nUnder Duterte, there was a \"de facto open door policy for POGOs,\" Hontiveros said.\n\n\"Let's see where the evidence takes us, if this time around we would be able to connect the dotted lines all the way to Duterte,\" she said, adding there was also evidence linking Duterte's former spokesperson Harry Roque to a POGO firm.\n\nDuterte could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but Roque denied any wrongdoing and challenged Hontiveros to show proof.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately reply to requests from BenarNews for comment.\n\nOn July 1, officials from Manila and Beijing agreed to boost bilateral cooperation efforts against transnational crimes, including offshore gaming operations in the Philippines.\n\nLast month, National Security Adviser Eduardo A\u00f1o said the Philippines was monitoring POGOs amid security concerns that China could be involved in illegal gambling operations.",

Guo did not respond to Reuters' request for comment but wrote to the senate that she was the subject of \"malicious accusations\".\n\nOn Wednesday, the senate cited Guo in contempt for failing to appear and Senator Risa Hontiveros, who is leading the investigation, said she would set in motion steps to get a warrant for her arrest.\n\n\"The chair has ruled to cite them in contempt,\" said Hontiveros, who told a previous hearing that Guo might have actually been born in China and be a Chinese \"asset\", although she gave no proof.\n\nRAID RAISES QUESTIONS\n\nThe investigation began after a police raid revealed a scam centre operating out of a facility built on land partially owned by Guo. It was one of many that have sprung up across Southeast Asia in recent years.\n\nThe raid uncovered hundreds of trafficked workers including foreign nationals, spurring a human trafficking complaint against Guo from an agency battling organised crime.\n\nGuo has said she sold her stake in the business before she was elected in 2022 and had no knowledge of criminality.\n\nOfficials have turned a searchlight on her background since.\n\nThe National Bureau of Investigation said Guo's fingerprints matched those of a Chinese national who entered the country as a teenager.\n\nThe solicitor general is seeking to cancel her birth certificate and she has been suspended from her post during the investigation. The senate committee urged the immigration agency to stop Guo from leaving the Philippines.\n\nGuo's attorney, Stephen David, told radio station DWPM she had been \"traumatised\" by previous sessions but had assured him she was still in the Philippines.\n\n\"If she gets arrested and detained at the senate, then she will testify,\" he said.\n\nEarlier hearings grilled Guo about her background and a lack of records regarding her presence in the Philippines. After she was unable to recall details of her childhood, Hontiveros asked if she was an \"asset\" for China.\n\nIn May, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr told reporters, \"No one knows her. We wonder where she came from. That's why we are investigating this, together with the Bureau of Immigration, because of the questions about her citizenship.\"\n\nThe mayor has denied she is a spy, saying in a television interview that she was a simple Philippine citizen, the love child of her Chinese father with a maid who had grown up \"hidden\" on a pig farm and homeschooled, with no friends.\n\nGuo's case comes at a time of growing Philippine suspicion about China's activities following an increasingly tense dispute over reefs and shoals in the busy waterway of the South China Sea, where both nations have claims.\n\nIt has boosted calls for a crackdown on Philippine offshore gambling operators, or POGOs, mostly run by Chinese nationals to serve clients in China, which flourished during the tenure of former President Rodrigo Duterte, but have since drawn scrutiny.\n\n(Reporting by Neil Jerome Morales and Poppy McPherson;

Filipino citizenship is not for sale,\" Hontiveros said in her opening statement, setting the tone for a session focused on uncovering the truth behind the scandal.\n\nThe senator was referring to the fact that Guo hid her Chinese identity, as determined by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), so she could run for public office and gain authority to implement programs against national interest.\n\nHontiveros accused the mayor of exploiting the Philippines' fragile regulatory system to facilitate crimes such as money laundering and human trafficking. \"Our system may be brittle, but it is not broken. You will be charged. Mayor Guo will be charged,\" she said, urging accountability.\n\nHontiveros raised several crucial questions about the true identity of Guo, whose birth details mysteriously match those of another woman from Tarlac. She questioned the origins of Guo Hua Ping and the possible involvement of her father in the Communist Party of China's activities.\n\n\"Is she working with Chinese triads? With the Chinese government?

The investigation began following a raid on a casino, allegedly revealing Guo's potential connections to human trafficking. The case has amplified national concerns over Chinese influence in the country.\n\nThe Philippine senate threatened on Wednesday to arrest a small town mayor for contempt during a hearing investigating her alleged ties with Chinese criminal syndicates, a case that has captivated the nation amid tension between Manila and Bejing.\n\nThe arrest threat came after the mayor, Alice Guo, failed to appear for a second consecutive hearing, citing stress. The case that began in March, when authorities raided a casino in Guo's sleepy farming town of Bamban, has shed light on criminal activity in the mostly Chinese-backed online casino industry in the Philippines.\n\nIt gained national attention after one senator questioned whether Guo might not have been born in the Philippines and could even be a Chinese 'asset' an accusation she denied. She has also denied links to criminals, saying she is a natural-born Philippine citizen. Guo did not respond to Reuters' request for comment but wrote to the senate that she was the subject of 'malicious accusations'.\n\nOn Wednesday, the senate cited Guo in contempt for failing to appear and Senator Risa Hontiveros, who is leading the investigation, said she would set in motion steps to get a warrant for her arrest. 'The chair has ruled to cite them in contempt,' said Hontiveros, who told a previous hearing that Guo might have actually been born in China and be a Chinese 'asset', although she gave no proof.\n\nRAID RAISES QUESTIONS The investigation began after a police raid revealed a scam centre operating out of a facility built on land partially owned by Guo. It was one of many that have sprung up across Southeast Asia in recent years.\n\nThe raid uncovered hundreds of trafficked workers including foreign nationals, spurring a human trafficking complaint against Guo from an agency battling organised crime. Guo has said she sold her stake in the business before she was elected in 2022 and had no knowledge of criminality.\n\nOfficials have turned a searchlight on her background since. The National Bureau of Investigation said Guo's fingerprints matched those of a Chinese national who entered the country as a teenager.\n\nThe solicitor general is seeking to cancel her birth certificate and she has been suspended from her post during the investigation. The senate committee urged the immigration agency to stop Guo from leaving the Philippines. Guo's attorney, Stephen David, told radio station DWPM she had been 'traumatised' by previous sessions but had assured him she was still in the Philippines.\n\n'If she gets arrested and detained at the senate, then she will testify,' he said. Earlier hearings grilled Guo about her background and a lack of records regarding her presence in the Philippines. After she was unable to recall details of her childhood, Hontiveros asked if she was an 'asset' for China.\n\nIn May, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr told reporters, 'No one knows her. We wonder where she came from. That's why we are investigating this, together with the Bureau of Immigration, because of the questions about her citizenship.' The mayor has denied she is a spy, saying in a television interview that she was a simple Philippine citizen, the love child of her Chinese father with a maid who had grown up 'hidden' on a pig farm and homeschooled, with no friends.\n\nGuo's case comes at a time of growing Philippine suspicion about China's activities following an increasingly tense dispute over reefs and shoals in the busy waterway of the South China Sea, where both nations have claims. It has boosted calls for a crackdown on Philippine offshore gambling operators, or POGOs, mostly run by Chinese nationals to serve clients in China, which flourished during the tenure of former President Rodrigo Duterte, but have since drawn scrutiny.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_of_the_Philippines", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Senate of the Philippines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Organized crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roman Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human trafficking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risa_Hontiveros", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risa Hontiveros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Agriculture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Beijing"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manila"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_raid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police raid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Immigration_(Philippines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Immigration (Philippines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(family_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legitimacy (family law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_(Abu_Dhabi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The National (Abu Dhabi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_certificate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birth certificate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Homeschooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South China Sea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Marcos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ferdinand Marcos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_broadcasting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radio broadcasting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrigo_Duterte", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodrigo Duterte"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Falun_Dafa", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Falun Dafa", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/03_03_2020_19_06_33_8443168.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720040", "eventUri": "eng-9720040", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Record shows Alice Guo went to school in QC", "body": "Nope, it's not true that Mayor Alice Guo grew up in a farm and home-schooled by Teacher Rubilyn\n\nIt seems that teacher Rubilyn was just a product of embattled Bamban, Tarlac Mayor Alice Guo's creative imagination.\n\nDuring the Senate hearing on Wednesday, July 10, Senator Sherwin Gatchalian presented documents showing that Guo went to a regular school in Quezon City, contradicting what the mayor had been saying in past inquires that she grew up in a farm, and was home-schooled by \"Teacher Rubilyn.\"\n\n\"Apparently, si Guo Hua Ping, hindi siya lumaki sa farm, hindi rin siya home-schooled. Nag-aral po siya,\" Gatchalian said. (Apparently, Guo Hua Ping didn't grow up in a farm, and she was not home-schooled. She went to a regular school.)\n\n\"Nag-aral siya sa parehas kong school sa Grace Christian High School, for grades 1 , 2, and 3, from year 2000 to 2003. Hindi siya home-schooled ni Rubilyn,\" he added, as the senator showed school records of Guo Hua Ping, believed to be the real identity of the local official. Grace Christian High School is now Grace Christian College.\n\n(We went to the same school in Grace Christian High School for grades 1, 2, and 3, from year 2000 to 2003. She was not home-schooled by Rubilyn.)\n\n\"Ang natatandaan ko, wala pong farm sa school natin, puro buildings po roon,\" Gatchalian said, alluding to the false testimony made by Guo in earlier hearings. (From what I remember, we don't have a farm in our school, we have buildings there.)\n\nThe Senate committee on women, children, family relations and gender equality led by Senator Risa Hontiveros had conducted four hearings on the illegal activities of Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs). Guo and her alleged involvement in illegal POGO operations in Tarlac have been the subject of Senate hearings since May.\n\nFor the second time, the Bamban mayor snubbed the Senate inquiry on Wednesday, prompting the committee to cite her, along with seven others, in contempt. On June 26, Guo also skipped the hearing.\n\nBefore the hearing on Tuesday, July 9, Guo's lawyer, Stephen David, said that Guo was not keen on attending Wednesday's hearing because she was \"traumatized\" by the embarrassment caused by past inquiries.\n\nApart from the school records, Gatchalian also showed the alien registration that matches the one filed at the Bureau of Immigration under Guo Hua Ping. The records also include a Chinese birth certificate which listed Lin Wen Yi and Jian Zhong Guo as her parents. Both are Chinese nationals.\n\nThis latest development makes the evidence strong that the Bamban mayor is not really Filipino.\n\n\"Lumalabas ang alien school registration 'nya ay match dun sa alien registration na hawak ng Bureau of Immigration,\" Gatchalian said. (It turned out that her alien school registration matches the alien registration from the Bureau of Immigration.)\n\nOn June 27, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) confirmed that the fingerprints of the suspended mayor and Guo Hua Ping match.\n\nHontiveros said that the NBI finding was the \"strongest evidence\" to strip Guo of her elective post. She also urged the Office of the Solicitor General \"to expedite its filing of a quo warranto case against\" Guo. Such a case would determine whether or not she has a \"legal right\" to her mayoral post.\n\nThe Bamban mayor is under preventive suspension ordered by the Ombudsman. The suspension was due to a graft case filed by the Department of the Interior and Local Government over serious illegal acts and her link to illegal activities of POGOs. - Rappler.com", "source":

We will see where the evidence will take us, and if this time around we can connect the dotted lines to Duterte,\" Hontiveros added.\n\nThe senator accused Yang, Duterte's former economic adviser, of having ties to illegal POGO operations.\n\nHontiveros also disclosed that Cruz, an incorporator of the service provider Brickhartz linked to the raided POGO hub in Bamban, Tarlac, is also an incorporator of Pharmally Biological and Yang's Full Win Group of Companies.\n\nFormer Duterte spokesperson Harry Roque will also be summoned to explain his alleged links to Lucky South 99, the illegal POGO raided in Porac, Pampanga last month, Hontiveros said.\n\nAs this developed, the Senate panel on Wednesday ordered the arrest of suspended Bamban Mayor Alice Leal Guo or Guo Hua Ping and seven other persons to compel their attendance in the next hearing into the illegal POGO operations.\n\nAside from Guo, Hontiveros also cited in contempt and ordered the arrest of five of the mayor's family members -- her biological parents Wenyi Lin and Jian Zhong Guo, her brothers Seimen Guo and Wesley Guo and sister Shiela Guo -- as well as Guo's alleged former consultant, Nancy Gamo and for head of the now defunct Technology and Livelihood Resource Center Dennis Cunanan.\n\nIt was the second time Guo skipped the hearing, citing mental health problems.\n\nGuo's filed a petition for certiorari before the Supreme Court Wednesday to block the invitations and subpoena of the Senate panel.\n\nThe suspended mayor also asked the high court to direct the Senate committee to desist from inviting her to attend the hearing.\n\nHer lawyers said Guo has already been tagged as a \"spy\" and \"POGO operator\" during the hearings.\n\n\"Her Constitutionally guaranteed freedoms and rights have been repeatedly violated, ignored, and/or disregarded,\" Guo's lawyers said.\n\nIn a letter sent to Hontiveros, Guo noted that malicious accusations being hurled against her has taken a toll on her health.\n\nShe said has also been receiving death threats which she cannot ignore.\n\nSenators, however, rejected Guo's alibi.\n\nSenate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada said a government or even a Senate doctor can check on Guo's condition before she testifies in the next hearing, which has yet to be scheduled.\n\nIn the same hearing, Senator Sherwin Gatchalian said it was not true that Guo did not have any formal schooling and was home schooled under a certain Teacher Rubilyn.\n\nHe said Guo Hua Ping, the mayor's alleged real name, studied in the same school in Quezon City were he went.\n\nShowing Guo's school records, Gatchalian said she was enrolled from Grade 1 to Grade 3 at the Grace Christian High School from 2000 to 2003.\n\n\"In my recollection, there is no farm there, just buildings,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, PAGCOR chairperson Alejandro Tengco said Roque was the Cabinet official who helped earlier helped a POGO firm secure a license.\n\nTengco said that sometimes on July 26, 2023, Roque, along with Cassandra Lee Ong, visited him in his office in Ermita, Manila.\n\nRoque requested the PAGCOR chief to help Ong, who was allegedly duped by Cunanan, who was the authorized representative of her POGO firm to pay its taxes.\n\nBut Ong was informed by PAGCOR that Cunanan did not remit the $500,000 that was supposed to cover her company's taxes for six months.\n\nRoque vehemently denied reports claiming that Tengco said he represented an illegal POGO.\n\n\"As clearly stated by Tengco in today's Senate hearing, I requested a rescheduling of arrears payment of a lessee and principal of my client Whirlwind Corporation.

Risa Hontiveros, cited Guo in contempt after she failed to appear at the committee's inquiry into alleged criminal activities within the POGO industry.\n\nHontiveros ruled to cite Guo and others in contempt following separate motions by Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada and Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian.\n\nHontiveros also ruled to issue a warrant of arrest against Guo, which would need the Senate president's signature to take effect.\n\nAside from the nullification of the Senate order, Guo's camp also asked the high court to issue a temporary restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction to compel the Senate panel to desist from further inviting her as a \"resource person.\"\n\nGuo's camp argued that Hontiveros violated the mayor's right to due process as she was allegedly not allowed to explain herself.\n\n\"However, a careful perusal of the transcript of stenographic notes during the May 7, 2024 and May 22, 2024 show that several violations of Petitioner's right to due process were committed. One, she was invited as a resource person to discuss 'what she knows' but in reality, she was never afforded any opportunity to sufficiently explain her side whenever a certain issue was raised. Two, although she was being asked questions relative to the issues against her, her side of the story was never considered for she was already branded, called and concluded to be a 'liar', 'spy', and 'POGO operator'. This is highly evident in the opening remarks of the committee chairperson in one of the public hearings,\" the petition read.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that Hontiveros has sent invitations to Guo and her family members to attend the Senate inquiry.\n\nGuo missed the June 26 hearing due to health reasons, according to her legal counsel.\n\nThe hearing was set to take place after the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission and the Philippine National Police filed non-bailable trafficking charges against the suspended mayor.\n\nGuo's camp argued that legislative inquiries do not have the power to \"delve and reach to private affairs of the citizens.\"\n\nThey added that the Senate panel's questions focused on her private life rather than her public post.\n\n\"Her childhood was repeatedly challenged, even her ability to speak another language was questioned, and worst, her birthright was invalidated,\" the petition read.\n\n\"Here, (the) petitioner never consented to the release of her private data and information to the public outside the committee hearing. Yet, the respondent committee members openly discussed and showed her personal data and information to the media during a series of press conferences as if they were the owners of this sensitive information without regard to violation of data privacy,\" it added.\n\nGuo's team emphasized that determining criminal liability is a function of the courts or prosecutorial bodies, not the Senate.\n\n\"The determination of who is/are liable for a crime or illegal activity, the investigation of the role played by each official, the determination of who should be haled to court for prosecution and the task of coming up with conclusions and finding of facts regarding anomalies, especially the determination of criminal guilt, are not functions of the Senate,\" the petition read.",

As a result, petitioner's life, liberty, and security were put in actual danger as she received threats from inside and outside the country,\" read her petition.\n\nShe urged the SC \"to caution investigating entities that information-sharing must observe strict confidentiality.\"\n\n\"Intelligence gathered must be released exclusively to the authorities empowered to receive the relevant information.

San Juan", "body": "THE camp of suspended Bamban, Tarlac Mayor Alice Guo on Wednesday filed a petition with \"extremely urgent prayer\" for the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO) to enjoin the Senate from further compelling her to appear as a resource person in a committee hearing on various illegal activities of a Philippine offshore gaming operator in her town.\n\nIn a 78-page petition, Guo through her lawyer Stephen David, also asked the court to nullify the subpoena issued by Senate Committee on Women, Children, Family Relations and Gender Equality chair Risa Hontiveros requiring her to appear anew before the committee hearing scheduled on July 10, 2024.\n\nIn that hearing, Hontiveros, on a motion by Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada and Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian, cited Guo and seven others in contempt for snubbing Senate subpoenas. The citations are expected to lead to orders for their arrest by the Senate sergeant at arms to compel their attendance at hearings.\n\nGuo's petition also seeks to stop the committee from probing her personal and private life, on the ground that Hontiveros and other committee members \"are exercising their authority to conduct inquiries in aid of legislation, with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.\"\n\nThe petitioner claimed her constitutional rights to due process and to privacy were violated when she appeared in the first two hearings of the committee held on May 7 and May 22, 2024.\n\nShe noted that the Court had previously nullified the orders issued by the Senate and the House of Representatives in conducting inquiries in aid of legislation on the grounds of grave abuse of discretion.\n\nDuring the May 7 and May 22, 2024 hearings, Guo's camp said several violations of petitioner's right to due process were committed.\n\nGuo noted that she was invited as a resource person to discuss \"what she knows\" but in reality, she was never afforded any opportunity to sufficiently explain her side whenever a certain issue was raised.\n\nShe added that despite being asked questions relative to the issues against her, her side of the story was never considered as she was already branded a \"liar,\" \"spy,\" and \"Pogo operator.\"\n\nGuo's camp pointed out that the mayor was invited to testify on her knowledge about human trafficking, cyber fraud operation, and other illegal activities being associated with Pogo operations.\n\n\"What happened during the hearings was that her personal life became the center of the inquiry, which are totally unrelated, unconnected, and unassociated with the pending resolutions subject of the public hearing,\" the petition read.\n\n\"As a result, she was asked and forced to divulge matters of her private life, childhood, love life, and personal businesses to the public under the pain of contempt,\" it added.\n\nAs a result, Guo said her right to life, liberty and securitywhich is guaranteed under the Bill of Rights \"is infringed,\" considering that the questions during the hearings pertain to her personal life which has an effect on her security.\n\n\"With due respect, the inquiries, as apparent as it could be on the transcripts, did not really pinpoint how it can help the Committee in crafting relevant laws in regulating POGO, in cyber fraud and in human trafficking,\" the petitioner stressed.\n\n\"One can surmise however, that the direction of the inquiry is to find out her personal information and for them to connect her in any way, in the alleged illegal POGO operations, an issue that is within the province of the courts and not the Congress. Thus, petitioner's right to due process has been violated and disregarded by the respondent Committee,\" she added.\n\nLikewise, Guo stressed that she never consented to the release of her private data and information to the public outside the committee hearing.\n\nHowever, she noted that the respondent committee members openly discussed and showed her personal data and information to the media during a series of press conferences without regard to violation of data privacy.\n\nThe embattled mayor also argued that with criminal and administrative cases already filed against her before the Office of the Ombudsman and the Department of Justice aside from the petition to cancel her birth certificate lodged before a trial court and pending investigation with regard to her taxes and businesses, the committee should already terminate its investigation to give way for these proceedings.\n\n\"With all these cases and more, the respondent Committee has nothing to discuss, show, present, and ask during the public hearing that are not covered by the filing of different cases,\" Guo stressed.", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title":

An innocent person, wrongly accused, will want to clear his or her name as soon as possible. These are among the pieces of advice given to Mayor Alice Guo of Bamban, Tarlac, who has made herself scarce amid an ongoing Senate investigation over her nationality and suspected links to a Philippine offshore gaming operator hub in her town that was raided recently.\n\nA helper in Guo's farm refused to accept a Senate subpoena that was served last week, saying Guo had not been there for some time and he did not know the mayor's supposed siblings listed in the summons. Guo has also not been seen at the Bamban municipal hall. She sent the Senate a letter, invoking poor health in explaining why she could not attend the continuation of the hearings today.\n\nSenators said if illness is invoked in snubbing a summons, it must be backed by a medical certificate. Guo's camp said no doctor wanted to issue such a certificate, so Senate President Francis Escudero said the chamber could send its doctor to verify the mayor's health condition. Guo's lawyer has said she is \"traumatized\" and stressed by the Senate grilling and the public bashing she has been receiving.\n\nAnyone accused of wrongdoing will undoubtedly feel stressed. Moneyed and influential persons have invoked elevated blood pressure and cited risks of stroke, cardiac and other health problems in evading public grilling, or in requesting for \"hospital arrest\" in cases where bail is not allowed.

Hindi rin siya homeschooled. Nag aral ho siya... Nag-aral siya sa parehas kong school-- sa Grace Christian High School for Grades 1, 2, and 3. Year 2000 to 2003,\" Gatchalian said.\n\n\"Hindi siya homeschooled ni Rubilyn...and nu'ng natatandaan ko sa school po namin, wala pong farm po doon puro building,\" he quipped.\n\nThe enrollment documents that Gatchalian bared included Guo Hua Ping's Chinese birth certificate which indicated that her mother is Wen Yi Lin and not Amelia Leal Guo, as earlier claimed by the embattled mayor.\n\n\"In that enrollment document, interestingly, mayroon ring birth certificate galing sa China in Chinese at trinanslate siya sa English. Ang nakasulat dito na father niya si Guo Jian Zhong na alam na ho natin at ang mother niya ay si Wen Yi Lin,\" Gatchalian said.\n\nApart from this, the senator said the Alien Certificate of Registration submitted by Guo for her enrollment is the same as the document that's in the Bureau of Immigration's records.\n\nGatchalian said he disclosed the documents in order to strengthen the cases against Guo.\n\nAssistant Solicitor General James Lee Cundangan told the Senate panel that they will consider the documents in their deliberations on the filing of a quo warranto case against Guo.\n\nA quo warranto proceeding is a legal remedy to determine a person's right or title to a public office and to oust the holder from its enjoyment.\n\nSolicitor General Menardo Gueverra earlier said that they will file a quo warranto case against Guo \"as soon as possible\" after the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) confirmed that she has the same fingerprints as Chinese passport holder Guo Hua Ping.\n\nGuo is at the center of the Senate investigation into the raided Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGO) hub in Bamban after several seized documents showed that she was personally involved in the processing of documents for its operations.\n\nGuo's citizenship was also questioned due to her inconsistent testimonies about her background, including her education history, and the supposed dubious documents regarding her Filipino citizenship. -- AOL, GMA Integrated News", "source": {"uri": "gmanetwork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GMA Network"},

A July 2022 video in which Guo said, \"If you lose a penny, I will take responsibility for it,\" was filmed five months after Guo filed for bankruptcy, the prosecutor said.\n\nGuo, who has been jailed since his March 2023 arrest, wore a light gray suit and smiled occasionally during Finkel's argument.\n\nDefense lawyers have previously said Guo's businesses were legitimate and that he was trying to build a movement against China's government.\n\nFinkel acknowledged that Guo, a former real estate developer who left China in 2014 during an anti-corruption crackdown, was targeted by Chinese authorities. But he said that had nothing to do with the conduct at issue in this case.\n\n\"Was Miles Guo targeted by the CCP? Yes,\" Finkel said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. \"Does that excuse what he did?

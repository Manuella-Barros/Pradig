You could have sleep apnea", "text": "You'll have a lot more energy throughout the day if you get a good night's sleep, but not everyone does due to a medical condition. Sleep apnea is a disorder where your breathing stops and starts throughout the night and people with it are usually loud snorers and they often feel tired even after a full night's rest. The Canadian Lung Association said about seven per cent of Canadians have it and even more may have symptoms of mild sleep apnea. \u201cI was just so tired all the time, falling asleep while i was talking on the phone,\u201d Manish Amin said. Amin tried lifestyle changes, but when those didn\u2019t work, he talked to his doctor about a sleep study. \u201cAn overnight sleep test can detect whether you have obstructive sleep apnea, which is when your breathing pauses during sleep because something blocks your airway, like your tongue or relaxed throat muscles,\u201d Kevin Loria with Consumer Reports said. Left untreated, obstructive sleep apnea can cause daytime sleepiness. It can also strain the heart, and increase the risk of anxiety, diabetes, hypertension and even stroke. The primary treatment for sleep apnea is a continuous positive airway pressure machine or CPAP. Users are fitted with a mask connected to a pump that pushes air into the airway, holding it open while sleeping. CPAP can significantly reduce the number of breathing interruptions during the night, but patients often have complaints. \u201cIt\u2019s hard dealing with the CPAP, there\u2019s the mask, the hose, there\u2019s definitely some adjustment,\u201d Amin said. If the full-face mask isn\u2019t for you, you might want to consider a nasal pillow or a nasal mask. Another alternative are custom-made dental devices. \u201cThey\u2019re designed to move the jaw and shift the tongue toward the front of the mouth to keep the airway open. This can be used with CPAP,\u201d Loria said. In the United States, there are devices like Inspire that are surgically implanted in the upper chest, like a pacemaker. They stabilize your throat during sleep to prevent obstruction of the airway. With no hose or mask, it might seem more convenient. Inspire told CTV News Toronto that it's not available in Canada. Amin says it's a step he wouldn't want to take. \u201cI'd rather learn to get comfortable with the CPAP than go through surgery. It\u2019s important for me to get a handle on this,\u201d Amin said. It's important to realize that snoring and sleep issues can be serious, but a restful night could start after a good conversation with your doctor. To reduce symptoms to get a better night's rest, it's advisable to skip alcohol and sleep on your side or stomach. Losing weight can also help because obesity is a primary factor for sleep apnea.", "summary": "You'll have a lot more energy throughout the day if you get a good night's sleep, but not everyone does due to a medical condition.", "url": "https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/are-you-a-loud-snorer-you-could-have-sleep-apnea-1.6900326", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2020/1/14/sleep-1-4767298-1627386817959.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:30:39", "author": "Pat Foran", "authors": ["Pat Foran"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.309}

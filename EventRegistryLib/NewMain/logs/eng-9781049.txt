(Jordan Pettitt/PA via AP)\n\nBy BRIAN MELLEY and JILL LAWLESS Associated Press\n\nLONDON (AP) -- British police said Thursday they have charged a 17-year-old with murder over a stabbing attack that left three little girls dead and several more in critical condition. The charges came as the traumatized town of Southport cleaned up after a bout of far-right violence, and agitators fired up by anger and misinformation clashed with police near the prime minister's residence in London.\n\nThe Merseyside Police force said the teenager, who has not been named because of his age, faces three counts of murder and 10 of attempted murder over people injured in the attack during a Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday dance and yoga class.\n\nHe is due to appear in court in Liverpool later Thursday.\n\nAbout two dozen children were attending the summer vacation workshop on Monday when an attacker with a knife burst in. Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, died from their injuries. Ten other people were injured, among whom five girls and two adults are in critical condition.\n\nFar-right demonstrators have launched several violent protests, ostensibly in response to the attack, clashing with police outside a mosque in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nA few hundred protesters hurled beer cans and flares near British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's residence in Downing Street in central London on Wednesday evening. More than 100 people were arrested for offenses including violent disorder and assault on an emergency worker, London's Metropolitan Police force said.\n\nPolice also faced violent demonstrators in the town of Hartlepool in northeast England, as far-right groups seek to stir anger over an attack they have sought to link -- without evidence -- to immigrants.\n\nHours earlier, residents of Southport swept shattered glass and broken bricks from streets after far-right protesters clashed with police outside a mosque in the seaside town.\n\nOn Tuesday night a crowd of several hundred people hurled bricks and bottles at riot police in Southport, set garbage bins and vehicles on fire and looted a store, hours after a peaceful vigil for the girls, aged 6, 7 and 9, were killed. More than 50 officers were injured, including more than two dozen who were taken to hospitals, officials said.\n\n\"I am absolutely appalled and disgusted at the level of violence that was shown towards my officers,\" Merseyside Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said. \"Some of the first responders who attended that awful scene on Monday ... then were faced with that level of violence.\"\n\nFive men have been arrested in connection with the riots in Southport, mainly for violent disorder; one was arrested for possessing a knife and fighting. Kennedy said more arrests were expected.\n\nStarmer condemned the \"thuggery\" and said the protesters \"hijacked\" the community's grief.\n\nNorman Wallis, chief executive of the Southport Pleasureland amusement park, was one of dozens of people who turned up with brushes and shovels to clear the debris.\n\n\"It's horrendous what those hooligans have done last night,\" he said. \"But none of those people were the people of Southport,\" he added. \"The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up.\"\n\nThe protesters, who police said were supporters of the far-right English Defence League, were apparently fueled false online rumors about the suspect.\n\nPolice said a name circulating on social media -- spread by far-right activists and accounts of murky origin purporting to be news organizations -- was incorrect and that he was born in Britain, contrary to online claims he was an asylum-seeker. The names of suspects under the age of 18 are usually not made public in Britain.\n\nPatrick Hurley, the local lawmaker, said the violence by \"beered-up thugs\" was the result of \"propaganda and lies\" spread on social media.\n\n\"This misinformation doesn't just exist on people's internet browsers and on people's phones. It has real world impact,\" he said.\n\nChanaka Balasuryla, whose corner store was looted for booze and cigarettes, said he watched from home on a surveillance camera as a gang broke in. He was terrified because a woman and her daughter lived upstairs and he feared the looters would set the shop on fire.\n\nHe learned later that the woman had confronted the mob and told them the Windsor Mini Mart was her shop and asked them to stop. The next morning he went get down to his shop were people waiting to help him clean up.\n\n\"I feel safe again because people are here to protect us,\" he said.\n\nThe rampage in Southport is the latest shocking attack in a country where a recent rise in knife crime has stoked anxieties and led to calls for the government to do more to clamp down on bladed weapons, by far the most commonly used instruments in U.K. homicides.\n\nWitnesses described hearing screams and seeing children covered in blood in the mayhem outside the Hart Space, a community center that hosts everything from pregnancy workshops to women's boot camps.\n\nJoel Verite, a window cleaner riding in a van on his lunch break, said his colleague slammed on the brakes and reversed to where a woman was hanging on the side of a car covered in blood.\n\n\"She just screamed at me: 'He's killing kids over there. He's killing kids over there,'\" Verite told Sky News.\n\n\"It was like a scene you'd see on a disaster film,\" he said. \"I can't explain to you how horrific it is what I saw.\"\n\nBritain's worst attack on children was in 1996, when 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton shot and killed 16 kindergartners and their teacher in a school gymnasium in Dunblane, Scotland. The United Kingdom subsequently banned the private ownership of almost all handguns.\n\nWhile knives are used in about 40% of homicides each year, mass stabbings are unusual.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Pan Pylas in London contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "kurv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "710 KURV - The Valley's News/Talk Station"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fred_cruz@kurv.com", "name": "Fred Cruz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Violent disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

Kennedy said more arrests were expected.\n\nStarmer condemned the \"thuggery\" and said the protesters \"hijacked\" the community's grief.\n\nNorman Wallis, chief executive of the Southport Pleasureland amusement park, was one of dozens of people who turned up with brushes and shovels to clear the debris.\n\n\"It's horrendous what those hooligans have done last night,\" he said. \"But none of those people were the people of Southport,\" he added. \"The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up.\"\n\nThe protesters, who police said were supporters of the far-right English Defence League, were apparently fueled false online rumors about the suspect.\n\nPolice said a name circulating on social media -- spread by far-right activists and accounts of murky origin purporting to be news organizations -- was incorrect and that he was born in Britain, contrary to online claims he was an asylum-seeker. The names of suspects under the age of 18 are usually not made public in Britain.\n\nPatrick Hurley, the local lawmaker, said the violence by \"beered-up thugs\" was the result of \"propaganda and lies\" spread on social media.\n\n\"This misinformation doesn't just exist on people's internet browsers and on people's phones.

The next morning he went get down to his shop were people waiting to help him clean up.\n\n\"I feel safe again because people are here to protect us,\" he said.\n\nThe rampage in Southport is the latest shocking attack in a country where a recent rise in knife crime has stoked anxieties and led to calls for the government to do more to clamp down on bladed weapons, by far the most commonly used instruments in UK homicides.\n\nWitnesses described hearing screams and seeing children covered in blood in the mayhem outside the Hart Space, a community center that hosts everything from pregnancy workshops to women's boot camps.\n\nJoel Verite, a window cleaner riding in a van on his lunch break, said his colleague slammed on the brakes and reversed to where a woman was hanging on the side of a car covered in blood.\n\n\"She just screamed at me: 'He's killing kids over there. He's killing kids over there,'\" Verite told Sky News.\n\n\"It was like a scene you'd see on a disaster film,\" he said. \"I can't explain to you how horrific it is what I saw.\"\n\nBritain's worst attack on children was in 1996, when 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton shot and killed 16 kindergartners and their teacher in a school gymnasium in Dunblane, Scotland.

A 17-year-old suspect appeared in court to face three counts of murder and 10 of attempted murder.\n\nThe attack on children at a Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday dance class shocked a country where knife crime is a long-standing and vexing problem.The deaths have also been used by far-right activists to stoke anger at immigrants and Muslims though the suspect is not an immigrant, and his religion has not been disclosed.\n\nThe suspect has not been named because he is under 18, but police say he was born in Britain. He has not been charged with terrorism offenses but faces three counts of murder over the deaths of Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, in the seaside town of Southport in northwest England.\n\nHe also has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder over eight children and two adults who were injured. Several of the victims remain in critical condition.\n\nThe suspect made a brief appearance at Liverpool Magistrates' court on Thursday morning. He was not asked to enter a plea and was ordered detained until his next hearing, scheduled for later in the day.\n\nFar-right demonstrators - fueled, in part, by online misinformation have held several violent protests, ostensibly in response to the attack, clashing with police outside a mosque in Southport on Tuesday and causing a melee near the prime minister's office in London the next day.\n\nStarmer's office said he would tell police leaders that \"while the right to peaceful protest must be protected at all costs, he will be clear that criminals who exploit that right in order to sow hatred and carry out violent acts will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nHundreds of protesters chanting \"we want our country back\" hurled beer cans and bottles near the prime minister's Downing Street residence in London on Wednesday evening, and launched flares at a nearby statue of wartime leader Winston Churchill. More than 100 people were arrested for offenses including violent disorder and assault on an emergency worker, London's metropolitan police force said.\n\nPolice officers were pelted with bottles and eggs in the town of Hartlepool in northeast England, where a police car was set ablaze, as far-right groups seek to stir anger over an attack they have sought to link to immigrants. A smaller disturbance was reported in Manchester.\n\nOn Tuesday night a crowd of several hundred people hurled bricks and bottles at riot police in Southport, set garbage bins and vehicles on fire and looted a store, hours after a peaceful vigil for the stabbing victims.\n\n\"I am absolutely appalled and disgusted at the level of violence that was shown towards my officers,\" Merseyside chief constable Serena Kennedy said. \"Some of the first responders who attended that awful scene on Monday ... then were faced with that level of violence.\"\n\nPolice said a name circulating on social media purported to be the suspect's spread by far-right activists and accounts of murky origin purporting to be news organizations was incorrect and that the suspect was born in Britain, contrary to online claims he was an asylum-seeker.\n\nPatrick Hurley, a local lawmaker, said the violence by \"beered-up thugs\" was the result of \"propaganda and lies\" spread on social media.\n\n\"This misinformation doesn't just exist on people's internet browsers and on people's phones.

The charges came as the traumatized town of Southport cleaned up after a bout of far-right violence, and agitators fired up by anger and misinformation clashed with police near the prime minister's residence in London.\n\nThe Merseyside Police force said the teenager, who has not been named because of his age, faces three counts of murder and 10 of attempted murder over people injured in the attack during a Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday dance and yoga class.\n\nHe is due to appear in court in Liverpool later Thursday.\n\nAbout two dozen children were attending the summer vacation workshop on Monday when an attacker with a knife burst in. Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, died from their injuries. Ten other people were injured, among whom five girls and two adults are in critical condition.\n\nFar-right demonstrators have launched several violent protests, ostensibly in response to the attack, clashing with police outside a mosque in Southport on Tuesday.\n\nA few hundred protesters hurled beer cans and flares near British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's residence in Downing Street in central London on Wednesday evening. More than 100 people were arrested for offenses including violent disorder and assault on an emergency worker, London's Metropolitan Police force said.\n\nPolice also faced violent demonstrators in the town of Hartlepool in northeast England, as far-right groups seek to stir anger over an attack they have sought to link -- without evidence -- to immigrants.\n\nHours earlier, residents of Southport swept shattered glass and broken bricks from streets after far-right protesters clashed with police outside a mosque in the seaside town.\n\nOn Tuesday night a crowd of several hundred people hurled bricks and bottles at riot police in Southport, set garbage bins and vehicles on fire and looted a store, hours after a peaceful vigil for the girls, aged 6, 7 and 9, were killed. More than 50 officers were injured, including more than two dozen who were taken to hospitals, officials said.\n\n\"I am absolutely appalled and disgusted at the level of violence that was shown toward my officers,\" Merseyside Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said. \"Some of the first responders who attended that awful scene on Monday ... then were faced with that level of violence.\"\n\nFive men have been arrested in connection with the riots in Southport, mainly for violent disorder; one was arrested for possessing a knife and fighting. Kennedy said more arrests were expected.\n\nStarmer condemned the \"thuggery\" and said the protesters \"hijacked\" the community's grief.\n\nNorman Wallis, chief executive of the Southport Pleasureland amusement park, was one of dozens of people who turned up with brushes and shovels to clear the debris.\n\n\"It's horrendous what those hooligans have done last night,\" he said. \"But none of those people were the people of Southport,\" he added. \"The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up.\"\n\nThe protesters, who police said were supporters of the far-right English Defense League, were apparently fueled false online rumors about the suspect.\n\nPolice said a name circulating on social media -- spread by far-right activists and accounts of murky origin purporting to be news organizations -- was incorrect and that he was born in Britain, contrary to online claims he was an asylum-seeker. The names of suspects under the age of 18 are usually not made public in Britain.\n\nPatrick Hurley, the local lawmaker, said the violence by \"beered-up thugs\" was the result of \"propaganda and lies\" spread on social media.\n\n\"This misinformation doesn't just exist on people's Internet browsers and on people's phones. It has real world impact,\" he said.\n\nChanaka Balasuryla, whose corner store was looted for booze and cigarettes, said he watched from home on a surveillance camera as a gang broke in. He was terrified because a woman and her daughter lived upstairs and he feared the looters would set the shop on fire.\n\nHe learned later that the woman had confronted the mob and told them the Windsor Mini Mart was her shop and asked them to stop. The next morning he went get down to his shop were people waiting to help him clean up.\n\n\"I feel safe again because people are here to protect us,\" he said.\n\nThe rampage in Southport is the latest shocking attack in a country where a recent rise in knife crime has stoked anxieties and led to calls for the government to do more to clamp down on bladed weapons, by far the most commonly used instruments in UK homicides.\n\nWitnesses described hearing screams and seeing children covered in blood in the mayhem outside the Hart Space, a community center that hosts everything from pregnancy workshops to women's boot camps.\n\nJoel Verite, a window cleaner riding in a van on his lunch break, said his colleague slammed on the brakes and reversed to where a woman was hanging on the side of a car covered in blood.\n\n\"She just screamed at me: 'He's killing kids over there. He's killing kids over there,'\" Verite told Sky News.\n\n\"It was like a scene you'd see on a disaster film,\" he said. \"I can't explain to you how horrific it is what I saw.\"\n\nBritain's worst attack on children was in 1996, when 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton shot and killed 16 kindergartners and their teacher in a school gymnasium in Dunblane, Scotland. The United Kingdom subsequently banned the private ownership of almost all handguns.\n\nWhile knives are used in about 40 percent of homicides each year, mass stabbings are unusual.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement in the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Violent disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

The deaths have also been used by far-right activists to stoke anger at immigrants and Muslims - though the suspect is not an immigrant, and his religion has not been disclosed.\n\nThe suspect has not been named because he is under 18, but police say he was born in Britain. He has not been charged with terrorism offenses but faces three counts of murder over the deaths of Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, in the seaside town of Southport in northwest England.\n\nHe also has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder over eight children and two adults who were injured.

Police faced violent demonstrators in the town of Hartlepool in northeast England, as far-right groups seek to stir anger over an attack they have sought to link -- without evidence -- to immigrants. (Owen Humphreys/PA via AP)\n\nLONDON (AP) -- Prime Minister Keir Starmer summoned British police chiefs for a crisis meeting on Thursday over violent unrest that followed a stabbing attack that left three young girls dead. A 17-year-old suspect was due in court to face three counts of murder and 10 of attempted murder.\n\nThe attack on children at a Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday dance class shocked a country where knife crime is a long-standing and vexing problem. The deaths have also been used by far-right activists to stoke anger at immigrants and Muslims - though the suspect is not an immigrant, and his religion has not been disclosed.\n\nThe suspect has not been named because he is under 18, but police say he was born in Britain. He has not been charged with terrorism offenses but faces three counts of murder over the deaths of Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, in the seaside town of Southport in northwest England.\n\nHe also has been charged with 10 counts of attempted murder over eight children and two adults who were injured. Several of the victims remain in critical condition.\n\nFar-right demonstrators -- fueled, in part, by online misinformation -- have held several violent protests, ostensibly in response to the attack, clashing with police outside a mosque in Southport on Tuesday and causing a melee near the prime minister's office in London the next day.\n\nStarmer's office said he would tell police leaders that \"while the right to peaceful protest must be protected at all costs, he will be clear that criminals who exploit that right in order to sow hatred and carry out violent acts will face the full force of the law.\"\n\nHundreds of protesters chanting \"we want our country back\" hurled beer cans and bottles near the prime minister's Downing Street residence in London on Wednesday evening, and launched flares at a nearby statue of wartime leader Winston Churchill. More than 100 people were arrested for offenses including violent disorder and assault on an emergency worker, London's Metropolitan Police force said.\n\nPolice officers were pelted with bottles and eggs in the town of Hartlepool in northeast England, where a police car was set ablaze, as far-right groups seek to stir anger over an attack they have sought to link to immigrants. A smaller disturbance was reported in Manchester.\n\nOn Tuesday night a crowd of several hundred people hurled bricks and bottles at riot police in Southport, set garbage bins and vehicles on fire and looted a store, hours after a peaceful vigil for the stabbing victims.\n\n\"I am absolutely appalled and disgusted at the level of violence that was shown towards my officers,\" Merseyside Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said. \"Some of the first responders who attended that awful scene on Monday ... then were faced with that level of violence.\"\n\nPolice said a name circulating on social media purported to be the suspect's -- spread by far-right activists and accounts of murky origin purporting to be news organizations -- was incorrect and that the suspect was born in Britain, contrary to online claims he was an asylum-seeker.\n\nPatrick Hurley, a local lawmaker, said the violence by \"beered-up thugs\" was the result of \"propaganda and lies\" spread on social media.\n\n\"This misinformation doesn't just exist on people's internet browsers and on people's phones. It has real world impact,\" he said.\n\nBritain's worst attack on children was in 1996, when 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton shot and killed 16 kindergartners and their teacher in a school gymnasium in Dunblane, Scotland. The United Kingdom subsequently banned the private ownership of almost all handguns.\n\nWhile knives are used in about 40% of homicides each year, mass stabbings are unusual. But a recent rise in knife crime has stoked anxieties and led to calls for the government to do more to clamp down on bladed weapons, by far the most commonly used instruments in U.K. homicides.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6, died from their injuries. The 10 who were wounded included five girls and two adults who are in critical condition.\n\nFar-right demonstrators have launched several violent protests, ostensibly in response to the attack, with a few hundred protesters hurling beer cans and flares near British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's residence on Downing Street in central London on Wednesday evening. The crowd was shouting, \"Save our kids\", \"We want our country back\" and \"Stop the boats\", as well as English football chants.\n\nMore than 100 people were arrested for offences including violent disorder and assault on an emergency worker, London's Metropolitan Police force said.\n\nStarmer condemned the \"thuggery\" and said the protesters \"hijacked\" the community's grief.\n\nIn Southport, residents on Wednesday swept shattered glass and broken bricks from streets after far-right protesters set fire to vehicles, looted a store and clashed with police outside the town's mosque on Tuesday night. More than 50 officers were injured, including more than two dozen who were taken to hospitals, officials said.\n\n\"I am absolutely appalled and disgusted at the level of violence that was shown towards my officers,\" Merseyside Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said. \"Some of the first responders who attended that awful scene on Monday ... then were faced with that level of violence.\"\n\nFive men have been arrested in connection with the riots in Southport, mainly for violent disorder; one was arrested for possessing a knife and fighting. Kennedy said more arrests were expected.\n\nNorman Wallis, chief executive of the Southport Pleasureland amusement park, was one of dozens of people who turned up with brushes and shovels to clear the debris.\n\n\"It's horrendous what those hooligans have done last night,\" he said. \"But none of those people were the people of Southport,\" he added. \"The people of Southport are the ones here today cleaning the mess up.\"\n\nThe protesters, who police said were supporters of the far-right English Defence League, were apparently fuelled by false online rumours about the suspect. Police said a name circulating on social media - spread by far-right activists and accounts of murky origin purporting to be news organisations - was incorrect and that he was born in the UK, contrary to online claims he was a migrant.\n\nThe names of suspects under the age of 18 are usually not made public in the UK for legal reasons.\n\nPatrick Hurley, the local legislator, said the violence by \"beered-up thugs\" was the result of \"propaganda and lies\" spread on social media. \"This misinformation doesn't just exist on people's internet browsers and on people's phones. It has real-world impact,\" he said.\n\nChanaka Balasuryla, whose corner shop was looted for alcoholic drinks and cigarettes, said he watched from home on a surveillance camera as a gang broke in. He was terrified because a woman and her daughter lived upstairs and he feared the looters would set the shop on fire.\n\nHe learned later that the woman had confronted the mob and told them the Windsor Mini Mart was her shop and asked them to stop. The next morning, when he went to his shop, he found people people were waiting to help him clean up.\n\n\"I feel safe again because people are here to protect us,\" he said.\n\nThe rampage in Southport is the latest shocking attack in a country where a recent rise in knife crime has stoked anxieties and led to calls for the government to do more to clamp down on bladed weapons.\n\nThe country's worst attack on children was in 1996, when 43-year-old Thomas Hamilton shot and killed 16 primary schoolchildren and their teacher in Dunblane, Scotland. The UK subsequently banned the private ownership of almost all handguns.\n\nWhile knives are used in about 40 percent of homicides each year, mass stabbings are unusual.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_seeker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asylum seeker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violent_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Violent disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merseyside_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merseyside Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

the latter a reference to small boats bringing irregular migrants across the Channel.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southport"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West_England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "North West England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mosque"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attempted murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crown Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downing_Street", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downing Street"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrates'_court_(England_and_Wales)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magistrates' court (England and Wales)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartlepool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hartlepool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hartlepool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Defence_League", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English Defence League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_hooliganism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Football hooliganism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Crown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Seaside resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Victims", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://image.khaleejtimes.com?uuid=f2697191-7307-5f5b-941d-539e5c849e6d&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=75&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.84355&x=0&y=0&width=1200&height=675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9781049", "eventUri": "eng-9781049", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

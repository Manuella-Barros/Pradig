{"id": 231211820, "title": "Best VPN for Travel", "text": "IPVanish IPVanish offers 2,400-plus servers in 56 countries, a smaller international selection than many competitors; NordVPN, ExpressVPN and Surfshark tout 100 or more country locations, while Proton and PIA both offer over 90 countries. In our experience, IPVanish's internet download speeds were uneven with a 44% average internet download speed loss in our 2024 testing, with fast speeds marred by occasionally noticeable dips, which could impact gaming or 4K streaming. IPVanish provides plenty of perks, including unlimited simultaneous connections, reasonably fast internet download speeds and user-friendly apps. It streams and unblocks region-restricted content from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus with aplomb. At $13 monthly, $42 annually or $72 total for two years (both the 12- and 24-month plans jump to $90 per year after the sweet introductory pricing), IPVanish saves you money upfront compared to companies like ExpressVPN or NordVPN. While IPVanish works fine for casual use, you can get a VPN with a much larger server network, more robust privacy features and faster internet speeds, all of which benefit travel. IPVanish\u2019s user-friendly apps make it a decent choice for beginners seeking a VPN to add peace of mind and allow for streaming abroad. Wallet-friendly VPNs PIA and Surfshark are better options for the money because of their larger server networks. CyberGhost With 11,800-plus servers spanning over 100 countries, CyberGhost offers loads of choices for international travel. It\u2019s decent for streaming from Netflix, BBC iPlayer and other sites. You\u2019ll need to use specific servers optimized for streaming. Keep in mind that ExpressVPN, NordVPN and Surfshark don\u2019t require specialized servers for geo-unblocking. CyberGhost remains wallet-friendly at $13 per month, $42 every six months or $57 total for 26 months of service (you\u2019re billed annually after 24 months of service on its two-year plan). CyberGhost lacks advanced privacy features like obfuscation, which makes it more difficult to determine that you\u2019re using a VPN. Obfuscated servers could be useful when running a VPN at school, work or in a country where virtual private networks are frowned upon. Its high internet speed loss isn\u2019t ideal for demanding applications like 4K streaming or gaming. CyberGhost does provide some useful features, including a kill switch, which shuts off your internet if your VPN gets disconnected and split tunneling for selectively choosing some apps, but not all to route through your VPN. All things considered, CyberGhost is acceptable for casual use like streaming videos or web browsing, and its exhaustive server network is particularly well-suited to travel. Uneven speed loss and middle-of-the-road privacy features mean you\u2019ve likely got better choices. Read our CyberGhost review. Hotspot Shield Sporting over 3,200 servers in 80-plus countries, Hotspot Shield works well enough for globe-trotting. We like its reasonable 26% average speed loss and excellent streaming support. Still, the lackluster pricing of $13 per month or $96 annually runs you more than faster, more secure VPNs such as ExpressVPN, NordVPN and Surfshark. Because Hotspot Shield is based in the US -- part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance -- it\u2019s not great for privacy-concerned users. Its closed-source Hydra Catapult VPN protocol and unnecessary data collection give us pause in recommending it over other options, particularly when you can spend less money to get a faster VPN with better privacy.

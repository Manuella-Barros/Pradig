{"id": 231237410, "title": "Are Chas and Dave the new Posh 'n' Becks? As David Beckham is made an ambassador for the King's...", "text": "One is a heavily tattooed former footballer from humble beginnings, the other is the King of the United Kingdom and 14 commonwealth realms. Now, David Beckham has been appointed an ambassador for His Majesty's charity, the King's Foundation. You would be forgiven for thinking the pair have nothing in common other than their vast fortunes - but you would be wrong. Here, CLAUDIA CONNELL celebrates all the similarities shared by Chas and Dave - the new Posh n Becks. The bee's knees When Becks and the King met at his Majesty's estate at Highgrove ahead of the ambassador announcement at the start of this month, they bonded and chatted over their mutual love of bee keeping. Charles - who in 1999 looked comfortable in a beekeeping suit when he visited an organic farm in Buenos Aires - has hives at his Gloucestershire home, while David keeps them at his country house in Oxfordshire. Earlier in the year David presented Charles with a jar of his home-made honey - D'Beez Sticky Stuff. Charles joked that they should do a taste comparison test with his own Duchy Originals honey. It remains to be seen which one tastes the sweeter, but I think we all know which has the more tasteful name... Hunks in trunks Never shy about showing off his buff body, we've seen plenty of pictures of David in his pants due to his voluminous modelling work. Still fabulously fit at 49, David looks sensational in a pair of swimming trunks too, whether tiny budgie smugglers or more modest Bermudas. The King may not have done any underwear commercials for Armani or H&M and we'll probably never seen him in Speedos but His Majesty once had a toned and trim physique. As a young man visiting Australia in 1981, he set pulses racing when he swam in the ocean in his trunks. More recently, Charles rocked some floral swimwear while on holiday with Camilla in Barbados. Dapper dressers Whether smart and formal or pared down and casual, both men are super sharp dressers. It takes a certain swagger to pull off the suit look but both Charles and David do this with ease. The King uses tailors Turnball & Asser and Anderson & Sheppard to make his formal outfits. In the past, Beckham has used Saville Row tailors Kathryn Sargent and Richard James. Having just signed a commercial deal with Hugo Boss, David now wears suits by their chief designer Loro Piana. When playing lord of the manor, David looks the part in his Barbour wax jackets, fleece gilets by Outdoor and Country and peaked caps from Lock & Co. Wellies are courtesy of Le Chameau, a big favourite with the Princess of Wales. But nobody does fuss-free country dressing like the King. Some of his clothes are older than David. His John Partridge wax jackets have been patched so many times there are patches on the patches. Love their chicks For Christmas last year, Victoria bought husband David a flock of chickens, a rooster and a coop for them all to live in at their \u00a36million Cotswold's house. David loves to cook with the eggs, while Posh Spice likes to make jokes on her social media pages about her husband's 'big cock.' Charles is also an enthusiastic hen keeper. Like his new bestie, he delights in collecting the eggs. Chances are his wife, Camilla, who is said to love a smutty joke, probably has a few wisecracks of her own\u2026. she just keeps them off Instagram. City gents, country squires As working men, both David and Charles have a London residence (well, Charles has four but there's only one he calls home.) Clarence House is where the King lives when in the capital, preferring to keep the nearby Buckingham Palace for official business. He also has many country residences but his favourite place in the world is Highgrove, his country estate in Gloucestershire. During the week, David and Victoria live in their \u00a330million London townhouse. But there's nothing Becks loves more than donning his wellies and Barbour and playing country squire at his sprawling estate in Oxfordshire \u2013 just a 40-minute tractor ride away from Highgrove. Horse and hounds To be a true country gent you must enjoy the sport of kings, live in houses that smell of wet dog and wear clothes covered in the hound's hair. A skilled horseman, The King no longer plays polo but still rides for relaxation. David is not quite so comfortable in the saddle, although he was pictured riding during a visit to a ranch in LA. However, daughter Harper is a keen rider and is thought to have her own pony. When it comes to mutts, both are devoted doggy daddies. Charles is now hugely fond of Bluebell and Beth, Camilla's two Jack Russell rescues from Battersea Dog's Home. Over at Chez Beckham, Simba the cockapoo is the most recent addition to the family and joins their German Shephard Logan and three spaniels: Olive, Sage and Fig. Sports cars Chas and Dave are both petrol heads, except these days our environmentally conscious monarch has had some of his fleet converted so that they can run on bioethanol, a fuel derived from cheese and wine. The King's collection includes a rare (one of only eight) Rolls Royce Phantom IV and his prized Aston Martin DB6 Volante, a 21st birthday gift from his mother, now worth around \u00a3600,000. David also owns at least two Aston Martins (as well as assorted Bentleys, Rolls', Maseratis and Land Rovers). Four years ago, Becks sold his red Aston Martin AMV8 Volante for \u00a3445,000 via Auto Trader. For that price, let's hope he threw in a couple of jars of honey. Witty wives Both men have strong, happy marriages to feisty women known for their wicked sense of fun. Despite being famous for her pout, friends say that Victoria has a sharp wit and sense of humour, as we saw in David's Netflix series, Beckham. The 'be honest' scene where Victoria claims to be working class (despite the fact her dad did the school run in a Rolls Royce) has spawned thousands of memes. In 2001, she revealed to TV interviewer Michael Parkinson that she calls her husband 'Golden Balls'. The nickname stuck. Likewise, although much more private than Mrs Beckham, Queen Camilla is known for her great \u2013 and often risqu\u00e9 \u2013 sense of humour. In his book, Charles III: New King, New Court, the Mail's Robert Hardman revealed that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak describes her Majesty as 'uproariously funny.' Sailing on super yachts The King may beat Becks hands down when it comes to the number of properties owned but \u2013 unlike our monarch \u2013 David has his own yacht. The Beckham family recently upgraded their \u00a35million starter yacht to a \u00a316million spectacular 130-footer named Seven, in honour of Beckham's old jersey number and their daughter Harper. Poor old Charlie hasn't had his own superyacht since Royal Yacht Britannia was decommissioned in 1997. Not to worry though, he still gets invited aboard some pretty nice boats. In 2017, when Prince of Wales, he and Camilla holidayed in Corfu aboard OKTO, the \u00a350million yacht owned by Greek shipping magnet Theodore Angelopoulos. Surely David would let Charles and Camilla charter Seven for a few days if they asked nicely? Stylish in a skirt The picture of Beckham in France in 1999 wearing a sarong turned him into an international style icon \u2013 but Charles was looking stylish in skirts long before. From his teenage years through to today, the King has embraced kilt wearing. The King could turn out in his own tartan - which is woven from Scottish wool - at the Braemar Gathering in September. As for Becks, it's been 25 years since he was last seen in a skirt.

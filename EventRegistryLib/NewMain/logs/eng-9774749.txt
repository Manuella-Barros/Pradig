More info\n\nPrincess Anne, just a few weeks on from her alarming emergency hospital visit due to head injuries sustained in a chilling equestrian accident, has confidently embarked on her first foreign tour post-recovery, gracing Paris with her presence for the Olympic Games.\n\nThe accomplished royal, who herself competed in equestrian events at the 1976 Olympics, has been actively engaging in the grand sporting event, awarding medals and soaking up various competitions. On Monday, she proudly handed over gold medals to Team GB's equestrian victors and lauded swimmer Adam Peaty with a silver for his efforts in the 100m breaststroke.\n\nToday saw her continue her duties by presenting golds to Team GB's female rowers triumphant in the quadruple sculls.\n\nHer Royal Highness has not only enjoyed sports like Rugby Sevens, archery, and hockey but also delivered an inspiring talk to Team GB at the British embassy in Paris before the commencement of the Games. With these high-visibility engagements, Royal aficionados have expressed their joy at seeing her return to her duties, reports the Mirror.\n\nFollowing the medal ceremony for the champion rowers, one enthusiast took to social media, exclaiming: \"Imagine winning a gold medal at the rowing and then it's Princess Anne who gives you it, the absolute boss that she is. There's winning and then there's that.\"\n\nAnother commented: \"How lovely Princess Anne gave out the medals for the rowers today? \" while a fan enthused: \"It's lovely to see Princess Anne presenting medals at the rowing this afternoon.\"\n\nThe Princess Royal had to spend five nights in hospital last month. It's believed she suffered a nasty blow from a horse while on a walk around her Gatcombe Park estate.\n\nDue to her injuries, Anne missed out on nine official duties, including a poignant trip to Canada meant to honour war heroes.\n\nHer healthcare advisors have stated that the head injuries she sustained are aligned with what one might expect from an encounter with a horse's leg or head. However, the details of the accident remain somewhat murky due to the concussion she suffered.\n\nAlthough initially, an air ambulance was dispatched, Princess Anne ultimately made the journey to the hospital by road after receiving onsite emergency care. She checked in to Southmead Hospital in Bristol, where she was seen for minor head injuries and her concussion.\n\nEarlier this month, at her first royal duty since the accident, Anne disclosed that she has no recollection of the event itself.\n\nPrincess Anne is widely acknowledged for her passion for horse riding, a trait evident through the many horses stabled at her Gloucestershire home. Over the course of her equestrian career, she has earned considerable acclaim, including taking home the European Championship title back in 1971.\n\nThe King's sister also holds the distinction of being the first Royal to compete in the Olympic Games, having participated in Montreal in 1976. As of 2020, she is a patron for 28 different equestrian and animal-related charities, as reported by Country Life.\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

The Princess Royal, who represented Great Britain at the 1976 Olympics in equestrian events, has been seen taking in the sporting spectacle and dishing out the medals.\n\nOn Monday she presented gold medals to Team GB's victorious eventing team and was at the pool later that day to present swimmer Adam Peaty with his silver in the 100m breaststroke. Meanwhile today, she was on hand to present gold medals to Team GB's winning team in the women's quadruple sculls.\n\nShe has also been spotted enjoying other sports such as the Rugby Sevens, archery and hockey and gave a motivational speech to Team GB at the British embassy in Paris before the Games kicked off. And with her gaining much exposure with her high-profile appearances, royal fans have been delighted to see her back at work.\n\nTaking to X after the princess presented the golds to the champion rowers, one fan wrote: \"Imagine winning a gold medal at the rowing and then it's Princess Anne who gives you it, the absolute boss that she is.

An air ambulance was scrambled to take the princess to hospital, but in the end, she travelled by road after being treated by an emergency crew on site. She was treated at Southmead Hospital in Bristol for minor head injuries and her concussion. Speaking at her first engagement back earlier this month, she told how she \"can't remember a thing\" about the incident.\n\nThe Princess is renowned for being a lifelong equestrian, with multiple horses resident at her Gloucestershire estate's stables. She's previously won a string of medals throughout a glittering equestrian sports career, including the 1971 European Championship title.\n\nThe King's sister was also the first royal to compete in the Olympic Games in Montreal in 1976.

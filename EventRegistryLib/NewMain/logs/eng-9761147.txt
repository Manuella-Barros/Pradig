To clear up inaccurate reporting,\" Capitol Police said.\n\nD.C. police and Capitol Police arrested 15 people, while the U.S. Park Police arrested eight people, according to The Washington Post.\n\nThe Union Station protest drew bipartisan condemnation.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., condemned the vandals as \"pro-Hamas lunatics\" and noted that he \"introduced a bill to deport any foreigner involved in violence and vandalism on federal property.\"\n\n\"The Jew hate and anti-American garbage coming out of college campuses this spring didn't end with the last day of school,\" Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass, said. \"College presidents, you're on notice: Enforce your codes of conduct from day one of the fall semester.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who is also the presumptive 2024 Democratic nominee, took nearly 24 hours to condemn the violent protests in a statement Thursday, describing them as \"despicable acts by unpatriotic protestors [sic] and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric.\"\n\nAs of Thursday morning, President Joe Biden did not offer comment on the incident.\n\nThe protest comes as Israel continues its Gaza military offensive to eliminate Hamas, the terror group responsible for the Oct. 7 attack on Southern Israel that killed hundreds of civilians. The Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry reports over 38,000 people have died in Gaza since the offensive began. That figure doesn't differentiate between combatants and civilians. The Israeli government has long accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields.", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [],

Some other Democrats chose not to attend the speech.\n\nProtestors elsewhere in the nation's capital held similar signs, with at least one Hamas flag and several pro-Hamas graffiti messages left on structures.\n\nProtesters called for U.S. officials to stop supplying aid to Israel, and some said the state of Israel should be eliminated.\n\nPolice officers wearing helmets and carrying riot shields clashed with the protesters and arrested nine people, including five on charges of crowding.\n\nA 15-year-old was arrested for assaulting an officer in front of Union Station while three were also arrested for assaulting a police officer and crossing a police line in Columbus Circle, outside Union Station.\n\nUnion Station is about half a mile from the U.S. Capitol.\n\nA U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) spokesperson told news outlets: \"No flags under our protection have been removed or vandalized. Our officers will enforce the law if anyone attempts to remove a flag in USCP jurisdiction.\"\n\nSome members of both parties condemned protesters for tagging structures with graffiti and promoting Hamas.\n\n\"Defacing public property, desecrating the American flag, threatening Jews with violence and promoting terrorist groups like Hamas is not acceptable under any circumstance,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.\n\n\"There is a difference between lawful expression and disorderly conduct. Anyone who violates the law must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\"", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Union_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Union Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge_of_Allegiance_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pledge of Allegiance (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashida_Tlaib", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rashida Tlaib"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disorderly_conduct", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disorderly conduct"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jurisdiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jews"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Columbus, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/07/25/id5693444-US_Israel_Netanyahu_24206588430695-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761147", "eventUri": "eng-9761147", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 81, "textEnd": 88}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

The protesters accosted and even got into physical confrontations with police. U.S. Capitol Police officers deployed pepper spray after some protesters became \"violent\" and \"failed to obey\" orders by law enforcement.\n\nNine people were reportedly arrested across D.C., including four people on charges of assaulting a police officer outside Union Station.\n\nVandals defaced the Columbus Memorial Fountain, the Freedom Bell, and other monuments. The activists graffitied messages on the monuments with threats such as \"Hamas is coming.\"\n\nAmerican flags flying outside of Union Station were removed by anti-Israel activists, and activists hoisted Palestinian ones in their place. The activists then burned the American flags.\n\n'You tear down our flag, and I will put it back up every single time!'\n\nA group of House Republicans -- led by Speaker of the House Mike Johnson and Rep. Brandon Williams of New York -- descended on Union Station late Wednesday night to restore the American flags that were taken down.\n\n\"We recognize that they flew Palestinian flags on these polls. It is outrageous. They were pulled down, thankfully,\" Johnson said.\n\nHe continued, \"American flags are once again flying over Union Station. We will not let the terrorist mob win.\"\n\nCongressman Williams added, \"Anti-American agitators will not have the last say. We will continue to stand for this great country, no matter what. You tear down our flag, and I will put it back up every single time! God Bless America.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Derrick Van Orden from Wisconsin said, \"We came down here to Union Station and re-flew these flags because Americans will not bend. We will not bow. We will not be afraid, and we will not be cowered by these terrorist sympathizers. We will stand strong with the American flag, the American people, and our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel.\"\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) wrote on the X social media platform, \"We raised the flags back up. Earlier today, terrorist sympathizers tore down the American flags at Union Station, burned them, and raised the Palestinian flag in its place. After votes tonight, a group of members, including many veterans and the speaker of the house, took our flag back and raised it. Took a while to get it done because the Hamas supporters broke the connections, but D.C. police helped us out and got us zip ties.\"\n\nAfter raising the three American flags, the Republicans and law enforcement officers said the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nGOP Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas announced on Wednesday that a bill had been introduced by Republican lawmakers to \"deport any foreigner involved in violence and vandalism on federal property.\"\n\n\"The actions of the pro-Hamas lunatics at Union Station in DC are shameful, and anyone on a visa who took part should have it revoked immediately,\" Cotton declared.\n\nOn Thursday morning, National Park

The intifada has just begun!\" protesters shouted, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. \"Netanyahu, you can't hide. You're committing genocide,\" other protesters shouted.\n\nThrongs of demonstrators rallied near the Capitol before starting their march ahead of Netanyahu's joint address to Congress, but police blocked them from getting close to the building. Police said they used pepper spray after some protesters became \"violent\" and \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\nBefore Netanyahu's speech, some protesters tried to block his route to the Capitol but were removed from the street by police. After being turned away by officers near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of the nearby rail station.\n\nOutside of Union Station, at least four protesters were handcuffed and taken away by police. Protesters shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers who formed a circle. One person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer was seen grabbing a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossing it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome from the effects of pepper spray.\n\nCheers rang out as a fire burned what appeared to be a papier-mache likeness of Netanyahu. Protesters spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. \"Free Gaza\" was scrawled in green.\n\nAmong the protesters was a group of artists from Baltimore displaying a massive papier-mache sculpture meant to depict President Joe Biden with blood on his hands and devil horns.\n\nMary Kaileh, a Palestinian woman who moved to the U.S. from the West Bank 17 years ago and now lives in Baltimore, said her people have been ignored and mistreated for decades. She's not convinced protests will change anything in terms of convincing American politicians to act, but she wasn't about to stay home.\n\n\"I love it, but I don't see the effects of it,\" she said.\n\nWhile many of the demonstrators have condemned Israel, others have expressed support while pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal in the war with Hamas and bring home the hostages still being held by the militant group.\n\nMany Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came in response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loves ones.\n\nCapitol Police said in a post on X that six people who \"disrupted\" Netanyahu's address were removed from the House gallery and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the congressional buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nDuring Netanyahu's speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages. The individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself.\n\nPolice significantly boosted security around the Capitol and closed multiple roads for most of the week. Workers erected a metal fence around the White House on Wednesday morning while tall steel barriers ringed the Capitol.\n\nDozens of protesters rallied outside Netanyahu's hotel Monday evening after his arrival in Washington, and on Tuesday afternoon, hundreds of demonstrators staged a flashmob-style protest in the Cannon building, which houses offices of House members.\n\nThe Capitol Police said about 200 people were arrested Tuesday on charges stemming from the sit-in at the Cannon building. Jewish Voice for Peace, which organized the protest, said many more than that were arrested, rabbis among them.\n\nAfter about a half-hour of protesters' clapping and chanting, officers from the Capitol Police issued several warnings, then began arresting demonstrators -- binding their hands with zip ties and leading them away one by one.\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu are expected to meet today, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity before a White House announcement. Vice President Kamala Harris will also meet Netanyahu separately that day.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Truth Social that he would meet with Netanyahu on Friday.\n\nA large effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, center, is seen as protestors attempt to block streets, Wednesday, July 24, 2024, in Washington, ahead of a scheduled visit by Netanyahu at the US Capitol.

The intifada has just begun!\" protesters shouted, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. \"Netanyahu, you can't hide. You're committing genocide,\" other protesters shouted.\n\nThrongs of demonstrators rallied near the Capitol before starting their march ahead of Netanyahu's joint address to Congress, but police blocked them from getting close to the building. Police said they used pepper spray after some protesters became \"violent\" and \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\nBefore Netanyahu's speech, some protesters tried to block his route to the Capitol but were removed from the street by police. After being turned away by officers near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of the nearby rail station.\n\nNine people were arrested across Washington, including four people on charges of assaulting a police officer outside Union Station.\n\nOutside of Union Station, protesters shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers who formed a circle around several people who were arrested. One person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer was seen grabbing a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossing it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome from the effects of pepper spray.\n\nCheers rang out as a fire burned what appeared to be a papier-mache likeness of Netanyahu. Protesters spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. \"Free Gaza\" was scrawled in green.\n\nAmong the protesters was a group of artists from Baltimore displaying a massive papier-mache sculpture meant to depict President Joe Biden with blood on his hands and devil horns.\n\nMary Kaileh, a Palestinian woman who moved to the U.S. from the West Bank 17 years ago and now lives in Baltimore, said her people have been ignored and mistreated for decades. She's not convinced protests will change anything in terms of convincing American politicians to act, but she wasn't about to stay home.\n\n\"I love it, but I don't see the effects of it,\" she said.\n\nWhile many of the demonstrators have condemned Israel, others have expressed support while pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal in the war with Hamas and bring home the hostages still being held by the militant group.\n\nMany Jewish Americans view the war in Gaza as just because it came in response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies. The families of hostages taken by Hamas are also protesting, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loves ones.\n\nCapitol Police said in a post on X that six people who \"disrupted\" Netanyahu's address were removed from the House gallery and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the congressional buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nDuring Netanyahu's speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages. The individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but had done nothing to disrupt the speech itself.\n\nPolice significantly boosted security around the Capitol and closed multiple roads for most of the week. Workers erected a metal fence around the White House on Wednesday morning while tall steel barriers ringed the Capitol.\n\nDozens of protesters rallied outside Netanyahu's hotel Monday evening after his arrival in Washington, and on Tuesday afternoon, hundreds of demonstrators staged a flashmob-style protest in the Cannon building, which houses offices of House members.\n\nThe Capitol Police said about 200 people were arrested Tuesday on charges stemming from the sit-in at the Cannon building. Jewish Voice for Peace, which organized the protest, said many more than that were arrested, rabbis among them.\n\nAfter about a half-hour of protesters' clapping and chanting, officers from the Capitol Police issued several warnings, then began arresting demonstrators -- binding their hands with zip ties and leading them away one by one.\n\nFamilies of some of the remaining hostages held a protest vigil Tuesday evening on the National Mall, demanding that Netanyahu come to terms with Hamas and bring home the approximately 120 Israeli hostages remaining in Gaza.\n\nBiden and Netanyahu are expected to meet Thursday, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity before a White House announcement. Vice President Kamala Harris will also meet Netanyahu separately that day.\n\nHarris, as Senate president, would normally sit behind foreign leaders addressing Congress, but she will be away Wednesday, on an Indianapolis trip scheduled before Biden withdrew his reelection bid, which made her the likely Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Truth Social that he would meet with Netanyahu on Friday.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Olla Mokhtar, Olivia Diaz, Michael Kunzelman and Lea Skene contributed to this report.", "source":

REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris joined Democratic and Republican leaders in condemning protesters who burned American flags and sprayed pro-Hamas graffiti outside Washington's Union Station on Wednesday, describing the acts as unpatriotic and abhorrent.\n\nThe protests coincided with a speech to Congress by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Before he spoke, protesters marched near the U.S. Capitol building, condemning U.S. military aid to Israel during its war with Hamas militants in Gaza.\n\nFollowing Netanyahu's speech, some of the demonstrators gathered in front of Union Station. They hoisted American flags outside the iconic train station, burned American ones and spray painted the words \"Hamas is coming\" and \"Free Gaza\" on a large monument.\n\nHarris, the Democrats' presidential candidate, said in a statement on Thursday that she condemns any individuals associating with Hamas.\n\n\"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris and Biden were due to hold separate meetings with Netanyahu later on Thursday. More protests were planned for outside the White House.\n\nDuring the protest on Wednesday, before some of the protesters converged near Union Station, police used pepper spray on some of the thousands of demonstrators present and made some arrests.\n\nThe flag burning and graffiti outside Union Station drew strong criticism from Republican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson and Hakeem Jeffries, the chamber's Democratic leader.\n\n(Reporting by Ismail Shakil in Ottawa and Jasper Ward in Washington; editing by Rami Ayyub)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE

The war has engulfed the Gaza Strip, with hostages still being held there by Hamas.\n\nThe protesters have called for a cease-fire and criticized America's ongoing support for Israel, mostly in the form of weapons. Opponents of the protests say they ignore the ongoing hostage situation and echo the talking points of a terrorist organization.\n\nA smaller group of protesters returned Thursday to demonstrate outside the White House, where Netanyahu was scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nJoining several Republicans who condemned the protests on Wednesday, Harris, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both New York Democrats, forcefully criticized the protesters on Thursday, with Schumer telling NBC News, \"What happened at Union Station was vile, offensive, wrong.\"\n\nHarris, in her statement, called out \"despicable acts by unpatriotic protestors\" and called their rhetoric \"dangerous and hate-fueled.\"\n\nShe also condemned \"any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas\" and \"the burning of the American flag.\"\n\nJeffries told reporters at the Capitol that \"it is unacceptable to deface public property, desecrate the American flag, threaten Jews with violence, or promote terrorist organizations like Hamas.\"\n\nThe protest on Wednesday was originally led by the ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) Coalition and grew to thousands ahead of Netanyahu's speech.\n\nWaving flags and chanting, the protesters clashed with Capitol Police at barricades set up near the Capitol and then grew more heated when they reached Union Station, a few blocks away.\n\nProtesters vandalized statues in front of Union Station (a major Amtrak stop), removed and burned the American flags from the flagpoles and replaced them with Palestinian flags. Several flash bangs were heard, believed to be set off by protesters in the middle of Massachusetts Avenue, one of the main streets that feeds a circle in front of the train station.\n\nIn several instances, police deployed pepper spray against the protesters and several were arrested.\n\nDuring his speech Wednesday, Netanyahu condemned the protesters, accusing them of standing for evil and \"for Hamas.\"\n\n\"From all we know, Iran is funding the anti-Israel protests that are going on right now outside this building,\" the prime minister said, adding: \"Well, I have a message for these protesters. When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising and promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots.\"\n\nThe statements from Democrats come as support for Israel's war against Hamas has become a political problem for the party.\n\nNearly half of congressional Democrats skipped Netanyahu's speech on Wednesday, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, of California, and former House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, of South Carolina.\n\nIn recent weeks, more Democrats have called on Netanyahu to accept the terms of a cease-fire deal announced by President Joe Biden in May that would help bring home the remaining Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas.", "source": {"uri":

About a mile away from that spot, some demonstrators later hoisted Palestinian flags and burned American ones, an act condemned by top U.S. leaders, including Harris.\n\n\"I condemn the burning of the American flag,\" Harris said in a statement. \"It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nHer statement also condemned pro-Hamas graffiti and made no mention of police using pepper spray on protesters.\n\nLater on Thursday, a few dozen pro-Palestinian protesters and a smaller number of pro-Israel demonstrators gathered outside the White House on Thursday as President Joe Biden and Harris met with Netanyahu.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters held banners that read \"Israel uses U.S. tax dollars to kill Palestinian children\" and \"Arrest this criminal,\" referring to the International Criminal Court prosecutor office's arrest warrant against the Israeli leader over alleged war crimes in Gaza that he denies.\n\nPro-Israeli demonstrators carried Israeli flags and demanded the release of hostages held in Gaza.\n\nOne pro-Palestinian protest organizing group said the focus on the flag burning was a distraction from the use of pepper spray by police against demonstrators and from the humanitarian crisis in Gaza against which protesters demonstrated.\n\n\"They are attempting to demonize the protests, and focus on one individual sign or some individual's burning of the American flag,\" the ANSWER group, an acronym for 'act now to stop war and end racism', said.\n\nAnother group, CodePink, said it did not participate in or endorse the burning of flags.\n\n\"We do question the moral clarity of people more upset over the burning of fabric than over the burning to death of children by weapons their own country supplied,\" CodePink added.\n\nGaza's health ministry says nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the enclave in Israel's assault that has also displaced nearly the entire 2.3 million population and caused a hunger crisis. The Israeli assault followed an Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which governed Gaza, on Israel that killed 1,200 with about 250 people taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSeparately, family members of some hostages met U.S. and Israeli officials, including Biden and Netanyahu, at the White House and urged that a ceasefire deal be reached quickly to get hostages released and stop the killings in Gaza.\n\n\"We came in really emphasizing ... a desire to get this (ceasefire) deal done,\" Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of one of the hostages, told reporters

Exalting them and burning Union Station's American flag is disgraceful. Defacing public property is illegal. Hateful, antisemitic messages and threats against Jews have no place here.\"\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters, some of whom espoused support for Hamas with flags and graffiti on statues, burned American flags erected outside the popular Union Station travel hub and replaced them with Palestinian ones. Some altercations turned violent when police intervened to quell the vandalism and arrest individuals, including some demonstrators who attempted to physically drag officers away.\n\nThe White House and Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, denounced what Harris labeled \"unpatriotic protesters.\"\n\n\"I condemn the burning of the American flag,\" she said in a statement. \"That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nThousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators swarmed the streets of the nation's capital on Wednesday. At times, police said they were forced to deploy deterrents like pepper spray against agitators who threatened security perimeters around the Capitol, where Netanyahu addressed a joint session of Congress.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan Police were assisted by officers from other agencies in preparation for the protests, including as far away as the New York Police Department.\n\nIn addition to burning the American flag, demonstrators burned Israeli flags, chanted \"Allahu Akbar,\" graffitied a Christopher Columbus statue with \"Hamas is coming,\" and burned an effigy of Netanyahu.\n\nRoughly 100 House Democrats and more than two dozen Senate Democrats boycotted Netanyahu's speech to protest his handling of the war in Gaza. Schumer attended, but he and Netanyahu declined to embrace with a handshake and simply nodded to one another.\n\nSenate Minority Whip John Thune (R-SD), prior to Schumer's condemnation, accused Democrats of \"running scared\" from their constituency.\n\n\"I think it's internal Democrat politics. I think they're afraid of those voters,\" Thune said. \"I just think they are running scared of that constituency in Michigan and other places around the country that gets radicalized to the point of what you saw happening yesterday at Union Station.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nRep.

Before he spoke, protesters marched near the U.S. Capitol building, condemning U.S. military aid to Israel during its war with Hamas militants in Gaza. Following Netanyahu's speech, some of the demonstrators gathered in front of Union Station. They hoisted American flags outside the iconic train station, burned American ones and spray painted the words \"Hamas is coming\" and \"Free Gaza\" on a large monument.\n\nHarris, the Democrats' presidential candidate, said in a statement on Thursday that she condemns any individuals associating with Hamas. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris and Biden were due to hold separate meetings with Netanyahu later on Thursday. More protests were planned for outside the White House. During the protest on Wednesday, before some of the protesters converged near Union Station, police used pepper spray on some of the thousands of demonstrators present and made some arrests.\n\nThe flag burning and graffiti outside Union Station drew strong criticism from Republican U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson and Hakeem Jeffries, the chamber's Democratic leader.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Union_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington Union Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_desecration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag desecration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pepper spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/23_07_2024_11_40_16_9544228.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761147", "eventUri": "eng-9761147", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

We had seen hundreds of premade signs calling the Israeli prime minister a \"war criminal.\"\n\nOne man responded, \"I, like, called out sick from work, so if I get arrested ... . But, you know, he deserves it.\"\n\nWe followed up with: \"If you could get to Netanyahu, what would you do, what would you say to him?\"\n\nOne of two protesters, laughing off the question, said, \"I can't answer that right now, I don't want to incriminate myself.\"\n\nA third protester showed off a replica guillotine. A friend of his assured us that it was \"obviously just metaphorical.\"\n\n\"A human head wouldn't fit through that hole.\"\n\nAn effigy like that of the Palestinian guillotine evoked comparisons to the gallows displayed by Jan. 6 protesters. The New York Times called the latter \"right-wing iconography.\"\n\nA man standing off to one side of the rally stage holding a sign saying \"Hamas-Hezbollah-Houthi CRUSH THEM\" was immediately surrounded and heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nProtesters proudly waved jihadist flags and the Cuban flag. Many people also sported signs and merchandise featuring images of Palestinian terrorist Leila Khaled and flags with the leader of the terrorist group Hamas on them.\n\nThe Party for Socialism and Liberation, a communist political party, was also active at Wednesday's demonstrations.\n\nBarricades of police lined the perimeter of the U.S. Capitol building. Present at the riot were officers of the U.S. Park Police; the New York Police Department; Montgomery County, Maryland, Police; U.S. Capitol Police; and the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, along with Department of Homeland Security agents.\n\nThey were equipped with gas masks and pepper spray. A few noncompliant protesters were seen pouring water into their eyes and wiping off their bodies after being pepper-sprayed by police.\n\nThe mob paraded bloody paper m\u00e2ch\u00e9 effigies of Netanyahu and President Joe Biden through the streets.\n\nA large effigy of Biden with devil horns held an object resembling a missile that said, \"ISRAEL BOMBS, US PAYS.\"\n\nA fake Netanyahu was wheeled over the top of flames of an already burning American flag and caught fire while the crowd -- and the flames -- roared.\n\nAnother effigy likened the Israeli leader to Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.\n\nThe protesters made clear they were none too happy with the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. A speaker at the rally called her out for supposedly being complicit in genocide and said the protesters would not vote for her in November \"just because she is black and a woman.\"\n\nMany protesters waved both the Palestinian and Pride flags at once. Some held signs written in rainbow marker that read \"There is no PRIDE in GENOCIDE.\"\n\nOne person even waved a double-sided transgender and Palestinian flag, despite the fact that acts of homosexuality are punishable under law in Gaza.\n\nAs pro-Palestinian protesters began lowering the first of three American flags outside Union Station, raising a Palestinian flag in its stead, U.S. Park Police chased down and began arresting a man close to the scene. While detaining and arresting the individual, another protester emerged from the mob and dragged one of the police officers away.\n\nAnother officer intervened with his baton as his partner stood back up and regained his balance.", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hudson_crozier@dailysignal.com", "name": "Hudson Crozier",

They flew Palestinian flags in their place and burned at least one of the American flags that were taken down. Protesters also covered nearby monuments in grafitti.\n\n\"We recognize that they flew Palestinian flags on these poles.

Anyone who violates the law must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,\" Jeffries wrote.\n\nTransportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg echoed Jeffries in his own statement.\n\n\"Grave concern for the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza cannot justify defacing federal property with Hamas slogans. Passionate differences are grounds for fierce debate and meaningful protest, not intimidation and certainly not support for terrorism,\" Buttigieg wrote.\n\nA man who walked by the protest and remarked that he was Jewish and was offended by the language was then chased down the street, yelled at and called \"Hitler\" by agitators. He and a woman were later let inside a building to get away from the protesters. When a Fox News reporter asked why they followed the man, one said it was because he was White and Jewish.\n\nEarlier in the day, hundreds of protesters had gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue and 3rd Street, outside the Gallery of Art.

Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, Brandon Williams, R-N.Y., Rudy Yakym, R-Ind. and other lawmakers gathered to raise flags they said had flown over the Capitol and recited the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nProtesters opposing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress had burned the flags next to an effigy of the leader.\n\n\"It's shameful what happened here today,\" Speaker Johnson said. \"Instead of protesting, you should be standing with your country, and we will.\"\n\nOnce Rep. Yakym raised his flag, he climbed the poll to fasten the ropes.\n\n\"The protesters were here - pro-Hamas protesters - they tore these flags down, and they put up Palestinian flags,\" Rep. Yakym said. \"But today, we're gonna raise the American flags.\"\n\nThe lawmakers noted they went to Union Station immediately after a House voting session. In a video posted to social media, Rep. Williams said he recruited the congressmembers after driving past the flagpoles to get to the Capitol.\n\n\"Tonight as I drove in to votes, I drove by Union Station here in Washington, D.C. and observed that the flagpoles where our American flags were burned today by the Hamas protesters were still bare, and our flag had not been restored,\" he explained. \"I recruited a number of fellow members of Congress with me, including the speaker and a bunch of Navy vets, Marine vets.\"\n\nAfter the protesters lit the flag on fire hours earlier, some danced around it and sung.

Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) said on X. \"Over a million Americans have given their lives to protect that right -- including my own father.\"\n\nInitially, the protesters converged on Pennsylvania Ave NW, near the National Gallery of Art East Building, where they heard from speakers including Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein.\n\nProtesters displayed a paper mache, blood-soaked Biden, held above the crowd. Many signs accused Israel of \"genocide\" in the Gaza Strip.\n\nOthers created a giant Netanyahu head with crafted hands dripping with red paint symbolizing blood.\n\n\"Prime Minister of Genocide,\" one sign near the display read.\n\nAnother labeled the prime minister \"Satanyahu.\"\n\nEarly in the morning, before the main demonstration, anti-Israel agitators dyed a city fountain near the Capitol blood red and released maggots and other insects at the Watergate Hotel where the Israeli delegation was staying.\n\nVideo on X shows the bugs crawling across a table with Israeli and American flags in the background, raising questions about how anti-Israel activists accessed the hotel area used by the Israeli delegation.\n\n\"Palestine protestors manufactured chaos at the Watergate Hotel last night so that Netanyahu, Israeli Mossad agents, and the Secret Service had no peace as they continue to terrorize our people,\" the Palestinian Youth Movement posted on X.\n\nA law enforcement source told The Post that although the conference room seemed set up for official business, it was \"not part of our agreed-upon security plan with the Israeli security services and our local partners.\"\n\nIman Potter, 70, from Virginia, joined the protest, holding a sign that read \"United States of Israel.\" She said she was \"appalled\" by Netanyahu's invitation to speak to Congress.\n\n\"This is a catastrophic moment in history. We are appalled that our government would host a war criminal like him,\" she told The Post. \"They have no shame.\"\n\n\"We want to vote all of them -- all the dual citizens, all of the Zionists in Congress -- out. They all take millions in AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs Committee] money,\" she added. \"It's sick. They're bought and paid for.\"\n\nThe crowd was so large that law enforcement agencies, including the New York Police Department, were on hand to assist with security.\n\nOne protest speaker claimed New York's Finest \"sent 200 cops to Washington, DC\" to protect Netanyahu \"because that's who they are.\"\n\n\"Their motto in New York is to serve and protect,\" the speaker shouted. \"Well right now, they're serving and protecting a genocidal lunatic.\"\n\nAt one point, a trio from DiploAct, an organization aiming to \"fight the antisemitic propaganda,\" drew the ire of protesters, some of whom were unsure how to respond to them.\n\n\"Do not engage with Zionists,\" one man was heard shouting to bystanders. Eventually, the trio left after being surrounded by the anti-Israel protesters.\n\nOne DiploAct member, Barack Swarttz, 29, said he and his partners tried to talk with dozens of protesters. They had cameras and microphones with them.\n\n\"As soon as you introduce yourself and ask where you're from and what you're doing, he gets labeled and I get labeled as genocidal baby killers. Does it look like either of us are here to defend an accusation of genocide,\" he later told The Post.\n\nUnrest also occurred inside the House gallery, where Capitol Police arrested six people for unlawful conduct.\n\nWith his Wednesday speech, Netanyahu, 74, has now addressed Congress four times, setting a new record. He is scheduled to meet with President Biden on Thursday and former President Donald Trump on Friday.\n\nThe House is set to adjourn early for its August recess on Friday after struggling with appropriations bills.

The intifada has just begun!\" protesters shouted, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. \"Netanyahu, you can't hide. You're committing genocide,\" others shouted.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nThrongs of demonstrators rallied near the Capitol before starting their march ahead of Netanyahu's joint address to Congress, but police blocked them from getting close to the building. Police said they used pepper spray after some protesters became \"violent\" and \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\nBefore Netanyahu's speech, some protesters tried to block his route to the Capitol but were removed by police. After being turned away by officers near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of the nearby rail station.\n\nOutside of Union Station, at least four protesters were handcuffed and taken away by police. Protesters shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers who formed a circle. One person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer was seen grabbing a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossing it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome by the effects of pepper spray.\n\nCheers rang out as a fire burned what appeared to be a papier-mache likeness of Netanyahu. Protesters spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. \"Free Gaza\" was scrawled in green.\n\nAmong the protesters was a group of artists from Baltimore displaying a massive papier-mache sculpture meant to depict President Joe Biden with blood on his hands and devil horns.\n\nMary Kaileh, a Palestinian woman who moved to the U.S. from the West Bank 17 years ago and now lives in Baltimore, said her people have been ignored and mistreated for decades. She's not convinced protests will change anything in terms of convincing U.S. politicians to act, but she wasn't about to stay home.\n\n\"I love it, but I don't see the effects of it,\" she said.\n\nWhile many of the demonstrators condemned Israel, others expressed support while pressing Netanyahu to strike a cease-fire deal in the war with Hamas and bring home the hostages still being held by the militant group.\n\nMany Jewish Americans view the war as just because it came in response to the brutal Oct. 7 Hamas attack, even if they don't outright support Netanyahu and his policies.\n\nThe families of hostages taken by Hamas also protested, demanding Netanyahu agree to a cease-fire deal that would free their loves ones.\n\nCapitol Police said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that six people who \"disrupted\" Netanyahu's address were removed from the House gallery and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the congressional buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nDuring Netanyahu's speech, five people wearing yellow T-shirts that read \"seal the deal now\" were removed from the gallery. The phrase is a rallying cry for those urging Netanyahu to reach a deal to return the hostages. The individuals stood to prominently display the message on their shirts during moments when others were applauding but did nothing to disrupt the speech itself.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0

The war has continued in the Gaza Strip, with hostages still in Hamas captivity.\n\nThe protests have called for a ceasefire and been critical of ongoing support from the U.S. in the form of weapons. Opponents have said the protests are ignoring the ongoing hostage situation and echoing the talking points of a terrorist organization.\n\nA smaller group of protesters returned on Thursday to demonstrate outside the White House, where Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nJoining several Republicans who condemned the protests on Wednesday, Harris, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries forcefully criticized the protesters on Thursday, with Schumer telling NBC News, \"What happened at Union Station was vile, offensive, wrong.\"\n\nIn her own statement, Harris called out \"despicable acts by unpatriotic protestors\" and called the protesters' rhetoric \"dangerous and hate-fueled.\"\n\nShe also condemned \"any individuals associating with the brutal terrorist organization Hamas\" and \"the burning of the American flag.\"\n\nJeffries told reporters at the Capitol that \"it is unacceptable to deface public property, desecrate the American flag, threaten Jews with violence, or promote terrorist organizations like Hamas.\"\n\nThe protest on Wednesday was originally led by the ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) Coalition and grew to thousands ahead of Netanyahu's speech.\n\nWaving flags and chanting, the protesters clashed with Capitol Police at barricades that had been set up near the Capitol and then grew more heated when they reached Union Station, a few blocks away.\n\nProtestors vandalized the statues in front of Union Station, where Amtrak trains enter and leave the city, removed and burned the American flags from the flagpoles, and replaced them with Palestinian flags. Several flash bangs were heard, believed to be set off by protestors in the middle of Massachusetts Avenue, one of the main streets that feeds a circle in front of the train station.\n\nIn several instances, police deployed pepper spray against the protesters and several were arrested.\n\nDuring his speech on Wednesday, Netanyahu himself condemned the protesters, accusing them of standing for evil and standing \"for Hamas.\"\n\n\"From all we know, Iran is funding the anti-Israel protests that are going on right now outside this building,\" the prime minister said, adding: \"Well, I have a message for these protesters. When the tyrants of Tehran who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising and promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots.\"\n\nThe statements from Democrats come as support for Israel's war against Hamas has become a political problem for the party.\n\nNearly half of congressional Democrats skipped Netanyahu's speech on Wednesday, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. and former House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, D-S.C.\n\nIn recent weeks, more Democrats have called on Netanyahu to accept the terms of a ceasefire deal announced by President Joe Biden in May that would help bring the remaining Israeli and American hostages held by Hamas home.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news",

At least one Hamas flag was spotted in the crowd.\n\nAnother protest was captured with a sign that read, \"Allah is gathering all the Zionists for the final solution,\" with a photo of a nuclear mushroom cloud over the Israeli flag.\n\nThe protester then began pushing against the security buffer zone.\n\nOne of the demonstrators who was pepper sprayed told The Post that officers unleashed chemicals because others around him were trying to break through the Capitol's defenses despite warnings to stop.\n\nIn anticipation of the upheaval, Capitol Police barricaded off a perimeter around the Capitol building, to give a buffer around the congressional domain fortified by metal fencing, concrete barriers, and officers.\n\nAt one point in the protest, the mob also set a scowling effigy of Netanyahu ablaze near the station amid a cacophony of screeds against Israel from a bevy of protesters in the background.\n\nProtesters also vandalized the Christopher Columbus statue outside the railroad and metro station, with one ominous piece of red graffiti reading, \"Hamas is coming.\"\n\nOther pieces of graffiti outside Union Station read \"F -- Israel\" and \"Free Palestine.\"\n\nA sea of Palestinian flags dominated the protests.\n\nChants of \"No justice, no peace,\" \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be freed,\" and \"Intifada\" were constantly heard throughout the protest.\n\n\"I never imagined seeing the flag of a terror group holding eight Americans hostage for 292 days waved in the streets of our nation's Capitol,\" Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) said on X. \"Over a million Americans have given their lives to protect that right -- including my own father.\"\n\nInitially, the storm of protesters converged on Pennsylvania Ave NW, right around the National Gallery of Art East Building, where they heard from an array of speakers including Green Party presidential hopeful Jill Stein.\n\nProtesters fashioned a paper mache, blood-soaked Biden, which was held above the crowd. Many others had signs accusing Israel of \"genocide\" in the Gaza Strip.\n\nOthers constructed a giant Netanyahu head accompanied by two crafted hands dripping with red paint representing blood.\n\n\"Prime Minister of Genocide,\" one sign near the display read.\n\nAnother called the prime minister \"Satanyahu.\"\n\nOvernight -- hours before the main demonstration got underway, anti-Israel agitators had dyed a city fountain, which was located not far from the Capitol, blood red and unleashed a scourge of maggots and other creepy crawlers at the Watergate Hotel where the Israeli delegation was staying.\n\nVideo posted on X shows the bugs crawling across a table flanked by Israeli and American flags in the background -- prompting questions about how the anti-Israel activists were able to access the area in the hotel being used by the visiting Israeli delegation.\n\n\"Palestine protestors manufactured chaos at the Watergate Hotel last night so that Netanyahu, Israeli Mossad agents, and the Secret Service had no peace as they continue to terrorize our people,\" the Palestinian Youth Movement posted on X.\n\nA law enforcement source told The Post that even though the conference room appeared to be set up for official business, it was \"not part of our agreed-upon security plan with the Israeli security services and our local partners.\"\n\nIman Potter, 70, who lives in Virginia and joined the demonstration while parading around a sign that said \"United States of Israel,\" explained that she was \"appalled\" by the invite Netanyahu received to speak to Congress.\n\n\"This is a catastrophic moment in history. We are appalled that our government would host a war criminal like him,\" she told The Post. \"They have no shame.\"\n\n\"We want to vote all of them -- all the dual citizens, all of the zionists in Congress -- out. They all take millions in AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs Committee] money,\" she added. \"It's sick. They're bought and paid for.\"\n\nThe crowd was so large that outside law enforcement agencies - including the New York Police Department - were on hand to help with security.\n\nOne speaker at the protest claimed New York's Finest \"sent 200 cops to Washington, DC\" to safeguard Netanyahu \"because that's who they are.\"\n\n\"Their motto in New York is to serve and protect,\" the speaker screamed. \"Well right now, they're serving and protecting a genocidal lunatic.\"\n\nAt one point, a trio from DiploAct, an organization that aims to \"fight the antisemitic propaganda,\" elicited the wrath of protesters, some of whom seemed baffled about how to handle them.\n\n\"Do not engage with zionists\" one man was heard shouting to bystanders. Eventually, the trio left after being swarmed by the anti-Israel protesters.\n\nOne of those DiploAct members, Barack Swarttz, 29, claimed that he and his partners attempted to talk with dozens of the protests. They had cameras and microphones with them.\n\n\"As soon as you introduce yourself and ask where you're from and what you're doing, he gets labeled and I get labeled as genocidal baby killers. Does it look like either of us are here to defend an accusation of a genocide,\" he later told The Post.\n\nUnrest also took place inside the House gallery, where a total of six people were arrested for unlawful conduct, according to Capitol Police.\n\nWith his Wednesday speech, Netanyahu, 74, has now delivered four addresses to Congress, which has set a new record. He is slated to meet with President Biden on Thursday and former President Donald Trump on Friday.\n\nThe lower chamber is set to break early for its August recess next week after running into hurdles wrangling through appropriations bills. The Senate will reconvene next week.", "source": {"uri": "skynews.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News Australia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The foundation was covered in smaller triangles and slogans, such as \"free Gaza\" and \"all Zionists are bastards.\"\n\nThe Liberty Bell replica Freedom Bell, American Legion, which stands across from the fountain, was completely covered In graffiti and red inverted triangles, according to Congressman Ryan Zinke. In a video posted to X, Zinke highlighted graffiti on the bell that said \"abolish the USA.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe American flags that flew at Union Station were pulled down from their poles and replaced with Palestinian flags, according to video posted on Instagram by Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM).

One woman wore a Hamas headband over a keffiyeh. Fox News photographed a woman with a Hamas flag wearing a \"Umm Obeida\" headband in reference to the terrorist spokesman.

Washington DC Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said in a Wednesday statement that her force had arrested five people for blocking the flow of traffic \"near the intersection of 4th Street, Southwest, and Independence Avenue, Southwest.\"\n\nProtests took a violent turn at several points in the day. A group or protesters pushed against a line of Capitol Police, demanding \"let us through,\" according to a People's Forum NYC video. Soon after, the demonstrators were doused with pepper spray.\n\nArrested on assault charges\n\n\"The crowd failed to obey our order to move back from our police line,\" the Capitol Police said on X. \"We are deploying pepper spray towards anyone trying to break the law and cross that line.\"\n\nSmith said that two protesters were arrested and charged for assualting an MPD officer at Columbus Circle. Two more were arrested for crossing police lines after the assault.\n\n\"While many people chose to peacefully exercise their first amendment rights in our city, some choose to disobey the law,\" said

REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nBy Kanishka Singh\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday condemned the burning of American flags by protesters a day ago when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress, while pro-Palestinian demonstrators distanced themselves from the act and said it was a distraction from the crisis in Gaza.\n\nThousands demonstrated outside the Capitol on Wednesday in a protest in which police used pepper spray on marching protesters as they reached a police blockade. About a mile away from that spot, some demonstrators later hoisted Palestinian flags and burned American ones, an act condemned by top U.S. leaders, including Harris.\n\n\"I condemn the burning of the American flag,\" Harris said in a statement. \"It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nHer statement also condemned pro-Hamas graffiti and made no mention of police using pepper spray on protesters.\n\nLater on Thursday, a few dozen pro-Palestinian protesters and a smaller number of pro-Israel demonstrators gathered outside the White House on Thursday as President Joe Biden and Harris met with Netanyahu.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters held banners that read \"Israel uses U.S. tax dollars to kill Palestinian children\" and \"Arrest this criminal,\" referring to the International Criminal Court prosecutor office's arrest warrant against the Israeli leader over alleged war crimes in Gaza that he denies.\n\nPro-Israeli demonstrators carried Israeli flags and demanded release of hostages held in Gaza.\n\nOne pro-Palestinian protest organizing group said the focus on the flag burning was a distraction from the use of pepper spray by police against demonstrators and from the humanitarian crisis in Gaza against which protesters demonstrated.\n\n\"They are attempting to demonize the protests, and focus on one individual sign or some individual's burning of the American flag,\" the ANSWER group, an acronym for 'act now to stop war and end racism', said.\n\nAnother group, CodePink, said it did not participate in or endorse the burning of flags.\n\n\"We do question the moral clarity of people more upset over the burning of fabric than over the burning to death of children by weapons their own country supplied,\" CodePink added.\n\nGaza's health ministry says nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the enclave in Israel's assault that has also displaced nearly the entire 2.3 million population and caused a hunger crisis. The Israeli assault followed an Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which governed Gaza, on Israel that killed 1,200 with about 250 people taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSeparately, family members of some hostages met U.S. and Israeli officials, including Biden and Netanyahu, at the White House and urged that a ceasefire deal be reached quickly to get hostages released and stop the killings in Gaza.\n\n\"We came in really emphasizing ... a desire to get this (ceasefire) deal done,\" Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of one of the hostages, told reporters after the meeting. \"We came today with a sense of urgency.\"\n\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Washington; additional reporting by Ismail Shakil in Ottawa and Jasper Ward in Washington; Editing by

The intifada has just begun!\" protesters shouted, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. \"Netanyahu, you can't hide. You're committing genocide,\" other protesters shouted.\n\nThrongs of demonstrators rallied near the Capitol before starting their march ahead of Netanyahu's joint address to Congress, but police blocked them from getting close to the building. Police said they used pepper spray after some protesters became \"violent\" and \"failed to obey\" orders to move back from the police line.\n\nBefore Netanyahu's speech, some protesters tried to block his route to the Capitol but were removed from the street by police. After being turned away by officers near the Capitol, protesters wound through the Capitol Hill neighborhood for several blocks before gathering in front of the nearby rail station.\n\nNine people were arrested across Washington, including four people on charges of assaulting a police officer outside Union Station.\n\nOutside of Union Station, protesters shouted, \"Let them go!\" at officers who formed a circle around several people who were arrested. One person grabbed at a police officer's riot shield and then raised his fists in a fighting stance. An officer was seen grabbing a Palestinian flag from a woman and tossing it aside. At least one protester appeared to be overcome from the effects of pepper spray.\n\nCheers rang out as a fire burned what appeared to be a papier-mache likeness of Netanyahu. Protesters spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. \"Free Gaza\" was scrawled in green.\n\nAmong the protesters was a group of artists from Baltimore displaying a massive papier-mache sculpture meant to depict President Joe Biden with blood on his hands and devil horns.\n\nCapitol Police said in a post on the social media platform X that six people who \"disrupted\" Netanyahu's address were removed from the House gallery and arrested.\n\n\"Disrupting the Congress and demonstrating in the congressional buildings is against the law,\" police said.\n\nOTHER PROTESTS\n\nA fake protest encampment set up for a TV shoot on a New York City college campus sparked a real reaction from pro-Palestinian activists, who organized their own demonstration against the filming, a newspaper reported Wednesday.\n\nThe scenario unfolded Monday and Tuesday at Queens College, where the CBS drama \"FBI: Most Wanted\" was filming an upcoming episode involving a climate change protest, The New York Times reported.\n\nLike some of the encampments that formed on college campuses in the U.S. and elsewhere this spring to protest Israel's actions in its war against Hamas, the TV set protest featured tents, sleeping bags and handmade banners.\n\nMembers of some pro-Palestinian groups, Within Our Lifetime and Students for Justice in Palestine, took umbrage and organized a protest of their own on the sidelines of the fictional one, the Times reported. Production wrapped up earlier than expected Monday following the protesters' appearance, and a group of about 15 protesters returned Tuesday, the paper reported. It wasn't clear whether any were students.\n\nThe newspaper said the demonstrators declined to speak to a reporter. However, in chants and flyers, they called the film shoot \"propaganda\" and the use of the campus \"a clear attempt to simultaneously demonize and profit from the student movement.\"\n\nThe show's producers declined to comment, the Times said.\n\nQueens College said in a statement that the \"campus community\" had been told in advance about the TV shoot, including its \"focus on a climate change/environmental issue protest at a fictitious college.\"\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Ashraf Khalil, Alanna Durkin Richer, Olla Mokhtar, Olivia Diaz, Michael Kunzelman, Lea Skene, Mike Pesoli, Matt Slocum, Jose Luis Magana, Mike Stewart and staff writers of The Associated Press.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks during a memorial service for former U.S. Sen.

(AP Photo/Mike Stewart)\n\nProtesters against the Gaza war held a \"die-in\" across from Lafayette Park and the White House on Thursday as President Joe Biden met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe protesters poured red liquid onto the street, saying it symbolized the blood of those killed in Gaza. They chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of Netanyahu with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. The jumpsuit reads, \"Wanted for crimes against humanity.\"\n\nMore than 39,000 people have died in Gaza since the start of the war in October. Dozens of Israeli hostages remain in Hamas captivity.\n\nIn an address to Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu defended Israel's conduct during the war, as thousands of demonstrators massed near the Capitol, marching through city streets carrying Palestinian flags and calling for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nOutside Washington's Union Station, protesters removed American flags and hoisted Palestinian ones in their place to massive cheers in the crowd. They sprayed graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, spoke strongly about the protesters' actions.\n\n\"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent, and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" she said. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nThe number of protesters Thursday was significantly smaller than the day before.\n\nHazami Barmada, who described herself as a grassroots activist, spoke through a megaphone of Biden's decision not to see reelection and to pass the baton to Harris.\n\n\"Biden did not voluntarily leave the race, Joe Biden was pushed out of the race,\" she said. \"And Kamala Harris still needs to prove her humanity\" before earning the trust of pro-Palestinian voters.\n\n\"I'm not going to give you my vote until you show you share the ideals that the Democratic Party is supposed to believe in,\" she said.\n\nAt one point, a young man with an Israeli flag draped over his shoulders walked into the middle of the protest circle and posed for the journalists' cameras as the crowd jeered.\n\nPolice worked to keep the two sides apart.\n\nAs police led the man away -- he wasn't detained -- Barmada shouted, \"See, they even want to occupy our protests. Even our land isn't enough!\"\n\nAs police cleared the way, the protesters later marched through city streets toward the National Mall.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafayette_Square,_Washington,_D.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die-in", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Die-in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canadian_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Canadian Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_against_humanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crimes against humanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Union_Station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Union Station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Columbus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hostage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hostage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flag of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mall", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Mall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Home_and_Garden/Flags_and_Banners", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Home and Garden/Flags and Banners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.castanet.net/content/2024/7/2651144beb3b7aecc2fac00c7583478d2cfbc7e6b0db86ba141221cd899f54e5_p3858522.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761147", "eventUri": "eng-9761147", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

It is the first time since the October 7 attacks he has addressed Congress.\n\nUnfortunately, his welcome was less than warm.\n\nNot only did Vice President Kamala Harris, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), as well as a number of Democratic lawmakers miss Netanyahu's speech, but \"chaos\" ensued on Capitol Hill as thousands of pro-Hamas protesters gathered to wreak havoc.\n\nJulio Rosas, Blaze Media's national correspondent, who was in D.C. to witness the bedlam, joins Jill Savage and the \"Blaze News Tonight\" panel to relay what he saw.\n\n\"Initially the protesters that were against Netanyahu speaking to Congress today tried to get close to the Capitol building, [but] police blocked their path because they didn't want them to get close. That resulted in clashes; police had to use pepper spray. Eventually, the crowd started to move on,\" says Rosas, adding that the mob \"marched around in the Capitol Hill neighborhood before coming to Union Station.\"\n\n\"U.S. Park police moved in to stop protesters from tearing down the American flags that are normally placed in Columbus Circle. There was more fighting; more arrests were made. The Park police withdrew after they secured the American flag and the arrestees, but as they were withdrawing, people were chasing them; they were heckling them.\"\n\nThen \"the protesters tore down the remaining American flags, and they replaced them with Palestinian flags,\" Rosas reports.\n\n\"Why isn't this an insurrection?\" asks Jill, pointing out the glaring hypocrisy.\n\n\"Because the Democratic Party and their media friends have decided that it's not,\" says Blaze Media's senior politics editor and Washington correspondent Christopher Bedford, adding, \"What's striking about what we're seeing here -- the flags being torn down, the cops being attacked, flags being burned -- is how many members of Congress stand with these people.\"\n\n\"The members of Congress who actually did show up, which was not a lot of them ... some of [the Democrat members] wore some of the activist T-shirts that you actually see in the parade,\" he continues.\n\n\"Take the image ... of protesters ripping down and burning the American flag and put it next to Donald Trump with blood spotted across his face, putting his fist in the air next to the American flag, and ask people which side they want to choose.\"\n\nTo hear more analysis of the chaos in D.C., watch the episode above.\n\nTo enjoy more provocative opinions, expert analysis, and breaking stories you won't see anywhere else,

Not far away, pro-Hamas agitators were desecrating public property and burning the American flag, including at Union State, where American flags were even replaced with Palestinian ones. Many reacted over social media with outrage and heartbreak, leading POLITICO to go for the narrative that \"Republicans pounce.\"\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, POLITICO's Congressional Minutes noted that \"Republicans pounce after Netanyahu protesters burn U.S. flags -- and wave Hamas ones instead.\" The headline has since been changed to \"Republicans condemn Netanyahu protesters for burning US flags -- and waving Hamas ones instead.\"\n\nScreenshots still remain, though, and a post from POLITICO includes the original headline.\n\nEven if the \"pounce\" language is gone from the headline, the piece still begins by claiming \"Republicans seized.\"\n\nAs Anthony Adragna wrote:\n\nRepublicans seized immediately on images of burning U.S. flags and vandalism at Washington, D.C.'s Union Station following Benjamin Netanyahu's speech as evidence of widespread antisemitism and a harbinger of what can happen under Democratic control of government.\n\n...\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement that \"no flags under our protection have been removed or vandalized\" though non-Capitol Police officers were seen making mass arrests near Union Station after the speech.\n\nOther GOP lawmakers tried to tie the protests and vandalism -- without evidence -- to Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic nominee for president.\n\nThe statement from the U.S. Capitol Police is moot when eyewitness accounts and footage exists all over social media, include images and video clips, of flags being desecrated at Union Station. In her eyewitness account, The Daily Signal's Elise McCue posted that \"Police are nowhere to be seen.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Adragna's mention and defense of Vice President Kamala Harris, it's worth reminding that she boycotted Netanyahu's speech in favor of attenting an event for a sorority in Indianapolis.\n\nNot only do her priorities speak volumes, but such protesters represent the far-left base that the Biden-Harris administration and the Democratic Party have tried to cater to. The adminsitration has also been slow to condemn such antisemitic and pro-Hamas behavior taking place in this country at such an alarming rate since the October 7 attack that Hamas terrorists perpetrated against our ally in the Middle East.\n\nAdragna references Republicans such as Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Rep. Michal McCaul (R-TX).\n\nThe piece also brings up Rep. Brian Mast (R-FL) when it comes to the criticism of Harris. What Adragna leaves out is how Mast also spoke about being a veteran in that same post, and how he lost friends in battle.\n\nSuch a post is now Mast's pinned post as of early Thursday morning.\n\nFor all of this focus on Republicans \"pounc[ing]\" and how they \"seized,\" Adragna even admits that Democratic members also expressed outrage, including Reps. Dean Phillips (D-MN) and Jake Auchincloss (D-MA).\n\nAdragna also left out Phillips' mention of his father, who gave his life in battle.\n\nAnother Democrat, Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) is also worth mentioning, as he was in for quite the reality check.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday he posted his outrage over how Netanyahu had powerfully and fittingly called out the pro-Hamas protesters in the United States for being \"Iran's useful idiots,\" a part of the speech which Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) also took great issue with. Hours later, even Murphy posted his disgust over pro-Hamas protesters wrecking the city.\n\nIt also was far from members of Congress, from either party, who were sharing how the terrorist sympathizers were cuasing mayhem and destruction over Netanyahu's speech. Matt showcased plenty in his piece from Wednesday afternoon, as did Brett T at our sister site of Twitchy.\n\nAlthough it took several hours, especially due to how methodical and dedicated the terrorist sympatherizers were, the American flags were ultimately put back up later on Wednesday evening. This was thanks to an effort from members of Congress, many of them veterans, including Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA).\n\nPOLITICO's Olivia Beavers shared a photo of the members gathered at Union Station on Wednesday evening.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_downs@townhall.com", "name": "Rebecca Downs", "type": "author",

Being \"pro-Palestinian\" means being antisemitic, which these protesters are. It means being terrorist sympathizers, which these protesters are.

Harris ditched Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech before Congress to pander to these activists in the first place, making it clear that she, like they, will be tougher on Israel than on the Hamas terrorists who are responsible for the bloodshed in the region.\n\nThat is why the Biden administration wasted hundreds of millions of dollars on a Gaza pier to send aid to Gaza despite having good reason to suspect that Hamas would steal that aid. That is why both President Joe Biden and Harris have threatened consequences for Israel, even as they remain committed to funneling aid to Gaza that everyone knows ends up in Hamas's hands. Biden, Harris, and much of the Democratic Party want a \"ceasefire\" that would leave Hamas in power and let the threat of terrorism continue to loom over Israel.\n\nThese protesters, with their flag-burning, antisemitism, and terrorist sympathies, are part of the Democratic base, which Democrats admit through their policies even as they try and distance themselves from the protests themselves. Contrast that with people such as the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill fraternity members who went to one of these protests to protect the American flag and were then given a platform at the Republican National Convention. Or with the convention attendees who chanted to bring American hostages held by Hamas home, a display that is hard to imagine seeing at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nPolls consistently show far higher levels of patriotism among conservatives than among liberals, and a not-inconsiderable subset of the Left actually detests this land of freedom.\n\nThe people who support freeing hostages and the American flag are the ones worth counting among your base. The ones who burn the American flag and proudly wave the flag of a terrorist \"state\" are not, but those are the ones Democrats would rather court.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com",

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries tried to distance Democrats from the protests.\n\n'It's not clear to me that any of the protesters associated with the left wing of the Democratic Party when these are individuals who have been aggressively protesting members of the House Democratic Congress, every week, every month, year after year, from October 7 In connection with our support for the special relationship between the United States and Israel.'\n\nAn image of members of the school's Pi Kappa Phi, Alpha Epsilon Pi and other fraternities holding up the U.S. flag went viral on social media in May.\n\nThe patriotic act drew over $500,000 in donations to throw the groups an 'epic rager.' Netanyahu gave the students a shoutout in his address.\n\n'I wish to salute the fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina for protecting the American flag against these anti-Israel protesters,' he said to applause and chants of 'USA' from Congress.\n\nMeanwhile, police estimated that over 10,000 protestors descended upon Capitol Hill to call for an end to the 'genocide' in Gaza and demand a ceasefire.\n\nFrat boys at UNC Chapel Hill surround American flag in protection as pro Palestine mob runs wild\n\nParticipants walk past an effigy as protesters against the war in Gaza and US weapons sales to Israel gather outside the US Capitol\n\nDemonstrators set fire on an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\n\nThe protesters also burned an effigy of Netanyahu and displayed another one of him with devil horns and blood spraying out of his mouth.\n\nThey spray painted statues outside the city's train station with slogans like 'Hamas is coming' and 'Zionists are bastards.'\n\n'Part of the crowd has started to become violent at First Street and Constitution Avenue, NW. The crowd failed to obey our order to move back from our police line. We are deploying pepper spray towards anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,' Capitol Police said in a statement at one point.\n\nAmtrak Northeast riders were told to 'expect delays near Washington Union Station and intermittent closures of entrances/exits.'\n\nDemocratic Rep. Dean Phillips, Minn., reacted with horror at the sight of a Hamas flag being flown just outside the U.S. Capitol.\n\n'I never imagined seeing the flag of a terror group holding eight Americans hostage for 292 days waved in the streets of our nation's Capitol. Over a million Americans have given their lives to protect that right - including my own father,' he wrote on X.\n\nProtestors burn a photo of Benjamin Netanyahu outside of Union Station on July

of police officers\n\nAnti-Israel rioters burned the US flag, flaunted blood-red paint-soaked effigies, and even attempted to breach the US Capitol Police line i\n\nMeanwhile close to half of Congressional Democrats skipped Netanyahu's Capitol speech due to tensions over the ongoing war with the Hamas terror group in Gaza.\n\nThey believe Netanyahu has not done enough to protect civilians - a reported 40,000 have died since the war began - to allow in aid or to get hostages back.\n\nMost notable absences include Vice President Kamala Harris, who would have presided over the Senate, but

They chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of Netanyahu with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. The jumpsuit reads, \"Wanted for crimes against humanity.\"\n\nMore than 39,000 people have died in Gaza since the start of the war in October.

About a mile away from that spot, some demonstrators later hoisted Palestinian flags and burned American ones, an act condemned by top U.S. leaders, including Harris.\n\n\"I condemn the burning of the American flag,\" Harris said in a statement. \"It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nHer statement also condemned pro-Hamas graffiti and made no mention of police using pepper spray on protesters.\n\nLater on Thursday, a few dozen pro-Palestinian protesters and a smaller number of pro-Israel demonstrators gathered outside the White House on Thursday as President Joe Biden and Harris met with Netanyahu.\n\nPro-Palestinian protesters held banners that read \"Israel uses U.S. tax dollars to kill Palestinian children\" and \"Arrest this criminal,\" referring to the International Criminal Court prosecutor office's arrest warrant against the Israeli leader over alleged war crimes in Gaza that he denies.\n\nPro-Israeli demonstrators carried Israeli flags and demanded release of hostages held in Gaza.\n\nOne pro-Palestinian protest organizing group said the focus on the flag burning was a distraction from the use of pepper spray by police against demonstrators and from the humanitarian crisis in Gaza against which protesters demonstrated.\n\n\"They are attempting to demonize the protests, and focus on one individual sign or some individual's burning of the American flag,\" the ANSWER group, an acronym for 'act now to stop war and end racism', said.\n\nAnother group, CodePink, said it did not participate in or endorse the burning of flags.\n\n\"We do question the moral clarity of people more upset over the burning of fabric than over the burning to death of children by weapons their own country supplied,\" CodePink added.\n\nGaza's health ministry says nearly 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in the enclave in Israel's assault that has also displaced nearly the entire 2.3 million population and caused a hunger crisis. The Israeli assault followed an Oct. 7 attack by Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which governed Gaza, on Israel that killed 1,200 with about 250 people taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nSeparately, family members of some hostages met U.S. and Israeli officials, including Biden and Netanyahu, at the White House and urged that a ceasefire deal be reached quickly to get hostages released and stop the killings in Gaza.\n\n\"We came in really emphasizing ... a desire to get this (ceasefire) deal done,\" Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of one of the hostages, told reporters after the meeting. \"We came today with a sense of urgency.\" (Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Washington;

They chanted, \"Arrest Netanyahu,\" and brought in an effigy of Netanyahu with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. The jumpsuit reads, \"Wanted for crimes against humanity.\"\n\nMore than 39,000 people have died in Gaza since the start of the war in October. Dozens of Israeli hostages remain in Hamas captivity.\n\nIn an address to Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu defended Israel's conduct during the war, as thousands of demonstrators massed near the Capitol, marching through city streets carrying Palestinian flags and calling for Netanyahu's arrest.\n\nOutside Washington's Union Station, protesters removed American flags and hoisted Palestinian ones in their place to massive cheers in the crowd. They sprayed graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Vice President Kamala Harris, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, spoke strongly about the protesters' actions.\n\n\"Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent, and we must not tolerate it in our nation,\" she said. \"I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.\"\n\nThe number of protesters Thursday was significantly smaller than the day before.\n\nHazami Barmada, who described herself as a grassroots activist, spoke through a megaphone of Biden's decision not to see reelection and to pass the baton to Harris.\n\n\"Biden did not voluntarily leave the race, Joe Biden was pushed out of the race,\" she said. \"And Kamala Harris still needs to prove her humanity\" before earning the trust of pro-Palestinian voters.\n\n\"I'm not going to give you my vote until you show you share the ideals that the Democratic Party is supposed to believe in,\" she said.\n\nAt one point, a young man with an Israeli flag draped over his shoulders walked into the middle of the protest circle and posed for the journalists' cameras as the crowd jeered.\n\nPolice worked to keep the two sides apart.\n\nAs police led the man away -- he wasn't detained -- Barmada shouted, \"See, they even want to occupy our protests. Even our land isn't enough!\"\n\nAs police cleared the way, the protesters later marched through city streets toward the National Mall.\n\n___\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

In their permit for the event submitted to the U.S. Park Police and obtained by JNS, the Answer Coalition estimated some 5,000 total participants.\n\nOrganizers occasionally updated the crowd with claims about how many intersections throughout the city had been \"claimed by the people\" as miles of central Washington were closed off to traffic amid a significant police presence.\n\n\"Part of the crowd has started to become violent at First Street and Constitution Avenue, NW,\" stated the U.S. Capitol Police shortly before Netanyahu began his 2 p.m. address. \"The crowd failed to obey our order to move back from our police line. We are deploying pepper spray towards anyone trying to break the law and cross that line.\"\n\nJNS heard a loud, explosive bang near that intersection around the same time that briefly panicked parts of the crowd, which included both families with small children as well as protesters wearing gas masks and body armor in apparent anticipation of clashes with the police.\n\nA police officer from the New York City Police Department guarding the Capitol told JNS that the sound came from police firing tear gas in response to clashes with protesters. He did not know if any arrests had been made.\n\nMore than 200 members of the New York City Police Department were sworn in as U.S. Capitol Police special officers alongside other law enforcement from the D.C. area to supplement security during Netanyahu's visit.\n\n'Confronting law enforcement on scene'\n\nUnconfirmed video on social media shows protesters throwing bottles and other objects at police at the intersection, and the police responding with pepper spray and firing at least one round of tear gas into the crowd.\n\nProtesters also confronted a small group of pro-Israel counter-demonstrators along the route, berating them with expletives, staring them down and throwing at least one water bottle at them. Police officers were likewise hailed with expletives and rude gestures by a significant number of marchers.\n\nThe demonstration reached its conclusion at Columbus Circle in front of Union Station. Video on social media shows protesters bringing down the three U.S. flags in the plaza and replacing them with Palestinian flags. Some shouted Allahu Akbar (\"God is great\") as they lit fire to at least one of the American flags. Netanyahu was also burned in effigy.\n\n\"A crowd in Columbus Circle is engaged in criminal activity and confronting law enforcement on scene,\" the U.S. Park Police wrote. \"USPP is attempting to de-escalate and contact the event organizer for help.\"\n\nIt later added that the permit for the rally had been revoked and ordered demonstrators to leave.\n\nDuring the afternoon march, JNS spotted explicitly pro-Hamas and pro-terrorism messages, including the flags of Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- the red triangle logos Hamas uses in its social-media posts to designate targets -- as well as Hamas's al-Qassam Brigades headbands.", "source": {"uri": "vinnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "vinnews.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The graffiti on the fountain will need several days of cleaning treatment, according to a Park Service worker.\n\n\"Marble is a more porous material than granite, so once the paint starts to seep in, it takes a little longer to draw it out -- but certainly over the course of the next week,\" the Park Service worker said. \"By the time they're done, you won't be able to see any [of the vandalism].\n\nProtesters vandalized the marble of the Lincoln Memorial with green paint about 15 years ago, requiring about two weeks of work to remove the graffiti, while vandalism on the granite of the Washington Monument a couple years ago was removed after one day of treatment, the worker said.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump issued an executive order in June 2020, during the BLM riots, directing federal law enforcement to prosecute individuals who damaged monuments and threatening to withhold funding from local governments that failed to protect their own statues from vandals. President Biden rescinded that order on May 14, 2021.\n\nThe Park Service received but declined offers from the public to help in the cleanup, saying that specialized treatments needed to be done as opposed to simply using bleach and a pressure washer that could cause more damage.\n\nThousands of demonstrators protesting Israel's war in Gaza marched through Washington on Wednesday, accusing Mr. Netanyahu of war crimes as he addressed congressional lawmakers.\n\nThe protesters who faced off against law enforcement were pepper-sprayed and shouted several chants, including \"Free, Free Palestine,\" \"The whole world is watching,\" \"We will never be silenced\" and \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.\"\n\nThe Palestinian militant group Hamas sparked the war with its Oct. 7 raid of southern Israel, which killed at least 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and in which more than 200 others were taken hostage. Since then, Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip, which Hamas controls, has killed more than 39,000 people, according to Gazan health officials, whose figures haven't been verified and who do not differentiate between civilians and Hamas fighters.\n\nIn Washington, Hundreds of protesters were arrested Tuesday night at a sit-in at a House office building at the U.S. Capitol complex.\n\nProtesters rallied at Union Station, where they removed American flags outside the train station and replaced them with Palestinian flags. They chanted \"Shut it down!\" and marched behind a banner that read \"globalize the student intifada.\"\n\nLaw enforcement began to deploy pepper-spray and make arrests near the train terminal.\n\n\"Part of the crowd has started to become violent at First Street and Constitution Avenue, NW. The crowd failed to obey our order to move back from our police line,\" U.S. Capitol Police posted on X. \"We are deploying pepper spray towards anyone trying to break the law and cross that line.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers brought American flags to Union Station later that evening after law enforcement removed the Palestinian flags and hoisted the U.S. flags on the poles.", "source":

In scenes reminiscent of the fraternity brothers who protected the flag during protests at the University of North Carolina, the group of Republicans, including Reps. Rudy Yakym, Ind., Derrick Van Orden, Wis., Morgan Luttrell, Texas and Brandon Williams, N.Y., hung the flag up and said the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nEarlier in the day officers were engaged in violent scenes as thousands of demonstrators descended in Washington D.C. to vent their fury at the Israeli Prime Minister over the war in Gaza. Vice President Kamala Harris condemned the 'despicable acts by unpatriotic protestors and dangerous hate-fueled rhetoric' outside the Capitol on Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans immediately sought to tie the rioters to their Democratic opponents. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries tried to distance Democrats from the protests. 'It's not clear to me that any of the protesters associated with the left wing of the Democratic Party when these are individuals who have been aggressively protesting members of the House Democratic Congress, every week, every month, year after year, from October 7 In connection with our support for the special relationship between the United States and Israel.'\n\nAn image of members of the school's Pi Kappa Phi, Alpha Epsilon Pi and other fraternities holding up the U.S. flag went viral on social media in May. The patriotic act drew over $500,000 in donations to throw the groups an 'epic rager.' Netanyahu gave the students a shoutout in his address.\n\n'I wish to salute the fraternity brothers at the University of North Carolina for protecting the American flag against these anti-Israel protesters,' he said to applause and chants of 'USA' from Congress. Meanwhile, police estimated that over 10,000 protestors descended upon Capitol Hill to call for an end to the 'genocide' in Gaza and demand a ceasefire.\n\nThe protesters also burned an effigy of Netanyahu and displayed another one of him with devil horns and blood spraying out of his mouth. They spray painted statues outside the city's train station with slogans like 'Hamas is coming' and 'Zionists are [expletive].'\n\n'Part of the crowd has started to become violent at First Street and Constitution Avenue, NW. The crowd failed to obey our order to move back from our police line. We are deploying pepper spray towards anyone trying to break the law and cross that line,' Capitol Police said in a statement at one point. Amtrak Northeast riders were told to 'expect delays near Washington Union Station and intermittent closures of entrances/exits.'\n\nDemocratic Rep. Dean Phillips, Minn., reacted with horror at the sight of a Hamas flag being flown just outside the U.S. Capitol. 'I never imagined seeing the flag of a terror group holding eight Americans hostage for 292 days waved in the streets of our nation's Capitol. Over a million Americans have given their lives to protect that right - including my own father,' he wrote on X.\n\nMeanwhile, close to half of Congressional Democrats skipped Netanyahu's Capitol speech due to tensions over the ongoing war with the Hamas terror group in Gaza. They believe Netanyahu has not done enough to protect civilians - a reported 40,000 have died since the war began - to allow in aid or to get hostages back.\n\nMost notable absences include Vice President Kamala Harris, who would have presided over the Senate, but is claiming a scheduling conflict, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the second most powerful Democratic Senator Durbin D-Ill.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

In their permit for the event submitted to the U.S. Park Police and obtained by JNS, the Answer Coalition estimated some 5,000 total participants.\n\nSpeakers included former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein; a leader of the D.C.-area branch of Students for Justice in Palestine who was referred to as \"Noor\"; and the presidential candidate of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a Communist party that calls for a revolution to overthrow capitalism.\n\nOrganizers occasionally updated the crowd with claims about how many intersections throughout the city had been \"claimed by the people\" as miles of central Washington were closed off to traffic amid a significant police presence.\n\nAfter several hours of speeches denouncing Israel, Zionism, capitalism, the U.S. government, U.S. President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Congress and the American university system, coupled with call-and-repeat chants with the crowd that included \"From the River to the Sea,\" rally-goers marched along Constitution Avenue to the north of the Capitol.\n\nWhile most of the crowd proceeded peacefully, a significant portion confronted the U.S. Capitol Police in an attempt to cross police barriers surrounding the building.\n\n\"Part of the crowd has started to become violent at First Street and Constitution Avenue, NW,\" stated the U.S. Capitol Police shortly before Netanyahu began his 2 p.m. address. \"The crowd failed to obey our order to move back from our police line. We are deploying pepper spray towards anyone trying to break the law and cross that line.\"\n\nJNS heard a loud, explosive bang near that intersection around the same time that briefly panicked parts of the crowd, which included both families with small children as well as protesters wearing gas masks and body armor in apparent anticipation of clashes with the police.\n\nA police officer from the New York City Police Department guarding the Capitol told JNS that the sound came from police firing tear gas in response to clashes with protesters. He did not know if any arrests had been made.\n\nMore than 200 members of the New York City Police Department were sworn in as U.S. Capitol Police special officers alongside other law enforcement from the D.C. area to supplement security during Netanyahu's visit.\n\n'Confronting law enforcement on scene'\n\nUnconfirmed video on social media shows protesters throwing bottles and other objects at police at the intersection, and the police responding with pepper spray and firing at least one round of tear gas into the crowd.\n\nProtesters also confronted a small group of pro-Israel counter-demonstrators along the route, berating them with expletives, staring them down and throwing at least one water bottle at them. Police officers were likewise hailed with expletives and rude gestures by a significant number of marchers.\n\nThe demonstration reached its conclusion at Columbus Circle in front of Union Station. Video on social media shows protesters bringing down the three U.S. flags in the plaza and replacing them with Palestinian flags. Some shouted Allahu Akbar (\"God is great\") as they lit fire to at least one of the American flags. Netanyahu was also burned in effigy.\n\n\"A crowd in Columbus Circle is engaged in criminal activity and confronting law enforcement on scene,\" the U.S. Park Police wrote. \"USPP is attempting to de-escalate and contact the event organizer for help.\"\n\nIt later added that the permit for the rally had been revoked and ordered demonstrators to leave.\n\nDuring the afternoon march, JNS spotted explicitly pro-Hamas and pro-terrorism messages, including the flags of Hamas and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- the red triangle logos Hamas uses in its social-media posts to designate targets -- as well as Hamas's al-Qassam Brigades headbands.", "source": {"uri": "sun-sentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SunSentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They pulled down the American flag and replaced it with the Palestinian flag. Some flew the Hamas flag and vandalized monuments with spray-painted slogans like \"Hamas is comin'\" and \"I commend Hamas.\"\n\nThe occasion was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaking to a joint session of Congress. So how would our D.C.-riot-hating media treat this? Some largely pretended it did not exist (like the Wall Street Journal news pages). Even Netanyahu denouncing some protesters as \"useful idiots\" for Iran didn't drag out more detail.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nOthers went into denial. On the \"PBS NewsHour,\" reporter Nick Schifrin asked former Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.) about Netanyahu calling protesters \"useful idiots\" for Iran. Malinowski replied, \"If you look at the protesters who are flying the Hamas flag and burning the American flag -\" Schifrin interrupted: \"You mean they're flying the Palestinian flag.\" No, photographs showed Hamas flags were flown by someone. It's funny how they avoid that.\n\nOn NPR's \"All Things Considered,\" reporter Jennifer Ludden found protesters to denounce Biden as a \"silent accomplice,\" but insisted they were \"largely peaceful.\" Shoving cops and vandalizing monuments and burning flags were not \"considered.\"\n\nOn NBC, you could see vandalized monuments behind anchorman Lester Holt, but he and reporter Andrea Mitchell merely used the \"thousands of protesters\" to underline that Netanyahu was controversial, not that the protesters were in any way controversial. No flag-burning appeared, and no violence toward police was pointed out.\n\nOn CBS, reporter Scott MacFarlane - who aggressively promoted the Pelosi-Picked Panel on Jan. 6 for several years - showed protesters burning the American flag and described them as merely \"raucous.\" He also highlighted protests by Rep. Rashida Tlaib (with her little black paddle with the words \"War Criminal\") and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who claimed it was \"important not to legitimize a leader who attacked democracy.\"\n\nOnly ABC devoted an entire TV story to the protests. ABC reporter Matt Gutman showed the flag-burning and burning Netanyahu in effigy. He showed \"defaced\" monuments. But there was no mention of violence toward police (just officers were \"swarmed\"). On screen, ABC put \"violent\" in quotation marks about the protesters.\n\nNone of these stories described the protesters with an ideological label, when the organizers are radical-left, and some are affiliated with communist parties (like International ANSWER). The New York Times offered 17 paragraphs on \"activist groups\" without a label, although they noted the crowd was \"waving Palestinian flags.\"\n\nThe Washington Post, the local paper, put \"U.S. flag set ablaze\" in their headline, but noted \"most demonstrators walked and chanted peacefully.\" There were no ideological descriptions in 36 paragraphs. They were just \"pro-Palestinian protesters.\" They did quote the vandalized messages \"All Zionists are bastards\" and late in the piece, \"Hamas is comin'.\" But they did let a leftist rabbi denounce Netanyahu as a \"zealot\" with \"fascist politics.\"\n\nWhile most stories noted that scads of Democrats from Kamala Harris on down boycotted the Netanyahu speech, no one questioned whether that was controversial with Jewish voters or could harm the Democrats in the fall.\n\nIt was fascinating when Harris then issued a statement condemning flag-burning, \"unpatriotic\" protesters associated with Hamas, and \"pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric.\" Where did she find out about that? Too many \"news\" outlets buried that news.\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

It is the first time since the October 7 attacks he has addressed Congress.\n\nUnfortunately, his welcome was less than warm.\n\nNot only did Vice President Kamala Harris, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), as well as a number of Democratic lawmakers miss Netanyahu's speech, but \"chaos\" ensued on Capitol Hill as thousands of pro-Hamas protesters gathered to wreak havoc.\n\nJulio Rosas, Blaze Media's national correspondent, who was in D.C. to witness the bedlam, joins Jill Savage and the \"Blaze News Tonight\" panel to relay what he saw.\n\n'Hamas Is Coming': CHAOS at the Capitol Erupts During Netanyahu Speech | 7/24/2024www.youtube.com\n\n\"Initially the protesters that were against Netanyahu speaking to Congress today tried to get close to the Capitol building, [but] police blocked their path because they didn't want them to get close. That resulted in clashes; police had to use pepper spray. Eventually, the crowd started to move on,\" says Rosas, adding that the mob \"marched around in the Capitol Hill neighborhood before coming to Union Station.\"\n\n\"U.S. Park police moved in to stop protesters from tearing down the American flags that are normally placed in Columbus Circle. There was more fighting; more arrests were made. The Park police withdrew after they secured the American flag and the arrestees, but as they were withdrawing, people were chasing them; they were heckling them.\"\n\nThen \"the protesters tore down the remaining American flags, and they replaced them with Palestinian flags,\" Rosas reports.\n\n\"Why isn't this an insurrection?\" asks Jill, pointing out the glaring hypocrisy.\n\n\"Because the Democratic Party and their media friends have decided that it's not,\" says Blaze Media's senior politics editor and Washington correspondent Christopher Bedford, adding, \"What's striking about what we're seeing here -- the flags being torn down, the cops being attacked, flags being burned -- is how many members of Congress stand with these people.\"\n\n\"The members of Congress who actually did show up, which was not a lot of them ... some of [the Democrat members] wore some of the activist T-shirts that you actually see in the parade,\" he continues.\n\n\"Take the image ... of protesters ripping down and burning the American flag and put it next to Donald Trump with blood spotted across his face, putting his fist in the air next to the American flag, and ask people which side they want to choose.\"\n\nTo hear more analysis of the chaos in D.C., watch the episode above.\n\nTo enjoy more provocative opinions, expert analysis, and breaking stories you won't see anywhere else,

During the 2023-24 college school year, agitators and student protesters flooded college campuses nationwide to protest the war in Israel, which also included spiking instances of antisemitism and Jewish students publicly speaking out that they did not feel safe on some campuses.\n\nAgitators on Columbia University's campus, for example, took over the school's Hamilton Hall building, while schools such as UCLA, Harvard and Yale worked to clear spiraling student encampments where protesters demanded their elite schools completely divest from Israel.\n\nPROTESTERS CHANT 'FREE PALESTINE' AS NETANYAHU ADDRESSES CONGRESS\n\nFlorida Republican Rep. Carlos Gimenez told Fox News Digital on Thursday that the chaos unfolding on the streets of Washington, D.C., \"lies squarely on the shoulders of those in power who failed to act,\" including Democrats and college officials who did not end or condemn the protests earlier this year as they turned violent and chaotic.\n\n\"Since October 7, the Biden administration and woke university administrators across America have refused to take action and shut down these antisemitic, pro-Hamas riots. Their inaction led to one of the most reprehensible riots on Capitol Hill during PM Netanyahu's address,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Rioters attacked police officers, defaced our monuments, set American flags ablaze, and wreaked havoc in Washington, DC, all while spreading antisemitic canards. This chaos lies squarely on the shoulders of those in power who failed to act.\"\n\nHARRIS BOYCOTTS NETANYAHU, SNUBS ISRAELI LEADER'S WARTIME ADDRESS TO GIVE SORORITY SPEECH\n\n\"What happened yesterday is not free speech; it's free hate. This is just a glimpse of what's to come. Universities across the nation are in danger of becoming pro-Hamas dumpster fires as students return to campus this upcoming semester.\"\n\nThe White House condemned the protests Wednesday evening, calling the chaos \"disgraceful.\"\n\n\"Identifying with evil terrorist organizations like Hamas, burning the American flag, or forcibly removing the American flag and replacing it with another, is disgraceful,\" White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a comment to Fox News Digital Wednesday evening.\n\n'CHICKENS FOR KFC': NETANYAHU RIPS CEASE-FIRE ACTIVISTS IN SPEECH TO CONGRESS AS TLAIB SILENTLY PROTESTS\n\n\"Antisemitism and violence are never acceptable. Period. Every American has the right to peaceful protest. But shamefully, not everyone demonstrated peacefulness today.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee after President Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday, did not condemn the protests until late Thursday morning. Harris also notably was not in attendance during Netanyahu's address to Congress on Wednesday.\n\nEarlier this month, as speculation mounted Biden would drop out of the race, Harris told The Nation that she understands \"the emotion behind\" the anti-Israel protests that raged on college campuses.\n\n\"They are showing exactly what the human emotion should be, as a response to Gaza,\" Harris told the progressive magazine. \"There are things some of the protesters are saying that I absolutely reject, so I don't mean to wholesale endorse their points. But we have to navigate it. I understand the emotion behind it.\"\n\nWHITE HOUSE CONDEMNS PRO-HAMAS AGITATORS IN DC: 'DISGRACEFUL'\n\nHarris was notably cited by the media and White House sources late last year as urging Biden and the administration to be \"tougher\" on Netanyahu as war raged, allegedly arguing the White House needed to be more sympathetic toward Palestinians.\n\n\"Kamala Harris' embarrassing snub of @netanyahu's Joint Address to Congress was a stunt to appease the pro-Hamas base of the Democrat Party that just burned American flags, clashed with police, and spread dangerous pro-terror chaos and violence. Why won't Kamala disavow these antisemitic terrorist sympathizers?\" New York Rep. Elise Stefanik posted to her X account of Harris.\n\nIsrael has become a lightning rod for the Democratic Party since October, with the party's progressive faction, including members of the \"Squad,\" coming under fierce condemnation from the Jewish community and conservatives for not taking harder stances against Hamas.\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu addressed Congress to discuss his nation's ongoing war against Hamas after the terrorist group launched attacks on Israel in October. During the speech, \"Squad\" member Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., held up a sign that said \"war criminal\" while listening to Netanyahu's speech.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister tore into the protesters amid his speech in the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"I have a message for these protesters. When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots,\" Netanyahu said.\n\n\"Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming gays for Gaza. They might as well hold up signs saying 'Chickens for KFC.' These protesters chant 'From the river to the sea.' But many don't have a clue what river and what sea they're talking about.\"\n\nThe protesters in the nation's capital on Wednesday held signs reading \"Wanted War Criminal,\" alongside depictions of Nentanyahu, while others chanted \"Free Palestine\" and \"From the river to the sea....\"\n\nOther protesters yelled at the swath of police officers on the scene, \"You're a b -- -.\" Fox News witnessed pepper spray being used at one point.\n\nSTEFANIK GRILLS HARVARD PRESIDENT OVER STUDENTS CALLING FOR 'INTIFADA,' RAMPANT ANTISEMITISM ON CAMPUS\n\n\"I am deeply disturbed by the anti-Israel protests that we saw on college campuses this past year and again this week in our nation's capital,\" Jewish influencer Lizzy Savetsky told Fox News Digital on Thursday of the protests. \"The so-called 'peaceful protesters' are burning American flags and displaying the flag of Hamas, a terrorist organization that slaughtered 1,200 innocent civilians on October 7th and took hundreds hostage. Such actions are beyond the scope of reasonable dialogue; they represent support for a group that oppresses both Israelis and Palestinians and rejects any pursuit of peace. Endorsing Hamas is not a stand for justice but an embrace of tyranny and oppression. We must stand unwaveringly against hatred and antisemitism in our society.\"\n\nSUSAN SARANDON JOINS ANTI-ISRAEL PROTEST AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY MONTHS AFTER BEING DROPPED BY TALENT AGENCY\n\nConservative lawmakers and political leaders, including former President Trump, have long stood against the anti-Israel protests and rising antisemtism that unfolded on college campuses this year.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and the Workforce held hearings late last year, when they grilled leaders from some of the nation's most elite universities, including the University of Pennsylvania, MIT, Harvard and Northwestern.\n\n\"Isn't it true that a Jewish student wearing a yarmulke was spat on,\" Stefanik said to Northwestern University President Michael Schill in May, before asking how long Schill anticipates campus investigations will last regarding instances of antisemitism on campus.\n\nANTI-ISRAEL YALE PROTESTERS JOINING COLUMBIA STUDENTS IN 'TEAR DOWN OUR SOCIETY' IVY LEAGUE MOVEMENT: LAW PROF\n\n\"I'm not going to be able to tell you that. They'll be finalized when the conduct office and the Title VI office, which are well on this issue...\" Schill said.\n\n\"This is why you've earned an F,\" she said, referring to the school receiving an F grade in the Anti-Defamation League's Campus Antisemitism Report Card this year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn December, Stefanik and the committee grilled the then-presidents of Harvard and Penn, Claudine Gay and Liz Magill respectively, about their handling of antisemitism. The pair of administrators resigned from their positions shortly after the hearing, amid widespread backlash for waffling on whether calls for the genocide of Jews violated their respective schools' codes of conduct.\n\nFox News Digital's Liz Elkind, Brie Stimson and Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFIN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitic_trope", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitic trope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_A._Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos A.

I know some of the protesters like to shut roads down and make a statement, that ain't gonna happen here, we're not gonna allow it.\"\n\nThere will be some road closures in the area and the Intercoastal will be shut down near Mar-a-Lago.\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service will also be on hand to assist law enforcement with securing the area.\n\nSouth Florida authorities are trying to avoid scenes like the ones in Washington on Wednesday, where protesters gathered as Netanyahu spoke before a joint session of Congress.\n\nThe demonstrators weaved through the streets of the nation's capital carrying Palestinian flags and signs with messages such as \"arrest Netanyahu\" and \"end all U.S. aid to Israel.\" Outside Washington's Union Station, protesters removed American flags and hoisted Palestinian ones in their place to massive cheers in the crowd.\n\nCheers rang out as a fire burned what appeared to be a papier-mache likeness of Netanyahu. Protesters spray painted graffiti on a monument to Christopher Columbus, including the words, \"Hamas is coming\" in large red letters. \"Free Gaza\" was scrawled in green.\n\nAt a press conference in Aventura Thursday morning, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis spoke about the protests, calling them a \"complete disgrace.\"\n\nHe said he has never seen this \"outburst of antisemitism\" in his lifetime, and that protests and antisemitic messages are \"disgraceful and unacceptable. He also criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for not being there when Netanyahu arrived to Congress.\n\n\"Kamala can't go there and greet him? That's not a way to treat an ally,\" DeSantis said.\n\nHarris issued a statement on Thursday morning condemning what she called the \"despicable acts\" by some protesters who displayed pro-Hamas graffiti and burned an American flag.\n\nShe was absent from Netanyahu's address due to a trip to Indianapolis that was scheduled before President Biden withdrew his reelection bid and she became the likely Democratic presidential candidate.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 6 South Florida"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They are attempting to demonize the protests, and focus on one individual sign or some individual's burning of the American flag,\" the ANSWER coalition, which was the lead organizing group of the protest, wrote in a statement to The Hill.\n\n\"The White House is directly slandering the protest as 'violent and antisemitic.' Everyone who was there knows this is an outright lie,\" they added.\n\nAfter the protest, White House Deputy Spokesperson Andrew Bates released a statement calling the protestors \"disgraceful.\"\n\n\"Identifying with evil terrorist organizations like Hamas, burning the American flag, or forcibly removing the American flag and replacing it with another, is disgraceful,\" Bates wrote.\n\n\"Antisemitism and violence are never acceptable.

Protestors also set two of those flags on fire, as well as an effigy of Netanyahu, according to police on the scene.\n\n\"The rising of the Palestinian flag on multiple flagpoles in front of Union Station and in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol grounds is a clear indication that the tide has turned,\" the organizers wrote to The Hill.\n\nIn a statement to The Hill, a Council of American Islamic Relations spokesperson condemned the flag burning and vandalism saying that they \"reject this unauthorized and unrepresentative behavior, which does not reflect or represent the movement to end the Gaza genocide.\" CAIR was one of the co-organizers of the protest.\n\n\"We also reject politicians and media personalities who have cynically attempted to conflate rogue criminal behavior by a small number of individuals with the actions of the peaceful protesters who gathered on Capitol Hill to oppose Netanyahu, his government's genocide and U.S. support for it,\" the spokesperson continued. \"Selective condemnations must end. If vandalism and offensive rhetoric is offensive, then so is committing, funding, lying about, and applauding the genocide of 40,000 human beings.\"\n\nPolice arrested 23 people yesterday and shot pepper spray and stun grenades at protestors multiple times throughout Wednesday's march.\n\n\"As soon as this mass assembly began to march towards Congress, police attacked,\" organizers wrote. \"So not only does the Biden-Harris administration direct U.S. tax dollars to fund the Israeli war machine, they unleash pepper spray on people who object. Dozens of marchers exercising their First Amendment rights were subject to a brutal and unprovoked police attack.\"\n\nU.S. Capitol Police has disagreed with organizers' characterization, writing, \"Part of the crowd [became] violent at First Street and Constitution Avenue, NW. The crowd failed to obey our order to move back from our police line.

It is borne of the Left from a hatred that, only a daily basis, is nurtured and stoked in order to reach the soon-coming flash point. Yesterday in our nation's capitol, we watched in real-time horror on social media as thousands of anti-America and anti-Israel domestic terrorists from the radical Left wreaked havoc attacked police and anyone deemed to be 'pro-Zionist'. To prove their point, they burned American flags.\n\n\"And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;\" 2 Peter 2:13 (KJB)\n\nIn case you haven't noticed, America now has our very own version of the Nazi brownshirts, and they are made up of the various domestic hate groups like ANTIFA, the Occupy Movement and Black Lives Matter burn down buildings, rape women, pillage businesses and shoot people dead in the street. This new faction, we'll call them the pro-Palestinian Movement, is much worse than anything that took place on January 6th. These people have the full support of the Biden administration, and should Kamala Harris be successful in her coup, these gangs will control the streets.\n\nFROM THE JERUSALEM POST: \"Hamas is coming,\" was scrawled in red across the face of the Christopher Columbus Memorial Fountain at Union Station, according to photographs published by the protest group Palestinian Assembly for Liberation-Awda. The graffiti was accented with the inverted red triangle favored in Hamas videos to denote the targeting of enemies. The foundation was covered in smaller triangles and slogans, such as \"free Gaza\" and \"all Zionists are bastards.\"\n\nThe Liberty Bell replica Freedom Bell, American Legion, which stands across from the fountain, was completely covered in graffiti and red inverted triangles, according to Congressman Ryan Zinke. In a video posted to X, Zinke highlighted graffiti on the bell that said \"Abolish the USA.\"\n\nThe American flags that flew at Union Station were pulled down from their poles and replaced with Palestinian flags, according to a video posted on Instagram by the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM). Timcast News documented that the US flags were set on fire.\n\nCongressman Dan Crenshaw said on X that later that night he and other members of the house with the aid of the Capitol Police raised new American Flags in their stead. As the Palestinian flags were raised, PYM footage shows that an effigy of Netanyahu was set on fire. Next to the burning effigy, a flag emblazoned with the face of Hamas Izz ad-Din Al-Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu Obeida was waved, and nearby a sign proclaimed \"Bibi [Netanyahu] must hang.\"\n\nSome at the demonstration wore terrorist paraphernalia. One woman wore a Hamas headband over a keffiyeh. Fox News photographed a woman with a Hamas flag wearing a \"Umm Obeida\" headband in reference to the terrorist spokesman. On the shoulder of her camouflage jacket was the logo of the Al-Qassam brigade, and a pin with Abu Obeida's face in its lapel. Timcast News documented a protester marching through Washington with a Hezbollah flag.\n\n\"Netanyahu you will pay, resistance is the only way,\" chanted some demonstrators. \"There is only one solution, intifada revolution.\"\n\nThe protesters had surrounded and attempted to prevent entry of Netanyahu's motorcade to the Capitol.

The phrase \"Hamas is coming,\" written in all capital letters, was spray-painted on a monument, along with an upside-down red triangle, a symbol used by the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas when attacking Israeli targets.\n\n\"These images are deeply disturbing. The glorification of Hamas -- a terrorist organization backed by the Iranian regime and holding over a hundred hostages in Gaza -- is unacceptable and has no place in our country,\" US Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-NV) posted on Twitter/X on Wednesday as images of the protests began to emerge.\n\n\"F -- k Israel\" was also spray-painted at various spots in the US capital city.\n\nMeanwhile, video emerged on social media showing rioters attacking police officers and burning American flags. They also tore down the American flag in front of Union Station and replaced it with a Palestinian flag. They subsequently set the American flag on fire.\n\nOn Wednesday night, a group of Republican lawmakers -- including Speaker of the House Mike Johnson (R-LA) -- visited the spot where the American flag was burned and said the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nThe protests, which were sponsored by more than 15 organizations, had an explicitly pro-Hamas message.\n\nPosters handed out by the US Palestinian Community Network read, \"Resistance is justified when people are occupied. #AlAqsaFlood,\" referring to the name Hamas gave to its Oct. 7 attack, in which it led some 3,000 Palestinian terrorists in murdering 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages during an onslaught across southern Israel. The poster also includes a photo of armed men on a type of military vehicle.\n\nA number of Hamas flags were also seen at the protests. One woman, waving a Hamas flag, dressed as Abu Obeida, the alias of the spokesman for Hamas' military wing, with a red keffiyeh covering her face, a green headband, and a military jacket.\n\nAnother person, waving a black flag that has the words of the Islamic creed known as the Shahada on it -- traditionally understood to be the flag under which the Muslim prophet Muhammad began his conquests -- held a separate sign reading, \"Allah is gathering all the Zionists for the 'Final Solution.'\" The poster included a large bomb being exploded in the middle of an Israeli flag.\n\nEarlier this week, protesters gathered outside of the Watergate Hotel, where Netanyahu was staying while in Washington.\n\nVideo emerged of one person screaming, \"Jewish motherf -- kers. We're gonna kill all of you. We're gonna burn you. Allahu Akbar. Hamas!\" When the same man later saw a person with an Israeli flag, he confronted him, saying, \"Jewish coward motherf -- ker!\"\n\nThe Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM) released a video on Instagram saying protesters released maggots and crickets into the hotel where Netanyahu was staying. \"BON APPETIT!! MAGGOTS REPORTEDLY RELEASED ON THE CRIMINAL ZIONIST'S WAR TABLE!\" it wrote.\n\n\"Mealworms and maggots (not talking about Netanyahu) were reportedly left on their banquet tables, and crickets were released on multiple floors of the hotel,\" PYM continued. \"Fire alarms were triggered for over 30 minutes on multiple floors to ensure that there will be no rest before Netanyahu and Congress disgrace themselves in front of the world for failing to achieve any of their military and political objectives.\"\n\nThe Combat Antisemitism Movement (CAM) lambasted the demonstrators and called on US authorities to do more in response to what appeared to be outright hatred of both Jews and the Jewish state.\n\n\"These mobs were not pro anything; they were just filled with violent hate and rage, and many seemed to have a bloodlust for anything Jewish or Israeli,\" CAM CEO Sacha Roytman Dratwa said in a statement. \"They crossed all lines and now it is the responsibility of the US authorities to clamp down on them and take immediate and forceful action. Yesterday, the true face of terror in the US revealed itself.\"\n\nRoytman Dratwa argued the demonstrators' actions show they are not pro-Palestinian but anti-American and anti-Western, adding, \"Writing 'Hamas is coming' on an American national monument, is more than an idle threat; it is an aspiration, and they are openly calling for an Oct. 7-style massacre to take place in the US, inciting for genocide against Jews.\"", "source": {"uri": "algemeiner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Algemeiner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

During the 2023-24 college school year, agitators and student protesters flooded college campuses nationwide to protest the war in Israel, which also included spiking instances of antisemitism and Jewish students publicly speaking out that they did not feel safe on some campuses.\n\nAgitators on Columbia University's campus, for example, took over the school's Hamilton Hall building, while schools such as UCLA, Harvard and Yale worked to clear spiraling student encampments where protesters demanded their elite schools completely divest from Israel.\n\nPROTESTERS CHANT 'FREE PALESTINE' AS NETANYAHU ADDRESSES CONGRESS\n\nFlorida Republican Rep. Carlos Gimenez told Fox News Digital on Thursday that the chaos unfolding on the streets of Washington, D.C., \"lies squarely on the shoulders of those in power who failed to act,\" including Democrats and college officials who did not end or condemn the protests earlier this year as they turned violent and chaotic.\n\n\"Since October 7, the Biden administration and woke university administrators across America have refused to take action and shut down these antisemitic, pro-Hamas riots. Their inaction led to one of the most reprehensible riots on Capitol Hill during PM Netanyahu's address,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Rioters attacked police officers, defaced our monuments, set American flags ablaze, and wreaked havoc in Washington, DC, all while spreading antisemitic canards. This chaos lies squarely on the shoulders of those in power who failed to act.\"\n\nHARRIS BOYCOTTS NETANYAHU, SNUBS ISRAELI LEADER'S WARTIME ADDRESS TO GIVE SORORITY SPEECH\n\n\"What happened yesterday is not free speech; it's free hate. This is just a glimpse of what's to come. Universities across the nation are in danger of becoming pro-Hamas dumpster fires as students return to campus this upcoming semester.\"\n\nThe White House condemned the protests Wednesday evening, calling the chaos \"disgraceful.\"\n\n\"Identifying with evil terrorist organizations like Hamas, burning the American flag, or forcibly removing the American flag and replacing it with another, is disgraceful,\" White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a comment to Fox News Digital Wednesday evening.\n\n'CHICKENS FOR KFC': NETANYAHU RIPS CEASE-FIRE ACTIVISTS IN SPEECH TO CONGRESS AS TLAIB SILENTLY PROTESTS\n\n\"Antisemitism and violence are never acceptable. Period. Every American has the right to peaceful protest. But shamefully, not everyone demonstrated peacefulness today.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who is now the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee after President Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday, did not condemn the protests until late Thursday morning. Harris also notably was not in attendance during Netanyahu's address to Congress on Wednesday.\n\nEarlier this month, as speculation mounted Biden would drop out of the race, Harris told The Nation that she understands \"the emotion behind\" the anti-Israel protests that raged on college campuses.\n\n\"They are showing exactly what the human emotion should be, as a response to Gaza,\" Harris told the progressive magazine. \"There are things some of the protesters are saying that I absolutely reject, so I don't mean to wholesale endorse their points. But we have to navigate it. I understand the emotion behind it.\"\n\nWHITE HOUSE CONDEMNS PRO-HAMAS AGITATORS IN DC: 'DISGRACEFUL'\n\nHarris was notably cited by the media and White House sources late last year as urging Biden and the administration to be \"tougher\" on Netanyahu as war raged, allegedly arguing the White House needed to be more sympathetic toward Palestinians.\n\n\"Kamala Harris' embarrassing snub of @netanyahu's Joint Address to Congress was a stunt to appease the pro-Hamas base of the Democrat Party that just burned American flags, clashed with police, and spread dangerous pro-terror chaos and violence. Why won't Kamala disavow these antisemitic terrorist sympathizers?\" New York Rep. Elise Stefanik posted to her X account of Harris.\n\nIsrael has become a lightning rod for the Democratic Party since October, with the party's progressive faction, including members of the \"Squad,\" coming under fierce condemnation from the Jewish community and conservatives for not taking harder stances against Hamas.\n\nOn Wednesday, Netanyahu addressed Congress to discuss his nation's ongoing war against Hamas after the terrorist group launched attacks on Israel in October. During the speech, \"Squad\" member Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., held up a sign that said \"war criminal\" while listening to Netanyahu's speech.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister tore into the protesters amid his speech in the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\"I have a message for these protesters. When the tyrants of Tehran, who hang gays from cranes and murder women for not covering their hair, are praising, promoting and funding you, you have officially become Iran's useful idiots,\" Netanyahu said.\n\n\"Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming gays for Gaza. They might as well hold up signs saying 'Chickens for KFC.' These protesters chant 'From the river to the sea.' But many don't have a clue what river and what sea they're talking about.\"\n\nThe protesters in the nation's capital on Wednesday held signs reading \"Wanted War Criminal,\" alongside depictions of Nentanyahu, while others chanted \"Free Palestine\" and \"From the river to the sea....\"\n\nOther protesters yelled at the swath of police officers on the scene, \"You're a b----.\" Fox News witnessed pepper spray being used at one point.\n\nSTEFANIK GRILLS HARVARD PRESIDENT OVER STUDENTS CALLING FOR 'INTIFADA,' RAMPANT ANTISEMITISM ON CAMPUS\n\n\"I am deeply disturbed by the anti-Israel protests that we saw on college campuses this past year and again this week in our nation's capital,\" Jewish influencer Lizzy Savetsky told Fox News Digital on Thursday of the protests. \"The so-called 'peaceful protesters' are burning American flags and displaying the flag of Hamas, a terrorist organization that slaughtered 1,200 innocent civilians on October 7th and took hundreds hostage. Such actions are beyond the scope of reasonable dialogue; they represent support for a group that oppresses both Israelis and Palestinians and rejects any pursuit of peace. Endorsing Hamas is not a stand for justice but an embrace of tyranny and oppression. We must stand unwaveringly against hatred and antisemitism in our society.\"\n\nSUSAN SARANDON JOINS ANTI-ISRAEL PROTEST AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY MONTHS AFTER BEING DROPPED BY TALENT AGENCY\n\nConservative lawmakers and political leaders, including former President Trump, have long stood against the anti-Israel protests and rising antisemtism that unfolded on college campuses this year.\n\nThe House Committee on Education and the Workforce held hearings late last year, when they grilled leaders from some of the nation's most elite universities, including the University of Pennsylvania, MIT, Harvard and Northwestern.\n\n\"Isn't it true that a Jewish student wearing a yarmulke was spat on,\" Stefanik said to Northwestern University President Michael Schill in May, before asking how long Schill anticipates campus investigations will last regarding instances of antisemitism on campus.\n\nANTI-ISRAEL YALE PROTESTERS JOINING COLUMBIA STUDENTS IN 'TEAR DOWN OUR SOCIETY' IVY LEAGUE MOVEMENT: LAW PROF\n\n\"I'm not going to be able to tell you that.

The pair of administrators resigned from their positions shortly after the hearing, amid widespread backlash for waffling on whether calls for the genocide of Jews violated their respective schools' codes of conduct.\n\nFox News Digital's Liz Elkind, Brie Stimson and Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emma_colton@foxnews.com", "name": "Emma Colton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flag of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antisemitism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Zionism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_A._Gim\u00e9nez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carlos A.

Protesters have said that Israel's response has been disproportionate and led to mass civilian casualties.\n\nBut at least one demonstrator, whose face was covered, was spotted by Fox News carrying what appeared to be the flag of the terrorist group Hamas, while others were heard shouting \"allahu Akbar.\"\n\nAt Union Station, agitators burned an American flag and vandalized a Christopher Columbus statue with the words \"Hamas is coming.\" They also took down an American flag and flew the Palestinian flag instead.\n\nThe crowds also chanted \"Free Palestine\" and \"From the river to the sea...,\" an antisemitic phrase that calls for the elimination of the state of Israel.\n\nPROTESTERS CHANT 'FREE PALESTINE' AS NETANYAHU ADDRESSES CONGRESS\n\nIn his remarks, Netanyahu took aim at \"many anti-Israel protesters\" who he said \"choose to stand with evil.\"\n\n\"They stand with Hamas. They stand with rapists and murderers. They stand with people who came into the kibbutzim, into a home, the parents hid the children, the two babies, in the attic, in a secret attic. They murdered the family, the parents, they found the secret latch to the hidden attic and then they murdered the babies,\" he said. \"These protesters stand with them. They should be ashamed of themselves.\"\n\nHours later, as images emerged of the anti-Israel protests in Washington, D.C., Murphy condemned the pro-Hamas support he was seeing.\n\nHARRIS BOYCOTTS NETANYAHU, SNUBS ISRAELI LEADER'S WARTIME ADDRESS TO GIVE SORORITY SPEECH\n\n\"I've seen some disturbing images coming out of today's protests at the Capitol.

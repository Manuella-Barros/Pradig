For Forbes' methodology, researchers removed the eight classic Ivy League institutions (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown, Penn, Columbia, Dartmouth and Cornell) as well as the ''Ivy-plus yardstick'': Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Duke University and the University of Chicago.\n\nThe Forbes' researchers said the evaluation came as the traditional Ivy League institutions have ''faced a barrage of complaints in recent years'' related to admissions policies, grade inflations at several elite schools and university officials' responses to on-campus protests regarding the Israel-Hamas War.\n\nFrom there, Forbes evaluated schools with a minimum of 4,000 students to even out comparisons between smaller liberal arts schools and larger research universities. Forbes then analysed schools with high standardized test scores and a minimum of 50 percent of school applicants submitting them for admission considerations.\n\nThe researchers also used an admissions rate threshold of 20 percent or below for private institutions and 50 percent or below for public schools. After receiving a final list of 42 schools, Forbes spoke with hiring manager respondents about each one to see which schools' students rose to the top of prospective employers' priority lists.\n\nUT sits with an undergraduate student population just below 40,000, with a 31 percent acceptance rate. Over at Rice, the private Houston university has an undergraduate enrollment just over 4,200, with a 9 percent acceptance rate.\n\nIn the 50th percentile for SAT and ACT scores, UT's admitted students earned an average 1370 on the SAT and a 30 for the ACT. An estimated 85 percent of prospective students also submitted those scores for admission considerations.\n\nAt Rice, admitted students earned an average 1540 on the SAT and 35 on the ACT, when looking at 50th percentile figures. Among its prospective students, 76 percent of them submitted those test scores as part of their applications.\n\nRice has long been considered an Ivy League school of the south. With an acceptance rate of only 8.7 percent, the private research university located in Houston is extremely selective. According to the US News & World Report, half the applicants admitted to Rice who submitted test scores reported SAT scores between 1490 and 1570, or ACT scores between 34 and 36.\n\nUT Austin is one of the largest universities in the nation with an acceptance rate of 31 percent and average ACT score between 29 and 34. UT Austin is ranked 32 on U.S. News & World Report's list of Best National Universities.\n\nUT Austin has been in the spotlight lately during on-campus protests that resulted in dozens of arrests over the war in Gaza as students ask the school to divest in companies that support Israel as well as a statewide ban on diversity, equity and inclusion resources that resulted in the school laying off about 50 employees and shutting down DEI offices.\n\nBelow is the full list of Forbes' new Ivy League schools.\n\nPublic Schools : Binghamton University, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Florida, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of Maryland-College Park.\n\nUniversity of Michigan-Ann Arbor, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, University of Texas-Austin, University of Virginia, University of Wisconsin-Madison Private schools: Boston College, Carnegie Mellon University, Emory University, Georgetown University, Johns Hopkins University, Northwestern

Conversely, 42% of respondents indicated they are more likely to hire public university graduates than five years ago.\n\nHiring managers are increasingly turning to these 20 public and private institutions for graduates who are better prepared to enter the workforce.

They are not just technically skilled, but ready to innovate, to craft new solutions, to lead and to collaborate in solving complex problems.\"\n\nTo compile the lists, Forbes analyzed 2022 admissions data for 1,743 colleges with at least 4,000 students and an admission rate of 50% or below.

UT Austin and Rice University are not Ivy League schools. The Ivy League is an athletic conference consisting of eight private universities in the Northeastern United States. The members are Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, and Yale University. | Education", "body": "Two Texas schools -- University of Texas (UT), in Austin and Rice University in Houston -- have joined the ranks of Ivy League institutions, according to Forbes.\n\nThe two institutions are ''attracting the smartest students and plaudits from employers''.\n\nThe development comes as a piece of great news for Indian international students who are enrolled in large numbers in these two Texas schools, especially after India surpassed China as top source of International graduate students recently, according to Open Doors Report. For Forbes' methodology, researchers removed the eight classic Ivy League institutions (Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Brown, Penn, Columbia, Dartmouth and Cornell) as well as the ''Ivy-plus yardstick'': Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Duke University and the University of Chicago.\n\nThe Forbes' researchers said the evaluation came as the traditional Ivy League institutions have ''faced a barrage of complaints in recent years'' related to admissions policies, grade inflations at several elite schools and university officials' responses to on-campus protests regarding the Israel-Hamas War.\n\nFrom there, Forbes evaluated schools with a minimum of 4,000 students to even out comparisons between smaller liberal arts schools and larger research universities. Forbes then analysed schools with high standardized test scores and a minimum of 50 percent of school applicants submitting them for admission considerations.\n\nThe researchers also used an admissions rate threshold of 20 percent or below for private institutions and 50 percent or below for public schools. After receiving a final list of 42 schools, Forbes spoke with hiring manager respondents about each one to see which schools' students rose to the top of prospective employers' priority lists.\n\nUT sits with an undergraduate student population just below 40,000, with a 31 percent acceptance rate. Over at Rice, the private Houston university has an undergraduate enrollment just over 4,200, with a 9 percent acceptance rate.\n\nIn the 50th percentile for SAT and ACT scores, UT's admitted students earned an average 1370 on the SAT and a 30 for the ACT. An estimated 85 percent of prospective students also submitted those scores for admission considerations.\n\nAt Rice, admitted students earned an average 1540 on the SAT and 35 on the ACT, when looking at 50th percentile figures. Among its prospective students, 76 percent of them submitted those test scores as part of their applications.\n\nRice has long been considered an Ivy League school of the south. With an acceptance rate of only 8.7 percent, the private research university located in Houston is extremely selective. According to the US News & World Report, half the applicants admitted to Rice who submitted test scores reported SAT scores between 1490 and 1570, or ACT scores between 34 and 36.\n\nUT Austin is one of the largest universities in the nation with an acceptance rate of 31 percent and average ACT score between 29 and 34. UT Austin is ranked 32 on U.S. News & World Report's list of Best National Universities.\n\nUT Austin has been in the spotlight lately during on-campus protests that resulted in dozens of arrests over the war in Gaza as students ask the school to divest in companies that support Israel as well as a statewide ban on diversity, equity and inclusion resources that resulted in the school laying off about 50 employees and shutting down DEI offices.\n\nBelow is the full list of Forbes' new Ivy League schools.\n\nPublic Schools : Binghamton University, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Florida, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of Maryland-College Park.\n\nUniversity of Michigan-Ann Arbor, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, University of Texas-Austin, University of Virginia, University of Wisconsin-Madison Private schools: Boston College, Carnegie Mellon University, Emory University, Georgetown University, Johns Hopkins University, Northwestern University, Rice University, University of Notre Dame, University of Southern California, Vanderbilt University.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

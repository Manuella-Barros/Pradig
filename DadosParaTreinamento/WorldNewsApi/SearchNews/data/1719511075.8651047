{"id": 223735816, "title": "Martine Croxall back on BBC News after discrimination claims", "text": "Martine Croxall has returned to BBC News following her launching a tribunal claim against her employers. The presenter, 55, has previously alleged along with other senior female BBC journalists Kasia Madera, Annita McVeigh and Karin Giannone that they were kept off air for a year after they were snubbed for chief presenter roles following the merger of the BBC\u2019s News and World News channels. Announcing her return, Croxall wrote on X, formerly Twitter, saying: \u201cYa\u2019ll ready for this? Back on #BBCNews at 1100 BST.\u201d The presenter, who has worked for the BBC since October 1991 and been a chief presenter with the BBC News Channel and BBC World News since 2001, shared the message along with a video of her in the studio saying: \u201cNow, where were we?\u201d Croxall, who has also appeared on BBC One network news bulletins, previously spent nearly two weeks off air in 2022 over claims she had showed bias when Boris Johnson pulled out of the Conservative leadership contest. She said she was \u201cgleeful\u201d while presenting an edition of the former The Papers programme, and while responding to a guest\u2019s joke aimed at the former Prime Minister, she said: \u201cI shouldn\u2019t probably (laugh). I\u2019m probably breaking some terrible due impartiality rule by giggling.\u201d Croxall was congratulated by Madera, who returned earlier this month, Giannone and McVeigh, who came back to work on March 18. \u201cGreat to see my friend and colleague @MartineBBC back on @BBCNews,\u201d Madera wrote. Giannone called it a \u201ctreat\u201d and wrote: \u201cAs soon as the leg mends, I\u2019ll be there too.\u201d Earlier this month, the journalists were seen together as they attended preliminary hearings for their discrimination claims at the Central London Employment Tribunal. Croxall, McVeigh and Madera allege discrimination on the grounds of age, sex, being a union member and wages. Giannone alleges discrimination based on age, sex and wages. The women claim they have been left to suffer victimisation, harassment and reputational damage. At a preliminary hearing, the journalists, who had previously reached settlements with the broadcaster, were told they would not be able to bring a claim for equal pay. A BBC spokesman said: \u201cWe are pleased with the result and that the tribunal has accepted our position. \u201cWe will not be commenting further at this stage.\u201d It is believed that the BBC\u2019s position is that it had complied with equal pay legislation, and applied a rigorous and fair recruitment process, and that all managers conducted that process properly. The women were given the go-ahead to have their cases heard jointly.", "summary": "She has worked for the BBC since October 1991, and been a chief presenter with the BBC News Channel and BBC World News since 2001.", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/bbc-news-twitter-prime-minister-carrie-gracie-london-b1160324.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/05/26/15/0b5630957757a334ff1dcb55fef5c688Y29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE2ODE4NzYx-2.76035548.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:54:12", "author": "Charlotte McLaughlin", "authors": ["Charlotte McLaughlin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.482}

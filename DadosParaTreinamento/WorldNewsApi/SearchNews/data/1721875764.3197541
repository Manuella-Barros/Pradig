Beyond the world of boxing, AJ is known to be a fiercely private man for whom loyalty to family is of paramount importance. He grew up as one of seven children living between his mum's house and his dad's place. In various interviews he spoke fondly about his mother Yeta Odusanya, and his son, JJ. Soon after his career took off, he bought a place for his mum to live in. \u201cWhen you step up as a man in the house, freedom is making sure your parents are taken care of as well,\" he told the BBC. \"For me, that\u2019s freedom knowing that no matter where I am in the world, my mum\u2019s happy, she\u2019s taken care of.\" Joshua says he has \"always kept boxing out\" away from his family, adding that he is a father and son first. Would he like his son to enter the ring? He has previously said he did not envisage that life for his \"little JJ\", wanting his son to be the \"best man that he can be\" instead. Speaking to Desert Island Discs, Joshua revealed that his views about his son\u2019s future had not changed. He said he would tell JJ to \"do the best you can do\", when advising him about what he wanted to be when he was older. \"If I was to choose [a career] for him, I would ask him to probably look at accountancy because I think it\u2019s good to understand numbers,\" he said. But what about his own future? Does he plan to retire? There are no plans for retirement yet, but he said that when he eventually leaves the sport he would like to start a care home for retired boxers with poor health. \u201cThat would be part of my boxing legacy, that I gave something back to the sport that made me,\" he said. \"I know I\u2019m not going to be in the hot-seat for all my life, so I have to make smart decisions while the iron\u2019s hot.\u201d Desert Island Discs was recorded on Friday 12 April 2024.", "summary": "The British champion tells BBC's Desert Island Discs he is not too keen on his son, JJ, entering the ring.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cxeezexv42zo", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/bc43/live/e6a73b20-2fff-11ef-97a3-b9fc9fdbba57.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 00:07:16", "author": "Lipika Pelham And Hollie Cole", "authors": ["Lipika Pelham And Hollie Cole"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.307}

I don't think it's really sunk in yet.\"\n\nOn an occasion all about Anderson, the stars (and dark clouds) had aligned to present what seemed the perfect conditions to end a legendary career with one final mesmeric spell.\n\nSeldom do home crowds cheer quite so loudly when England win the toss and choose to field, but the Lord's spectators recognised the grey sky and floodlights were prime Jimmy material.\n\nThere was a moving tribute video played on the big screen to England's all-time leading wicket-taker, he led his team out for the national anthems and the entire Anderson family were on hand to ring the five-minute bell.\n\nBut this stage would not be filled by a greatest hits set, rather a thrilling debut album, one that will be music to the ears of the England hierarchy following the decision to pull Anderson from the dancefloor.\n\nNot for one second is anyone trying to claim Atkinson is a better bowler than Anderson now, or that he will be in the future.\n\nEngland, though, have nailed their colours to pace, consistently telling us that Test bowlers are most likely to be successful when they get up above 85mph.\n\nAnd, for all of the encouragement offered to Anderson and Chris Woakes in the early going, West Indies openers Kraigg Brathwaite and Mikyle Louis were relatively untroubled by bowling in the low 80s.\n\nThat all changed when Atkinson pushed down the slope at the Pavilion End in the 11th over. Quick steps, short delivery stride, high arm. His first delivery hit 89mph and his second, at 88mph, drew the usually obdurate Brathwaite into a wild hack and a drag-on to the stumps.\n\n\"I just wanted to get it down there in a good area. It wasn't exactly where I wanted to bowl it, but it came off well, so I can't complain,\" said Atkinson.\n\n\"It was a bit of relief and nice to get the first one out of the way quickly.\"\n\nAtkinson's average speed of 87.86 in that opening over is the second-fastest by an England bowler since such data has been measured, bettered only by Steven Finn in Bangladesh in 2010.\n\nSlippery and skiddy, Atkinson made light of the slow pitch with a full length and a scrambled seam. In his third over, he added the wicket of Kirk McKenzie, drawn into an edge to second slip. Overall, his opening spell of five overs contained four maidens and the two runs he did concede were from a misfield.\n\nTellingly it was Atkinson, rather than Anderson, who was asked to begin proceedings after lunch, a decision repaid with a spectacular triple-wicket maiden.\n\nAlick Athanaze poked to first slip and a squared-up Jason Holder was held at third for a golden duck. Joshua da Silva prevented Atkinson becoming only the fourth man to take a hat-trick on Test debut, but next ball inside-edged to give Smith his first catch as a Test keeper.\n\nBy this point, Atkinson had become the fifth England debutant to take a five-wicket haul in the two years Ben Stokes has been captain, following just two in the 13 previous years.\n\nAfter Alzarri Joseph chipped to mid-on and Shamar Joseph got in an ugly tangle to be caught at backward point, Atkinson finished with 7-45, the best figures by an England bowler on Test bow since Dominic Cork on the same ground against the same opponents in 1995.\n\nWhen Anderson trapped last man Jayden Seales lbw to leave West Indies 121 all out, the crowd sang Jimmy's name, but it was Atkinson who led England from the field.\n\nThose who know Atkinson say he is quiet, to the point of being shy. After he showed his well-earned match ball to the crowd as they applauded him off, he dropped it.\n\nHis father Ed was in the Lord's Long Room, just as he was in the team huddle for the cap presentation at the beginning of the day, alongside Atkinson's brother, sister and aunt. His mother Caroline passed away after a car crash four years ago.\n\n\"He's a big cricket fan, to make him proud and my family proud is very special,\" said Atkinson. \"Walking through the Long Room at the end and seeing him there was pretty cool.\"\n\nAt 26, Atkinson is something of a late developer. He did not make his Surrey debut until the age of 22 and this is his first first-class match at Lord's.\n\n\"Gus Atkinson looks the real deal,\" said former England captain Michael Vaughan. \"He bowled with good zip and pace at the first time of asking.\n\n\"We know England are looking for pace. If you want to win a five-match series against India or Australia, you're probably going to need five quicks that you can rotate.\n\n\"The hope for England by next summer is that they've got a group of bowlers that you don't know who you're going to leave out.\"\n\nLife comes at you fast. Very soon Anderson will be England's past. Atkinson has made a speedy claim to be a big part of their future.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

England reached 3-189 at the close, Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope making half-centuries as they established a first-day lead of 68.\n\nWhen the West Indies were nine down, with Atkinson bowling, the seamer was one wicket from securing the best figures by any Test debutant. But a couple of boundaries meant Albert Trott's 8-43 for Australia against England in Adelaide in 1895 remains supreme. Indeed, so does Dominic Cork's England-best 7-43 against the West Indies at Lord's a century later.\n\nInstead it was Anderson who claimed the last wicket, that of Jayden Seales, to the biggest cheer of the day. That took Anderson, who will be 42 later this month, to 701 wickets in his 22-year Test career, a tally eclipsed only by Warne and Muttiah Muralitharan.\n\n\"I was a bit nervous this morning, I woke up and all I could think about was the day ahead.

Before play the five-minute bell on the balcony of the pavilion was rung by his daughters Ruby and Lola with his parents and wife alongside.\n\nWest Indies, however, refused to play along and had reached 0-34 without alarm when Anderson left the attack. But they were soon 3-43 with Atkinson taking two and top scorer Mikyle Louis (27) dismissed by skipper Ben Stokes.\n\nAlick Athanaze (23) and Kavem Hodge (24) added 40 but when Atkinson parted them the tourists collapsed, losing 7-33 with Atkinson taking three wickets in four balls at one point. England were aided by superb catching, notably by Harry Brook and Pope.\n\nThe tourists, who had only one warm-up match, fielded less well, Crawley escaping a run out before he had scored and Ben Duckett dropped on one. The latter perished soon after but Crawley took advantage, making 76. Pope also scored 57 as England built the platform for a commanding first-innings lead.", "source": {"uri": "theroar.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Roar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Anderson_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "James Anderson (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lord's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_Warne", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shane Warne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Seales", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Seales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_cricket_team_in_the_West_Indies_in_2020\u201321", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sri Lankan cricket team in the West Indies in 2020\u201321"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Pope", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Cork", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominic Cork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zak_Crawley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zak Crawley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muttiah_Muralitharan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muttiah Muralitharan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Century (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adelaide"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adelaide"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Duckett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Duckett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kavem_Hodge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kavem Hodge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brook", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Brook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Stokes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ben Stokes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alick_Athanaze", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alick Athanaze"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Electronics_and_Electrical/Safety_and_Compliance_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Electronics and Electrical/Safety and Compliance Testing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Statistics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn4.theroar.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2161458731-1-1200x675.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722696", "eventUri": "eng-9722696", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Four overs later, he took two wickets in three balls as his team-mates and the spectators roared in jubilation.\n\nIt was a scene Atkinson admitted he \"couldn't have even dreamt of\" when he was presented with his cap from Surrey team-mate Ollie Pope alongside his family in the huddle.\n\n\"I was trying to keep as level as possible before and my dad kept saying it was the biggest day of my life,\" he said after the close of play.\n\n\"I had to tell him to relax because I was trying not to think like that.

He also sits at the top of that list for the quickest Englishman to achieve the feat, doing it in 53 balls.\n\nEarlier this summer, England's managing director Rob Key said he would prioritise bowlers who could offer pace as opposed to taking wickets, but Atkinson did both.\n\nHe finished with the third-best figures for an Englishman on Test debut, conceding two runs more than pace bowler Dominic Cork, who took 7-43, also against West Indies, in 1995.\n\nAtkinson picked up a wicket with his second ball as he induced a bottom-edge from West Indies' most experienced Test batter and captain, Kraigg Brathwaite (six) which cannoned onto the stumps for England's breakthrough.\n\nHe started the day bowling cross-seam deliveries but with the pitch drier than expected, he switched to a tighter wobble seam which distributed the left-handers in particular with Kirk McKenzie (one) and Alick Athanaze (23) getting a thick outside edge to Zak Crawley and Jamie Smith respectively.\n\n\"My stock ball is that scrambled seam, it felt like today, bowling with the slope, bowling from the Pavilion End, that was my most dangerous ball,\" Atkinson added.\n\n\"I was targeting fourth stump and trying to run it down the hill and with the left-handers I was trying to push it across them with the odd in-swinger. I felt like that was the best way I could get wickets.\n\n\"The seam was probably a bit more scrambled than I'd like but that is something I can work on.\n\n\"I feel like I can bowl quicker and hit the pitch harder when I bowl scrambled seam and it's worked pretty well for me in the past.\"\n\nHaving only played 21 first-class games prior to his Test debut, Atkinson proved England's scouting system to be a success, a method that uses and prioritises technology above in-person selection.\n\nThe same apparatus was used to discover Somerset's off-spinner Shoaib Bashir, who, like Atkinson, starred on his debut in India earlier this year, leading him to be re-selected for this Test.\n\nWhat Atkinson does with the ball, Harry Brook (25no) does with the bat. The 25-year-old, who missed the India tour due to personal reasons, returned to the Test fold for the first time since appearing at The Oval against Australia in 2023. The Yorkshireman made an extraordinary start to his own Test career, amassing 809 runs in his first six appearances for England, and looks in good stead to carry England further with the bat.\n\nWith James Anderson bowing out after the Lord's Test, there is a changing of the guard as Stokes' side look to prepare for The Ashes in 2025, and it is a side which seems not only safe but promising at the hands of England's youngsters.\n\nWatch day two of the first Test between England and West Indies live on Sky Sports Cricket from 10.15am on Thursday (11am first ball).\n\nStream Sky Sports live with no contract on a Month or Day membership on NOW.

out the tourists for 121 on day one of the first test at Lord's.\n\nJoe Root was not out on 15 with Harry Brook on 25, after boundary-studded innings of 76 from Zak Crawley and 57 from Ollie Pope put the home side ahead on an overcast day.\n\nEarlier, England fast bowler Atkinson took seven wickets for 45 runs while James Anderson, playing in his 188th and final test before retirement, claimed his 701st wicket as the hosts dismissed the West Indies in just under 42 overs.\n\nAtkinson took three wickets in four balls at one point, just missing out on a hat-trick, and recorded the best figures by an Englishman on debut since Dominic Cork's seven for 43, also against the West Indies, in 1995.\n\nAnderson meanwhile is third on the all-time test wicket-takers list and needs seven more to join Australian Shane Warne (708) in second place behind Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan (800).\n\nMikyle Louis, the first man from the island of St Kitts to play test cricket for the West Indies, was his side's top scorer with 27 in an otherwise forgettable innings for the tourists.\n\nAtkinson claimed the wicket of the visitors' captain Kraigg Brathwaite (6) with his second ball and dismissed left-hander Kirk McKenzie for one soon after.\n\nLouis then became Ben Stokes' 199th test wicket, putting the England skipper one short of an all-rounder's double of 200 wickets and 6,000 test runs, a feat only before achieved by West Indian Garry Sobers and South Africa's Jacques Kallis.\n\nWith successive balls Atkinson removed Alick Athanaze for 23 and Jason Holder, back in the touring side's squad after nearly a year away, for a golden duck.\n\nTwo balls later, Atkinson had Joshua da Silva caught behind by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith for a duck, leaving the West Indies in deep trouble on 88 for six.\n\nChris Woakes took his 150th test wicket when he removed Kavem Hodge for 24, and Atkinson dismissed Alzarri Joseph (17) and Shamar Joseph for another duck before Anderson brought the West Indies innings to a close with the wicket of Jayden Seales on two.\n\nIn reply, England lost Ben Duckett (3) early to the bowling of Seales before Pope and Crawley began hitting 11 and 14 fours respectively that took England past the Windies total.\n\nPope was eventually trapped leg before wicket by Holder, and four overs later Seales ripped Crawley's stumps out of the ground with a perfect yorker, bringing Brook to the wicket to join Root.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Reuters)\n\nGus Atkinson stole the spotlight from England great James Anderson's farewell by taking a sensational seven wickets on his Test debut as the West Indies collapsed to 121 all out on the opening day at Lord's.\n\nEngland then consolidated their advantage to be 189-3 at stumps, a lead of 58 runs, with Zak Crawley (76) and Ollie Pope (57) both making fluent fifties.\n\nThe build-up to the first of this three-match series had centred on the retiring Anderson's last international appearance following a record-breaking Test career that has now yielded 701 wickets - the most by any fast bowler at this level.\n\nBut it was 26-year-old quick Atkinson who took centre stage instead with a remarkable haul of 7-45 in 12 overs - including a triple wicket-maiden.\n\nAtkinson's final figures, after he accounted for Alzarri Joseph and Shamar Joseph, were the second best by an England bowler on a Test debut behind Dominic Cork's 7-43 against the West Indies at Lord's in 1995.\n\nAnderson, by contrast, did not add to his tally of Test wickets until he had last man Jayden Seales lbw to end the West Indies innings.\n\nWest Indies debutant Mikyle Louis, the first Test cricketer from St Kitts, top-scored with 27 in an innings where only three batsmen made it into the 20s.\n\nHaving played just one warm-up match and with inexperienced top-order batsmen Kirk McKenzie, Alick Athanaze and Kavem Hodge holding only nine caps between them before this Test, the West Indies unsurprisingly struggled after losing the toss in overcast conditions.\n\nThey were 88-3 when Atkinson, who had already taken two wickets before lunch, came on to bowl the 35th over.\n\nWith his second ball of the over he had Athanaze caught by Joe Root in the slips for 23. Atkinson, maintaining a challenging line and length, then produced a superb delivery next ball that Holder, back after nearly a year out of Test cricket, edged to Harry Brook in the cordon.\n\nJoshua Da Silva survived the hat-trick but the following ball he too fell for a duck, an inside edge caught by opposing wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, who along with Surrey team-mate Atkinson was also making his Test debut.\n\nAtkinson had now taken three wickets for no runs in four balls, thereby securing his place on the Lord's honours board for a five-wicket haul in a Test.\n\nEarlier, Anderson was thrust straight into the action when England captain Ben Stokes opted to field after winning the toss - a decision greeted by huge cheers from the crowd at the 'Home of Cricket'.\n\nBut despite a probing new-ball spell of five overs for 11 runs, the 41-year-old Anderson was unable to dislodge either West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite or fellow opener Louis.\n\nWest Indies were looking to Brathwaite, appearing in his 90th Test, to make a significant score.\n\nBut he was out for two, chopping onto his stumps, as Atkinson struck with only his second ball Wednesday.\n\nLouis's promising 58-ball innings ended when the 23-year-old fell to a brilliant low catch by the diving Harry Brook at third slip off Stokes.\n\nWest Indies' plight was summed up when Hodge fell for 24 after a fierce square cut off Chris Woakes was well caught by Pope at point, the batsman sinking to his knees in disbelief. Crawley looked on course for a hundred before Seales bowled him with a rapid leg-stump yorker as an 89-ball innings, including 14 fours, came to a spectacular end.\n\nSCOREBOARDWest Indies 1st InningsK.

Gus Atkinson", "body": "New Delhi: England pacer Gus Atkinson shot to prominence in his maiden red-ball fixture for the Three Lions against the West Indies at Lord's in the first Test on Wednesday (July 10). The Surrey quick bagged figures of 7 for 45 to demolish the Men from Caribbean to a miniscule score of 121.\n\nAtkinson happened to record the second best figures by an English player on debut after Dominic Cork's 7 for 43 in 1995 at the same venue, interestingly it also came against the West Indies. The 26-year-old has displayed his credentials at the right time with legendary bowler James Anderson all set to retire from the game.\n\nIt would certainly be too early to name the successor of a player who has not done anything ordinary throughout his prolonged and storied career. In other words, the shoes are too big to fill. For now, we can consider Atkinson to be one of those pacers who can potentially lead the English attack down the line.\n\nAtkinson joined a list of bowlers who registered a five-wicket haul on Test debut ever since Ben Stokes took over the captaincy reins. Here we take a look at all five bowlers to have achieved a similar feat.\n\nAtkinson was brought into the attack after the new-ball pair of James Anderson and Chris Woakes failed to find the early breakthrough. The Surrey speedster didn't took long to breach the defences of West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite with a wide full length delivery pitched outside the off-stump.\n\nThe scrambled seam became his potent weapon in a spell that kept the Windies batters on their toes. In his second spell, he picked three wickets in the space of four deliveries, running through the feeble middle order. He ended up with seven scalps after bowling just 12 overs.\n\nThe left-arm spinner got his opportunity to play for The Three Lions in the absence of Jack Leach. It was an arduous task for England to defend 231 runs against Rohit Sharma and his men on their own soil but Hartley made things look effortless, though pulled-a-rabbit-out-of-hat-like-act. With the dismissals of top order batters like Rohit, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill, Hartley put India on backfoot before providing the finishing touches for England while claiming figures of 7 for 62 as England won by 28 runs.\n\nThe Worcestershire pacer went wicketless in the first innings where England bowled out Ireland for 172 on the first day but claimed 5 for 66 in the second innings despite the Irish batters showing dogged resistance. The most important dismissal of his spell was of Harry Tector, who looked promising on 51.\n\nAt the age of 18 years and 126 days, Rehan Ahmed became the youngest Test debutant for England. He ensured to make it further memorable by also becoming the youngest debutant to pick up a five-wicket haul in Test cricket on the third day of the Karachi Test against Pakistan. His 5 for 48 included the scalps of Babar Azam, Saud Shakeel, Mohammad Rizwan and Agha Salman as England swept the series in Pakistan by a 3-0 margin.\n\nBefore Rehan hogged the headlines in Karachi, Will Jacks showed his credentials in Rawalpindi, a flat track which offered nothing for the spinners. Jacks was expensive but kept Pakistan in check and balance with regular interventions.

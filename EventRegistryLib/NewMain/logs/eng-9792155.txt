Per the New York Post, McDowell, 21, was initially charged with theft on August 1, but authorities subsequently brought a murder charge against him the following day.\n\n\"Homicide Investigators charged Akili McDowell (21) with murder in the shooting death of Cesar Peralta (20). McDowell was recently taken into custody and booked into the Harris County Jail,\" Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez wrote in a Facebook post on August 3.\n\nGonzalez also said the investigation is ongoing and urged anyone with information about the fatal incident to contact authorities. McDowell's bond for the theft and murder crimes was set at $400,210.\n\nBesides Billions, McDowell also made a name for himself by starring in series including The Astronaut Wives Club and David Makes Man. McDowell was just 15 when he starred in OWN's David Makes Man.\n\nIn a 2015 interview with Oprah Winfrey, the 21-year-old touched on that series, saying that \"you can be something. You don't have to settle for what everybody may think you're going to be. You can work to be better. And you can be better.\"\n\nIn another interview with Vulture, he further touched on his character and how it was connected to his personal life. \"With David being raised by a single mother and him feeling like he had to be the man of the house at such an early age and make all these grown folks' decisions and things like that, I've also felt like that in my life,\" he said.\n\nHe continued: \"He just wants to be there for his mom. She doesn't gotta worry about David. That's what he wants. David's gonna do his job; David gonna get things done.

Over the weekend, the post was updated to reflect that McDowell, 21, was arrested in connection with the man's death and was being held on $400,000 bond.\n\nFurther details, such as motive or any other information about McDowell's connection to the deceased male have not been released. Witnesses reported that the deceased man had previously been having a disagreement with another man before he was shot, according to AP.\n\nMcDowell appeared in two episodes of Billions as Savion Williams, a young teenage boy who lives in Bobby Axelrod's childhood home, before going on to star in the titular role of the well-received David Makes Man, which ran for two seasons on the Oprah Winfrey Network, from 2019 to 2021.\n\nThe series was created by screenwriter and playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney, who won an Oscar in 2017 for writing the film Moonlight. In addition to Winfrey, actor Michael B. Jordan also served as a producer on David Makes Man.\n\nOprah interviewed McDowell for OWN TV early on in the series, which follows the young prodigy character as he tries to improve his circumstances and escape his neighborhood. McDowell echoed many of the show's inspirational themes in his own responses during the sit-down. \"You can be something,\" he said in the 2019 interview, \"You don't have to settle for what everybody may think you're gonna be.\"", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Makes_Man", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Makes Man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billions_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Billions (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Giamatti", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Giamatti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damian_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Damian Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harris County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moonlight (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarell_Alvin_McCraney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tarell Alvin McCraney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_B._Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael B.

{"id": 231247900, "title": "Brit dad's TUI holiday from hell as he arrives at \u00a38k Mexico hotel to 'no booking", "text": "A Brit dad's dream holiday to Mexico turned into a nightmare after the hotel confirmed he had \"no booking.\" Gerard Brodrick and his wife, Natalie, from Glasgow, forked out \u00a38,000 for a two-week stay at the luxury Moon Palace in Cancun. The couple made the pricy trip alongside their son Lennon, 11, after booking the getaway in the wake of missing a previous family holiday due to the pandemic. When they arrived on June 5, the family was told they were not welcome as they were informed TUI had \"failed to pay\" the resort for the family's stay. They were moved to another nearby hotel at half the price of their original booking. Gerard, 35, told The Daily Record: \"It has ruined our whole holiday and left it in tatters. When we arrived and were told there was no booking for us, I honestly thought my pals had paid Jeremy Beadle to wind me up and that he'd appear with a video camera - that is how bad this was. \"The staff were extremely rude and appeared to smirk at us and our situation. They told us that TUI had failed to pay for our booking and that if we wanted to stay, we'd have to pay in full - again.\" \"I couldn't believe it, we saved up 18 months for this. If we wanted to stay for the night, they were going to charge us $600 (\u00a3472).\" For three hours the family tried to discuss what had happened with hotel staff before TUI moved them to different accommodation. But before a taxi arrived to collect them, Gerard claims security staff threatened to chuck the family onto the streets, which left Lennon \"terrified.\" He added: \"At one point, they got three security guards to stand behind me and threatened to chuck us out if I continued to speak. My son was terrified, it's not exactly the safest place to chuck a family onto the street. The whole ordeal was horrific, we are heartbroken. It was meant to be the trip of a lifetime.\" The dad-of-one spent months searching for the perfect hotel for the getaway. In the meantime, the family will be expected to stay at their new hotel for the rest of their holiday. \"It might be the last holiday that our kid wants to come on with us before he turns into a teenager, so we wanted to go all out,\" he said. \"We genuinely booked this holiday for Moon Palace - it is the place to be in Cancun, it offers a premium family holiday and that's exactly what we wanted.\" Gerard continued: \"It had amazing reviews and is highly reputable, so it seemed like the perfect holiday for us. The hotel we have been moved to is fine but it isn't a patch on what we paid for and expected to get. \"The quality and prestige that Moon Palace offers just isn't here, it is really inferior in comparison. We paid for a jacuzzi in our room at Moon Palace and they obviously don't have that here. It's the detail we wanted. \"We're gutted and angry about the whole situation and it's left us pondering over what we can do to salvage this holiday.\" It has been reported that a small number of customers have been denied entry to Moon Palace due to a contract dispute with TUI. A TUI spokesperson said: \"We are so sorry to hear about our customer's experience in Cancun. Our goal is to ensure customers have the best possible experience, so this is not the way we wanted their holiday to start. Our destination team is working to get this resolved as quickly as possible.\"", "summary": "Gerard Brodrick, 35, from Glasgow, had his dream holiday turn into a nightmare when he and his family were moved to a nearby hotel despite forking out thousands of pounds on a plush hotel in Mexico", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/brit-dads-tui-holiday-hell-32988551", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32988611.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Gerard.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 13:29:36", "author": "Anders Anglesey,Anders-Anglesey", "authors": ["Anders Anglesey", "Anders-Anglesey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.859}

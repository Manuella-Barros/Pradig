{"id": 225047022, "title": "Kover meets Egyptian counterpart in Budapest", "text": "Hungary considers Egypt a key strategic partner in the Middle Eastern and north African regions with which it can maintain close cooperation as countries pursuing a foreign policy based on sovereign and national interests, Kover said, adding that the two countries were bound by their religious and cultural tolerance and respect for traditions and families. Kover said Hungary appreciated Egypt\u2019s role in stabilising the north African region, underlining that Europe\u2019s security began with north Africa. He said the world was facing a dangerous situation unlike any it had encountered before, adding that the world\u2019s leading politicians were unaware of this danger, and countries like Egypt and Hungary had to aim to have a bigger influence on global developments than the more powerful countries. Parliament\u2019s press office cited Gebali as saying that Egypt had made strenuous efforts to put a complete stop to the illegal migration waves heading towards Europe. He asked Hungary to support the recognition of and financial compensation for this scheme by the European Union during its upcoming presidency of the Council of the EU. Kover praised the two countries\u2019 economic relations, underlining that Hungarian exports to Egypt had grown 1.5-fold and bilateral trade turnover had more than doubled over more than a decade. Kover and Gebali hailed their countries\u2019 cooperation in agriculture, the defence industry and tourism and the manufacturing of joint Hungarian-Egyptian rolling stock as \u201csuccess stories\u201d. As regards the Russia-Ukraine war, the speakers said both their countries urged an immediate ceasefire and political talks. Gebali also said Egypt was making every possible effort to bring an end to the armed conflict in the Gaza Strip, and asked for Hungary\u2019s help in this, noting that it enjoyed good relations with both the Arab states and Israel.", "summary": "<p>You must be logged into the site to view this content.</p>", "url": "https://www.budapesttimes.hu/diplomacy/kover-meets-egyptian-counterpart-in-budapest/", "image": "https://www.budapesttimes.hu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fideszcongress_kover.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:09:25", "author": "Attila Leitner", "authors": ["Attila Leitner"], "language": "en", "source_country": "hu", "sentiment": 0.127}

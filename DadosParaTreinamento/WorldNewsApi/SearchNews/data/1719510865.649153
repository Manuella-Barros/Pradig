Staycations, which became the norm during the Covid pandemic, can offer just as much sun and fun as an international trip - not to mention they're often less stressful and more affordable. Summer is the ideal season to explore Britain's best beaches, so why not try a seaside town you've never visited before? TikTok creator and travel enthusiast @lotteboo3 took to the popular social media platform to highlight an \"underrated\" coastal gem. Southwold, described as a \"classic seaside town\", is located in Suffolk and offers all the elements Brits love about staycations, reports the Express. The town boasts two beaches, Southwold Pier Beach to the north and Southwold Denes Beach to the south. Visitors will find charming, multi-coloured beach huts lined up along the sand, adding pops of butter yellows, whites and blues to the landscape. The TikTok creator shared a video of an \"award-winning bakery\", brimming with sausage rolls, gingerbread men, croissants and a variety of pastries. She also showcased a \"cute lighthouse\" - an excellent backdrop for holiday snaps - and a stunning pier where holidaymakers can add their own plaques. The official Southwold Pier website features a Pier Plaque Creator, allowing visitors to personalise their own plaque as a \"great gift, a wonderful surprise or a memento of your visit\". Those who choose to holiday in Southwold can look forward to exploring the charming streets filled with colourful houses, browsing through unique independent shops, and indulging in classic seaside delights like ice cream. Lotte's TikTok video on Southwold garnered much attention with almost 32,000 likes and over 3,200 saves. With more than 1,000 sharing it with friends and seemingly planning their next vacation. The town's fans were quick to sing its praises in the comments section. User @Goodgriefisthatthetime said: \"Worked at scores of seaside towns all over the UK. By far the cleanest, well looked after.\" Laura Marsh chimed in with, \"We live down the road from Southwold, definitely one of our happy places. Great beer and fish and chips.\" Others described the coastal town as their \"happy place\", with Bethany sharing, \"I absolutely love it here I go every year, it's like a second home\". Caitlin Harvey also added her perspective by stating: \"Worked here for six years. Can't deny that it's actually a lovely place to visit.\"", "summary": "There an 'underrated' seaside town that's been labelled as 'a classic' and has been dubbed the UK's 'happiest place'.

From Dorit's PTSD from their 2021 home invasion to PK's constantly traveling for work, the two experienced their ups and downs in front of a camera.\n\nDuring the show's reunion episode in March, Dorit claimed that the two were able to turn things around.\n\n\"After we wrapped [filming], things got progressively worse,\" she confessed. \"And him and I were at probably an all-time bad.\" Dorit even revealed that PK once briefly stayed in a hotel, but denied the couple had ever lived \"separate lives.\"\n\nDespite \"struggling\" but \"working through things,\" she said that they were doing \"better than ever\" after he gave up alcohol to preserve their relationship.\n\n\"PK was drinking a lot and he's a drinker. I just think that its very difficult to have clear-headed conversations when he's drinking so much, so he gave up drinking,\" she smiled, adding that at the time of filming PK had been sober for \"49 days.\"\n\n\"That was a very pivotal moment, so things are -- knock on wood -- as good as they can possibly be,\" Dorit gushed.", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-kindergarten", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pre-kindergarten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorit_Kemsley", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dorit Kemsley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_Beverly_Hills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alcohol (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/6dHUmdX_ZQv_8QftNVNhZg0i3nI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(809x349:811x351)/Paul-Kemsley-and-Dorit-Kemsley-7cfe831f63f7490086b1808483949607.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554773", "eventUri": "eng-9554773", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 120, "textEnd": 125}, {"amb": false, "date": "2015-03-", "textStart": 985, "textEnd": 995}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

However, StyleCaster may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes.\n\nAnother day, another Bravo breakup. Ever since the news of their separation, Bravoholics have wondered why Dorit and PK broke up from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and whether anyone cheated before their split.\n\nDorit joined The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills as a Housewife in Season 7 in 2010. She replaced Housewife Yolanda Hadid, who left The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills after Season 6 following three seasons on the show. In an interview on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen in 2020, Dorit -- who married her husband, Paul \"PK\" Kemsley in 2015 -- denied that she and PK were divorcing.\n\n\"There was a rumor recently that PK was living at a friend's London guest house because your marriage was in trouble,\" host Andy Cohen asked Dorit. \"What do you make of that? I just saw PK before the show. He came in and said hi. I guess everything is OK.\"\n\nDorit responded, \"Yeah I mean Andy, PK and I. .. I think we were reading it together while we were in San Francisco. He said, the thing that bothered him the most wasn't even that there were divorce rumors, it was the fact that someone would think that he would live in someone's guest house.\"\n\nShe continued, \"He said, 'It's so far-fetched, it's ridiculous.' \"Because one person says it on some podcast and all of a sudden it somehow could be true. No fact checking? I don't even understand journalism today. Is it journalism?\"\n\nFour years later, Dorit and PK officially announced their separation after almost a decade of marriage. So why did Dorit and PK break up from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and did anyone cheat? Read on for what we know so far.\n\nWh ydid Dorit and PK break up from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills? Dorit and PK Kemsley announced that they had separated after nine years of marriage in a joint Instagram post on May 9, 2024.\n\n\"We as a couple have been subject to a lot of speculation about our marriage. We have had our struggles over the last few years and continue to work through them as two people who love each other and share two amazing children together,\" the statement read. \"To safe guard our deep friendship and maintain a harmonious environment for our children we have made the mutual and difficult decision to take some time apart and reevaluate our relationship while we prioritize our children, We appreciate your love and support while we continue to do the work necessary throughout this journey. With love, Dorit and PK.\"\n\nPrior to their separation announcement, The Daily Mail reported in April 2024 that Bravo planned to demote Dorit to a \"Friend of\" for the upcoming Season 14 of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills with only three confirmed episodes if she wasn't honest about her relationship with PK. \"She wants to be a full time cast member on the show, but she does not want to explain that she is on a break with PK and he has temporarily moved out of the house,\" the source said.\n\nThe insider continued, \"She really does not want to be seen as a single mother in Beverly Hills, because once you are labeled that you don't get invited to as many parties, you lose friends, you are an insider.\"\n\nThe source claimed that PK's relationships in Hollywood played a part in Dorit's decision to not separate from him sooner. \"He has a lot of celebrity friends and pull, so she doesn't want to lose him at the end of the day,\" the insider said. \"And it's not just about power. She also does not want the world to know she failed at her marriage.\"\n\nThe source continued, \"And the kids don't really know they are on a break either, they think papa has just taken some time away from the home for business. She worries about the kids.\"\n\nBefore she and PK confirmed their split, the source claimed that Dorit was still deciding on whether to go public with their relationship issues. \"Does she become a \"friend\" and try to repair her marriage in secret? Or does she spill the beans about her break with PK and expose all the ugly details and get a bigger part on her show?\" the source said. \"She loves PK so it's very hard for her. She wants to stay married to him.\"\n\nThe insider continued, \"He loves that she is fun and beautiful, she loves that he is business savvy and has a zillion friends.\"\n\nAs for the reason they split, Dorit revealed during The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 13 reunion in March 2024 that her relationship issues became worse after filming Season 12 of the reality TV series due in part to PK's drinking. 'After we wrapped [filming], things got progressively worse,\" she said. \"And him and I were at probably an all-time bad.\"\n\nDid PK cheat on Dorit? In a Season 13 episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in October 2023, Dorit's co-star, Sutton Stracke, claimed that there was a woman with PK the night he got into a DUI in November 2021. \"The only thing that I've ever heard about PK and Dorit was the night PK got pulled over for a DUI... he may have or may not have had a woman in the car with him. That's the only rumor I've ever heard,\" Sutton said. Dorit denied the PK cheating rumors on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 13, where she also slammed Sutton for publicizing the claim.\n\nDorit also denied rumors that she cheated on PK with her co-star Kyle Richards' estranged husband, Mauricio Umansky, in an interview with Entertainment Tonight in November 2023. \"We got word that they were going to release it, and I just... it's a rumor and it's hearsay, and we really wanted to shut it down because it's not true,\" she told Entertainment Tonight. \"I know how these things kind of build and grow.\"\n\nShe continued of her relationship with PK at the time, \"I spoke this season about the challenges that we've had, and we've had a difficult couple of years post-home invasion. I've been through a lot of stuff personally, and of course, it has affected our marriage. We've been very honest and open about it. I just wanted people to know, this is a rumor. We are not separated; we are not divorcing. We've had a difficult couple of years, and we are still working things out, but we are good.\"\n\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills is available to stream on Peacock.\n\nFor more on The Real Housewives, check out the 2021 book, Not All Diamonds and Rose: The Inside Story of The Real Housewives from the People Who Lived It .

Rather, we are focused on healing, making changes and doing the things that many couples have to do at some point in their marriage.\"\n\nThough expected, the potential demise of Dorit and PK would mean the second major RHOB couple to separate within the last year, following in the footsteps of Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky. Moving forward, my only wish is that we protect Dorit's son Jagger (and Phoenix) at all costs. That child is way too saintly to be on Housewives!", "source": {"uri": "thecut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Cut"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_leibert@thecut.com", "name": "Emily Leibert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-kindergarten", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pre-kindergarten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorit_Kemsley", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dorit Kemsley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_Beverly_Hills", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul's_Drag_Race_(season_13)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RuPaul's Drag Race (season 13)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravo_(American_TV_network)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bravo (American TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post-traumatic stress disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Richards", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Richards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/bbf/829/7d02bdc6238ac2509a8d59b64f9c46d890-dorit-and-pk-separation.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554773", "eventUri": "eng-9554773", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 452991257, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 25, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 25}}}

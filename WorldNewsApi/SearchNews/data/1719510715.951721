Madrid-born Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, 52, who is trans, accepted the Cannes best actress award on behalf of the other female members of the cast \u2013 Selena Gomez, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Adriana Paz. Spanish-language musical Emilia P\u00e9rez has been the talk of the Cannes Film Festival 2024 thanks to its dramatic story of Mexican drug wars, not to mention trans liberation. It received a 10-minute standing ovation at a screening earlier this week. The film follows the story of Mexico City lawyer Rita (Zoe Salda\u00f1a) who is hired by cartel leader Manitas (Karla Sofia Gasc\u00f3n) with the unusual request to help Manitas flee Mexico with her children and wife, Jessi (Selena Gomez) in order to seek gender affirming surgery so she can live as a woman. Cannes jury president (and Barbie director) Greta Gerwig explained the thinking behind the shared award: \u201cWomen together \u2013 that\u2019s something we wanted to honor when we made this award,\u201d she told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cEach of them is a standout, but together transcendent.\u201d Emilia P\u00e9rez also received the coveted jury prize at this year\u2019s festival. Sex worker drama Anora \u2013 a darkly funny and touching drama about a young exotic dancer who becomes involved with a Russian oligarch\u2019s son \u2013 won the top prize, the Palme d\u2019Or. Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n accepted the ensemble cast\u2019s award with a tearful speech, dedicating it to all trans people \u201cwho suffer so much and must keep faith that changing is possible\u201d. Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s co-star Selena Gomez was not at the gala event, but shared an Instagram story expressing her delight and disbelief at the news, with her head in her hand. She tagged fellow Emilia P\u00e9rez star Zoe Saldana. The film has been very positively reviewed. Rolling Stone\u2018s review of Emilia P\u00e9rez describes the musical as \u201cone of those films in which description on a page can\u2019t do justice to the delirium onscreen.\u201d Furthermore, Vanity Fair notes \u201cAudiard\u2019s steadfast refusal to play it as a joke \u2013 this is sincere, sentimental filmmaking \u2013 proves wholly winning.\u201d Currently, there is no Emilia P\u00e9rez release date for UK or US audiences. However, the film will be theatrically released in France on 28 August 2024.", "summary": "<p>The ensemble cast of &#8220;trans gangster musical&#8221; Emilia P\u00e9rez, including Selena Gomez and Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, collectively won Best Actress at the Cannes 2024 gala ceremony on Saturday (25 May).

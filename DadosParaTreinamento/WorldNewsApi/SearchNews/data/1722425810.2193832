The TV presenter, 29, and the rapper, 30, were seen dancing and laughing as they stood by the Other Stage barriers. The Love Island host and her boyfriend were later pictured holding hands as they partied in the field at Worthy Farm. Stormzy looked like he was living his best life as he snapped pictures of Maya on a disposable camera. They partied with his pal, recently dumped Love Islander Omar Nyame. Maya showed off her figure in a tiny black bandeau which she layered with a patterned jacket and matching skirt. She left her brunette locks to flow naturally down her back and wore black Hunter wellies as part of her getup. Meanwhile, Stormzy looked trendy in a beige and red jacket and bucket hat combo with a pair of white love-heart sunglasses. The couple reunited back in early 2023. They previously dated for four years before parting ways, with the rapper publicly declaring he has 'never loved anyone how I've loved her'. Earlier in the day, Maya threw herself into the festival celebrations, enjoying a tinnie as she travelled to the iconic venue with her pals. The TV personality had enjoyed a last-minute blow dry and Aqua Tight facial with Shane Cooper to transform her complexion for four days of non-stop partying at the festival. She indulged in a pink gin and lemonade as she travelled to the festival on Thursday evening, but showed she wouldn't be enduring the hardships of a campsite, by posting a video of her lavish accommodation at Babbington House. For more than 200,000 Glastonbury goers it's a frantic race to Somerset to find a square metre of space in the festival's crowded campsites and pitch up their tents for the weekend. But for the rich and famous, the experience looks very different as they enjoy the swimming pools and spa at the five-star hotel Babbington House - 30 minutes from the Worthy Farm site. The hideaway is a hot spot for A-listers with the likes of Holly Willoughby, Peter Crouch and Abbey Clancy and the Gallagher brothers staying there in previous years. On Saturday, the main stage will welcome Nigerian stars Femi Kuti and Ayra Starr, followed by US 80s chart-topper Cyndi Lauper and rock band Keane. Mercury Prize winner Michael Kiwanuka and British rapper Little Simz will also play on the Pyramid Stage in the evening before Coldplay top the bill. It will mark the rock band's first Pyramid Stage appearance since 2016 and will make them the first act to headline Glastonbury five times. Meanwhile, on the Other Stage, the Saturday line-up includes Brit rising star winners The Last Dinner Party, US singer Camila Cabello and electronic duo Disclosure. The main stage on the final day will open with a performance by Interlinked Ballet, with Seasick Steve and Paloma Faith set to take to the stage in the afternoon. They will be followed by Twain, who is expected to play her hits including Man! I Feel Like A Woman!, You're Still The One and That Don't Impress Me Much. The country star follows in the footsteps of artists such as Dolly Parton, Kylie Minogue and Diana Ross in the prestigious legends slot. US singer and actress Janelle Monae and Nigerian singer Burna Boy will take over for the evening session before Sza closes out the Pyramid Stage with her hits including Saturn and Kill Bill. The US singer, real name Solana Imani Rowe, who was named international artist of the year at the Brit Awards in March, will be making her debut at the festival this year. Sunday will also see US star Avril Lavigne, Northern Irish band Two Door Cinema Club and US rock band The National perform on the Other Stage.", "summary": "The TV host, 29, and\u00a0her rapper boyfriend, 30,\u00a0put on a\u00a0loved-up display during a D-Block Europe set at Glastonbury Festival on Friday.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-13581803/Maya-Jama-boyfriend-Stormzy-loved-display-date-night-Glastonbury.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/28/23/86716193-0-image-m-28_1719614352460.jpg", "video": "https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/02/17/88923974500503213/1024x576_MP4_88923974500503213.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-29 00:12:26", "author": "Editor,Ruth Francis", "authors": ["Editor", "Ruth Francis"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": 0.854}

{"id": 231966082, "title": "Black Music Sunday: Celebrating the Cole Porter songbook", "text": "It is hard to categorize Cole Porter's music. That is because it is so original. Jazz artists basically fell in love with everything he wrote, given his witty, innuendo-packed lyrics and his extraordinary gift for writing melody. Unlike his contemporaries, he never worked in teams like Rodgers and Hammerstein or George and Ira Gershwin. He did it all, and many would argue that no one did it better. No sooner would one of his Broadway musical revues open or his new Hollywood film hit the silver screen than performers and band arrangers would be swinging the tunes making them jazz standards overnight. Just consider such classic songs as \"Begin the Beguine,\" \"I Get a Kick Out of You,\" \"Easy to Love,\" \"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye,\" \"I've Got You Under My Skin \"... and that's not scratching the surface of his unparalleled personal hit-parade. Porter was openly gay. His sexuality was not an issue in the elite circles that swirled about him. His parties were the talk of the town in Paris; the lyrics of his most famous songs were born in those settings. Gay, straight, married, single, black, white, everyone who was a Paris \"influencer\" was there. \"You're the Top\" had some interesting party lyrics that, as you might imagine, never quite made it to the publishers or Broadway. Speaking of Broadway, talk to soprano Lisa Vroman [Christine in Phantom of the Opera] about George Gershwin and Cole Porter, and she'll keep coming back to the night in Paris when the two legendary songwriters played together at the piano until 3 a.m. Porter married American socialite Linda Lee Thomas in 1918. It was not a sham marriage; he was truly devoted to his wife. Clearly, their marriage also was no torrid love affair. But they figured out how to make it work. Linda knew from the beginning that he was gay. In fact, she never disparaged his gay dalliances. On the contrary, like just about everyone else, she loved him for who he was, a gay genius.", "summary": "<p><span>Continuing our dual celebration of</span><a href=\"https://www.dailykos.com/stories/2024/6/2/2242540/-Black-Music-Sunday-Celebrate-Black-Music-Month-and-pioneering-LGBTQ-musicians\" title=\"\"><span> </span><span>Black Music Month and LGBTQ+ Pride Month from last Sunday</span></a><span>, I thought it would be interesting to explore the works of one of America\u2019s greatest songwriters in The Great American Songbook Hall of Fame:</span><a href=\"https://thesongbook.org/hall-of-fame/songbook-hall-of-fame-honorees/cole-porter\"><span> Cole Porter</span></a><span>,</span><a href=\"https://queerportraits.com/bio/porter\"><span> </span><span>who happened to be gay</span></a><span>.

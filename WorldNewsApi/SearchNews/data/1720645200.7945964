{"id": 231373568, "title": "New Joe Biden campaign ad targets Donald Trump on military issues", "text": "A new ad from President Biden\u2019s campaign released Friday slammed former President Donald Trump for debunked comments on soldiers from five years ago. Mr. Biden\u2019s campaign released the one-minute video after he gave a speech at Pointe du Hoc in France amid the 80th anniversary of the Allied invasion of Normandy. The ad, called \u201cWhat Trump Thinks,\u201d which used the backdrop of rows of white cross headstones at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, included Mr. Trump\u2019s reported quotes disparaging troops from a 2019 magazine article that his advisers proved was false. The latest ad comes on the heels of another Biden campaign video that included three veterans calling Mr. Trump a \u201cdraft dodger.\u201d The campaign ad also hit on Mr. Trump\u2019s feud with the late Sen. John McCain, who was a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War and vehement critic of the former president. Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was quick to hit back at the ad in a response video. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung attacked Mr. Biden\u2019s past transgressions against veterans and service members in the video, noting that when he was vice president, he called soldiers \u201cstupid bastards\u201d during a military base address and was seen looking at his watch during the transfer of soldiers who died in the Kabul airport bombings in 2021. \u201cJoe Biden has disrespected U.S. service members by calling them \u2018silly bastards,\u2019 showed his lack of empathy by repeatedly checking his watch during a solemn ceremony for soldiers killed during the catastrophic Afghanistan withdrawal, and been criticized by Gold Star families for his lack of respect. The fact is that under Biden, America is weaker on the world stage and has made America more vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Cheung said.", "summary": "A new ad from President Biden's campaign released Friday slammed former President Donald Trump for debunked comments on soldiers from five years ago.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/8/new-joe-biden-campaign-ad-targets-donald-trump-mil/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/08/Biden_France_31459.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:36:34", "author": "Alex Miller", "authors": ["Alex Miller"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.31}

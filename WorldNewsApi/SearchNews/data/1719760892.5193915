Nagy suggested that this year\u2019s imports could even exceed last year\u2019s record total. Ukraine has abandoned its traditional grain markets and is now shipping its grain to Europe rather than the Arab countries,\u201d the minister said. \u201cCompetition is impossible because for European farmers it means as if they had to stand at the start line with a leg or hand cut off,\u201d Nagy said and called for creating \u201cfully fair market conditions\u201d. June 9 will \u201coffer a chance to replace all those that view agriculture through dark green spectacles \u2026 and return to normalcy\u201d. He said the Hungarian EU presidency would offer a chance \u201cto reverse trends \u2026 before the new bureaucracy in Brussels enters office we will have a chance to think freely without being influenced.\u201d Nagy noted that Hungary would host an informal meeting of his European counterparts in which participants would draft a recommendation for the community\u2019s agricultural policy after 2027.", "summary": "<p>You must be logged into the site to view this content.</p>", "url": "https://www.budapesttimes.hu/hungary/agriculture-minister-calls-for-putting-an-end-to-eus-hypocritical-farm-policy/", "image": "https://www.budapesttimes.hu/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/agriculture_wikipedia.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 13:18:10", "author": "Attila Leitner", "authors": ["Attila Leitner"], "language": "en", "source_country": "hu", "sentiment": -0.117}

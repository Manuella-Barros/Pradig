President Bola Tinubu had recently sought the approval of the National Assembly for an extension of the implementation periods of the two budgets. The president had asked the lawmakers to shift the termination date of the two budgets from December 31, 2023, to December 31, 2024. But reacting on Friday, BudgiT, which tracks the implementation and execution of government projects in the country, said shifting the budget termination date would turn the country\u2019s annual budget into a biennial. The organisation said such practice negates both global and local practice as there is no provision for it in the 1999 constitution and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2007. In a statement by its communications officer, Nancy Odimegwu, BudgiT said it was worrisome that the Federal Government could be drafting a 2024 supplementary budget to be implemented alongside the 2023 yearly budget, 2023 supplementary budget, and 2024 annual budget. It stated, \u201cRecall that the 2023 Approved Budget of N21.83 trillion was signed into law by former Muhammadu Buhari in January 2023, and was designed to run for 12 calendar months from January to December, as is the practice globally. \u201cIn addition, while the 2024 Appropriation Bill was being drafted, the 2023 Supplementary Budget of N2.17 trillion was passed by the National Assembly and assented to by President Bola Tinubu barely two months before the end of the 2023 fiscal year. \u201cNational Assembly had initially extended the implementation of the 2023 Approved Budget and 2023 Supplementary Budget to June 30, 2024, and now to December 31, 2024.\u201d", "summary": "<p>A non-profit organisation, BudgiT, has condemned the proposed elongation of the implementation period of both the 2023 annual and supplementary budget by the federal government, describing it as an anomaly.

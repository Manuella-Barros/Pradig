Photograph: ANI Photo\n\nObserving that the trial court conducted proceedings with a \"predetermined notion of conviction\", a division bench of Justices AS Supehia and Vimal K Vyas quashed the CBI court's order sentencing Solanki and the six others to life imprisonment.\n\nJethwa was shot dead outside the high court on July 20, 2010, after he tried to expose illegal mining activities allegedly involving Solanki by seeking information under the Right to Information Act.\n\nThe CBI court sentenced Solanki and six others to life imprisonment in 2019 and ordered them to pay a fine of Rs 15 lakh in the case of murder and criminal conspiracy.\n\nThe high court later suspended the life sentences of Dinu Solanki and his nephew Shiva Solanki, also convicted in the case.\n\nIn its judgment, the court said the case will be remembered as \"an antithesis to 'Satyamev Jayate' \" (truth alone triumphs) and observed that the investigation appears to be an eyewash from the inception.\n\n\"We reiterate that the entire investigation, right from the inception of the offence, appears to be perfunctory and prejudiced.

The trial court was duty bound to apply the law as written and not as per its instinct\", it said.\n\nHighlighting flaws in the investigation, the court came down on the Central Bureau of Investigation and said it carried out \"a slipshod and perfunctory investigation\".\n\n\"All efforts are made to see that the truth is buried forever; the perpetrators have succeeded in doing so. Evenly, the trial court has conducted the trial proceedings with a predetermined notion of conviction,\" the court said in its order.\n\n\"Resultantly the common judgment on the order of conviction dated July 11, 2019, passed by the special judge, CBI court...whereby the accused have been convicted for the offence under section 302 (murder) and section 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of Indian\n\nPenal Code (IPC) and are sentenced is quashed and set aside,\" the HC order said.\n\nQuoting a Supreme Court judgment, the bench observed that the survival of democracy and the unity and integrity of the nation depends upon the realisation that \"constitutional morality is no less essential than constitutional legality\".\n\nAfter Jethwa's murder, an FIR was registered against two unidentified assailants, and the investigation was transferred to the state police's Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which later filed a chargesheet.\n\nIn September 2012, the high court handed over the investigation to the CBI, which arrested Dinu Solanki in November 2013.\n\nOn July 11, 2019, Dinu Solanki and his nephew were convicted of Jethwa's murder.\n\nThe high court in September 2021 suspended Dinu Solanki's sentence pending his appeal against conviction by the CBI court.\n\nLast year, it also suspended the life sentence of his nephew Shiva Solanki and granted him bail pending the hearing of his appeal against his conviction by the CBI court.\n\nIn its judgment, the court noted that even when a police constable was present just a few feet away from where the assailants shot dead Jethwa, and police officials arrived at the scene of the crime within a few minutes, \"it is appalling and equally astounding that the assailants were not apprehended, and they 'escaped' [emphasis added] from the limits of Ahmedabad.\"\n\nThe high court, in its judgment dated September 25, 2012, handed over the probe to the CBI, reposing immense faith in the agency, the bench said.\n\nThe facts, however, indicate that the CBI also carried out \"a slipshod and perfunctory investigation,\" it said.\n\nThe cross-examination of hostile witnesses appears to be an empty formality, with no efforts made to extract relevant evidence, which has corroborative value, it said.\n\n\"The witnesses who were cross-examined were all enjoying police protection, but all of them have turned hostile and have ditched the prosecution,\" it said.\n\nThere were loopholes in the investigation, and investigating officers \"have tried to fix square pegs into round holes and have presented nothing more than unsubstantiated assertion\", the court observed.\n\nIt also said proceedings against only eight witnesses

The prosecution has failed to secure the confidence of the witnesses,\" the bench said in its order.\n\nThe trial court, \"on a preconceived notion of conviction, has analysed the evidence dehors the statute and settled legal precedents. The trial court was duty bound to apply the law as written and not as per its instinct\", it said.\n\nHighlighting flaws in the investigation, the court came down on the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and said it carried out \"a slipshod and perfunctory investigation\".\n\n\"All efforts are made to see that the truth is buried forever; the perpetrators have succeeded in doing so. Evenly, the trial court has conducted the trial proceedings with a predetermined notion of conviction,\" the court said in its order.\n\n\"Resultantly the common judgment on the order of conviction dated July 11, 2019, passed by the special judge, CBI court...whereby the accused have been convicted for the offence under section 302 (murder) and section 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and are sentenced is quashed and set aside,\" the HC order said.\n\nQuoting a Supreme Court judgment, the bench observed that the survival of democracy and the unity and integrity of the nation depends upon the realisation that \"constitutional morality is no less essential than constitutional legality\".\n\nAfter Jethwa's murder, an FIR was registered against two unidentified assailants, and the investigation was transferred to the state police's Criminal Investigation Department (CID), which later filed a chargesheet.\n\nIn September 2012, the high court handed over the investigation to the CBI, which arrested Dinu Solanki in November 2013.\n\nOn July 11, 2019, Dinu Solanki and his nephew were convicted of Jethwa's murder.\n\nThe high court in September 2021 suspended Dinu Solanki's sentence pending his appeal against conviction by the CBI court.\n\nLast year, it also suspended the life sentence of his nephew Shiva Solanki and granted him bail pending the hearing of his appeal against his conviction by the CBI court.\n\nIn its judgment, the court noted that even when a police constable was present just a few feet away from where the assailants shot dead Jethwa, and police officials arrived at the scene of the crime within a few minutes, \"it is appalling and equally astounding that the assailants were not apprehended, and they 'escaped' [emphasis added] from the limits of Ahmedabad.\"\n\nThe high court, in its judgment dated September 25, 2012, handed over the probe to the CBI, reposing immense faith in the agency, the bench said.\n\nThe facts, however, indicate that the CBI also carried out \"a slipshod and perfunctory investigation,\" it said.\n\nThe cross-examination of hostile witnesses appears to be an empty formality, with no efforts made to extract relevant evidence, which has corroborative value, it said.\n\n\"The witnesses who were cross-examined were all enjoying police protection, but all of them have turned hostile and have ditched the prosecution,\" it said.\n\nThere were loopholes in the investigation, and investigating officers \"have tried to fix square pegs into round holes and have presented nothing more than unsubstantiated assertion\", the court observed.\n\nIt also said proceedings against only eight witnesses were required to be taken under section 340 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) for not supporting the prosecution's case.\n\nThe trial court has initiated proceedings against 38 witnesses.",

Further observing that the \"investigation right from inception appears to be an eyewash\", the bench said, \"All efforts are made to see that the truth is buried forever. The perpetrators have succeeded in doing so.\"\n\nOn July 20, 2010, Amit Jethwa was shot dead by two people outside the Bar Council building opposite the Gujarat High Court. After shooting at Amit Jethwa, the assailants fled the spot, leaving behind their Bajaj Discover motorcycle along with a country-made revolver used for the murder. Initially, the case was investigated by the Crime Branch of Ahmedabad which filed two chargesheets against six accused. In 2012, the Gujarat High Court directed further investigation following a plea by the deceased's father and CBI charge-sheeted Dinu in 2013 and named him as the key conspirator.\n\nListing the many junctures where the case failed to hold up in appeal, the bench, in its operative part of the verdict, held on Monday, \"We reiterate that the entire investigation right from the inception of offence appears to be perfunctory and prejudiced. The prosecution has failed to secure the confidence of witnesses. The trial court on a preconceived notion of conviction has analysed the evidence dehors the statute and legal precedents. The trial court was duty-bound to apply the law as written and not as per its instincts. Resultantly, the judgement where the accused have been convicted is quashed and set aside.\"\n\nWhile quoting Nani A Palkhivala in the verdict, the bench said, \"The survival of our democracy and the unity and integrity of the nation depends upon the realisation that constitutional morality is no less essential than constitutional legality. Dharma lives in the hearts of public men; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no amendment can save it.\"\n\nThe trial court had also directed proceedings against 38 witnesses who had turned hostile during the trial. However, the Gujarat High Court on Monday confined the scope of such proceedings to only eight witnesses.\n\nOf the 195 prosecution witnesses who were to depose during the trial, 105 turned hostile, including eight eyewitnesses of the shooting. Bhikabhai, Amit Jethva's father, then moved the Gujarat HC seeking a retrial, following which the court of Justice J B Pardiwala directed a fresh trial of 26 witnesses.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sohini_ghosh@indianexpress.com", "name": "Sohini Ghosh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Jethwa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amit Jethwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Gujarat", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Gujarat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmedabad", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ahmedabad"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandya_dynasty", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pandya dynasty"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinu_Solanki", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dinu Solanki"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thakor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thakor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Information_Act,_2005", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right to Information Act, 2005"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyameva_Jayate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satyameva Jayate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solanki_(clan)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solanki (clan)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shiva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Penal_Code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian Penal Code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constable", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constable"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Police station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Revolver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jethwa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jethwa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Dinu-Solanki.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9542364", "eventUri": "eng-9542364", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-07-20", "textStart": 1036, "textEnd": 1049}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 12}], "sentiment": -0.4823529411764705, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

In the first match on Roland Garros' center court, Court Philippe-Chatrier, Osaka, ranked 134th in the world as she works her way back after giving birth to her first child in 2023, defeated 67th-ranked Bronzetti 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 in 2 hours, 1 minute. Osaka appeared to be running away with the third set but squandered her 4-0 lead before breaking serve in the 11th game and holding serve to advance to the second round. She served six aces to none for Bronzetti and hit 31 winners to the Italian's 11. Osaka's four career Grand Slam titles have all come on hard courts, two each at the U.S. Open and Australian Open. Japanese compatriot Taro Daniel lost his first-round match to sixth-seeded Russian Andrey Rublev 6-2, 6-7(3), 6-3, 7-5.

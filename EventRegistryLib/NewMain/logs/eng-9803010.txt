Its President Was Just Indicted by the DOJ", "body": "The opinions expressed by contributors are their own and do not necessarily represent the views of RedState.com.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that four men were being charged in a Philippine bribery money laundering scheme in the Southern District of Florida. What makes this announcement of added interest? One of the men charged is Roger Alejandro Pi\u00f1ate Martinez -- who also happens to be the founder and president of voting machine company Smartmatic.\n\nFrom the DOJ's press release regarding the indictment:\n\nA federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida returned an indictment today charging three executives of an election voting machine and service provider company and a former Chairman of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) of the Republic of the Philippines for their roles in an alleged bribery and money laundering scheme to retain and obtain business related to the 2016 Philippine elections.\n\nAccording to the indictment, between 2015 and 2018, Roger Alejandro Pinate Martinez, 49, a Venezuelan citizen and resident of Boca Raton, Florida, and Jorge Miguel Vasquez, 62, a U.S. citizen and resident of Davie, Florida, together with others, allegedly caused at least $1 million in bribes to be paid to Juan Andres Donato Bautista, 60, the former Chairman of COMELEC. These bribes were allegedly paid to obtain and retain business related to providing voting machines and election services for the 2016 Philippine elections and to secure payments on the contracts, including the release of value added tax payments.\n\nThe co-conspirators allegedly funded the bribes through a slush fund that was created by over-invoicing the cost per voting machine for the 2016 Philippine elections. To conceal and disguise the nature and purpose of the corrupt payments, the co-conspirators used coded language to refer to the slush fund and caused the creation of fraudulent contracts and sham loan agreements to justify transfers. The co-conspirators then allegedly laundered funds related to the bribery scheme through bank accounts located in Asia, Europe, and the United States, including in the Southern District of Florida.\n\nPinate and Vasquez are each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and one substantive violation of the FCPA. Bautista, Pinate, Vasquez, and Elie Moreno, 44, a dual citizen of Venezuela and Israel, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of international laundering of monetary instruments. If convicted, Pinate and Vasquez each face a maximum penalty of five years in prison for the FCPA and conspiracy to violate the FCPA counts. Bautista, Pinate, Vasquez, and Moreno each face a maximum penalty of 20 years for each count of international laundering of monetary instruments and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\n\"Smartmatic\" will undoubtedly ring a bell with most readers. We've covered stories related to the voting machine company fairly extensively here at RedState. Here's just a sampling:\n\nFox Files Motion to Dismiss Smartmatic's $2.7 Billion Suit, Says Claims Against Company Were 'Newsworthy' Even if False\n\nAn Intriguing Email About the Clintons, Smartmatic and Elections\n\nSmartmatic Voting Technology Co. Serves Fox News, Others for Defamation Over Voting Machine Claims\n\nWell This Is Fun: Smartmatic CEO Tapped To Head Soros' Open Society Foundation\n\nAs noted, this indictment pertains to allegations of misdeeds involving the Philippines, not the U.S. Still, given the history, the indictment is sure to raise eyebrows. Not only have there been controversies (and litigation) involving U.S. elections and Smartmatic, Venezuela has also had its share of election controversy related to the company.\n\nSome added information of interest regarding Smartmatic and Pi\u00f1ate can be found in this Twitter thread:\n\nFollowing the announcement of the indictment, Smartmatic responded:\n\nSmartmatic released a statement acknowledging the indictments, saying that the two executives who are still at the company have immediately been \"placed on leaves of absence,\" though they \"remain innocent until proven guilty.\"\n\nThe company added, \"No voter fraud has been alleged and Smartmatic is not indicted. Voters worldwide must be assured that the elections they participate in are conducted with the utmost integrity and transparency.\"\n\nHowever, as one might expect, the news is impacting some of the ongoing litigation involving the company.\n\nFox News and Newsmax have seized on the Philippines bribery allegations ever since CNN reported last year on the original charges against Bautista and the Justice Department's ongoing criminal probe.\n\nLawyers for Fox News and Newsmax have argued that any criminal prosecution against top Smartmatic executives would significantly harm Smartmatic's public reputation, making it much harder for the voting company to claim it was solely damaged by the controversial 2020 election coverage.\n\nCurrently, the suit between Newsmax and Smartmatic is set to start trial in September in Delaware state court.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "susie_moore@redstate.com", "name": "Susie

The payments, between 2015 and 2018, were made to obtain business with the Philippines and secure the timely payment for its work, the Justice Department said.\n\nTo hide the corrupt payments to Juan Donato Bautista, the former chairman of the Commission on Elections in the Philippines, the co-conspirators allegedly created a slush fund - codenamed the \"Philippines Pot,\" according to investigators - and sham loan agreements to justify transfers to bank accounts located in Singapore, Europe and the United States.\n\nThe investigation of the Smartmatic executives started in 2017, when the wife of Bautista informed investigators in the Philippines that her husband had obtained $20 million in unexplained wealth, some of it in stacks of cash found at their home.\n\nBautista was indicted last year in Miami in a criminal complaint that accuses him of taking the bribes in exchange for awarding an unnamed company nearly $200 million in contracts to supply tens of thousands of voting machines and related services for the 2016 presidential elections.\n\nSmartmatic in a statement said it had placed the two employees on leaves of absence, effective immediately.\n\n\"No voter fraud has been alleged and Smartmatic is not indicted,\" the company said in a statement. \"Voters worldwide must be assured that the elections they participate in are conducted with the utmost integrity and transparency.\"\n\nPinate co-founded Smartmatic more than two decades ago and its initial success is partly attributable to major contracts from the government of Hugo Chavez, an early devotee of electronic voting, in Pinate's native Venezuela. It has since expanded globally and helped carry out elections in 25 countries, from Argentina to Zambia as well as several European countries.\n\nPinate and Jorge Miguel Vasquez were each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Both reside in south Florida. Along with Elie Moreno, a dual citizen of Venezuela and Israel, they were also charged with several money laundering charges that carry a maximum penalty of 20 years.\n\nSmartmatic sued Fox News for airing false claims that software it developed altered the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. In April, another conservative media outlet, One America News Network, settled with Smartmatic similar allegations for undisclosed terms.\n\nReportedly funding Smartmatic's costly defamation suit is LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the indictment against the Smartmatic executives.\n\nSmartmatic has also sued several Trump allies, including his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, but the claims against him are on hold while his bankruptcy case plays out.\n\nFox News earlier tried unsuccessfully to get dismissed out of the case, which also named hosts Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro and former host Lou Dobbs. An appeals court threw out claims against network parent Fox Corp., but Smartmatic refiled them.\n\nFox countersued under a New York law against lobbing frivolous litigation to try to silence reporting or commentary on public matters. Smartmatic tried in vain to get those counterclaims tossed out.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

These bribes were allegedly paid to obtain and retain business related to providing voting machines and election services for the 2016 Philippine elections and to secure payments on the contracts, including the release of value added tax payments.\n\nThe co-conspirators allegedly funded the bribes through a slush fund that was created by over-invoicing the cost per voting machine for the 2016 Philippine elections. To conceal and disguise the nature and purpose of the corrupt payments, the co-conspirators used coded language to refer to the slush fund and caused the creation of fraudulent contracts and sham loan agreements to justify transfers. The co-conspirators then allegedly laundered funds related to the bribery scheme through bank accounts located in Asia, Europe, and the United States, including in the Southern District of Florida.\n\nHere is the Press Release from the DOJ itself at Justice.gov:\n\nMeanwhile, here is Lou Dobbs on Smartmatic way back in 2006:\n\nNow if this story sounds kind of familiar to you, it's because a similar story occurred back in September of last year.\n\nIt starts to get REALLY WEIRD and go REALLY DEEP and it even has Patrick Byrne all over it...\n\nTake a look:\n\nUsually when I see a headline too wild to be true, it usually is -- fake, that is.\n\nAlso, when I see that same wild story being shared from only ONE website that I've never heard of before, that's usually the final confirmation that the story is fake.\n\nWe had both of those elements here in this story, but I have kind of a surprising \"Fact Check\" to show you here.\n\nThis was the Tweet I first saw that caught my attention:\n\nProblem is, all the posts went to \"YourNews.com\" -- a site I've never heard of:\n\nAnd that was the ONLY site covering the story -- until I show you what I found on CNN, which I'll do just a bit further down below.\n\nSo I've already got two red flags and then here was the third red flag -- the story and the Tweets claim that \"Smartmatic was Indicted\".\n\nI'm no legal scholar, but I'm pretty sure you can only Indict people, not companies.\n\nSo there's red flag number 3.\n\nRed flag number 4 was Patrick Byrne slithering up into the middle of this story.\n\nAt first I didn't know what to make of Patrick Byrne.\n\nAnd yet, nothing ever quite seemed to make sense with him.\n\nSo there is Byrne saying this is his most important video ever and that the DOJ has indicted Smartmatic.\n\nThen he says he's \"involved in the background\" whatever that means.\n\nHe further clarified that \"indictment\" wasn't the right word (as I told you above):\n\nOk.....so I know you're saying \"Noah, tell us the bottom line here....what's going on?\"\n\nWell, good thing you've got us on the case because I didn't stop here.\n\nTurns out there IS something real here, just not the headlines that \"YourNews.com\" tried to peddle.\n\nThat site appears to be mostly BS.\n\nHere's the real scoop, and oddly enough I go now to CNN for the \"real scoop\" on this one -- from 3 days ago, here's what's actually going on, and it DOES involve Smartmatic at least tangentially and it does involve criminal charges, according to CNN:\n\nSmartmatic, the voting technology company suing Fox News and former President Donald Trump's top allies over their false claims that its machines rigged the 2020 election, was implicated in an alleged bribery scheme involving the former top election official in the Philippines, according to court filings obtained by CNN.\n\nThe court documents indicate that the Justice Department has filed money laundering charges against former Filipino election administrator Andres Bautista - and that four executives from Smartmatic subsidiaries are implicated as uncharged co-conspirators.\n\nThe bribery claims are sure to reverberate in Smartmatic's ongoing defamation cases. Trump allies repeatedly peddled the lie that the company manipulated the results in 2020, despite the fact that its machines were only used in one California county that year.\n\nSmartmatic spokeswoman Samira Saba said in a statement that the Florida-based company \"has never won a project through any illegal means\" and stressed that the claims in the Bautista case are \"not related to Smartmatic election security or integrity.\"\n\nSmartmatic filed massive defamation suits against Fox News, Newsmax, OAN, several individual Fox hosts, ex-Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and others. They all deny wrongdoing.\n\nSome of these pro-Trump figures have tried to push back against the defamation suits by highlighting Smartmatic's ties to Venezuela and its involvement in foreign elections.\n\nOAN recently asked a judge to let them seek records from the Philippines government and other countries as part of the discovery process, claiming they have files about \"investigations... scandals.. and major problems\" involving Smartmatic machines.\n\nThe Smartmatic co-conspirators in the Philippines-related criminal case aren't identified by name in the court filing obtained by CNN, which says they allegedly \"caused or attempted\" to funnel $4 million to Bautista \"in violation of US money laundering laws.\"\n\nAccording to the charging documents, the Smartmatic executives used \"slush funds\" and \"fake contracts\" to facilitate alleged bribes and masked their actions with phony email accounts. \"Salsa\" was their code word for \"money,\" the documents alleged.\n\nBut we're not stopping there....\n\nI have what I believe is the entire court filling for you, which you can read here:\n\nBut...have criminal charges been filed and does this closely relate to Smartmatic?\n\nIt appears that is a yes.\n\nAs always, we have a system of innocent until proven guilty here in the United States, or at least we used to.\n\nIt's unclear if we still have that system if you're a conservative or member of MAGA, but for anyone on the Left I'm sure they will be afforded all benefit of the doubt and all defenses available to them.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed Up"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_M._Byrne", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patrick M.

The indictment was issued by the federal grand jury in the Southern District of Florida.\n\nOn X , Bautista claimed the charges were \"politically influenced by key Philippine officials.\"\n\n\"The voting machine company won the contract before, during and after my tenure as chairman, a role I performed during the 2016 elections with zeal and competence in service of the Filipino people,\" he wrote.\n\n\"I will fight for my exoneration in court and show that I have not committed any crime against the US government or the American people nor have I taken advantage or prejudiced them in any way,\" he added.\n\nHe did not identify the Philippine officials who supposedly influenced the charges.\n\nBautista in US custody?\n\nBased on information received by The STAR, Bautista is already \"under custody by the US authorities\" and that he may enter into a plea bargain deal to testify against the other respondents.\n\nIt was unclear if Bautista was arrested or if he voluntarily surrendered to authorities as the US Justice Department statement did not mention the issuance of an arrest warrant.\n\nBautista was reportedly taken into custody somewhere in Canada, where he supposedly settled after leaving the Philippines amid a slew of charges and allegations of unexplained wealth.\n\nHe resigned as Comelec chief in 2017 following the filing of an impeachment complaint against him at the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Senate also issued an arrest warrant against him after he failed to attend a hearing that year.\n\nHis estranged wife, Patricia, had accused him of having unexplained wealth, which he vehemently denied.\n\nBautista served as chair of the Presidential Commission on Good Government, the agency tasked to run after the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcos family and their cronies, prior to his appointment to Comelec in 2015.\n\nIn a statement, Smartmatic said two of its employees indicted - Pi\u00f1ate and Moreno - have been placed on leave of absence \"regardless of the veracity of the allegations,\" while Velasquez had \"ceased to be part of the company since several years ago.\"\n\nSmartmatic noted that no voter fraud has been alleged and the firm is not indicted.\n\n\"Voters worldwide must be assured that the elections they participate in are conducted with the utmost integrity and transparency. These are the values that Smartmatic lives,\" the firm said.\n\nComelec Chairman George Garcia said he is still giving the personalities involved in the bribery issue the benefit of the doubt. \"Let's presume everyone innocent until the guilt is proved,\" said Garcia.\n\nHowever, the elections chief added that the development had somehow vindicated the present Comelec.\n\n\"It would appear to be a sort of vindication on the part of the present Commission. We were right all along when we disqualified Smartmatic,\" Garcia said.\n\nIn a statement issued in 2023, Smartmatic maintained that it \"has adhered to the Philippine Procurement Law and the strict controls that the Philippine Commission on Elections imposes\" in every bidding process and procurement procedure.\n\n\"Winning a bid in the Philippines is never solely one individual's preference or decision. Instead, multiple technical evaluations are conducted by committees, ensuring that the bidders comply with all the requirements specified in the Terms of Reference,\" Smartmatic said.\n\nSmartmatic said all of these assessments are presented to a bids and awards committee, which recommends a choice of winning bidder to the Comelec convened as a whole.\n\n\"Dozens of technical, commercial and administrative officials have a say in selecting the provider. Over the years Smartmatic has both won and lost bids in the Philippines. It is important to note that nothing about this investigation has anything to do with election security or integrity,\" it added.\n\nSmartmatic at the time said it would cooperate with investigating authorities. -- Rhodina Villanueva", "source": {"uri": "philstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Philstar.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "janvic_mateo@philstar.com", "name": "Janvic Mateo", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Philippine_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2016 Philippine general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartmatic", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartmatic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voting machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Elections_(Philippines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Commission on Elections (Philippines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_juries_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand juries in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Corrupt_Practices_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Corrupt Practices Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slush_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Slush fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andres_D._Bautista", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andres D.

To hide their crime, prosecutors say they used coded language to refer to a slush fund used to make the illicit payments - causing the creation of fraudulent contracts and fake loan agreements to make the transfers appear legitimate.\n\nThe defendants then allegedly laundered the funds related to the bribery scheme via a constellation of international bank accounts in Asia, Europe and the United States - including in the Southern District of Florida.\n\nBautista, Pi\u00f1ate, Vasquez, and Elie Moreno, 44, a dual citizen of Venezuela and Israel, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of international laundering of monetary instruments.\n\nIf convicted, Bautista, Pinate, Vasquez and Moreno each face a maximum penalty of 20 years for each count of international laundering of monetary instruments and conspiracy to commit money laundering. -Miami Herald\n\nSmartmatic was founded in 2000 by Pi\u00f1ate, Antonio Mugica and Alfredo Jos\u00e9 Anzola - making international headlines after Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez chose the company to replace the country's voting machines in 2004. In 2006, they acquired Sequoia Voting Systems - though later divested its stake.\n\nAccording to Smartmatic's website, Pi\u00f1ate \"played a critical role in planning and executing the world's largest election using optical scanners (in the Philippines) and in Smartmatic winning the largest election contract in US history (in Los Angeles).\"\n\nThe company responded to the indictment Thursday night, saying in a statement \"Smartmatic has learned that two of our employees have been indicted for alleged violations of the FCPA in the Philippines almost 10 years ago.

The payments, between 2015 and 2018, were made to obtain business with the Philippines and secure the timely payment for its work, the Justice Department said.\n\nTo hide the corrupt payments to Juan Donato, the former chairman of the Commission on Elections in the Philippines, the co-conspirators allegedly used coded language to refer to the slush fund and created sham loan agreements to justify transfers to bank accounts located in Asia, Europe and the United States.\n\nSmartmatic in a statement said it had placed the two employees on leaves of absence, effective immediately.\n\n\"No voter fraud has been alleged and Smartmatic is not indicted,\" the company said in a statement. \"Voters worldwide must be assured that the elections they participate in are conducted with the utmost integrity and transparency.\"\n\nPinate co-founded Smartmatic more than two decades ago and its initial success is partly attributable to major contracts from the government of Hugo Chavez, an early devotee of electronic voting, in Pinate's native Venezuela. It has since expanded globally and helped carry out elections in 25 countries, from Argentina to Zambia as well as several European countries.\n\nPinate and Jorge Miguel Vasquez were each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Both reside in south Florida. Along with Elie Moreno, a dual citizen of Venezuela and Israel, they were also charged with several money laundering charges that carry a maximum penalty of 20 years.\n\nSmartmatic sued Fox News for airing false claims that software it developed altered the outcome of the 2020 U.S. presidential election. In April, another conservative media outlet, One America News Network, settled with Smartmatic similar allegations for undisclosed terms.\n\nSmartmatic has also sued several Trump allies, including his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, but the claims against him are on hold while his bankruptcy case plays out.\n\nFox News earlier tried unsuccessfully to get dismissed out of the case, which also named hosts Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro and former host Lou Dobbs. An appeals court threw out claims against network parent Fox Corp., but Smartmatic refiled them.\n\nFox countersued under a New York law against lobbing frivolous litigation to try to silence reporting or commentary on public matters. Smartmatic tried in vain to get those counterclaims tossed out.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Bautista, Pi\u00f1ate, Vasquez, and Elie Moreno, a dual citizen of Venezuela and Israel, are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of international laundering of monetary instruments.\n\n\"If convicted, Pi\u00f1ate and Vasquez each face a maximum penalty of five years in prison for the FCPA and conspiracy to violate the FCPA counts. Bautista, Pi\u00f1ate, Vasquez, and Moreno each face a maximum penalty of 20 years for each count of international laundering of monetary instruments and conspiracy to commit money laundering,\" the DOJ said.\n\n\"Smartmatic has learned that two of our employees have been indicted for alleged violations of the FCPA in the Philippines almost 10 years ago,\" Smartmatic said in a statement. \"Regardless of the veracity of the allegations and while our accused employees remain innocent until proven guilty, we have placed both employees on leaves of absence, effective immediately.

In exchange for the money, the company would receive contracts for providing voting machines and election services for the 2016 election, prosecutors said.\n\nRead also: Voting tech company scores win in lawsuit against Fox News: report\n\n\"The co-conspirators allegedly funded the bribes through a slush fund, created by inflating the cost per voting machine,\" prosecutors said in a news release.\n\nTo conceal the payments, the group used coded words and created bogus contracts and sham loan deals, prosecutors said. They then laundered the money through bank accounts in Asia, Europe, and the United States, including in southern Florida.\n\nPinate and Vasquez face charges of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and a substantive violation of that same act. Along with Bautista and Elie Moreno, 44, a dual citizen of Venezuela and Israel, they also face charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of international laundering of monetary instruments.\n\nThe defendants face up to five years for FCPA violations and 20 years for the money laundering charges.\n\nSmartmatic's website said Pinate executes \"strategic efforts and daily business functions worldwide\" and co-created the company's long-term vision. He became company president in 2018 and holds a seat on the company's global board of directors.\n\n\"Roger played a critical role in planning and executing the world's largest election using optical scanners (in the Philippines) and in Smartmatic winning the largest election contract in US history (in Los Angeles),\" the company said.", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news",

It said in a statement the indicted employees have been placed on leave.\n\n\"No voter fraud has been alleged and Smartmatic is not indicted,\" the statement said.\n\nLawyers for the defendants could not immediately be identified.\n\nThe indictment comes as Smartmatic is suing Fox Corp and conservative commentators for billions of dollars in damages for allegedly defaming it with false claims that its machines rigged the 2020 U.S. presidential election.\n\nIt is unclear how the indictment could affect those cases, but Fox could try to use evidence from the criminal case to bolster its defense.\n\nFederal prosecutors said in a press release that Pinate conspired with two other Smartmatic executives to pay $1 million in bribes to Juan Andres Donato Bautista, 60, the former chairman of the Philippine Commission on Elections, or COMELEC.\n\nProsecutors said the bribes were paid through a slush fund created by over-invoicing voting machine costs for the 2016 Philippine elections and then disguised in financial documents using coded language.\n\nBautista served on COMELEC from 2015 to 2017, according to the agency's website. A representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSmartmatic is suing Fox News for $2.7 billion in damages for allegedly defaming it with coverage claiming its voting machines may have helped rig the 2020 U.S. election against then-President Donald Trump and in favor of Joe Biden, who won.\n\nFox has denied the allegations, saying its coverage of newsworthy allegations against Smartmatic was fair and protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe network settled a similar lawsuit by voting machine company Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million in April 2023.\n\n(Reporting by Jack Queen in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler and Jonathan Oatis)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/cf/ccf72d64-fd65-5906-a2c3-93a2edd755fa/66b668f1bc1ce.image.jpg?crop=800%2C420%2C0%2C56&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9803010", "eventUri": "eng-9803010", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Bautista for allegedly taking $1 million in bribes from Smartmatic and for money laundering in relation to the preparations for the 2016 elections.\n\nAside from Bautista, three other officials of Smartmatic were also charged due to their involvement in the case.\n\nLast Thursday, a federal grand jury in Florida finally indicted Bautista together with those from Smartmatic, namely, Roger Alejandro Martinez, Jorge Miguel Vasquez, and Ellie Moreno for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), conspiracy to commit money laundering, and international laundering of monetary instruments.\n\nWhen asked about the development, Garcia said those involved in the said case should still be presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nHowever, he noted that the filing of the case is also a \"vindication of sorts\" for Comelec. \"We were right all along when we disqualified Smartmatic.\"\n\n'No voter fraud'\n\nIn a social media post, Bautista said the contract with Smartmatic was aboveboard and the charges against him were \"politically influenced by key Philippine officials.\"\n\nHe said he is ready to defend himself in court.\n\n\"I will fight for my exoneration in court and show that I have not committed any crime against the U.S government or the American people nor have I taken advantage or prejudiced them in any way,\" Bautista said.\n\nFor its part, Smartmatic said it has ordered two of its employees, who were charged to go on leave. It also said that Vasquez already left Smartmatic several years ago.\n\nThe firm also stressed that the case involving its officials are not related to the election service it provides.\n\n\"No voter fraud has been alleged and Smartmatic is not indicted.

The indictment itself doesn't appear to be publicly available as of Friday morning.\n\nProsecutors said in the press release that the indictment stems from bribes allegedly paid by Smartmatic to Andres Bautista, the former top election official in the Philippines, \"to obtain and retain business related to providing voting machines and election services for the 2016 Philippine elections.\"\n\nBautista was already facing related charges in the US and is named in the new indictment, according to the press release.\n\nSmartmatic released a statement acknowledging the indictments, saying that the two executives who are still at the company have immediately been \"placed on leaves of absence,\" though they \"remain innocent until proven guilty.\"\n\nThe company added, \"No voter fraud has been alleged and Smartmatic is not indicted. Voters worldwide must be assured that the elections they participate in are conducted with the utmost integrity and transparency.\"\n\nEven though the charges aren't about the 2020 election, the new indictment is already making waves in the ongoing lawsuits that Smartmatic brought against conservative outlets that promoted the lie that its software rigged the 2020 US election.\n\nFox News and Newsmax are facing defamation lawsuits from Smartmatic. Fox declined to comment and Newsmax did not immediately respond to an inquiry.\n\nBoth Fox News and Newsmax deny defaming anyone and maintain that the First Amendment protected their 2020 coverage, when they gave airtime to allies of then-President Donald Trump who falsely claimed that Smartmatic and another voting company manipulated the results.\n\nFox News and Newsmax have seized on the Philippines bribery allegations ever since CNN reported last year on the original charges against Bautista and the Justice Department's ongoing criminal probe.\n\nLawyers for Fox News and Newsmax have argued that any criminal prosecution against top Smartmatic executives would significantly harm Smartmatic's public reputation, making it much harder for the voting company to claim it was solely damaged by the controversial 2020 election coverage.\n\nSmartmatic's foreign work, including past activities in Venezuela and the Philippines saga, has long been seen as a vulnerability that could weaken its defamation cases in the US.\n\nThe Newsmax-Smartmatic trial is scheduled for next month in Delaware state court, unless there is an outside settlement.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com",

These bribes were allegedly paid to obtain and retain business related to providing voting machines and election services for the 2016 Philippine elections and to secure payments on the contracts, including the release of value-added tax payments.\n\nThe co-conspirators allegedly funded the bribes through a slush fund that was created by over-invoicing the cost per voting machine for the 2016 Philippine elections.\n\nPinate and Vasquez face charges of one count each of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and one substantive count of the FCPA.\n\nAdditionally, Pinate, Vasquez, Bautista, and Elie Moreno, a dual citizen of Venezuela and Israel, are each charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of international laundering of monetary instruments.\n\nIf convicted, Pinate and Vasquez could each receive up to five years in prison for the FCPA charges, while all four defendants face up to 20 years for each count of money laundering.\n\nSmartmatic sued Fox News for $2.7 billion and is currently in litigation.

Especially since the Commission on Elections has junked voting system provider Smartmatic, for the first time since the Philippines switched to fully automated polls, and replaced it with South Korean firm Miru Systems.\n\nSince the Comelec in November last year disqualified Smartmatic from participating in Philippine elections, the news regarding the poll body has been dominated by accusations hurled mainly by two congressmen, that Comelec Chairman George Garcia allegedly received bribes to award the 2025 poll automation contract to Miru, and that he has some P1 billion in offshore bank accounts.\n\nGarcia has waived the secrecy of his bank deposits to prove the accusations wrong, and has sought the help of both Philippine and US authorities to go after those behind what he describes as a demolition job against him.\n\nLast April, the Supreme Court granted a petition filed by Smartmatic and declared that the Comelec had committed grave abuse of discretion in disqualifying the company. The SC, however, said its ruling was not sufficient to nullify the award of the automation contract to Miru.\n\nYesterday, the US Justice Department announced that a federal grand jury had indicted former Comelec chairman Andres Bautista and three top Smartmatic executives on charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and international laundering of monetary instruments related to the 2016 general elections in the Philippines. The Smartmatic officials, according to the indictment, allegedly \"caused at least $1 million in bribes\" to be paid to Bautista in exchange for the Comelec's continued use of Smartmatic as supplier of voting machines and election services.\n\nBautista has denied the charges, which he said were politically influenced by Philippine officials whom he did not name. Garcia, who had cited the accusations against Bautista as one of the reasons for disqualifying Smartmatic, said yesterday that he felt vindicated by the US case.

The indictment marks a major turn in an ongoing investigation into alleged corruption and bribery related to the 2016 Philippine elections.\n\nBackground of the Allegations\n\nThe indictment details that between 2015 and 2018, Vasquez, Pi\u00f1ate, and Moreno, among others, allegedly orchestrated bribes totaling at least $1 million paid to Bautista. The purpose of these bribes, according to the charges, was to secure and maintain Smartmatic's business related to providing voting machines for the 2016 elections in the Philippines.\n\nThe indictment alleges that these bribes were funneled through a network of slush funds and concealed by fraudulent contracts and loan agreements. The funds were reportedly laundered through various bank accounts across Asia, Europe, and the United States, including in Florida. This scheme allegedly involved complex money laundering activities, reflecting the sophisticated nature of the financial transactions.\n\nPolitical and Corporate Implications\n\nThe indictment has far-reaching implications for both the political and corporate spheres. Bautista, who led the Comelec during a controversial period in Philippine electoral history, has been at the center of scrutiny for several years. His tenure was marked by debates over the transparency and integrity of the election process.\n\nSmartmatic, a global provider of election technology, has faced criticism and legal challenges in various jurisdictions. The company's role in the Philippine elections, particularly in the context of alleged bribery and corruption, has intensified scrutiny of its business practices and ethical standards.\n\nReaction and Consequences\n\nThe charges against Bautista and the Smartmatic officials have prompted reactions from various stakeholders. In the Philippines, the news has sparked renewed discussions about electoral integrity and corruption. Activists and political analysts are calling for thorough investigations and accountability to ensure that similar issues are addressed and prevented in future elections.\n\nThe federal grand jury's indictment also underscores the international reach of anti-corruption efforts and the global implications of financial crimes. The case is expected to attract significant attention as it progresses through the legal system, potentially setting important precedents for handling international bribery and money laundering cases.\n\nAs the legal process unfolds, it will be crucial to monitor the developments and outcomes of this high-profile case.

Smartmatic was selected after a competitive bidding process in which it achieved the highest technical and financial scores among five bidders.\n\nHowever, the decision was contested in various courts, including the Public Procurement Administrative Review Board (PPARB), the High Court, and the Court of Appeal.\n\nDespite these challenges, the IEBC's decision to award the contract to Smartmatic was upheld.\n\nSmartmatic supplied 14,100 new KIEMS kits to complement the 41,000 kits already in IEBC's inventory, bringing the total to 55,100 kits.\n\nThese kits were deployed across 46,229 polling stations, with additional backup units in each county assembly ward.\n\nThe company's involvement was seen as critical in the operation of voter identification and results transmission systems.\n\nThe Indictment and Its Implications\n\nWhile the charges relate specifically to the 2016 Philippine elections, the revelations raise concerns about the integrity of the company's practices in other countries where it has provided election technology.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice emphasised that the indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants, including Pi\u00f1ate, are presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nHowever, if convicted, Pi\u00f1ate faces significant penalties, including up to 20 years in prison for each money laundering charge and five years for conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA).", "source": {"uri": "pulselive.co.ke", "dataType": "news", "title": "pulselive.co.ke"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But the indictment can still help Fox News, Newsmax, and other defendants in Smartmatic's many defamation lawsuits.\"\n\nThe Business Insider explained, \"According to the Justice Department, Pi\u00f1ate, along with another Smartmatic employee, laundered the funds by inflating the cost of each voting machine used in the 2016 Philippine election. The bribery scheme spanned bank accounts in Asia, Europe, and Florida, where the case was brought, prosecutors say.\"\n\nThrough the bribery of Bautista -- a codefendant in the case -- Smartmatic retained and expanded its election services in the 2016 election, prosecutors say.\n\nThe company, in a statement, explained, \"No voter fraud has been alleged and Smartmatic is not indicted.\"\n\nThe company has still-pending lawsuits against Fox News, Newsmax, Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, and others.

Here are the stories for The Manila Times for Saturday, August 10, 2024.\n\nToday's episode is brought to you by Wilcon Depot, The Philippines' leading home improvement and construction supplies retailer -- your Trusted Building Partner.\n\nREAD: US court indicts ex-Comelec chief\n\nFORMER Commission on Elections (Comelec) chairman Andres Bautista and three executives of the company that provided the automated vote-counting machines for the 2016 elections in the Philippines were indicted on Friday (Manila time) by a federal grand jury in Florida for bribery and money laundering. The company that allegedly bribed Bautista was not named in US court records, but the description in an affidavit matched that of Smartmatic, which had won every contract to supply Comelec with voting machines since the first automated elections were held in 2010. Charged with Bautista were Smartmatic President and General Manager Roger Alejandro Pinate, Vice President for External Operations Jorge Miguel Vasquez, and Vice President for Global Services Elie Moreno. Bautista on Friday said that the charges against him were politically motivated. The four defendants were each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of international laundering of monetary instruments. Pinate and Vasquez were each charged with one count of conspiracy to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and one substantive violation of the FCPA. If convicted, the four face a 20-year prison term for each count of international laundering of monetary instruments and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Pinate and Vasquez also face five years in prison for the FCPA and conspiracy to violate the FCPA counts. Based on court records, between 2015 and 2018, Smartmatic executives paid a bribe of at least $1 million to Bautista, the Comelec chairman at the time, to ensure that Smartmatic won the contract for vote counting machines and election services for the 2016 polls. More than 92,000 counting machines were used to digitize ballots and transmit the results for canvassing.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nREAD: Budget issues forced me to resign, Sara reveals\n\nVICE President Sara Duterte said issues over the budget allocation for the Department of Education (DepEd) were among the reasons she resigned from the Cabinet of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. In a television interview aired on Thursday, Duterte said that while she is not ready to fully explain the real cause of her resignation as education secretary, she said she believed that the 2024 General Appropriations Act was not properly handled. Turning to her relationship with the President, Duterte said they were no longer meeting or talking with each other. Duterte was Marcos' running mate in the \"UniTeam\" that swept them to victory in the 2022 elections. Duterte said she was now more \"free\" to speak her mind after leaving the Cabinet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nREAD: PNP: Search of Quiboloy compound may take days\n\nSEARCHING the 30-hectare Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KoJC) compound in Davao City where the evangelist Apollo Quiboloy could be hiding may take days, the Philippine National Police (PNP) said on Friday. In a press briefing at Camp Crame, PNP spokesman Col.

Quiboloy is wanted for child and sexual abuse and human trafficking.\n\nREAD: PH, Vietnam hold first joint sea drills\n\nTHE Philippine and Vietnamese coast guards held firefighting and searchand-rescue exercises off Manila on Friday, the first such drills between the two countries with maritime disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea.

(PhilPost) have raised concerns over the ongoing power struggle within the state-owned corporation, causing psychological stress, anxiety, and low morale among employees. In a strongly worded manifesto obtained by The Manila Times, the officials, led by three assistant postmaster generals and several unit and division heads of PhilPost, have called on government leaders, stakeholders and partners in governance to \"aid them in their quest\" for the immediate resolution of the leadership problem. PhilPost is being wracked by the power struggle between Luis Carlos, who was appointed as Postmaster General last April 2023 but was sacked by the board of directors, and former Quezon City councilor Michael Planas, who was appointed as Chairman by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. last month and was later appointed Postmaster General and Chief Executive Officer thereafter. In an interview with The Times on Friday, Assistant Postmaster General for Administration and Finance Benjie Yotoko said that with both Carlos and Planas reporting as Postmaster General, the employees are confused over whose order to follow.\n\nBUSINESS: 'More deficits, growth and inflation'\n\nOver to business, latest growth and inflation data have prompted the investment arm of Bank of America (BofA) to raise its economic forecasts for the Philippines. BoFA Securities (BoFAS), in a report released on Thursday, revised its 2024 and 2025 growth outlooks to 5.9 percent from 5.4 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively. The revisions, however, still fall below the 6.0- to 7.0-percent and 6.5- to 7.5-percent targets for 2024 and 2025. BoFAS also raised its deficit to GDP forecasts to 5.0 percent and 4.5 percent for this year and the next, respectively, from 4.7 percent and 4.5 percent. The average inflation projections for 2024 and 2025 were adjusted to 3.5 percent and 3.0 percent, from 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent, \"factoring-in the more recent inflation print while still anticipating weaker inflation later in 2024.\" GDP growth accelerated to 6.3 percent in the second quarter, up from 5.3 percent in the first three months of 2024 and raising the year-to-date average to 6.0 percent, at the bottom end of the government's target.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSPORTS: Ando performs her best in Paris\n\nGO hard or go home.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240808629949/en/\n\nLast month, on July 15, 2024, the Special Master appointed by the Delaware Superior Court denied the voting company's key claims made against Newsmax in the motion for spoliation sanctions filed in May 2024.\n\nIn its motion, Smartmatic alleged that Newsmax's CEO Christopher Ruddy and other senior staff at Newsmax intentionally deleted evidence, including text messages, that Smartmatic claimed was relevant to the case.\n\nThe Special Master ruled that Smartmatic failed to prove that the Newsmax CEO or senior staff intentionally or recklessly destroyed evidence in the case.\n\nNewsmax informed the Special Master that some of Ruddy's text messages were accidentally not preserved on his mobile phone, but he located another device that had many if not all of the text messages. Those messages were produced to Smartmatic in the litigation.\n\nNewsmax notes that it informed the Special Master that neither Ruddy nor any senior staff sought to hide text messages or emails, which in many cases were also collected from dozens of other Newsmax witnesses in the case and produced to Smartmatic.\n\nNewsmax separately filed a Motion for Sanctions against Smartmatic on May 13, 2024, and a Motion for Contempt against Smartmatic on July 16, 2024.\n\nBoth of those motions remain pending.\n\nIn its motions Newsmax argues that Smartmatic and its executives have misled Newsmax, the Special Master, and the Court about the Department of Justice's (DOJ) ongoing criminal investigation into Smartmatic.\n\nThe DOJ has alleged that Smartmatic and several of its senior executives participated in an international scheme involving a multi-million-dollar bribe allegedly made to an election official in the Philippines in exchange for the company getting nearly $200 million in contracts.\n\n[The publicly filed versions of Newsmax's Motion for Sanctions and Motion for Contempt are attached.]\n\nNewsmax contends that ongoing and future news reports about Smartmatic's alleged involvement in the bribery scheme is and will remain devastating to its defamation lawsuit against Newsmax.\n\nSpecifically, Newsmax says that these new revelations undermine Smartmatic's claim that it will suffer damage to its future business prospects as a result of 2020 election coverage by Newsmax and others.\n\nNewsmax contends that Smartmatic's alleged role in the bribery scheme and the potential for federal criminal charges against Smartmatic and its senior executives have harmed and will continue to harm Smartmatic's reputation.\n\nNewsmax asserts, with the support of expert testimony, that if Smartmatic or one of its executives is charged criminally, Smartmatic will be barred - in some cases automatically - from public contracting in many jurisdictions.\n\nCNN and other media have reported on the ongoing federal criminal bribery investigation into Smartmatic and several of its executives.\n\nIn September of 2023, CNN reported that DOJ filings allege that four Smartmatic executives who acted as co-conspirators in the criminal case allegedly \"caused or attempted\" to funnel $4 million to Filipino election administrator Andres Bautista \"in violation of US money laundering laws.\" See M. Cohen, \"Smartmatic implicated in alleged bribery scheme involving top Filipino election official,\" CNN (Sept. 22, 2023), available at https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/22/business/smartmatic-bribery-scheme-indictment/index.html.\n\nCNN reported that DOJ court filings alleged that \"Smartmatic executives used 'slush funds' and 'fake contracts' to facilitate alleged bribes and masked their actions with phony email accounts.\"\n\nNewsmax has also denied Smartmatic's defamation claim in its entirety, noting that Newsmax reported fairly on the 2020 election results by providing the public with both sides of the issue.\n\nNewsmax also asserts that the Smartmatic lawsuit poses a danger to the First Amendment and the most basic right of press freedom.\n\nNewsmax has filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, asking the Court to dismiss in its entirety Smartmatic's defamation lawsuit against Newsmax.\n\nPreviously, the Delaware Court ruled against Smartmatic's motion seeking to have New York law apply to this case.\n\nThe Court ruled in Newsmax's favor, making Florida law apply to the case. Florida law strongly protects the right of media organizations like Newsmax to neutrally report on what public figures are saying in matters of dispute, a key element of Newsmax's defense.\n\nNewsmax's Motion for Summary Judgment, and Smartmatic's Motion for Summary Judgment, are scheduled to be argued in the Delaware Superior Court on August 22, 2024.\n\nThe case is scheduled for trial to begin in late September.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240808629949/en/\n\nCONTACT: Bill Daddi\n\nbill@daddibrand.com\n\nKEYWORD:

Cristiano Ronaldo scores perfect hattrick in Al-Nassr vs Al-Wehda in 6-0 win-WATCH", "body": "In a dominant display, Al-Nassr thrashed Al-Wehda 6-0 in their recent Saudi Pro League encounter. The match saw Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a hat-trick with goals in the 5th, 12th, and 52nd minutes, while Ot\u00e1vio added another in the 18th minute. Sadio Man\u00e9 found the net just before halftime in the 45th minute, and Mohammed Al-Fatil sealed the victory with a goal in the 88th minute. Al-Nassr showcased their prowess with 14 shots and 7 shots on target, maintaining 65% possession and achieving a 90% pass accuracy. The comprehensive win solidified Al-Nassr's position in the standings, placing them second behind Al-Hilal.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo nets a perfect hattrick against Al-Wehda in the Saudi Pro League\n\nCristiano Ronaldo displayed his skills once again on Saturday, scoring his fourth hat trick of the Saudi Pro League season in an incredible 6-0 victory for Al-Nassr over Al-Wehda. With this incredible accomplishment, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner has scored 32 goals in the league this season, just edging Abderrazak Hamdallah's record of 34 goals from the 2018-19 campaign. Amazingly, Ronaldo is likely to surpass this feat with four league games left.\n\nFive minutes into the match, Ronaldo broke the deadlock by taking advantage of a defensive blunder by custodian Munir Mohamedi. He showed his domination right away. Only seven minutes later, the 5-time Ballon d'Or winner and former Real Madrid and Manchester United superstar increased his impact on the game by skillfully nodding in a cross from Marcelo Brozovic. Ronaldo's quest for greatness continued in the second half as he scored a crisp goal from inside the penalty area to complete his hat trick and give Al-Nassr a seven-game winning streak.\n\nTogether with Senegalese striker Sadio Mane and Mohammed Al-Fatil, who both scored goals, Ronaldo's fellow countryman Otavio also contributed to the team's victory.\n\nWith this crushing victory, Al-Nassr, the nine-time Saudi Arabian champion, reaffirms their league title rivalry by closing the gap to league leaders Al-Hilal by nine points. Al-Nassr's pursuit of greatness is still alive and well, with Ronaldo leading the way as they look to secure the top place in the league rankings.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aryan_suraj_chadha@republicworld.com", "name": "Aryan Suraj Chadha", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Wehda_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Wehda FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nassr_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al-Nassr FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Professional_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Professional League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Al-Fatil", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Al-Fatil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadio_Man\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sadio Man\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hilal_SFC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Hilal SFC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abderrazak_Hamdallah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abderrazak Hamdallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munir_Mohamedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Munir Mohamedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Jorkyball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/Ronaldo-(1)-169791040886616_9.bin", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540167", "eventUri": "eng-9529229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

They will face Yokohama F Marinos in the final after the Japanese team beat Ulsan Hyundai on penalties.\n\nAgainst the odds Al Ain beat Al Hilal, who have several internationals including defender Kalidou Koulibaly, goalkeeper Bono and striker Alexander Mitrovic, who missed the tie injured, plus midfield duo Sergej Milinkovic-Savic and Ruben Neves.\n\n\"We've watched Al Hilal against local rivals Al Ittihad in the Champions League and we were able to see the weaknesses of both,\" left back Erik said in an interview.\n\n\"God wrote the perfect story and chose Al Ain to fight Al Hilal's invincibility and there is nothing more rewarding than that\".\n\nAl Ain ended Al Hilal's world record run of 34 consecutive victories when they won the first leg.\n\n\"We were aware of our team's strength, although most predictions were in favour of Al Hilal. We were determined to compete strongly regardless of the opponent's strength.

He spoke to us with confidence, experience and his words gave us hope.\"\n\nBig dream\n\nSurprise package Al Ain knocked out Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr in the quarter-finals in a penalty shootout after a 4-4 draw on aggregate.\n\n\"Before the tournament began, according to the media, our chances were 1 per cent or less of being champions.\n\n\"I think logically we made the job easier and only us or Marinos can win the competition this season.\n\n\"That's already a big privilege and we are very proud and will fight with all of our strength for our big dream,\" he said of his side's chances of lifting the trophy.\n\n\"We followed the game between Marinos and Ulsan Hyundai in the semi-finals and we had already started studying both teams.\" Erik expects to be available for the final despite being injured against Al Hilal. The first leg takes place on May 11 at Yokohama with Al Ain hosting the return two weeks later.\n\nAsked about the possibility of moving to the Saudi league, he said: \"It's difficult for me to play for another club in Asia, I feel at home here. I'm a player for Al Ain, the biggest club in the Emirates.\n\nHowever, Erik added: \"If there's a good offer for Al Ain and for me, nothing is impossible.

The Portuguese forward brought the ball into the box and curled a right-footed effort into the bottom corner.\n\nRonaldo doubled Nassr's lead seven minutes later when he rose to head home Marcelo Brozovic's pinpoint cross.\n\nOtavio made it 3-0 in the 18th minute. After timing his run through the Wehda defence and getting on the end of Sadio Mane's lofted through pass, the Portuguese midfielder lifted the ball over the onrushing Mohamedi.\n\nOtavio and Mane then switched roles as provider turned scorer moments before half-time. Mane exchanged a quick one-two with Otavio before holding off two Wehda defenders and taking an early shot from the edge of the area that wrong-footed Mohamedi.\n\nShortly after the break, Ronaldo had his perfect hat-trick. Mane was once again the creator as the former Liverpool forward slid a pass through for Ronaldo, who timed his run to perfection and slotted home a left-footed shot.\n\nMohamed Al-Fatil then completed the rout in the 88th minute after Meshari Al-Nemer's initial shot was blocked into his path by Wehda goalkeeper Mohamedi.\n\nA seventh league victory in a row further cements Nassr's place as likely runners-up in the SPL. The Riyadh side are 19 points clear of Al Ahli in third, although they will need a monumental slip-up from leaders Al Hilal to win their first league title since 2019.\n\nHilal, who set a new world record this season for most games won in a row, are nine points clear with five matches remaining and play their game in hand against Al Ahli on Monday night.\n\n\"We achieved an important victory ... and what was required was for us to give our best and achieve three points to make the fans happy,\" Nassr manager Luis Castro said.\n\n\"I have beautiful words for the fans. They are the ones who gave us the spirit of victory and they are our fuel to achieve the best.\"\n\nWhile league and Asian Champions League glory has proved beyond Ronaldo and Nassr this season, they can still end the season with major silverware; Nassr face rivals Hilal in the King's Cup final.\n\n\"We started the season by winning the Arab Club Cup and we want to end the season by winning the King's Cup,\" Ronaldo said.\n\nRonaldo also has in his sights the SPL's single-season goalscoring record. The current record is held by Abderrazak Hamdallah, who scored 34 league goals in the 2018/19 season, so Ronaldo needs three more goals in his last four games to set a new mark.\n\n\"I will try to reach goal 900 this season or next season, it does not matter,\" added Ronaldo, who took his career goals tally to 884 for club and country.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_turner@thenationalnews.com", "name": "Jon Turner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munir_Mohamedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Munir Mohamedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Professional_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Professional League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Wehda_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Wehda FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nassr_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al-Nassr FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Al-Fatil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Al-Fatil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadio_Man\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sadio Man\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Ahli_SC_(Doha)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Ahli SC (Doha)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Riyadh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Cup_(Thailand)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "King's Cup (Thailand)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hilal_SFC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Hilal SFC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abderrazak_Hamdallah", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abderrazak Hamdallah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Skittles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://thenational-the-national-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/KUGDYQIRMYMWMFJOGLEQ5TJFLI.jpg?smart=true&auth=74c849a36c12d69b5125831ff27747b1db37518bbfdb31836cc6d7daa2de26a4&width=1200&height=630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540217", "eventUri": "eng-9529229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

The Portuguese took just five minutes to break the deadlock by intercepting a poor clearance by Wehda goalkeeper Munir Mohamedi as the ball found the back of the net. Well, to double his tally, he took just seven minutes as he replied with a simple header from Marcelo Brozovic's pass.\n\nOtavio stood next in the queue as he scored Nassr's third goal after receiving a brilliant pass from Mane. The Portuguese found himself one-on-one with Munir before he lobbed the ball over him and found the back of the net. At the stroke of half-time, Mane got himself into the scoresheet as he received the ball from Ronaldo and made a few exchanges with Otavio before pushing the ball into the net.\n\nAl Nassr ran rampant on the back of Ronaldo and Mane and looked in no mood to stop, clinically dominating the first half. They increased their tally as the striker completed his hat-trick in the 50th minute. Ronaldo made a brilliant run after getting the ball from the winger and netted his 31st league goal of the ongoing campaign and 41st overall.\n\nMohamed Al-Fatil found himself a place in the scoresheet as he scored the sixth and final goal of the night after Meshari Al-Nemer's initial attempt was blocked by Mohamedi.\n\nRonaldo yet again starred for his side and looked as sublime as ever while drilling the triple strike. Al-Wehda found it extremely difficult to handle the Portugal captain who completed the 66th hat-trick of his glorious career.\n\nOn the contrary, it was a night to forget for Morocco's Munir Mohamedi who conceded six times in 90 minutes and made a terrible blunder just at the start which Ronaldo took the benefit of and drilled the opener. Luis Castro's men will be next seen in action on Thursday as they take on Al-Akhdoud to close gap with table-toppers Al Hilal who are currently nine points ahead of Al Nassr.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amit_sharma@news9live.com", "name": "Amit Sharma", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munir_Mohamedi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Munir Mohamedi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nassr_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Al-Nassr FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Wehda_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al Wehda FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Professional_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Professional League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Okhdood_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al-Okhdood Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hilal_SFC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Hilal SFC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Al-Fatil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Al-Fatil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By_Type", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Costumes/By Type", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ronaldo-Al-Nassr-Al-Wehda.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9540217", "eventUri": "eng-9529229", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The superstar performance by Cristiano Ronaldo with goals at 17' and 57' set the tone for Al-Nassr. Sadio Man\u00e9's penalty goal at 37' added to their lead. Fawaz Al-Torais scored a consolation goal for Al-Khaleej at 82'. The match fixed Al-Nassr's place in the final and will now face Al-Hilal, which promises intense gameplay. Talking about the semifinal, Al-Nassr's superiority was evident in the statistics, with 21 shots and 12 on target compared to Al-Khaleej's 9 shots and 2 on target. The possession favored Al-Nassr with 59% against Al-Khaleej's 41%. Al-Nassr's precise passing, with 90% accuracy from 509 passes, highlighted their strategic play. Al-Khaleej received 1 yellow card while Al-Nassr faced none. The match saw Al-Nassr's dominance in all aspects, securing their spot in the finals with Cristiano Ronaldo eyeing revenge from his Saudi arch-rivals.\n\nAlso Read: AIFF disciplinary committee suspends Mohun Bagan's Armando Sadiku\n\nCristiano Ronaldo scores incredible weak foot volley goal during Al-Nassr vs Al-Khaleej\n\nAt the Al-Awwal Stadium in Riyadh on Saturday, Al Nassr defeated Al Khaleej 3-1 in the King Cup of Champions semi-final, with Cristiano Ronaldo and Sadio Mane showcasing their skill on the pitch. This victory sets up a thrilling championship match between Al Hilal, the top team in the Saudi Pro League, and Al Nassr. Al Hilal secured their berth by defeating Al Ittihad in the other semifinal match earlier this week.\n\nIn the seventeenth minute, Ronaldo showed off his predatory tendencies by breaking the tie by taking advantage of an Al Khaleej defensive blunder. Goalie Ibrahim Sehic was put in a dangerous situation by a misplaced back pass by Lisandro Lopez, which allowed Cristiano Ronaldo to seize the loose clearing and slide the ball into the net with his left foot with an incredible volley, that could be one of the best goals from Saudi Arabia.\n\nAlso Read: Vinicius Jr nets brace as Real Madrid draw 2-2 vs Bayern Munich: 1st leg\n\nIvo Rodrigues touched the ball inside the box, and Mane scored from the penalty spot to give Al Nassr a bigger advantage just before halftime. Mane ensured his team had a comfortable lead going into halftime by coolly finishing the spot-kick into the right corner.\n\nEven with changes made at halftime, Al Khaleej was unable to stop Al Nassr's constant onslaught. In the 57th minute, Ronaldo added to their misery by scoring his second goal of the game off of a perfectly placed cross from Ayman Yahya. Goalie Sehic of Al Khaleej stood up for making several vital stops that prevented Al Nassr from extending their lead multiple times.\n\nAfter using up all of their substitutions, Mohammed Al Khabrani's injury in the 77th minute left Al Khaleej with just 10 players for the duration of the match, making the situation worse for the club. However, Fawaz Al-Torais' accurate cross from Arif Al Haydar in the 82nd minute allowed Al Khaleej to cut the lead late in the game, allowing them to regain some pride.

We were determined to compete strongly regardless of the opponent's strength. We never stopped dreaming,\" Erik added.\n\n\"With the confidence that we gained in the first half at home in the first leg the belief increased that we could qualify for the final.\"\n\nAl Ain's Argentine coach Hernan Crespo exacted revenge for last season's 7-0 loss to Al-Hilal in the Champions League when he was in charge of Qatar's Al-Duhail.\n\n\"Crespo told us before the first game that he is very proud of us and that Al Hilal players are not from another world,\" the Brazilian added.\n\n\"We trust our coach; he is a legend in the world of football. He spoke to us with confidence, experience and his words gave us hope.\"\n\nSurprise package Al Ain knocked out Cristiano Ronaldo's Al Nassr in the quarter-finals in a penalty shootout after a 4-4 draw on aggregate.\n\n\"Before the tournament began, according to the media, our chances were 1% or less of being champions.\n\n\"I think logically we made the job easier and only us or Marinos can win the competition this season.\n\n\"That's already a big privilege and we are very proud and will fight with all of our strength for our big dream,\" he said of his side's chances of lifting the trophy.\n\n\"We followed the game between Marinos and Ulsan Hyundai in the semifinals and we had already started studying both teams.\"\n\nErik expects to be available for the final despite being injured against Al Hilal. The first leg takes place on May 11 at Yokohama with Al Ain hosting the return two weeks later.\n\nAsked about the possibility of moving to the Saudi league, he said: \"It's difficult for me to play for another club in Asia, I feel at home here. I'm a player for Al Ain, the biggest club in the UAE.\n\nHowever, Erik added: \"If there's a good offer for Al Ain and for me, nothing is impossible. Everyone knows my desire is to play in Europe, but now I have the opportunity to play in the final of the Asian Champions League...\n\n\"I think to play for Brazil it's easier to move to Europe, the Brazilian team doesn't have eyes for Asia but I continue to do my best and trust that God's will comes true in my life.\"", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Hilal_SFC", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Hilal SFC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Ain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Al Ain"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Al Ain"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Nassr_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Al-Nassr FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalidou_Koulibaly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kalidou Koulibaly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulsan_Hyundai_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ulsan Hyundai FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yokohama_F._Marinos", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yokohama F.

selfless act", "body": "Cristiano Ronaldo showed off his dancing skills after scoring the opener for Al Nassr in their King Cup of Champions clash.\n\nRonaldo showed great ingenuity when he scored after 17 minutes against Al Khaleej to give Al Nassr the lead in the semi-final tie.\n\nIt came from a defensive mix-up as Al Khaleej goalkeeper Ibrahim Sehic tried to play out from the back only to end up fluffing his lines and clearing it to Ronaldo.\n\nThe five-time Ballon d'Or winner still had plenty left to do, though, and was not even looking at the goal when he hooked the ball over his shoulder with a brilliant unorthodox left-footed finish.\n\nThe ball sailed into an empty net to spark wild celebrations, including from Ronaldo himself who pulled out a peculiar little dance to the home fans at the Al Awwal Stadium.\n\nShaking his hips a bit, the former Manchester United star pumped the air as well before a swooping fist to the adoring crowd.\n\nAl Nassr then went on to earn a penalty, a duty that Ronaldo usually takes care of.\n\nBut in a selfless act, the 39-year-old allowed former Liverpool star Sadio Mane to take the spot-kick instead.\n\nThe Senegal international made no mistake after a jaunty run-up, bundling in a second for Al Nassr to give them a 2-0 lead at half-time.\n\nRonaldo then doubled his personal tally after the break with a tap-in.\n\nThe two strikes take Ronaldo to 38 goals in all competitions this season as he continues his fine form ahead of Euro 2024 this summer.\n\nPortugal, who are led by former Everton boss Roberto Martinez, are one of the favourites to claim glory in Germany.\n\nHowever, Ronaldo's inclusion in the national side has been questioned in recent times and he was even dropped from the squad in the last round of

He explained to the Mail in 2016 that his love for Ronaldo stems from the 39-year-old \"representing motivation and hard work, showing you can come back stronger from a bad place no matter what\".\n\nHis looks first started drawing comparisons to his inspiration in 2013. And his social media accounts soon gained traction when fans noticed he was not only dedicated to following in Ronaldo's footsteps on the pitch, but posting photos which mimicked his idol on Instagram, whether that was the Al-Nassr star's eating or training habits.\n\nDuring a trip to Real's old training ground at Valdebebas for a one week trial in 2014, he claimed that people mistook him for the at-the-time Madrid goal-scoring phenom while he had his sunglasses on.\n\nYet Shanta's obsession appeared to have taken a stranger turn when reports emerged that he had borrowed his parents' money to have facial surgery in order to become more Ronaldo-like. The Odense-born Iranian has repeatedly denied those claims, saying: \"I'm used to reading that I spend money to look like Cristiano but actually I have spent zero.\"\n\nHe went on to admit: \"For people who think I am just the new Cristiano Ronaldo look-alike, that's not true. And I would never say I am the new Cristiano Ronaldo on the pitch because no one can be like him.\n\n\"I'm myself. I cannot be more myself. People may think I always want to be like Cristiano and I want to look like Cristiano but there is more to it. They do not see it the whole way.\n\n\"Maybe I do a lot of things like he does but I'm always myself. I don't like to go copying him fully because there will be no second Ronaldo.\"\n\nYet Shanta has, on half-a-dozen occasions, been fortunate enough to meet his idol. One of those times saw Ronaldo give the then-teenager some advice.\n\nShanta revealed: \"He told me to work hard and believe and these are two things you have to learn. Without these you won't grow.\"\n\nThose words may not have led to him becoming a world-renowned footballer, having once dreamed of playing for Iran at the 2022 World Cup, but he has since applied those lessons elsewhere in his life.\n\nHe studied Spanish and Maths at college and now runs his own football coaching company, srkcoaching, which he regularly shares snaps of on social media.\n\nShanta, who has 18,000 followers on X, explained his passion for coaching by saying: \"People often wonder why I dedicate so much time to training others in football. Well, here's my answer. I'm passionate about developing players and helping the unlock their full potential.\n\n\"Drawing from my own playing experience and inspiration from top players. I strive to provide top notch coaching guidance. It is a true privilege.\"\n\nHis online image as a manic wannabe has largely died down. Shanta, whose father Behrouz was a professional footballer himself and missed out on playing for Iran due to injuries, these days posts plenty of non-Ronaldo related content such as snaps alongside his younger brother, training videos and watching live football matches such as those at the 2022 Qatar World Cup.\n\nYet his love for Ronaldo remains undying, celebrating the veteran goal-scorer's accomplishment's last year with the message: \"53 goals in 2023.

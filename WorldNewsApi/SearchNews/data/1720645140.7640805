The Mets are in London for a two-game series against the Philadelphia Phillies. The 31-year-old Senga has been sidelined by a capsule strain in his pitching shoulder. But he has started long-tossing. \u201cHopefully he can start throwing bullpens at some point at the beginning of next week,\u201d Mendoza said. Senga went 12-7 with a 2.98 ERA in 29 starts for the Mets last year, making the NL All-Star team during his first season in the majors after arriving from Japan. He struck out 202 batters in 166 1/3 innings, finishing runner-up for NL Rookie of the Year and seventh in Cy Young Award voting. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21ldHMtc2VuZ2EtaW5qdXJ5LTU3MjA3MzNhY2ZkMWY1NTVjYmQ3OThmMmVmYTNiYjI50gEA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Mets pitcher Kodai Senga won't be back before All-Star break</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/mets-senga-injury-5720733acfd1f555cbd798f2efa3bb29", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/ca93e6a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5359x3014+0+279/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F23%2Fbe%2F9109308ceda5abad2b6bf89a2fd2%2F6d0cd87f295d4838ad9f804c09877931", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:02:00", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.057}

{"id": 225038558, "title": "Sony Deletes Interview With Naughty Dog\u2019s Neil Druckmann, Which Fabricated Quotes", "text": "Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin The Last of Us Part 2 Abby Sony has deleted a controversial interview with Naughty Dog\u2019s Neil Druckmann, an interview that turns out, probably should not have been controversial at all. In a statement, Sony issued an apology to Druckmann and his team for a number of errors, which included outright made-up quotes that went viral on social media. Here\u2019s that statement: \u201cIn re-reviewing our recent interview with Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann, we have found several significant errors and inaccuracies that don't represent his perspective and values (including topics such as animation, writing, technology, AI, and future projects). We apologize to Neil for misrepresenting his words and for any negative impact this interview might have caused him and his team. In coordination with Naughty Dog and SIE, we have removed the interview.\u201d The most significant error in the interview was a section where Druckmann supposedly said that his new, upcoming game, allegedly some sort of new sci-fi IP, \u201ccould redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.\u201d That quote went viral as it made it seem like Druckmann was a bit high on himself and his work to make such a declaration, but he felt like he had to issue a statement saying that \u201ccontext and intent\u201d were lost in editing. But that\u2019s diplomatic, as that quote did not appear in his original, much longer answer that he posted at all. The closest thing to that quote was him saying \u201cSo I\u2019m not only excited for this game that we\u2019re making \u2013 and it\u2019s something really fresh for us \u2013 but I\u2019m also excited to see how the world reacts to it.\u201d That is\u2026not at all the same thing, and the quote that was passed around simply does not exist in the entire paragraph, nor even does the sentiment.

(Photo by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic for HBO) FilmMagic for HBO Druckmann also made other comments about AI use in games that were controversial, but Sony seems to be saying here that it\u2019s possible those quotes were wrong or inaccurate as well, though we don\u2019t know how exactly. How did this happen? I\u2019ve seen a lot of \u201cthis is what game journalism has come to!!\u201d hand-wringing, but I think people were failing to realize this was\u2026not journalism, this was an internal interview with Sony itself, and they committed big no-nos like summarizing quotes with entirely new language which at least in one case, was a totally new, wrong, controversial thing attributed to him. While you can edit quotes for length or clarity (removing ahs and ums and repeated words and such) in interviews, you cannot just\u2026change words or interpret what you think someone means by something. And that appears to be what happened here. This also comes in the wake of Sony rarely ever giving interviews to actual gaming outlets with its top stars, Druckmann included, and well, this is what happens. We\u2019ll see if Druckmann clarifies any other quotes or misquotes, but for now this strange situation seems to be over. Follow me on Twitter, Threads, YouTube, and Instagram.

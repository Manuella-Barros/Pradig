{"id": 223751562, "title": "Philippe Clement reveals immediate plan as Rangers boss sends social media to fans after Cup final defeat", "text": "Philippe Clement has told his Rangers stars he is \"proud\" of their efforts as he expressed his disappointment at not bagging the Scottish Cup for the fans - but vowed he will be raring to go after a summer break with his family. The Belgian gaffer missed out on a domestic double in his first season at Ibrox as Adam Idah pounced on a Jack Butland push out in the 90th minute to sent the green and white half of Hampden wide and allow Brendan Rodgers to add the famous old trophy to the Scottish Premiership title in a double of his own. It's been 24 hours since that loss in Mount Florida and the Ibrox gaffer has had some time to reflect on the loss as he addressed the fans in a social media message. Writing on X, Clement said: \"Disappointed because we really wanted to win for our fans but proud of the boys for giving everything. Yesterday\u2019s game also means the end of my first season as a Rangers manager. It\u2019s time for a short period with my family before we start working hard towards next season.\" It's set to be a busy summer at Rangers with a host of players coming in and heading for the exit door. Jefte was announced as the first summer arrival on the eve of the Scottish Cup defeat to Celtic with Mohamed Diomande also becoming a permanent capture. Liam Kelly has been strongly linked with a free transfer to Ibrox with Record Sport revealing that Robby McCrorie is on Aberdeen's wishlist this summer with the current No2 seeking to go out and play first-team football after playing the back-up role again. John Lundstram, Borna Barisic and Kemar Roofe are all expected to leave on free transfers while a host of fringe men and loanees will also likely make their departure. A short break is planned for the Belgian before he gets back down to hard work to put his stamp on his Rangers team and build a side capable of capturing the Premiership crown from rivals Celtic and qualifying for the newly revamped Champions League next season with two qualifiers needed negotiated to join the Hoops alongside Europe's elite at the top table.", "summary": "The Belgian gaffer missed out on a double in his first season after Adam Idah fired home for the Hoops in the 90th minute at Hampden.", "url": "https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/football/philippe-clement-reveals-immediate-plan-32897129", "image": "https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article32893833.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS334569745.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:05:39", "author": "Alan Galindo", "authors": ["Alan Galindo"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.134}

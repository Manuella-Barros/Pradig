According to weather forecasters, the 2024 hurricane season is predicted to be one of the most active storm seasons on record with 24 named storms, 11 of which may become hurricanes and 6 of which might reach Category 3 status or stronger. The company encourages customers to buckle down on safety preparations to minimize storm impacts.\n\nTo enhance the reliability of our service, Entergy Texas proactively invests in strengthening and upgrading our power delivery system.

The proposal, which aims to reduce the duration of weather-related outages and restoration costs, includes leveraging non-ERCOT grants from the recently passed Texas Energy Fund to make necessary resiliency investments at an affordable cost.\n\n\"At Entergy Texas, we are intentional and strategic about improvements to the power grid,\" said Frank Shannon, Entergy Texas vice president of reliability. \"Our dedicated group of employees and contractors are committed to creating a more resilient grid that provides customers with the reliability they expect and deserve.\"\n\nFor more information and updates on Entergy Texas' reliability projects, visit Reliability Updates.\n\nStay Prepared\n\nStaying storm ready is a full-time commitment.

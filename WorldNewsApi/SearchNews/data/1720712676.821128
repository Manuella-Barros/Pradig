The reigning champions have had a forgettable week in Barbados to kick off their title defence, making a slow start in their washed-out opener against Scotland before being outclassed in all three disciplines by Australia on Saturday. Having watched their Ashes rivals rack up 201 for seven at the Kensington Oval, the highest total of the competition, they failed to come close in a chastening 36-run defeat. All is not lost, with games against Oman and Namibia coming up and a change of scenery in Antigua offering a chance to make up lost ground. But with unexpected results cropping up with increasing regularity, nothing can be taken for granted. As vice-captain, Moeen is a veteran of previous campaigns that teetered in the balance before ending in triumph \u2013 with the 2022 edition of this event and the 2019 World Cup both entering \u2018must-win\u2019 territory before England came good \u2013 but was also on duty when last year\u2019s 50-over defence lurched from bad to worse. \u201cIn the last T20 World Cup when we won it, we had to win every game so we\u2019re kind of used to doing this with our backs against the wall,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the last 50-over World Cup, that\u2019s done, but I think in this World Cup we can do a lot better. It\u2019s about being calm and not letting the outside noise affect us. \u201cYou can\u2019t get too down and go into our shells or say \u2018what if this happens?\u2019. We\u2019ve just got to be really ruthless in those next two games and start playing our best cricket otherwise we\u2019re going home.\u201d The scale of their defeat has put a major dent in the net run-rate, which comes into play as a tie-break should points be tied. England could therefore find themselves scrapping over decimal places with Scotland for a Super 8 spot, placing an emphasis on not just winning but winning big. \u201cWe need to be more aggressive without being reckless, not overthink things, and take those two teams down,\u201d said Moeen, who showed his own explosive side with three sixes off a single Glenn Maxwell over after the game had gone against Australia. \u201cThere\u2019s been quite a few tournaments where I\u2019ve missed out on net run rate so it\u2019s huge. If we get the chance we\u2019re going to have to win by quite big margins. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the team to do that. I know in this World Cup big teams are losing but we\u2019ve got to go into these two games and almost throw the first punch then just keep going from there.\u201d England have no shortage of areas to improve. Team selection may need to be looked at again, with the omission of left-arm quick Reece Topley appearing to be an error, while Jonny Bairstow\u2019s strained seven from 13 balls suggested a player short of rhythm. Even more obvious, though, is a lack of sharpness in the field. England lacked energy in both games and there were hints of fractiousness between players at times in Bridgetown. Head coach Matthew Mott felt his side were \u2018sloppy\u2019 against Scotland and that diagnosis was even truer second time around, with pressure mounting around his position after a difficult year. \u201cThere was a bit of sloppy stuff but I think we were sloppy with the ball as well,\u201d said a frustrated Moeen. \u201cWe just kept giving them the boundary. \u201cMotty is good, he was really calm and has a lot of experience in World Cups. It\u2019s just about everyone else being calm. \u201cEven in India he was the one guy being positive. Not for no reason, but he was always thinking about the positive things and how we can get better.\u201d", "summary": "A 36-run loss to Australia put an early dent in England\u2019s T20 World Cup title defence.", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/cricket/england-moeen-ali-matthew-mott-australia-barbados-b2559475.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/17/08-1ed10860c7dd4d4d8fb60130e2c4c6a6.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:24:34", "author": "Rory Dollard", "authors": ["Rory Dollard"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.228}

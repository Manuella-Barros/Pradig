(Photo: Ministry of Climate and Environment of Poland)\n\nPoland is making progress towards adding nuclear power to its energy mix, including in developing the necessary infrastructure for a safe and sustainable nuclear power programme, according to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) review mission.\n\nAn IAEA team of experts today concluded an 11-day mission to Poland to review its infrastructure development for the Polish Nuclear Power Programme (PNPP). The PNPP was approved in January 2014 by the Polish Council of Ministers. The establishment of nuclear power is an objective of the Energy Policy of Poland until 2040, which sets the framework for the country's energy transition to strengthen energy security and to reduce reliance on coal power plants to meet climate goals. In 2022, the Polish Government announced that the country's first nuclear power plant will be comprised of three Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, and it expects the first unit to be commissioned in 2033.\n\nThe Phase 2 Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) was carried out from 15 to 25 April, at the invitation of the Government of Poland, and hosted by the Ministry of Climate and Environment. The team reviewed the status of 19 nuclear infrastructure issues using the IAEA evaluation methodology for Phase 2 of the Milestones Approach, which evaluates the readiness of a country to make a knowledgeable commitment to a nuclear power programme.\n\nPrior to the Phase 2 INIR mission, Poland prepared a self-evaluation report covering all 19 nuclear power infrastructure issues and submitted the report and supporting documents to the IAEA. The team comprised of three experts from Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, as well as seven IAEA staff.\n\nThe team identified good practices that would benefit other countries developing nuclear power in the areas of contracting approach, strategic approach to funding, early authorization of technical support organizations to support the nuclear regulator, engagement with the electrical grid operator, stakeholder involvement and industrial involvement.\n\n\"The Polish nuclear power programme was initiated with clear objectives and is progressing towards the construction stage in a structured way,\" said mission team leader Mehmet Ceyhan, Technical Lead of the IAEA Nuclear Infrastructure Development Section. \"We observed strong and dedicated teams in each of the key organizations that will help to achieve the government's objectives for the PNPP.\"\n\nThe team also made recommendations and suggestions aimed at assisting Poland in making further progress in the development of its nuclear infrastructure and its readiness to build the first nuclear power plant in the country. The team highlighted areas where further actions would benefit Poland, including the need to further review its legal and regulatory framework, and finalize the preparatory work required for the contracting and construction stages.\n\n\"Poland's cooperation with the IAEA is a long-term collaboration, and the review mission is extremely valuable and beneficial for the implementation and execution of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme. We would like to thank the Agency's experts for their commitment, professionalism and valuable opinions provided during the Phase 2 INIR mission. The conclusions we drew after talks with the Agency's experts will allow us to improve the implementation of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme,\" said Miosz Motyka, Undersecretary of State for the Ministry of Climate and Environment of Poland.\n\nBased on the outcomes of the INIR mission, the IAEA and Poland will update their Integrated Workplan to continue providing coordinated support in line with the future development of the country's nuclear power programme.\n\nIn September 2023, Poland also hosted an IAEA Integrated Regulatory Review Service mission, which found that Poland's nuclear regulatory framework is in line with IAEA safety standards and that its regulatory body is competent and prepared for the launch of the country's nuclear power programme.\n\nAbout INIR Missions\n\nINIR missions are based on the IAEA Milestones Approach, with its 19 infrastructure issues, three phases (consider, prepare and construct) and three milestones (decide, contract and commission/operate). INIR missions enable IAEA Member State representatives to have in-depth discussions with international experts about experiences and best practices in different countries.\n\nIn developing its recommendations, the INIR team considers the comments made by the relevant national organizations.

The PNPP was approved in January 2014 by the Polish Council of Ministers. The establishment of nuclear power is an objective of the Energy Policy of Poland until 2040, which sets the framework for the country's energy transition to strengthen energy security and to reduce reliance on coal power plants to meet climate goals. In 2022, the Polish Government announced that the country's first nuclear power plant will be comprised of three Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, and it expects the first unit to be commissioned in 2033.\n\nThe Phase 2 Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) was carried out from 15 to 25 April, at the invitation of the Government of Poland, and hosted by the Ministry of Climate and Environment. The team reviewed the status of 19 nuclear infrastructure issues using the IAEA evaluation methodology for Phase 2 of the Milestones Approach, which evaluates the readiness of a country to make a knowledgeable commitment to a nuclear power programme.\n\nPrior to the Phase 2 INIR mission, Poland prepared a self-evaluation report covering all 19 nuclear power infrastructure issues and submitted the report and supporting documents to the IAEA. The team comprised of three experts from Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, as well as seven IAEA staff.\n\nThe team identified good practices that would benefit other countries developing nuclear power in the areas of contracting approach, strategic approach to funding, early authorization of technical support organizations to support the nuclear regulator, engagement with the electrical grid operator, stakeholder involvement and industrial involvement.\n\n\"The Polish nuclear power programme was initiated with clear objectives and is progressing towards the construction stage in a structured way,\" said mission team leader Mehmet Ceyhan, Technical Lead of the IAEA Nuclear Infrastructure Development Section. \"We observed strong and dedicated teams in each of the key organizations that will help to achieve the government's objectives for the PNPP.\"\n\nThe team also made recommendations and suggestions aimed at assisting Poland in making further progress in the development of its nuclear infrastructure and its readiness to build the first nuclear power plant in the country. The team highlighted areas where further actions would benefit Poland, including the need to further review its legal and regulatory framework, and finalize the preparatory work required for the contracting and construction stages.\n\n\"Poland's cooperation with the IAEA is a long-term collaboration, and the review mission is extremely valuable and beneficial for the implementation and execution of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme. We would like to thank the Agency's experts for their commitment, professionalism and valuable opinions provided during the Phase 2 INIR mission. The conclusions we drew after talks with the Agency's experts will allow us to improve the implementation of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme,\" said Mi\u0142osz Motyka, Undersecretary of State for the Ministry of Climate and Environment of Poland.\n\nBased on the outcomes of the INIR mission, the IAEA and Poland will update their Integrated Workplan to continue providing coordinated support in line with the future development of the country's nuclear power programme.\n\nIn September 2023, Poland also hosted an IAEA Integrated Regulatory Review Service mission, which found that Poland's nuclear regulatory framework is in line with IAEA safety standards and that its regulatory body is competent and prepared for the launch of the country's nuclear power programme.\n\nAbout INIR Missions\n\nINIR missions are based on the IAEA Milestones Approach, with its 19 infrastructure issues, three phases (consider, prepare and construct) and three milestones (decide, contract and commission/operate). INIR missions enable IAEA Member State representatives to have in-depth discussions with international experts about experiences and best practices in different countries.\n\nIn developing its recommendations, the INIR team considers the comments made by the relevant national organizations. Implementation of any of the team's recommendations and suggestions is at the discretion of the Member State requesting the mission. The results of the INIR mission are expected to help the Member State develop an action plan to fill any gaps, which in turn will help the development of the national nuclear infrastructure.

The PNPP was approved in January 2014 by the Polish Council of Ministers. The establishment of nuclear power is an objective of the Energy Policy of Poland until 2040, which sets the framework for the country's energy transition to strengthen energy security and to reduce reliance on coal power plants to meet climate goals. In 2022, the Polish Government announced that the country's first nuclear power plant will be comprised of three Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, and it expects the first unit to be commissioned in 2033.\n\nThe Phase 2 Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) was carried out from 15 to 25 April, at the invitation of the Government of Poland, and hosted by the Ministry of Climate and Environment. The team reviewed the status of 19 nuclear infrastructure issues using the IAEA evaluation methodology for Phase 2 of the Milestones Approach, which evaluates the readiness of a country to make a knowledgeable commitment to a nuclear power programme.\n\nPrior to the Phase 2 INIR mission, Poland prepared a self-evaluation report covering all 19 nuclear power infrastructure issues and submitted the report and supporting documents to the IAEA. The team comprised of three experts from Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, as well as seven IAEA staff.\n\nThe team identified good practices that would benefit other countries developing nuclear power in the areas of contracting approach, strategic approach to funding, early authorization of technical support organizations to support the nuclear regulator, engagement with the electrical grid operator, stakeholder involvement and industrial involvement.\n\n\"The Polish nuclear power programme was initiated with clear objectives and is progressing towards the construction stage in a structured way,\" said mission team leader Mehmet Ceyhan, Technical Lead of the IAEA Nuclear Infrastructure Development Section. \"We observed strong and dedicated teams in each of the key organizations that will help to achieve the government's objectives for the PNPP.\"\n\nThe team also made recommendations and suggestions aimed at assisting Poland in making further progress in the development of its nuclear infrastructure and its readiness to build the first nuclear power plant in the country. The team highlighted areas where further actions would benefit Poland, including the need to further review its legal and regulatory framework, and finalize the preparatory work required for the contracting and construction stages.\n\n\"Poland's cooperation with the IAEA is a long-term collaboration, and the review mission is extremely valuable and beneficial for the implementation and execution of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme. We would like to thank the Agency's experts for their commitment, professionalism and valuable opinions provided during the Phase 2 INIR mission. The conclusions we drew after talks with the Agency's experts will allow us to improve the implementation of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme,\" said Mi\u0142osz Motyka, Undersecretary of State for the Ministry of Climate and Environment of Poland.\n\nBased on the outcomes of the INIR mission, the IAEA and Poland will update their Integrated Workplan to continue providing coordinated support in line with the future development of the country's nuclear power programme.\n\nIn September 2023, Poland also hosted an IAEA Integrated Regulatory Review Service mission, which found that Poland's nuclear regulatory framework is in line with IAEA safety standards and that its regulatory body is competent and prepared for the launch of the country's nuclear power programme.\n\nAbout INIR Missions\n\nINIR missions are based on the IAEA Milestones Approach, with its 19 infrastructure issues, three phases (consider, prepare and construct) and three milestones (decide, contract and commission/operate). INIR missions enable IAEA Member State representatives to have in-depth discussions with international experts about experiences and best practices in different countries.\n\nIn developing its recommendations, the INIR team considers the comments made by the relevant national organizations. Implementation of any of the team's recommendations and suggestions is at the discretion of the Member State requesting the mission. The results of the INIR mission are expected to help the Member State develop an action plan to fill any gaps, which in turn will help the development of the national nuclear infrastructure. INIR follow-up missions assess the implementation of the recommendations and suggestions provided during the main mission.\n\n/Public Release.

Newsweek has contacted the Iranian foreign ministry and the IAEA for comment.\n\nThe IAEA is set to meet senior Iranian officials in May following alarm at comments made on April 18 by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander in charge of nuclear security, Ahmad Haghtalab.\n\nHaghtalab said that \"the threats of the Zionist regime (Israel) against Iran's nuclear facilities make it possible to review our nuclear doctrine,\" according to the Tasnim news agency, cited by Reuters.\n\nHaghtalab did not give further details but warned an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities would be reciprocated. Iran launched 300 drones and missiles on Israel earlier this month in response to an Israeli strike in Syria that killed two Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp. commanders. Israel responded with a more limited attack.\n\nThe comments by such a high-ranking Iranian official as Haghtalab \"are a source of concern,\" IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said Wednesday, according to Bloomberg. \"The Middle East is in a very fragile situation.\"\n\nIran's stock of enriched uranium, which was capped at 202.8 kg under the 2015 deal, was 5.5 tonnes as of February, according to the IAEA's latest quarterly report.

The IAEA spotlighted its work on calibrations, auditing, radiation dosimetry and clinical medical radiation physics. Staff presented accomplishments from the previous biennium; planned activities for the current one; and ideas for the next. They also highlighted cross-sectional, collaborative activities as they addressed the committee's questions on IAEA technical outputs - be it on publications, education and training activities, coordinated research projects (CRP) or data, to name but a few.\n\n\"Overall, there has been a fantastic, continued achievement\", Jan Seuntjens - the Committee's Chair - reflected. \"The impact of this is often understated. Initiatives like Rays of Hope cannot be successful without medical physics and the infrastructure that has been set up around the world by the IAEA.\"\n\nThe Committee - which consists of seven internationally renowned experts in the field - meets every two years to assess the IAEA's work and provide independent, external advice. First established in 1986 to review the activities of the IAEA's Dosimetry Laboratory (DOL), the Committee expanded its scope in 1988 to include all IAEA dosimetry and medical physics activities. Its recommendations are not only shared with the Directors General of the IAEA and WHO but also used to inform programme planning.\n\nA Biennium in Review: Key Highlights\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, the IAEA/WHO Network of SSDLs calibrated 134 ionization chambers and issued 269 calibration certificates to laboratories in 39 Member States, the Agency reported. Through these critical services, the Network improved accuracy in dosimetry measurements; facilitated traceability between end users (such as hospital staff) and the international measurement system for ionizing radiation; and achieved consistency across all countries. The IAEA also supported the upgrading of 18 SSDLs and the establishment of national calibration laboratories in seven countries.\n\nFor its part, the IAEA/WHO postal dose audit programme checked 1429 beams in 503 hospitals - helping with the safety and accuracy of radiotherapy treatments for cancer patients in 78 countries. DOL also expanded its audit options and received an increase in audit requests from Member States.\n\nTo further support countries, the IAEA published the guideline National Networks for Radiotherapy Dosimetry Audits. This resource joined four SSDL Newsletters and ten other publications, including:\n\nHandbook of Basic Quality Control Tests for Diagnostic Radiology, which was the most downloaded IAEA book in 2023; Artificial Intelligence in Medical Physics: Roles, Responsibilities, Education and Training of Clinically Qualified Medical Physicists, which helps medical physicists around the world meet the challenges of the present and the demands of the future; and Dosimetry in Brachytherapy - An International Code of Practice for Secondary Standards Dosimetry Laboratories and Hospitals, which will have significant impact on the quality and standardisation of radiation globally.\n\nAmong other things, the IAEA continued its dosimetry and medical physics research under five CRPs; assisted on 46 national, regional and interregional trainings; and supported nearly 400 technical cooperation projects, it was reported.\n\nThe IAEA also helped bring attention to an urgent global need. Data from its DIrectory of RAdiotherapy Centres (DIRAC) - the most comprehensive database on radiotherapy resources - enabled the World Intellectual Property Organization to reveal an alarming trend through its 2023 Global Innovation Index: cancer cases requiring radiotherapy are outpacing available technology. DIRAC data also show that only 20.9 per cent of countries met the minimum radiotherapy resource requirements in 2022.\n\nThis disparity is why the IAEA launched its Rays of Hope initiative, aimed at increasing access to radiotherapy in countries with little or no access to this technology. In supporting that flagship initiative's implementation, IAEA dosimetry and medical physics experts provided technical input to several projects; helped outline the process for setting up Anchor Centres; and conducted in-depth reviews of potential centres. They also contributed to the IAEA's efforts in securing collaborative partnerships with academia and industry.\n\n\"The IAEA's continued success has no doubt been possible because of its greatest resource: its staff. Through their dedication, professionalism and commitment, they have supported Member States and played a vital role in implementation - from providing technical expertise in technical cooperation projects worldwide to facilitating the establishment of Rays of Hope Anchor Centres,\" May Abdel-Wahab, the Director of the IAEA Division of Human Health, emphasized. \"They have advanced and ensured high-quality care through highly recognised guidance documents, publications and award-winning research.\"\n\nA full report of the Committee's proceedings and recommendations will be published in a forthcoming IAEA SSDL Newsletter.\n\nIAEA staff together with members of the Scientific Committee of the IAEA/WHO Network of SSDLs.

(Photo: Ministry of Climate and Environment of Poland)\n\nPoland is making progress towards adding nuclear power to its energy mix, including in developing the necessary infrastructure for a safe and sustainable nuclear power programme, according to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) review mission.\n\nAn IAEA team of experts today concluded an 11-day mission to Poland to review its infrastructure development for the Polish Nuclear Power Programme (PNPP). The PNPP was approved in January 2014 by the Polish Council of Ministers. The establishment of nuclear power is an objective of the Energy Policy of Poland until 2040, which sets the framework for the country's energy transition to strengthen energy security and to reduce reliance on coal power plants to meet climate goals. In 2022, the Polish Government announced that the country's first nuclear power plant will be comprised of three Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, and it expects the first unit to be commissioned in 2033.\n\nThe Phase 2 Integrated Nuclear Infrastructure Review (INIR) was carried out from 15 to 25 April, at the invitation of the Government of Poland, and hosted by the Ministry of Climate and Environment. The team reviewed the status of 19 nuclear infrastructure issues using the IAEA evaluation methodology for Phase 2 of the Milestones Approach, which evaluates the readiness of a country to make a knowledgeable commitment to a nuclear power programme.\n\nPrior to the Phase 2 INIR mission, Poland prepared a self-evaluation report covering all 19 nuclear power infrastructure issues and submitted the report and supporting documents to the IAEA. The team comprised of three experts from Brazil, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, as well as seven IAEA staff.\n\nThe team identified good practices that would benefit other countries developing nuclear power in the areas of contracting approach, strategic approach to funding, early authorization of technical support organizations to support the nuclear regulator, engagement with the electrical grid operator, stakeholder involvement and industrial involvement.\n\n\"The Polish nuclear power programme was initiated with clear objectives and is progressing towards the construction stage in a structured way,\" said mission team leader Mehmet Ceyhan, Technical Lead of the IAEA Nuclear Infrastructure Development Section. \"We observed strong and dedicated teams in each of the key organizations that will help to achieve the government's objectives for the PNPP.\"\n\nThe team also made recommendations and suggestions aimed at assisting Poland in making further progress in the development of its nuclear infrastructure and its readiness to build the first nuclear power plant in the country. The team highlighted areas where further actions would benefit Poland, including the need to further review its legal and regulatory framework, and finalize the preparatory work required for the contracting and construction stages.\n\n\"Poland's cooperation with the IAEA is a long-term collaboration, and the review mission is extremely valuable and beneficial for the implementation and execution of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme. We would like to thank the Agency's experts for their commitment, professionalism and valuable opinions provided during the Phase 2 INIR mission. The conclusions we drew after talks with the Agency's experts will allow us to improve the implementation of the Polish Nuclear Power Programme,\" said Miosz Motyka, Undersecretary of State for the Ministry of Climate and Environment of Poland.\n\nBased on the outcomes of the INIR mission, the IAEA and Poland will update their Integrated Workplan to continue providing coordinated support in line with the future development of the country's nuclear power programme.\n\nIn September 2023, Poland also hosted an IAEA Integrated Regulatory Review Service mission, which found that Poland's nuclear regulatory framework is in line with IAEA safety standards and that its regulatory body is competent and prepared for the launch of the country's nuclear power programme.\n\nAbout INIR Missions\n\nINIR missions are based on the IAEA Milestones Approach, with its 19 infrastructure issues, three phases (consider, prepare and construct) and three milestones (decide, contract and commission/operate). INIR missions enable IAEA Member State representatives to have in-depth discussions with international experts about experiences and best practices in different countries.\n\nIn developing its recommendations, the INIR team considers the comments made by the relevant national organizations. Implementation of any of the team's recommendations and suggestions is at the discretion of the Member State requesting the mission. The results of the INIR mission are expected to help the Member State develop an action plan to fill any gaps, which in turn will help the development of the national nuclear infrastructure. INIR follow-up missions assess the implementation of the recommendations and suggestions provided during the main mission.", "source": {"uri": "polandsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Poland Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "K\u00f6ppen climate classification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "International Atomic Energy Agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nuclear power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal-fired_power_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coal-fired power station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obninsk_Nuclear_Power_Plant", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP1000", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AP1000"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_mix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy mix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Climate change mitigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Energy security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "States of Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_the_European_Union", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Council of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_grid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electrical grid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Regulatory agency"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Nuclear", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear_Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Nuclear Pharmacy", "wgt": 23}], "image": "https://cdn.bignewsnetwork.com/YjA0NWVmZTMtMmZ.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9512923", "eventUri": "eng-9512923", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-15", "dateEnd": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 1292, "textEnd": 1306}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-25", "textStart": 207, "textEnd": 215}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-01-", "textStart": 708, "textEnd": 720}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 451765709, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 9, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 9}}}

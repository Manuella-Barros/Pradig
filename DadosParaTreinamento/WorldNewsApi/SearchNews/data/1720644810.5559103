The opportunity for things to go horribly wrong when people solve simple letter puzzles is part of its charm. With Pat Sajak bidding audiences farewell on his last show as the host, here\u2019s a look back at some of the funniest fails and viral moments throughout his run on the series. \u201cSelf-Potato\u201d The best Wheel of Fortune fails come from puzzles where the answer is entirely obvious. What also becomes obvious in many of these moments is just how crucial good spelling is. In this blunder, the contestant guessed \u201cself-potato\u201d for a puzzle, which is clearly solved by \u201cself-portrait.\u201d \u201cRight in the butt\u201d Despite the fact that the game show airs in primetime, a lot of Wheel of Fortune fails can be attributed to contestants guessing something less than family-friendly. Lest Pat Sajak depart the show without one more blunder, a recent contestant solved a puzzle by suggesting the phrase was \u201cRight in the butt!\u201d Not only was it the wrong guess, but the puzzle didn\u2019t even have enough letters for this to be plausible. The contestant looked embarrassed as his cohorts eventually worked the puzzle down. When solved, it read, \u201cThis is the best!\u201d Looking away goes wrong After one contestant guesses the puzzle and says \u201cDon\u2019t look away,\u201d Sajak says, \u201cNo.\u201d The other contestants start congratulating the first on guessing the puzzle while Sajak continues to say no. The puzzle expires before they realize the guess was actually incorrect, with the correct answer reading, \u201cCan\u2019t look away.\u201d Without a paddle After one contestant incorrectly guessed \u201cpaddle boat\u201d in a puzzle, the next had a surprisingly hard time solving the puzzle. The Wheel of Fortune puzzle read, \u201cRenting a pedal boat.\u201d Not realizing until it was too late, the second contestant guessed the same phrase, to the slight frustration of the host. Annunciation is important One woman is told she didn\u2019t solve the puzzle correctly because of a technicality. Because of her accent, the woman allegedly left the \u201cg\u201d off of \u201cseven swans a-swimming.\u201d When the next player confusedly added letters to the board and guessed the same, everyone looked confused. Sajak provided an explanation that seemed bogus to many. Celebrity Wheel of Fortune practically leans into fails In an episode of Wheel of Fortune featuring celebrity contestants Paul Scheer, Luenell and Mary Lynn Rajskub, the contestants had an embarrassingly hard time solving an almost-complete puzzle. Despite the fact that the solution was \u201cthrilling waterslides,\u201d each contestant tried to solve the puzzle, but left off the \u201cS,\u201d making their answer technically incorrect. Scheer was the first to realize the error of his ways and white-knuckled it until he could right the wrong. Ad-libbing gone wrong In another episode with celebrity contestants, Michael Rapaport is excited to solve a puzzle that reads, \u201cEating horseradish with Tiffany Haddish.\u201d Unfortunately, in his excitement, he added in the words \u201cmy girl,\u201d which invalidated his answer, leaving the gates open for June Diane Raphael to solve it. You can\u2019t miss any words either While adding words makes a puzzle solution incorrect, so too does missing them. As one woman goes to solve \u201cTaking some time for myself,\u201d she says, \u201cTaking time for myself\u201d instead. Sajak tells her she\u2019s wrong and she looks confused for a beat until she realizes what happened. It\u2019s one of the Wheel of Fortune fails where you can see a contestant kicking themselves seconds after the words come out of their mouths. It\u2019s every contestant for themselves You can make it to the final round thanks to the mess-ups of others, but once you get there, it\u2019s all you. Some of Wheel of Fortune fails that really stick out are the ones that come from a contestant blanking as the clock ticks down. One contestant seemed horrified to have guessed \u201cmagic hand\u201d and \u201cmagic band\u201d before the correct answer, \u201cmagic wand.\u201d Wheel of Fortune\u2018s finest solve Not all of the best moments from the show were Wheel of Fortune fails. Some were incredible solves, like this one where a woman solves the prize puzzle, a phrase, after guessing just a single letter. It reads, \u201cI\u2019ve got a good feeling about this,\u201d which she said she did! The internet is chaotic\u2014but we\u2019ll break it down for you in one daily email.

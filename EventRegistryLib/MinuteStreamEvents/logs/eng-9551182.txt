Unraveling the Powerful Factors Behind the Plunge - Travel And Tour World", "body": "Airbnb's rollercoaster earnings ride: Surging in Q1 but projecting a Q2 fall short, causing an 8% stock drop post-market.\n\nAirbnb revealed a surge in quarterly earnings on Wednesday but projected that its revenue for the upcoming quarter would fall short of market expectations, resulting in an 8% drop in stock price post-market.\n\nDuring the first quarter, travel companies experienced a boost in earnings, primarily driven by increased travel demands in regions outside North America, particularly in Asia-Pacific and Latin America.\n\nFor the first quarter, Airbnb saw its revenue climb 18% from the previous year, reaching $2.14 billion. However, for the upcoming quarter, the company anticipates revenue to be in the range of $2.68 billion to $2.74 billion, which is slightly below the $2.74 billion forecast by analysts. This forecast is influenced by factors such as foreign exchange rates and the timing of the Easter holiday.\n\nThe Easter holiday contributed positively to the first quarter's performance as travel activity increased, but it is expected to have a reverse effect on the second quarter's bookings, according to Airbnb.\n\nThe number of nights and experiences booked during the first quarter rose by 9.5% from the previous year to approximately $133 million. This increase was fueled by a significant growth in bookings from the Asia-Pacific and Latin America regions, which saw increases of 21% and 19%, respectively. Meanwhile, bookings in North America showed a slight deceleration.\n\nAirbnb, headquartered in San Francisco, reported a net income of $264 million, or 41 cents per share, for the quarter ending in March, surpassing the analyst expectation of 24 cents per share as reported by LSEG.\n\nThe average price per night, or the average daily rate, was $173 during the quarter, marking a 3% increase from the previous year. The company noted a rise in shorter stays and the booking of entire homes, which contributed to the growth in profit margins.\n\nThe platform's active listings increased by 17% year-over-year, with significant growth in Asia and Latin America.\n\nLooking forward to the summer, Airbnb expects to see an acceleration in revenue growth in the third quarter, partly due to anticipated travel surrounding international events such as the Olympics and Euro Cup.", "source": {"uri": "travelandtourworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Travel And Tour World"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profit_margin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Profit margin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cent_(currency)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cent (currency)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/American-Globe.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551182", "eventUri": "eng-9551182", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

The industry's recovery has been choppy, with demand growing faster in some regions and tapering off in others due to the different pace of reopening from lockdowns. Last week, Booking Holdings Inc. gave worse-than-expected guidance and Expedia Group Inc. issued disappointing results.\n\nAirbnb, which specializes in shared homes and vacation rentals both in urban cities and rural destinations, saw a deceleration in North American nights booked in the first quarter. It has been making an effort through its marketing to differentiate its rentals from hotels in the hopes that people traveling in groups will opt to rent homes with multiple bedrooms. The company said that bookings for groups of six or more people were the fastest-growing segment in the region.\n\nGrowth in the current period for nights and experiences booked -- a key industry metric -- will be \"relatively stable\" compared with the 9.5 percent gain it posted in the first quarter. That falls short of analysts' expectations for a roughly 12 percent increase. It also represents the slowest rate of growth since 2020, suggesting that overall demand has normalized after an initial post-pandemic travel boom.\n\nThe outlook overshadowed an otherwise better-than-expected report for the first quarter, which saw revenue surpass estimates, growing 18 percent to $2.14 billion thanks to particularly strong gains in Asia and Latin America.\n\nThe company is expecting revenue growth to re-accelerate in the third quarter, as key international events like the summer Olympics in Paris and the Euro Cup in Germany are fueling travel demand in the peak summer season.\n\nThe continued recovery in international travel has been a bright spot for the travel industry including Airbnb, whose businesses in Latin America and Asia have seen faster growth than in the United States. It has also been investing more in less mature markets in those regions to drive near-term gains, including the introduction of limited-edition stays inspired by local cultural icons.\n\nChief executive Brian Chesky has said that the company he cofounded in 2007 is ready to expand beyond its core product after spending the past year refining existing offerings. In particular, the company has been focused on making listings more reliable and affordable for guests, as well as encouraging more people to host.\n\nThat work has been paying off. The number of active listings in the first quarter grew 15 percent year-over-year and supply has continued to grow at a double-digit pace across all regions. That's in spite of the company removing thousands of listings in the first quarter that did not meet guest expectations.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbnb", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Airbnb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 lockdowns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booking_Holdings", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Booking Holdings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expedia_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Expedia Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacation_rental", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vacation rental"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metric system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Chesky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Chesky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oil refinery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/VbuiXRo6cL1ZLRSqfwj4vde5vYw=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/2YB77NQMJLZ25L6SY265VUV7KU.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551182", "eventUri": "eng-9551182", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-05-", "textStart": 65, "textEnd": 71}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

Very soon after she left, the doorbell rang. This was odd because we lived on a hill with only two neighbours (we all kept to ourselves) and we just... didn't get random visitors. Thanks to some conveniently placed picture frames, I could see out the door without being seen. I look out and see a young man I don't recognise. He's dressed in a tshirt and jeans and something just feels... off. So I ignore him and wait for him to leave.\" \"But he doesn't. He lingers and starts smoking. Again, this is an isolated hill, I'm alone, and now I'm getting scared. I go and hide and plan to wait for my mum. Except she JUST left, had a few errands to run, and I couldn't reach the phone without the guy seeing me. As I'm trying to figure out what to do my mum comes home. She runs in and asks if I'm okay. Apparently she got this random 'go home NOW' urge. She hadn't even run her first errand yet but turned around immediately. Found the guy in our yard and asked what he needed. I guess he muttered something about looking for someone, or something to that effect, and my mum told him to leave. Apparently he was acting very strangely. To this day I have no idea what he wanted, and no idea how my mum knew to come home. But I am VERY grateful she did.\"", "summary": "<h1>\"This big branch fell off of their pine tree onto the table where we were sitting.\"</h1><p><img src=\"https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/7/7/enhanced/8efbe5c9181c/original-963-1717747072-4.jpg?crop=1245:830;3,0\" /></p><hr /><p><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/elizabeth_cotton/scary-gut-feeling-stories\">View Entire Post &rsaquo;</a></p>", "url": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/elizabeth_cotton/scary-gut-feeling-stories", "image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2024-06/7/8/campaign_images/db2a82f47507/several-months-later-he-murdered-her-in-that-same-3-2148-1717747588-2_dblbig.jpg?resize=1200:*", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:05:02", "author": "Elizabeth Cotton,https://www.buzzfeed.com/about", "authors": ["Elizabeth Cotton", "https://www.buzzfeed.com/about"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.625}

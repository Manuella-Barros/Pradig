The 4-day storm delivered as much as 10 feet of snow and wind gusts up to 190 mph in the Sierra Nevada, eliminating a 'snow drought' and significantly boosting the snowpack. On average, the Sierra Nevada snowpack melt provides about 30% of California's crucial water supply in a state which only recovered from drought last year.

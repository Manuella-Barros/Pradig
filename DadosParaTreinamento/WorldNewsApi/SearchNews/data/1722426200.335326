Bill Maher shuts down Tulsi Gabbard on Trump's election lies", "text": "Bill Maher and onetime MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews on Friday joined forces against former Democratic U.S. representative Tulsi Gabbard in a discussion about Donald Trump's ongoing election denialism. Matthews started off the discussion by asking Gabbard about Trump's tendency to reject anything he doesn't win. \" Trump did not admit he lost the election in 2020... You have to say, 'I lost,' because that makes the system work,\" Matthews said on Friday. ALSO READ: Rep. Byron Donalds, his gigantic Jim Crow myth and a forgotten fact about Black voters Maher said it was a good question for Gabbard, who supports Trump's presidential ambitions and frequently targets Joe Biden. Gabbard's response, however, called Biden \"insane\" and called out the current president's claim that climate change is the biggest \"existential threat\" to Americans. She said the \"true existential threat\" is that we are close to a nuclear war. Maher said that nuclear war is a threat, and that so is artificial intelligence and other things. Matthews chimed in, \"And Trump is a threat.\" The host then said he wanted to get back to the question that was asked. \"You haven't answered and I want you to,\" Maher said. He then asked her again about if Gabbard should support someone who can't admit he lost the election. \"What you've heard from Trump is the same thing you've heard from Hillary Clinton,\" Gabbard said. \"That's over there, Tulsi,\" Maher said Friday evening, before reading a statement on the security of the 2020 election. Gabbard said Trump has vowed to accept the results \"if it's a free and fair election.\" \"I just read it to you! This was a free and fair one, so he obviously doesn't admit that he's lost when it's free and fair,\" Maher said, asking, \"Why would it be different this time?\"", "summary": "<img src=\"https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=24811087&width=1200&height=800&coordinates=77%2C0%2C78%2C0\"/><br/><br/><p>Bill Maher and onetime MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews on Friday joined forces against former Democratic U.S. representative Tulsi Gabbard in a discussion about Donald Trump's ongoing election denialism. </p><p>Matthews started off the discussion by asking Gabbard about Trump's tendency to reject anything he doesn't win.</p><p>\"Trump did not admit he lost the election in 2020...

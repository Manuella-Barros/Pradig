The Biden administration also said it's strongly opposed because it says safeguards already are in place to verify voter eligibility and enforce the law against noncitizens trying to cast ballots.\n\nStill, the House vote will give Republicans an opportunity to bring attention to two of their central issues in the 2024 race - border and election security. They also are using Democratic opposition to the bill as fuel for former President Donald Trump's claims that Democrats have encouraged the surge of migrants so they can get them to register and vote, which would be illegal. Noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections, nor is it allowed for any statewide elections.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a key backer of the bill, said in a news conference earlier this week that the Democratic opposition means many Democrats \"want illegals to participate in our federal elections; they want them to vote.\"\n\nDuring a speech Wednesday previewing the expected House debate, he called the vote a \"generation-defining moment.\"\n\n\"If just a small percentage, a fraction of a fraction of all those illegals that Joe Biden has brought in here to vote, if they do vote, it wouldn't just change one race,\" he said. \"It might potentially change all of our races.\"\n\nOn his Truth Social platform this week, Trump suggested that Democrats are pushing to give noncitizen migrants the right to vote and urged Republicans to pass the legislation -- the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act -- or \"go home and cry yourself to sleep.\"\n\nThe fixation on noncitizen voting is part of a broader and long-term Trump campaign strategy of casting doubt on the validity of an election should he lose, and he has consistently pushed that narrative during his campaign rallies this year. Last month in Las Vegas, he told supporters, \"The only way they can beat us is to cheat.\" It also is part of a wider Republican campaign strategy, with GOP lawmakers across the country passing state legislation and putting noncitizen voting measures on state ballots for November.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights advocates have said the legislation is unnecessary because it's already a felony for noncitizens to register to vote in federal elections, punishable by fines, prison or deportation. Anyone registering must attest under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. Noncitizens also are not allowed to cast ballots at the state level. A handful of municipalities allow them to vote in some local elections.\n\n\"For all their hysterical rhetoric around the SAVE Act, Republicans have one real purpose here - to continue to erode the confidence of Americans in our election systems,\" said Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee.\n\nThey also have pointed to surveys showing that millions of Americans don't have easy access to up-to-date documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport, and therefore the bill could inhibit U.S. citizen voters who aren't able to further prove their status.\n\nIf the bill were to pass, \"it would not safeguard American voting eligibility but immediately disenfranchise millions of American citizens,\" said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of voting rights at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nYet Republicans who support the bill say the recent unprecedented surge of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border creates too large a risk of noncitizens slipping through the cracks. They could purposely or inadvertently break the law to cast ballots that sway races amid narrow margins in November's elections.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require noncitizens to be removed from state voter rolls and require new applicants to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. It also would require states to establish a process for applicants who can't show proof to provide other evidence beyond their attestation of citizenship, though it's unclear what that evidence could include.\n\nResearch and audits in several states show that there have been incidences of noncitizens who successfully registered to vote and cast ballots, although it happens rarely and is typically by mistake. States have mechanisms to check for it, although there isn't one standard protocol they all follow.\n\nFor example, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose recently found 137 suspected noncitizens on the state's rolls -- out of roughly 8 million voters -- and said he was taking action to confirm and remove them.\n\nIn 2022, Georgia's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, conducted an audit of his state's voter rolls specifically looking for noncitizens. His office found that 1,634 had attempted to register to vote over a period of 25 years, but election officials had caught all the applications and none had been able to register.\n\nIn North Carolina in 2016, an audit of elections found that 41 legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total ballots cast. The votes didn't make a difference in any of the state's elections.\n\nIn a document supporting the bill, Johnson listed other examples of noncitizens who had been removed from the rolls in Boston and Virginia. The elections departments there didn't immediately answer questions from The Associated Press to verify the claims.\n\nSeveral secretaries of state, interviewed during their summer conference in Puerto Rico this week, said noncitizens attempting to register and vote is not a big problem in their state.\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said that his state already requires photo ID to vote and that most people use a driver's license. The state does not allow noncitizens living in the country illegally to get driver's licenses, and he said only a \"tiny universe\" of noncitizen legal residents can get one.\n\nAs a result, \"we don't really have a problem with this in my state,\" he said in an interview.\n\nUtah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican who oversees elections, said she supports the legislation in concept but provided a cautionary tale about how aggressively culling voter rolls can sometimes result in the removal of qualified voters. A few years ago, everyone in her household received mail ballots for a municipal election, except her. She had been removed from the rolls because she had been born in the Netherlands, where her father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\"I was the lieutenant governor, I was overseeing elections, and I got taken off because I was born in the Netherlands,\" she said, \"So I think we definitely have those checks and balances in the state of Utah, maybe to an extreme.\"\n\nThe House vote comes days after the Republican National Committee released its party platform, which emphasizes border security issues and takes a stand against Democrats giving \"voting rights\" to migrants living in the country illegally.\n\nRepublicans are expected to shine a light on their immigration and election integrity concerns at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee, where Trump is scheduled to accept his third straight nomination for president.\n\nSwenson reported from New York.

Cassidy in San Juan, Puerto Rico, contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

The Biden administration also said it's strongly opposed because it says safeguards already are in place to verify voter eligibility and enforce the law against noncitizens trying to cast ballots.\n\nStill, the House vote will give Republicans an opportunity to bring attention to two of their central issues in the 2024 race - border and election security. They also are using Democratic opposition to the bill as fuel for former President Donald Trump's claims that Democrats have encouraged the surge of migrants so they can get them to register and vote, which would be illegal. Noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections, nor is it allowed for any statewide elections.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a key backer of the bill, said in a news conference earlier this week that the Democratic opposition means many Democrats \"want illegals to participate in our federal elections; they want them to vote.\"\n\nDuring a speech Wednesday previewing the expected House debate, he called the vote a \"generation-defining moment.\"\n\n\"If just a small percentage, a fraction of a fraction of all those illegals that Joe Biden has brought in here to vote, if they do vote, it wouldn't just change one race,\" he said. \"It might potentially change all of our races.\"\n\nOn his Truth Social platform this week, Trump suggested that Democrats are pushing to give noncitizen migrants the right to vote and urged Republicans to pass the legislation -- the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act -- or \"go home and cry yourself to sleep.\"\n\nThe fixation on noncitizen voting is part of a broader and long-term Trump campaign strategy of casting doubt on the validity of an election should he lose, and he has consistently pushed that narrative during his campaign rallies this year. Last month in Las Vegas, he told supporters, \"The only way they can beat us is to cheat.\" It also is part of a wider Republican campaign strategy, with GOP lawmakers across the country passing state legislation and putting noncitizen voting measures on state ballots for November.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights advocates have said the legislation is unnecessary because it's already a felony for noncitizens to register to vote in federal elections, punishable by fines, prison or deportation. Anyone registering must attest under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. Noncitizens also are not allowed to cast ballots at the state level. A handful of municipalities allow them to vote in some local elections.\n\nThey also have pointed to surveys showing that millions of Americans don't have easy access to up-to-date documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport, and therefore the bill could inhibit U.S. citizen voters who aren't able to further prove their status.\n\nDuring a floor debate before the vote Wednesday, Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, expressed concern that the bill would disenfranchise various American citizens.\n\nHe mentioned military members stationed abroad who couldn't show documentary proof of citizenship in person at an election office, as well as married women whose names have changed, Native Americans whose tribal IDs don't show their place of birth and natural disaster survivors who have lost their personal documents.\n\nYet Republicans who support the bill say the recent unprecedented surge of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border creates too large a risk of noncitizens slipping through the cracks. They could purposely or inadvertently break the law to cast ballots that sway races amid narrow margins in November's elections.\n\n\"Every illegal vote cancels out the vote of a legal American citizen,\" Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the Republican chair of the House Administration Committee, said during the floor debate.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require noncitizens to be removed from state voter rolls and require new applicants to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. It also would require states to establish a process for applicants who can't show proof to provide other evidence beyond their attestation of citizenship, though it's unclear what that evidence could include.\n\nResearch and audits in several states show that there have been incidences of noncitizens who successfully registered to vote and cast ballots, although it happens rarely and is typically by mistake. States have mechanisms to check for it, although there isn't one standard protocol they all follow.\n\nFor example, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose recently found 137 suspected noncitizens on the state's rolls -- out of roughly 8 million voters -- and said he was taking action to confirm and remove them.\n\nIn 2022, Georgia's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, conducted an audit of his state's voter rolls specifically looking for noncitizens. His office found that 1,634 had attempted to register to vote over a period of 25 years, but election officials had caught all the applications and none had been able to register.\n\nIn North Carolina in 2016, an audit of elections found that 41 legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total ballots cast. The votes didn't make a difference in any of the state's elections.\n\nIn a document supporting the bill, Johnson listed other examples of noncitizens who had been removed from the rolls in Boston and Virginia. The elections departments there didn't immediately answer questions from The Associated Press to verify the claims.\n\nSeveral secretaries of state, interviewed during their summer conference in Puerto Rico this week, said noncitizens attempting to register and vote is not a big problem in their state.\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said that his state already requires photo ID to vote and that most people use a driver's license. The state does not allow noncitizens living in the country illegally to get driver's licenses, and he said only a \"tiny universe\" of noncitizen legal residents can get one.\n\nAs a result, \"we don't really have a problem with this in my state,\" he said in an interview.\n\nUtah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican who oversees elections, said she supports the legislation in concept but provided a cautionary tale about how aggressively culling voter rolls can sometimes result in the removal of qualified voters. A few years ago, everyone in her household received mail ballots for a municipal election, except her. She had been removed from the rolls because she had been born in the Netherlands, where her father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\"I was the lieutenant governor, I was overseeing elections, and I got taken off because I was born in the Netherlands,\" she said, \"So I think we definitely have those checks and balances in the state of Utah, maybe to an extreme.\"\n\nThe House vote comes days after the Republican National Committee released its party platform, which emphasizes border security issues and takes a stand against Democrats giving \"voting rights\" to migrants living in the country illegally.\n\nRepublicans are expected to shine a light on their immigration and election integrity concerns at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee, where Trump is scheduled to accept his third straight nomination for president.\n\n___\n\nSwenson reported from New York.

The Biden administration also said it's strongly opposed because it says safeguards already are in place to verify voter eligibility and enforce the law against noncitizens trying to cast ballots.\n\nStill, the House vote will give Republicans an opportunity to bring attention to two of their central issues in the 2024 race - border and election security. They also are using Democratic opposition to the bill as fuel for former President Donald Trump's claims that Democrats have encouraged the surge of migrants so they can get them to register and vote, which would be illegal. Noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections, nor is it allowed for any statewide elections.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a key backer of the bill, said in a news conference earlier this week that the Democratic opposition means many Democrats \"want illegals to participate in our federal elections; they want them to vote.\"\n\nDuring a speech Wednesday previewing the expected House debate, he called the vote a \"generation-defining moment.\"\n\n\"If just a small percentage, a fraction of a fraction of all those illegals that Joe Biden has brought in here to vote, if they do vote, it wouldn't just change one race,\" he said. \"It might potentially change all of our races.\"\n\nOn his Truth Social platform this week, Trump suggested that Democrats are pushing to give noncitizen migrants the right to vote and urged Republicans to pass the legislation -- the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act -- or \"go home and cry yourself to sleep.\"\n\nThe fixation on noncitizen voting is part of a broader and long-term Trump campaign strategy of casting doubt on the validity of an election should he lose, and he has consistently pushed that narrative during his campaign rallies this year. Last month in Las Vegas, he told supporters, \"The only way they can beat us is to cheat.\" It also is part of a wider Republican campaign strategy, with GOP lawmakers across the country passing state legislation and putting noncitizen voting measures on state ballots for November.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights advocates have said the legislation is unnecessary because it's already a felony for noncitizens to register to vote in federal elections, punishable by fines, prison or deportation. Anyone registering must attest under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. Noncitizens also are not allowed to cast ballots at the state level. A handful of municipalities allow them to vote in some local elections.\n\nThey also have pointed to surveys showing that millions of Americans don't have easy access to up-to-date documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport, and therefore the bill could inhibit U.S. citizen voters who aren't able to further prove their status.\n\nDuring a floor debate before the vote Wednesday, Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, expressed concern that the bill would disenfranchise various American citizens.\n\nHe mentioned military members stationed abroad who couldn't show documentary proof of citizenship in person at an election office, as well as married women whose names have changed, Native Americans whose tribal IDs don't show their place of birth and natural disaster survivors who have lost their personal documents.\n\nMorelle said he doesn't see the bill as an attempt to maintain voter rolls, but as part of larger GOP-led plans to question the validity of the upcoming election.\n\n\"The false claim that there is a conspiracy to register noncitizens is a pretext for trying to overturn the 2024 election, potentially leading to another tragedy on January 6th, 2025,\" Morelle said on the floor.\n\nYet Republicans who support the bill say the recent unprecedented surge of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border creates too large a risk of noncitizens slipping through the cracks. They could purposely or inadvertently break the law to cast ballots that sway races amid narrow margins in November's elections.\n\n\"Every illegal vote cancels out the vote of a legal American citizen,\" Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the Republican chair of the House Administration Committee, said during the floor debate.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require noncitizens to be removed from state voter rolls and require new applicants to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. It also would require states to establish a process for applicants who can't show proof to provide other evidence beyond their attestation of citizenship, though it's unclear what that evidence could include.\n\nResearch and audits in several states show that there have been incidences of noncitizens who successfully registered to vote and cast ballots, although it happens rarely and is typically by mistake. States have mechanisms to check for it, although there isn't one standard protocol they all follow.\n\nFor example, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose recently found 137 suspected noncitizens on the state's rolls -- out of roughly 8 million voters -- and said he was taking action to confirm and remove them.\n\nIn 2022, Georgia's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, conducted an audit of his state's voter rolls specifically looking for noncitizens. His office found that 1,634 had attempted to register to vote over a period of 25 years, but election officials had caught all the applications and none had been able to register.\n\nIn North Carolina in 2016, an audit of elections found that 41 legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total ballots cast. The votes didn't make a difference in any of the state's elections.\n\nIn a document supporting the bill, Johnson listed other examples of noncitizens who had been removed from the rolls in Boston and Virginia. The elections departments there didn't immediately answer questions from The Associated Press to verify the claims.\n\nSeveral secretaries of state, interviewed during their summer conference in Puerto Rico this week, said noncitizens attempting to register and vote is not a big problem in their state.\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said that his state already requires photo ID to vote and that most people use a driver's license.\n\n\"We don't really have a problem with this in my state,\" he said in an interview.\n\nUtah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican who oversees elections, said she supports the legislation in concept but provided a cautionary tale about how aggressively culling voter rolls can sometimes result in the removal of qualified voters. A few years ago, everyone in her household received mail ballots for a municipal election, except her. She had been removed from the rolls because she had been born in the Netherlands, where her father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\"I was the lieutenant governor, I was overseeing elections, and I got taken off because I was born in the Netherlands,\" she said, \"So I think we definitely have those checks and balances in the state of Utah, maybe to an extreme.\"\n\nThe House vote comes days after the Republican National Committee released its party platform, which emphasizes border security issues and takes a stand against Democrats giving \"voting rights\" to migrants living in the country illegally.\n\nRepublicans are expected to shine a light on their immigration and election integrity concerns at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee, where Trump is scheduled to accept his third straight nomination for president.\n\n___\n\nSwenson reported from New York.

The Biden administration also said it's strongly opposed because it says safeguards already are in place to verify voter eligibility and enforce the law against noncitizens trying to cast ballots.\n\nStill, the House vote will give Republicans an opportunity to bring attention to two of their central issues in the 2024 race - border and election security. They also are using Democratic opposition to the bill as fuel for former President Donald Trump's claims that Democrats have encouraged the surge of migrants so they can get them to register and vote, which would be illegal. Noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections, nor is it allowed for any statewide elections.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a key backer of the bill, said in a news conference earlier this week that the Democratic opposition means many Democrats \"want illegals to participate in our federal elections; they want them to vote.\"\n\nDuring a speech Wednesday previewing the expected House debate, he called the vote a \"generation-defining moment.\"\n\n\"If just a small percentage, a fraction of a fraction of all those illegals that Joe Biden has brought in here to vote, if they do vote, it wouldn't just change one race,\" he said. \"It might potentially change all of our races.\"\n\nOn his Truth Social platform this week, Trump suggested that Democrats are pushing to give noncitizen migrants the right to vote and urged Republicans to pass the legislation -- the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act -- or \"go home and cry yourself to sleep.\"\n\nThe fixation on noncitizen voting is part of a broader and long-term Trump campaign strategy of casting doubt on the validity of an election should he lose, and he has consistently pushed that narrative during his campaign rallies this year. Last month in Las Vegas, he told supporters, \"The only way they can beat us is to cheat.\" It also is part of a wider Republican campaign strategy, with GOP lawmakers across the country passing state legislation and putting noncitizen voting measures on state ballots for November.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights advocates have said the legislation is unnecessary because it's already a felony for noncitizens to register to vote in federal elections, punishable by fines, prison or deportation. Anyone registering must attest under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. Noncitizens also are not allowed to cast ballots at the state level. A handful of municipalities allow them to vote in some local elections.\n\nThey also have pointed to surveys showing that millions of Americans don't have easy access to up-to-date documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport, and therefore the bill could inhibit U.S. citizen voters who aren't able to further prove their status.\n\nDuring a floor debate before the vote Wednesday, Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, expressed concern that the bill would disenfranchise various American citizens.\n\nHe mentioned military members stationed abroad who couldn't show documentary proof of citizenship in person at an election office, as well as married women whose names have changed, Native Americans whose tribal IDs don't show their place of birth and natural disaster survivors who have lost their personal documents.\n\nMorelle said he doesn't see the bill as an attempt to maintain voter rolls, but as part of larger GOP-led plans to question the validity of the upcoming election.\n\n\"The false claim that there is a conspiracy to register noncitizens is a pretext for trying to overturn the 2024 election, potentially leading to another tragedy on January 6th, 2025,\" Morelle said on the floor.\n\nYet Republicans who support the bill say the recent unprecedented surge of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border creates too large a risk of noncitizens slipping through the cracks. They could purposely or inadvertently break the law to cast ballots that sway races amid narrow margins in November's elections.\n\n\"Every illegal vote cancels out the vote of a legal American citizen,\" Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the Republican chair of the House Administration Committee, said during the floor debate.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require noncitizens to be removed from state voter rolls and require new applicants to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. It also would require states to establish a process for applicants who can't show proof to provide other evidence beyond their attestation of citizenship, though it's unclear what that evidence could include.\n\nResearch and audits in several states show that there have been incidences of noncitizens who successfully registered to vote and cast ballots, although it happens rarely and is typically by mistake. States have mechanisms to check for it, although there isn't one standard protocol they all follow.\n\nFor example, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose recently found 137 suspected noncitizens on the state's rolls -- out of roughly 8 million voters -- and said he was taking action to confirm and remove them.\n\nIn 2022, Georgia's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, conducted an audit of his state's voter rolls specifically looking for noncitizens. His office found that 1,634 had attempted to register to vote over a period of 25 years, but election officials had caught all the applications and none had been able to register.\n\nIn North Carolina in 2016, an audit of elections found that 41 legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total ballots cast. The votes didn't make a difference in any of the state's elections.\n\nIn a document supporting the bill, Johnson listed other examples of noncitizens who had been removed from the rolls in Boston and Virginia. The elections departments there didn't immediately answer questions from The Associated Press to verify the claims.\n\nSeveral secretaries of state, interviewed during their summer conference in Puerto Rico this week, said noncitizens attempting to register and vote is not a big problem in their state.\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said that his state already requires photo ID to vote and that most people use a driver's license.\n\n\"We don't really have a problem with this in my state,\" he said in an interview.\n\nUtah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican who oversees elections, said she supports the legislation in concept but provided a cautionary tale about how aggressively culling voter rolls can sometimes result in the removal of qualified voters. A few years ago, everyone in her household received mail ballots for a municipal election, except her. She had been removed from the rolls because she had been born in the Netherlands, where her father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\"I was the lieutenant governor, I was overseeing elections, and I got taken off because I was born in the Netherlands,\" she said, \"So I think we definitely have those checks and balances in the state of Utah, maybe to an extreme.\"\n\nThe House vote comes days after the Republican National Committee released its party platform, which emphasizes border security issues and takes a stand against Democrats giving \"voting rights\" to migrants living in the country illegally.\n\nRepublicans are expected to shine a light on their immigration and election integrity concerns at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee, where Trump is scheduled to accept his third straight nomination for president.\n\n___\n\nSwenson reported from New York.

Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee.\n\nThey also have pointed to surveys showing that millions of Americans don't have easy access to up-to-date documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport, and therefore the bill could inhibit U.S. citizen voters who aren't able to further prove their status.\n\nIf the bill were to pass, \"it would not safeguard American voting eligibility but immediately disenfranchise millions of American citizens,\" said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of voting rights at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nYet Republicans who support the bill say the recent unprecedented surge of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border creates too large a risk of noncitizens slipping through the cracks. They could purposely or inadvertently break the law to cast ballots that sway races amid narrow margins in November's elections.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require noncitizens to be removed from state voter rolls and require new applicants to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. It also would require states to establish a process for applicants who can't show proof to provide other evidence beyond their attestation of citizenship, though it's unclear what that evidence could include.\n\nResearch and audits in several states show that there have been incidences of noncitizens who successfully registered to vote and cast ballots, although it happens rarely and is typically by mistake. States have mechanisms to check for it, although there isn't one standard protocol they all follow.\n\nFor example, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose recently found 137 suspected noncitizens on the state's rolls -- out of roughly 8 million voters -- and said he was taking action to confirm and remove them.\n\nIn 2022, Georgia's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, conducted an audit of his state's voter rolls specifically looking for noncitizens. His office found that 1,634 had attempted to register to vote over a period of 25 years, but election officials had caught all the applications and none had been able to register.\n\nIn North Carolina in 2016, an audit of elections found that 41 legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total ballots cast. The votes didn't make a difference in any of the state's elections.\n\nIn a document supporting the bill, Johnson listed other examples of noncitizens who had been removed from the rolls in Boston and Virginia. The elections departments there didn't immediately answer questions from The Associated Press to verify the claims.\n\nSeveral secretaries of state, interviewed during their summer conference in Puerto Rico this week, said noncitizens attempting to register and vote is not a big problem in their state.\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said that his state already requires photo ID to vote and that most people use a driver's license. The state does not allow noncitizens living in the country illegally to get driver's licenses, and he said only a \"tiny universe\" of noncitizen legal residents can get one.\n\nAs a result, \"we don't really have a problem with this in my state,\" he said in an interview.\n\nUtah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican who oversees elections, said she supports the legislation in concept but provided a cautionary tale about how aggressively culling voter rolls can sometimes result in the removal of qualified voters. A few years ago, everyone in her household received mail ballots for a municipal election, except her. She had been removed from the rolls because she had been born in the Netherlands, where her father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\"I was the lieutenant governor, I was overseeing elections, and I got taken off because I was born in the Netherlands,\" she said, \"So I think we definitely have those checks and balances in the state of Utah, maybe to an extreme.\"\n\nThe House vote comes days after the Republican National Committee released its party platform, which emphasizes border security issues and takes a stand against Democrats giving \"voting rights\" to migrants living in the country illegally.\n\nRepublicans are expected to shine a light on their immigration and election integrity concerns at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee, where Trump is scheduled to accept his third straight nomination for president.\n\n___\n\nSwenson reported from New York.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nEven if it passes the GOP-controlled House, the legislation is unlikely to advance through the Democratic-led Senate. The Biden administration also said it's strongly opposed because it says safeguards already are in place to verify voter eligibility and enforce the law against noncitizens trying to cast ballots.\n\nStill, the House vote will give Republicans an opportunity to bring attention to two of their central issues in the 2024 race - border and election security. They also are using Democratic opposition to the bill as fuel for former President Donald Trump's claims that Democrats have encouraged the surge of migrants so they can get them to register and vote, which would be illegal. Noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections, nor is it allowed for any statewide elections.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a key backer of the bill, said in a news conference earlier this week that the Democratic opposition means many Democrats \"want illegals to participate in our federal elections; they want them to vote.\"\n\nDuring a speech Wednesday previewing the expected House debate, he called the vote a \"generation-defining moment.\"\n\n\"If just a small percentage, a fraction of a fraction of all those illegals that Joe Biden has brought in here to vote, if they do vote, it wouldn't just change one race,\" he said. \"It might potentially change all of our races.\"\n\nOn his Truth Social platform this week, Trump suggested that Democrats are pushing to give noncitizen migrants the right to vote and urged Republicans to pass the legislation -- the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act -- or \"go home and cry yourself to sleep.\"\n\nThe fixation on noncitizen voting is part of a broader and long-term Trump campaign strategy of casting doubt on the validity of an election should he lose, and he has consistently pushed that narrative during his campaign rallies this year. Last month in Las Vegas, he told supporters, \"The only way they can beat us is to cheat.\" It also is part of a wider Republican campaign strategy, with GOP lawmakers across the country passing state legislation and putting noncitizen voting measures on state ballots for November.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDemocrats and voting rights advocates have said the legislation is unnecessary because it's already a felony for noncitizens to register to vote in federal elections, punishable by fines, prison or deportation. Anyone registering must attest under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. Noncitizens also are not allowed to cast ballots at the state level. A handful of municipalities allow them to vote in some local elections.\n\n\"For all their hysterical rhetoric around the SAVE Act, Republicans have one real purpose here - to continue to erode the confidence of Americans in our election systems,\" said Rep.

The Biden administration also said it's strongly opposed because it says safeguards already are in place to verify voter eligibility and enforce the law against noncitizens trying to cast ballots.\n\nStill, the House vote will give Republicans an opportunity to bring attention to two of their central issues in the 2024 race - border and election security. They also are using Democratic opposition to the bill as fuel for former President Donald Trump's claims that Democrats have encouraged the surge of migrants so they can get them to register and vote, which would be illegal. Noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections, nor is it allowed for any statewide elections.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a key backer of the bill, said in a news conference earlier this week that the Democratic opposition means many Democrats \"want illegals to participate in our federal elections; they want them to vote.\"\n\nDuring a speech Wednesday previewing the expected House debate, he called the vote a \"generation-defining moment.\"\n\n\"If just a small percentage, a fraction of a fraction of all those illegals that Joe Biden has brought in here to vote, if they do vote, it wouldn't just change one race,\" he said. \"It might potentially change all of our races.\"\n\nOn his Truth Social platform this week, Trump suggested that Democrats are pushing to give noncitizen migrants the right to vote and urged Republicans to pass the legislation -- the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act -- or \"go home and cry yourself to sleep.\"\n\nThe fixation on noncitizen voting is part of a broader and long-term Trump campaign strategy of casting doubt on the validity of an election should he lose, and he has consistently pushed that narrative during his campaign rallies this year. Last month in Las Vegas, he told supporters, \"The only way they can beat us is to cheat.\" It also is part of a wider Republican campaign strategy, with GOP lawmakers across the country passing state legislation and putting noncitizen voting measures on state ballots for November.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights advocates have said the legislation is unnecessary because it's already a felony for noncitizens to register to vote in federal elections, punishable by fines, prison or deportation. Anyone registering must attest under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. Noncitizens also are not allowed to cast ballots at the state level. A handful of municipalities allow them to vote in some local elections.\n\n\"For all their hysterical rhetoric around the SAVE Act, Republicans have one real purpose here - to continue to erode the confidence of Americans in our election systems,\" said Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee.\n\nThey also have pointed to surveys showing that millions of Americans don't have easy access to up-to-date documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport, and therefore the bill could inhibit U.S. citizen voters who aren't able to further prove their status.\n\nIf the bill were to pass, \"it would not safeguard American voting eligibility but immediately disenfranchise millions of American citizens,\" said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of voting rights at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nYet Republicans who support the bill say the recent unprecedented surge of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border creates too large a risk of noncitizens slipping through the cracks. They could purposely or inadvertently break the law to cast ballots that sway races amid narrow margins in November's elections.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require noncitizens to be removed from state voter rolls and require new applicants to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. It also would require states to establish a process for applicants who can't show proof to provide other evidence beyond their attestation of citizenship, though it's unclear what that evidence could include.", "source": {"uri": "whyy.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "WHYY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elections in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voter registration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Morelle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph D.

Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, expressed concern that the bill would disenfranchise various American citizens.\n\nHe mentioned military members stationed abroad who couldn't show documentary proof of citizenship in person at an election office, as well as married women whose names have changed, Native Americans whose tribal IDs don't show their place of birth and natural disaster survivors who have lost their personal documents.\n\nMorelle said he doesn't see the bill as an attempt to maintain voter rolls, but as part of larger GOP-led plans to question the validity of the upcoming election.\n\n\"The false claim that there is a conspiracy to register noncitizens is a pretext for trying to overturn the 2024 election, potentially leading to another tragedy on January 6th, 2025,\" Morelle said on the floor.\n\nYet Republicans who support the bill say the recent unprecedented surge of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border creates too large a risk of noncitizens slipping through the cracks. They could purposely or inadvertently break the law to cast ballots that sway races amid narrow margins in November's elections.\n\n\"Every illegal vote cancels out the vote of a legal American citizen,\" Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the Republican chair of the House Administration Committee, said during the floor debate.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require noncitizens to be removed from state voter rolls and require new applicants to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. It also would require states to establish a process for applicants who can't show proof to provide other evidence beyond their attestation of citizenship, though it's unclear what that evidence could include.\n\nResearch and audits in several states show that there have been incidences of noncitizens who successfully registered to vote and cast ballots, although it happens rarely and is typically by mistake. States have mechanisms to check for it, although there isn't one standard protocol they all follow.\n\nFor example, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose recently found 137 suspected noncitizens on the state's rolls -- out of roughly 8 million voters -- and said he was taking action to confirm and remove them.\n\nIn 2022, Georgia's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, conducted an audit of his state's voter rolls specifically looking for noncitizens. His office found that 1,634 had attempted to register to vote over a period of 25 years, but election officials had caught all the applications and none had been able to register.\n\nIn North Carolina in 2016, an audit of elections found that 41 legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total ballots cast. The votes didn't make a difference in any of the state's elections.\n\nIn a document supporting the bill, Johnson listed other examples of noncitizens who had been removed from the rolls in Boston and Virginia. The elections departments there didn't immediately answer questions from The Associated Press to verify the claims.\n\nSeveral secretaries of state, interviewed during their summer conference in Puerto Rico this week, said noncitizens attempting to register and vote is not a big problem in their state.\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said that his state already requires photo ID to vote and that most people use a driver's license.\n\n\"We don't really have a problem with this in my state,\" he said in an interview.\n\nUtah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican who oversees elections, said she supports the legislation in concept but provided a cautionary tale about how aggressively culling voter rolls can sometimes result in the removal of qualified voters. A few years ago, everyone in her household received mail ballots for a municipal election, except her. She had been removed from the rolls because she had been born in the Netherlands, where her father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\"I was the lieutenant governor, I was overseeing elections, and I got taken off because I was born in the Netherlands,\" she said, \"So I think we definitely have those checks and balances in the state of Utah, maybe to an extreme.\"\n\nThe House vote comes days after the Republican National Committee released its party platform, which emphasizes border security issues and takes a stand against Democrats giving \"voting rights\" to migrants living in the country illegally.\n\nRepublicans are expected to shine a light on their immigration and election integrity concerns at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee, where Trump is scheduled to accept his third straight nomination for president.", "source": {"uri": "bostonglobe.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Boston Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elections in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Committee_on_House_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Committee on House Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voter registration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Steil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Steil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Morelle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joseph D.

(Associated Press)\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday was poised to vote on a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration, a proposal Republicans have prioritized as an election-year talking point even as research shows noncitizens illegally registering and casting ballots in federal elections is exceptionally rare.\n\nEven if it passes the GOP-controlled House, the legislation is unlikely to advance through the Democratic-led Senate. The Biden administration also said it's strongly opposed because it says safeguards already are in place to verify voter eligibility and enforce the law against noncitizens trying to cast ballots.\n\nStill, the House vote will give Republicans an opportunity to bring attention to two of their central issues in the 2024 race - border and election security. They also are using Democratic opposition to the bill as fuel for former President Donald Trump's claims that Democrats have encouraged the surge of migrants so they can get them to register and vote, which would be illegal. Noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections, nor is it allowed for any statewide elections.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a key backer of the bill, said in a news conference earlier this week that the Democratic opposition means many Democrats \"want illegals to participate in our federal elections; they want them to vote.\"\n\nDuring a speech Wednesday previewing the expected House debate, he called the vote a \"generation-defining moment.\"\n\n\"If just a small percentage, a fraction of a fraction of all those illegals that Joe Biden has brought in here to vote, if they do vote, it wouldn't just change one race,\" he said. \"It might potentially change all of our races.\"\n\nOn his Truth Social platform this week, Trump suggested that Democrats are pushing to give noncitizen migrants the right to vote and urged Republicans to pass the legislation -- the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act -- or \"go home and cry yourself to sleep.\"\n\nThe fixation on noncitizen voting is part of a broader and long-term Trump campaign strategy of casting doubt on the validity of an election should he lose, and he has consistently pushed that narrative during his campaign rallies this year. Last month in Las Vegas, he told supporters, \"The only way they can beat us is to cheat.\" It also is part of a wider Republican campaign strategy, with GOP lawmakers across the country passing state legislation and putting noncitizen voting measures on state ballots for November.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights advocates have said the legislation is unnecessary because it's already a felony for noncitizens to register to vote in federal elections, punishable by fines, prison or deportation. Anyone registering must attest under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. Noncitizens also are not allowed to cast ballots at the state level. A handful of municipalities allow them to vote in some local elections.\n\nThey also have pointed to surveys showing that millions of Americans don't have easy access to up-to-date documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport, and therefore the bill could inhibit U.S. citizen voters who aren't able to further prove their status.\n\nDuring a floor debate before the vote Wednesday, Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, expressed concern that the bill would disenfranchise various American citizens.\n\nHe mentioned military members stationed abroad who couldn't show documentary proof of citizenship in person at an election office, as well as married women whose names have changed, Native Americans whose tribal IDs don't show their place of birth and natural disaster survivors who have lost their personal documents.\n\nYet Republicans who support the bill say the recent unprecedented surge of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border creates too large a risk of noncitizens slipping through the cracks. They could purposely or inadvertently break the law to cast ballots that sway races amid narrow margins in November's elections.\n\n\"Every illegal vote cancels out the vote of a legal American citizen,\" Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the Republican chair of the House Administration Committee, said during the floor debate.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require noncitizens to be removed from state voter rolls and require new applicants to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. It also would require states to establish a process for applicants who can't show proof to provide other evidence beyond their attestation of citizenship, though it's unclear what that evidence could include.", "source": {"uri": "americanpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lake Charles American Press"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@americanpress.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elections_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elections in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_registration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Voter registration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_elections", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States elections"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Steil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Steil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_D._Morelle", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joseph D.

His office found that 1,634 had attempted to register to vote over a period of 25 years, but election officials had caught all the applications and none had been able to register.\n\nIn North Carolina in 2016, an audit of elections found that 41 legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total ballots cast. The votes didn't make a difference in any of the state's elections.\n\nIn a document supporting the bill, Johnson listed other examples of noncitizens who had been removed from the rolls in Boston and Virginia. The elections departments there didn't immediately answer questions from The Associated Press to verify the claims.\n\nSeveral secretaries of state, interviewed during their summer conference in Puerto Rico this week, said noncitizens attempting to register and vote is not a big problem in their state.\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said that his state already requires photo ID to vote and that most people use a driver's license.\n\n\"We don't really have a problem with this in my state,\" he said in an interview.\n\nUtah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican who oversees elections, said she supports the legislation in concept but provided a cautionary tale about how aggressively culling voter rolls can sometimes result in the removal of qualified voters. A few years ago, everyone in her household received mail ballots for a municipal election, except her. She had been removed from the rolls because she had been born in the Netherlands, where her father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\"I was the lieutenant governor, I was overseeing elections, and I got taken off because I was born in the Netherlands,\" she said, \"So I think we definitely have those checks and balances in the state of Utah, maybe to an extreme.\"\n\nThe House vote comes days after the Republican National Committee released its party platform, which emphasizes border security issues and takes a stand against Democrats giving \"voting rights\" to migrants living in the country illegally.\n\nRepublicans are expected to shine a light on their immigration and election integrity concerns at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee, where Trump is scheduled to accept his third straight nomination for president.\n\n___\n\nSwenson reported from New York.

The Biden administration also says it's strongly opposed because there are already safeguards to enforce the law against noncitizen voting, but stopped short of saying it would veto the measure if it came to his desk.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nStill, the House vote will give Republicans an opportunity to bring attention to two of their central issues this year -- border and election security.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIt also provides an opportunity to fuel former President Donald Trump's claims that Democrats have encouraged the surge of migrants so they can register them to vote, which would be illegal. Noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections, nor is it allowed for any statewide elections.\n\nResearch and audits in several states show there have been incidences of noncitizens who successfully registered to vote and cast ballots, but it happens rarely and is typically by mistake. States have mechanisms to check for it, although there isn't one standard protocol they all follow.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a key backer of the bill, said in a news conference earlier this week that the Democratic opposition means many Democrats \"want illegals to participate in our federal elections; they want them to vote.\"\n\nDuring a speech Wednesday, he called the vote a \"generation-defining moment.\"\n\n\"If just a small percentage, a fraction of a fraction of all those illegals that Joe Biden has brought in here to vote, if they do vote, it wouldn't just change one race,\" he said. \"It might potentially change all of our races.\"\n\nOn his Truth Social platform this week, Trump suggested that Democrats are pushing to give noncitizen migrants the right to vote and urged Republicans to pass the legislation -- the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act -- or \"go home and cry yourself to sleep.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe fixation on noncitizen voting is part of a broader and long-term Trump campaign strategy of casting doubt on the validity of an election should he lose, and he has consistently pushed that narrative during his campaign rallies this year. Last month in Las Vegas, he told supporters, \"The only way they can beat us is to cheat.\" It also is part of a wider Republican campaign strategy, with GOP lawmakers across the country passing state legislation and putting noncitizen voting measures on state ballots for November.\n\nDemocrats and voting rights advocates have said the legislation is unnecessary because it's already a felony for noncitizens to register to vote in federal elections, punishable by fines, prison or deportation. Anyone registering must attest under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. Noncitizens also are not allowed to cast ballots at the state level. A handful of municipalities allow them to vote in some local elections.\n\nThey also have pointed to surveys showing that millions of Americans don't have easy access to up-to-date documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport, and therefore the bill could inhibit U.S. citizen voters who aren't able to further prove their status.\n\nDuring the Wednesday floor debate, Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, expressed concern that the bill would disenfranchise various American citizens.\n\nHe mentioned military members stationed abroad who couldn't show documentary proof of citizenship in person at an election office, as well as married women whose names have changed, Native Americans whose tribal IDs don't show their place of birth and natural disaster survivors who have lost their personal documents.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMorelle said he doesn't see the bill as an attempt to maintain voter rolls, but as part of larger GOP-led plans to question the validity of the upcoming election.\n\n\"The false claim that there is a conspiracy to register noncitizens is a pretext for trying to overturn the 2024 election, potentially leading to another tragedy on January 6th, 2025,\" he said.\n\nYet Republicans who support the bill say the unprecedented surge of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border creates too large a risk of noncitizens slipping through the cracks. They could purposely or inadvertently break the law to cast ballots that sway races amid narrow margins in November's elections.\n\n\"Every illegal vote cancels out the vote of a legal American citizen,\" said Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the Republican chair of the House Administration Committee.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require noncitizens to be removed from state voter rolls and require new applicants to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. It also would require states to establish a process for applicants who can't show proof to provide other evidence beyond their attestation of citizenship, though it's unclear what that evidence could include.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose recently found 137 suspected noncitizens on the state's rolls -- out of roughly 8 million voters -- and said he was taking action to confirm and remove them.\n\nIn 2022, Georgia's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, conducted an audit of his state's voter rolls specifically looking for noncitizens. His office found that 1,634 had attempted to register to vote over a period of 25 years, but election officials had caught all the applications and none had been able to register.\n\nIn North Carolina in 2016, an audit of elections found that 41 legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total ballots cast. The votes didn't make a difference in any of the state's elections.\n\nIn a document supporting the bill, Johnson listed other examples of noncitizens who had been removed from the rolls in Boston and Virginia. The elections departments there didn't immediately answer questions from The Associated Press to verify the claims.\n\nSeveral secretaries of state, interviewed during their summer conference in Puerto Rico this week, said noncitizens attempting to register and vote is not a big problem in their state.\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said that his state already requires photo ID to vote and that most people use a driver's license.\n\n\"We don't really have a problem with this in my state,\" he said in an interview.\n\nUtah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican who oversees elections, said she supports the legislation in concept but provided a cautionary tale about how aggressively culling voter rolls can sometimes result in the removal of qualified voters. A few years ago, everyone in her household received mail ballots for a municipal election, except her. She had been removed from the rolls because she had been born in the Netherlands, where her father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\"I was the lieutenant governor, I was overseeing elections, and I got taken off because I was born in the Netherlands,\" she said, \"So I think we definitely have those checks and balances in the state of Utah, maybe to an extreme.\"\n\nThe House vote comes days after the Republican National Committee released its party platform, which emphasizes border security issues and takes a stand against Democrats giving \"voting rights\" to migrants living in the country illegally.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRepublicans are expected to shine a light on their immigration and election integrity concerns at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee, where Trump is scheduled to accept his third straight nomination for president.\n\n___\n\nSwenson reported from New York.

The NVRA currently does not require proof of citizenship but asks registrants to attest that they are citizens or face penalties.\n\nRep. Chip Roy, the sponsor of the measure, said his bill was meant to ensure only American citizens vote in U.S. elections. He also accused President Biden and Democrats of pushing for noncitizens to participate in federal elections.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is this administration and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been damaging, breaking American sovereignty for the entirety of this administration,\" the Texas Republican said.\n\nThe measure would also require that election officials share information with the Department of Homeland Security and Social Security Administration to determine whether voters are eligible. If the agencies determine someone is ineligible to vote, election officials would have to remove the noncitizens from voter rolls.\n\nThe bill blends two issues at the forefront for the GOP: illegal immigration and election integrity.\n\nIt passed in a 221-198 vote that broke mostly along party lines. Five Democrats voted with Republicans in favor of the legislation.\n\nPresident Biden strongly opposes the legislation, and it is likely to die in the Senate.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, Louisiana Republican, heavily stumped for the measure, even teasing the bill during a meeting with former President Donald Trump at his Mar-A-Lago estate in April.\n\nMr. Johnson said on the House floor Wednesday that millions of illegal immigrants have flooded into the U.S. since Mr. Biden took office, and warned that if they participated in elections, they could drastically alter the results at every level.\n\nHis office released a report last month that provided \"irrefutable evidence\" of noncitizens illegally registering to vote and voting in federal elections. This year, election officials removed 70 noncitizens from voter rolls in Massachusetts and 137 from voter rolls in Ohio, according to the report.\n\nEarlier this year, Virginia election officials removed nearly 1,500 people from voter rolls \"with a reported reason for removal due to 'noncitizen status.'\"\n\nThough there is no evidence of illegal immigrants registering to vote on a large scale, Republicans said the stricter rules would be a preventative measure.\n\n\"We are merely suggesting that because so many illegal aliens are in the country ... it worth adding a layer of protection to ensure those illegals cannot register to vote,\" Mr. Johnson said.\n\nIt is illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, with penalties including deportation and imprisonment. It is also illegal for people to register to vote if they are not eligible. Some places such as in the District of Columbia, allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, but it is not a widespread practice.\n\nThe GOP's messaging on the bill echoes Mr. Trump's unfounded claims that large numbers of illegal immigrants voted in the 2020 election. On Tuesday, the former president said Republicans should pass the bill or \"go home and cry yourself to sleep.\"\n\nHundreds of civil rights organizations opposed the measure, arguing, among other things, that the legislation was \"wholly based on falsehoods\" and would make it harder for minority communities and naturalized citizens to vote.\n\n\"These are already communities who are unfairly targeted by anti-immigrant policies at the federal, state, and local level,\" the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights wrote in a letter to lawmakers. \"Congress should be doing everything possible to encourage and promote the political participation of these citizens, rather than seeking to diminish it through threats and fear tactics.\"\n\nDemocrats said the bill would do little or nothing at all to safeguard elections and would instead make it harder for citizens to register, more difficult for soldiers serving overseas to register, and increase the likelihood that eligible voters are removed from voter rolls.\n\n\"This extreme MAGA Republican voter suppression bill is not designed to solve any problem on behalf of the American people. It is designed to jam people up and prevent Americans from voting,\" said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, New York Democrat.", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news",

Chip Roy, R-Texas, also would require states to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls.\n\nPresident Joe Biden opposes the legislation and it's not likely to pass the Democrat-controlled Senate, where Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, sponsored a companion bill.\n\n\"I kind of dare them to vote no on a bill supported by 81% to 87% of the American people,\" Roy said Wednesday on the House floor, referring to Democrats. \"I dare them to vote no on a bill that says only American citizens should vote in American elections. I dare them to go ahead and follow a president who has put out a policy against a bill, the purpose of which is to guarantee citizens are the ones who get to vote in American elections.\"\n\nThe House bill also would empower U.S. citizens to bring civil suits against election officials who don't uphold proof-of-citizenship requirements for federal elections. It also allows for integrating existing databases at the Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration to expedite the requirement for states to remove noncitizens from voter rolls.\n\nAlthough it's already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, there is no mechanism to ensure that only those registering or voting are actually citizens, House Speaker Mike Johnson has said.\n\nJohnson, R-La., noted that Virginia last year removed 1,500 registrants from the voter rolls who were noncitizens, and 22% had cast ballots. The states of Massachusetts and Ohio removed noncitizens from voter rolls in recent years. Georgia found that 1,600 noncitizens attempted to vote.\n\n\"American citizens will be protected and in no way harmed by this bill,\" Johnson said Wednesday on the House floor. \"There is not a conceivable argument that the Democrats can make to oppose the commonsense measures that we're putting before them today. Nothing changes the voter registration process in the states.\"\n\n\"The only people who will face hurdles here are those who are trying to break our federal laws,\" the House speaker said. \"And that's why it's patently absurd that the White House issued a veto threat. They issued a veto threat.\"\n\nIn 2017, Pennsylvania Secretary of State Pedro Cortes resigned after the state admitted to registering illegal immigrants for several years.\n\nMore than 10 million illegal immigrants and millions more paroled aliens have entered the country since Biden took office in January 2021. The Biden administration has released at least 4.6 million illegal aliens into the United States in addition to 1.8 million known \"gotaways,\" according to Roy's office.", "source": {"uri":

But critics say the push to require documents proving citizenship to vote could wrongfully disenfranchise citizens if they lack access to the types of documents that meet the requirement.\n\nIt's illegal for people who aren't US citizens to vote in federal contests, and experts say it rarely happens, given that violators face imprisonment and deportation. Opponents also warn the GOP focus on noncitizen voting could serve as a way to undermine the results of the 2024 presidential election if Republicans do not win the White House.\n\nThe bill is not expected to be taken up by the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Biden administration has said that it \"strongly opposes\" the measure.\n\nIn addition to requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration in federal elections, the bill also includes provisions for removing noncitizens from federal voter registration rolls.\n\nThe vote is part of a broader push by Trump allies and comes after Trump and Johnson raised concerns about the integrity of US elections in a joint appearance at Mar-a-Lago in April that featured false claims about voting and immigration.\n\nAt that event, Johnson raised baseless concerns about \"potentially hundreds of thousands of votes\" being cast by undocumented immigrants in the November presidential election.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson said in a House floor speech ahead of the vote, \"Would we prefer to wait for fraud to happen and only do something after elections are finalized? No, we have to catch the fraud on the front end so there's no question about the integrity of our votes.\"\n\n\"There should be no objection to this legislation at all,\" he said.\n\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday that Republicans must pass the bill, writing, \"Our whole voting system is under siege.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has denounced the bill, saying in a statement earlier this week, \"The alleged justification for this bill is based on easily disproven falsehoods. ... States already have effective safeguards in place to verify voters' eligibility and maintain the accuracy of voter rolls.

Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), Donald Davis (D-N.C.), Jared Golden (D-Maine), Vincente Gonzalez (D-Texas), and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez (D-Wash.) -- joined all Republicans in voting for the legislation. Other Democrats opposed the bill, arguing that it's redundant due to existing prohibitions on noncitizen voting.\n\nThe measure is likely dead-on-arrival in the Democrat-controlled Senate. The White House has expressed opposition to the bill.\n\nUnder the bill, acceptable forms of proof of citizenship include a passport, birth certificate, a government-issued photo ID showing the person was born in the United States, or a military ID showing the same.\n\nIt would also require states to purge their voter rolls of any current noncitizens, in part by giving states no-cost access to databases run by the Department of Homeland Security and Social Security Administration.\n\nDemocrats say that under the terms of the bill, it would become more difficult for natural-born and naturalized citizens to register as well.\n\n\"It is already illegal under current law for noncitizens to register to vote or to vote in federal elections,\" Ms. Clark's office said.\n\nRepublicans, agree that federal law technically prohibits voting by illegal immigrants, but say there are loopholes that make it possible for an illegal immigrant to vote.\n\n\"It's a part of the federal statutes,\" Mr. Johnson said. \"The problem is ... there's no mechanism to ensure that only those registering or voting are actually citizens.\"\n\nRepublicans' concerns are primarily related to the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA), dubbed the Motor Voter law, which allows people to register to vote at the same time that they pick up a driver's license from their state's Department of Motor Vehicles or other state agencies.\n\nForeigners living permanently in the United States are encouraged to get a U.S. drivers license; 19 states and the District of Columbia allow illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses.\n\nThe White House has pushed back against the bill, saying states already have safeguards to verify voter eligibility and maintain the accuracy of voter rolls.\n\n\"This bill would do nothing to safeguard our elections, but it would make it much harder for all eligible Americans to register to vote and increase the risk that eligible voters are purged

That act is already illegal, since under current U.S. law, only citizens can vote in federal elections, but the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 prohibits states from confirming citizenship status.\n\nVoting laws vary by state, with some states like Georgia and Wisconsin requiring photo identification and others, such as Pennsylvania and New Mexico, requiring no documentation at all.\n\nStates that do mandate photo identification or other documents use driver's licenses, military ID cards, student ID cards, birth certificates, tribal ID cards, or even a recent utility bill.\n\nThe SAVE Act, introduced by GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas in May, would require most individuals to have a passport to register to vote.\n\nOnly about 48% of U.S. citizens have a passport, according to State Department data. Driver's license and tribal ID cards typically do not prove a person's citizenship and couldn't be used to register under the SAVE Act.\n\nData also indicates that noncitizen voting is not a prevalent issue, as many House Republicans have said.\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, states such as North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, California, and Texas reviewed their voter rolls between 2016 and 2022. These audits found that fewer than 50 noncitizens in each state had voted in recent elections, out of upwards of 23 million total votes per state.\n\nThe measure is unlikely to advance in the Democratic-controlled Senate.\n\nHouse Republicans have stood staunchly in favor of Roy's bill, H.R.8281.\n\nOn the House floor Wednesday, Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, urged his colleagues to pass the bill, saying it was \"one of the most important votes that members of this chamber will ever take in their entire careers.\"\n\nLast month, Johnson's office released a 22-page report asserting the SAVE Act was critical for American election integrity.\n\nJohnson blamed the Democratic Party for keeping American \"borders wide open to every country on the planet,\" and claimed Democrats \"want illegal aliens voting in our elections.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Biden administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy against the legislation, saying there is no cause for concern about noncitizen voting and that it would only hinder the voting rights of eligible Americans.\n\nRep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, urged his House colleagues during Wednesday floor debate to vote no on the bill, saying it would be devastating for all American voters.\n\n\"This bill is about scaring Americans, this bill is about silencing Americans, this bill is about disenfranchising Americans,\" he said. \"This bill is about further damaging the foundations of our democracy.\"\n\nBut House Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil backed the legislation during a Rules Committee hearing.\n\n\"In the past few decades, Americans' faith in the integrity of our elections has eroded and it is Congress' responsibility to restore confidence in our election system,\" said Steil, a Wisconsin Republican. \"The SAVE Act would do just that.\"\n\nRepublican Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana in a Monday press conference called the bill \"a safeguard to ensure that only American citizens vote in America's elections.\"\n\nDemocratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York during Wednesday floor debate alluded to the broader implications of the SAVE Act, looking towards the November election and the possibility of a second term for President Joe Biden.\n\nHe said Republicans could use the bill \"as a cover, already trying to set up an excuse for what may happen in November.\"\n\nVoting rights advocates have expressed concern over the SAVE Act, saying it contains many falsehoods and conspiracy theories that perpetuate extreme views.\n\nAt a Tuesday press conference hosted by America's Voice, an immigrant advocacy nonprofit, Sean Morales-Doyle from the Brennan Center for Justice said the bill plays into greater themes of racism and xenophobia.\n\n\"It's also a very damaging lie with an ulterior motive: to lay the groundwork for challenging legitimate election results down the road,\" he said.\n\nOne House member equated the bill to a \"Jim Crow poll tax\" during floor debate. Jennifer McClellan, a Virginia Democrat, said she \"is not aware of any single proof of citizenship document that doesn't cost an individual money to get it.\"\n\nWesley Hunt, a Republican from Texas, responded that \"Jim Crow is over.\"", "source": {"uri": "penncapital-star.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pennsylvania Capital-Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lia_chien@penncapital-star.com",

It now heads to the Senate, where it is all but certain to be ignored amid opposition from Democrats.\n\nPresident Biden has vowed to veto the measure.\n\nOpponents of the bill say its core idea -- establishing noncitizen voting as illegal -- is redundant, and argue that its provisions will more likely lead to U.S. citizens being denied their right to vote than to preventing votes by foreign nationals.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), meanwhile, argued on the House floor Wednesday that the legislation is necessary because noncitizens have voted in U.S. elections despite it being illegal to do so.\n\n\"Even though it's already illegal, this is happening,\" Johnson said.\n\nIn May, Johnson told reporters, \"we all know, intuitively, that a lot of illegals are voting in federal elections. But it's not been something that is easily provable. We don't have that number.\n\n\"This legislation will allow us to do exactly that -- it will prevent that from happening. And if someone tries to do it, it will now be unlawful within the states,\" he added.\n\nBut most researchers who have studied voting patterns have said Johnson's intuition is wrong.\n\nOne study by the Brennan Center for Justice found 30 suspected -- not confirmed -- cases of noncitizen voting out of 23.5 million.\n\nThe claim that noncitizens are voting -- and that Democrats are willfully importing undocumented immigrants to vote -- is the bill's raison d'etre.\n\nJohnson, nonetheless, brought the legislation to the floor as a show of unity between himself and members of the right flank on an issue that's also a Trump favorite.\n\nThe Speaker backed the idea of banning noncitizens from voting in U.S. elections through legislation during a joint press conference with Trump in April, at a time when the House leader was trying to drum up GOP support as a small group of Republican lawmakers threatened to oust him.\n\nThe former president urged GOP lawmakers to approve the legislation in a Truth Social post on Tuesday, writing: \"Republicans must pass the Save Act, or go home and cry yourself to sleep.\"\n\nRep. Chip Roy (R-Texas), who introduced the bill in May, said at the time, \"Radical progressive Democrats know this and are using open border policies while also attacking election integrity laws to fundamentally remake America.\"\n\nRoy and Johnson have butted heads in the past, particularly over the Speaker's bipartisan budget efforts, but the two former Judiciary Committee colleagues see eye to eye on immigration.\n\nIn an op-ed in May, Roy wrote that \"radical progressive Democrats aren't even trying to hide it anymore -- they're publicly admitting their intention to leverage open borders and the tens of millions of illegal aliens in the U.S. to fundamentally remake America by cementing one-party rule.\"\n\nRoy's stated evidence for that claim was a verbal flub by President Biden on a radio show in May -- widely picked up by right-wing media -- where Biden appears to refer to Hispanic immigrants as \"voters.\"\n\nRoy also criticized Democrats for voting against a bill that would have changed census apportionment to exclude non-U.S. citizens.\n\n\"I think they believe in their own heads, that somehow immigrants are bad and you know, we're terrible and we're always going to do bad things, when we know that's not true. We know the data actually shows that immigrants commit less crimes. That, you know, communities with lots of immigrants actually are safer,\" said Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), who emigrated from Peru at age 5.\n\nAnd advocates say the bill would make it harder for some U.S. citizens to register to vote, and would purge more citizens than noncitizens from voter rolls.\n\n\"We're seeing heightened threats against elections officials and voters at the polls, especially in places where Latinos are a growing and significant part of the eligible voting population,\" said Juan Espinoza, senior civil rights adviser at UnidosUS.\n\n\"Harmful and false rhetoric of noncitizen voters also spreads disinformation that targets and undermines Latino voters. This bill is a dangerous political ploy being used to suppress the vote in communities of color and further undermine voting rights in this country.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType":

It's true workers at the drive did not ask for proof of U.S. citizenship, but that's because the law does not require such proof to register to vote. However, federal and state law stipulates that Florida voters must be U.S. citizens to cast a ballot in any race. Voters confirm their citizenship under penalty of perjury. Noncitizen voting is exceedingly rare in the U.S. as states, including Florida, have processes to prevent it.\n\nTHE FACTS: Shortly before the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote, social media users shared a video of a voter registration drive in Palm Beach, Florida, to raise questions about noncitizens voting in U.S. elections.\n\nIn the video, a worker with Mi Familia en Acci\u00f3n speaks with a man and a woman outside the Central Palm Beach Service Center. The pair questions the worker about whether people register to vote inside, why she and her colleagues are wearing blue shirts, if she is registered to vote, if she is a U.S. citizen, and who funds Mi Familia en Acci\u00f3n.\n\nThe woman then asks the worker, \"What do you have to have to sign up to vote? A driver's license?\" The worker replies, \"No -- no, no, no, you have to be a U.S. citizen. It's a felony.\" After the woman asks how registrants prove their citizenship, the worker says that \"you have to trust in the people\" and reiterates that lying about U.S. citizenship on a voter registration form is a felony.\n\n\"'Mi Familia Vota' worker in Palm Beach is registering voters near the DMV,\" reads one X post that shared the video. \"Proof of citizenship isn't required.\" It had received approximately 21,000 likes and 11,700 shares as of Wednesday.\n\nThe video was first posted on X by Jeff Buongiorno, a Republican candidate for supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County. Buongiorno asked whether this is \"what Floridian's had in mind\" when the state constitution was amended in 2020 to require voters in Florida elections to be U.S. citizens.\n\nMi Familia en Acci\u00f3n and Mi Familia Vota are nonprofit, nonpartisan sister organizations that support the Latino community. The latter is registered in Florida as a third party voter registration organization.\n\nMi Familia en Acci\u00f3n confirmed that the video shows a voter registration drive it hosted in Palm Beach and that the worker is a temporary paid canvasser, but refuted the baseless implication about fraudulent activities related to the event.\n\n\"Mi Familia en Acci\u00f3n is a non-partisan organization, voter registrations are part of our day-to-day work to strengthen our democracy,\" the organization wrote in a statement. \"We do not encourage or register non-citizens to vote.\"\n\nBuongiorno told The Associated Press that he is \"100% concerned that they're registering noncitizens\" and that Florida's current laws \"are disenfranchising citizens from coming out and voting.\"\n\n\"I'm concerned of fraudulent registrations by noncitizens, I'm concerned about synthetic identities, and we need to tighten this up in the state of Florida or our elected officials who certify the elections, they'll be committing perjury when they certify the 2024 election,\" he continued.\n\nAlthough it is true Florida voters are not required to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote, all voters in the state must be U.S. citizens, according to federal and state law. They must confirm as much under penalty of perjury upon registration. Voting as a noncitizen, or even just registering to vote, can be punishable by fines, prison or deportation.\n\nThough research shows there have been incidences of noncitizen voting over the years across the U.S., it's exceedingly rare, in part because of the risk involved. States, including Florida, have additional mechanisms to prevent it, though there isn't one standard protocol they all follow.\n\n\"People, by and large, do not falsely submit voter registration applications when they don't believe that they're eligible because the risk is just too high,\" Valencia Richardson, legal counsel for voting rights at the Campaign Legal Center, told the AP. \"The consequences, particularly for noncitizens, are simply not worth it.\"\n\nA handful of municipalities in other states allow noncitizens to vote in some local elections. Noncitizens are never allowed to cast ballots at the federal or state level.\n\nRichardson explained that both federal and state law require Florida election officials to maintain accurate voter lists. This means removing anyone who is ineligible to vote, including noncitizens, but also ensuring that eligible voters are not unlawfully removed. She said there are many ways to confirm citizenship, such as checking department of motor vehicle records, asking the secretary of state's office or getting in touch with the voter themselves.\n\nThe Florida Department of State did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nResearch and audits in several states show that there have been noncitizens who successfully registered to vote and cast ballots, although it happens rarely and is typically by mistake.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, for example, recently found 137 suspected noncitizens on the state's rolls -- out of roughly 8 million voters -- and said he was taking action to confirm and remove them.\n\nIn 2023, Florida removed 268,521 active voters from its registration rolls and as of May 31, had removed 113,166 in 2024 so far. The data does not break down why they were removed. In addition to not being a U.S. citizen, reasons for removal can include death, a felony conviction, not listing a valid Florida residence, or moving out of state.\n\nFlorida currently has approximately 13.4 million active registered voters. When registering, new applicants must provide a Florida driver's license or identification card number, or the last four digits of their social security number. Alternative forms of ID for those who do not have any of these numbers include a U.S. passport, debit or credit card number, utility bill, or bank statement. Voters must present a picture ID with their signature when voting at a polling place.\n\nThe House on Wednesday passed the SAVE (Safeguard American Voter Eligibility) Act, a Republican proposal that would institute a proof-of-citizenship requirement for voter registration. It is unlikely to advance through the Democratic-led Senate and the Biden administration said it's strongly opposed to the legislation because it says safeguards already are in place to verify voter eligibility and enforce the law against noncitizens trying to cast ballots. Democrats are also concerned that the bill would disenfranchise some U.S. citizens.\n\n___\n\nThis is part of the AP's effort to address widely shared false and misleading information that is circulating online.

The Biden administration also says it's strongly opposed because there are already safeguards to enforce the law against noncitizen voting, but stopped short of saying it would veto the measure if it came to his desk.\n\nStill, the House vote will give Republicans an opportunity to bring attention to two of their central issues this year -- border and election security.\n\nIt also provides an opportunity to fuel former President Donald Trump's claims that Democrats have encouraged the surge of migrants so they can register them to vote, which would be illegal. Noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections, nor is it allowed for any statewide elections.\n\nResearch and audits in several states show there have been incidences of noncitizens who successfully registered to vote and cast ballots, but it happens rarely and is typically by mistake. States have mechanisms to check for it, although there isn't one standard protocol they all follow.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson, a key backer of the bill, said in a news conference earlier this week that the Democratic opposition means many Democrats \"want illegals to participate in our federal elections; they want them to vote.\"\n\nDuring a speech Wednesday, he called the vote a \"generation-defining moment.\"\n\n\"If just a small percentage, a fraction of a fraction of all those illegals that Joe Biden has brought in here to vote, if they do vote, it wouldn't just change one race,\" he said. \"It might potentially change all of our races.\"\n\nOn his Truth Social platform this week, Trump suggested that Democrats are pushing to give noncitizen migrants the right to vote and urged Republicans to pass the legislation -- the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act -- or \"go home and cry yourself to sleep.\"\n\nThe fixation on noncitizen voting is part of a broader and long-term Trump campaign strategy of casting doubt on the validity of an election should he lose, and he has consistently pushed that narrative during his campaign rallies this year. Last month in Las Vegas, he told supporters, \"The only way they can beat us is to cheat.\" It also is part of a wider Republican campaign strategy, with GOP lawmakers across the country passing state legislation and putting noncitizen voting measures on state ballots for November.\n\nOne Democrat who voted for the GOP bill, Rep. Vincente Gonzalez -- who hails from a competitive district in Texas representing the U.S. southern border -- said he only did so because the bill was doomed in the Senate.\n\n\"It's not going anywhere,\" said Gonzalez. \"It's just another Republican messaging bill.\"\n\nBut the majority of Democrats and voting rights advocates have said the legislation is unnecessary because it's already a felony for noncitizens to register to vote in federal elections, punishable by fines, prison or deportation. Anyone registering must attest under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen. Noncitizens also are not allowed to cast ballots at the state level. A handful of municipalities allow them to vote in some local elections.\n\nThey also have pointed to surveys showing that millions of Americans don't have easy access to up-to-date documentary proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate or passport, and therefore the bill could inhibit U.S. citizen voters who aren't able to further prove their status.\n\nDuring the Wednesday floor debate, Rep. Joe Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the House Administration Committee, expressed concern that the bill would disenfranchise various American citizens.\n\nHe mentioned military members stationed abroad who couldn't show documentary proof of citizenship in person at an election office, as well as married women whose names have changed, Native Americans whose tribal IDs don't show their place of birth and natural disaster survivors who have lost their personal documents.\n\nMorelle said he doesn't see the bill as an attempt to maintain voter rolls, but as part of larger GOP-led plans to question the validity of the upcoming election.\n\n\"The false claim that there is a conspiracy to register noncitizens is a pretext for trying to overturn the 2024 election, potentially leading to another tragedy on January 6th, 2025,\" he said.\n\nYet Republicans who support the bill say the unprecedented surge of migrants illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border creates too large a risk of noncitizens slipping through the cracks. They could purposely or inadvertently break the law to cast ballots that sway races amid narrow margins in November's elections.\n\n\"Every illegal vote cancels out the vote of a legal American citizen,\" said Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, the Republican chair of the House Administration Committee.\n\nIf passed, the bill would require noncitizens to be removed from state voter rolls and require new applicants to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship. It also would require states to establish a process for applicants who can't show proof to provide other evidence beyond their attestation of citizenship, though it's unclear what that evidence could include.\n\nOhio Secretary of State Frank LaRose recently found 137 suspected noncitizens on the state's rolls -- out of roughly 8 million voters -- and said he was taking action to confirm and remove them.\n\nIn 2022, Georgia's Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, conducted an audit of his state's voter rolls specifically looking for noncitizens. His office found that 1,634 had attempted to register to vote over a period of 25 years, but election officials had caught all the applications and none had been able to register.\n\nIn North Carolina in 2016, an audit of elections found that 41 legal immigrants who had not yet become citizens cast ballots, out of 4.8 million total ballots cast. The votes didn't make a difference in any of the state's elections.\n\nIn a document supporting the bill, Johnson listed other examples of noncitizens who had been removed from the rolls in Boston and Virginia. The elections departments there didn't immediately answer questions from The Associated Press to verify the claims.\n\nSeveral secretaries of state, interviewed during their summer conference in Puerto Rico this week, said noncitizens attempting to register and vote is not a big problem in their state.\n\nKentucky Secretary of State Michael Adams, a Republican, said that his state already requires photo ID to vote and that most people use a driver's license.\n\n\"We don't really have a problem with this in my state,\" he said in an interview.\n\nUtah Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican who oversees elections, said she supports the legislation in concept but provided a cautionary tale about how aggressively culling voter rolls can sometimes result in the removal of qualified voters. A few years ago, everyone in her household received mail ballots for a municipal election, except her. She had been removed from the rolls because she had been born in the Netherlands, where her father was stationed with the U.S. Air Force.\n\n\"I was the lieutenant governor, I was overseeing elections, and I got taken off because I was born in the Netherlands,\" she said, \"So I think we definitely have those checks and balances in the state of Utah, maybe to an extreme.\"\n\nThe House vote comes days after the Republican National Committee released its party platform, which emphasizes border security issues and takes a stand against Democrats giving \"voting rights\" to migrants living in the country illegally.\n\nRepublicans are expected to shine a light on their immigration and election integrity concerns at the Republican National Convention next week in Milwaukee, where Trump is scheduled to accept his third straight nomination for president.\n\n___\n\nSwenson reported from New York.

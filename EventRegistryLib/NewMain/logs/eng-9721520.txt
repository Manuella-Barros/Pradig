Company products include QuickBooks, Credit Karma, and TurboTax.\n\nIn a message issued to Intuit's staff today, CEO Sasan Goodarzi said the move was not an attempt to cut costs, but rather, is a vehicle to help allocate investment to critical areas, to drive growth and support customers.\n\n\"This includes reinvesting in the necessary skills and capabilities to support these areas, and, as such, we will hire approximately 1,800 new people primarily in engineering, product, and customer facing roles such as sales, customer success, and marketing,\" said Goodarzi.\n\nIntuit plans to accelerate investment and hiring in areas such as data and AI, network teams, fintech, human capital management, customer experience and international growth. With this in mind, Intuit hopes to see its headcount begin to grow during the 2025 financial year.\n\nThe company plans to layoff 1,050 employees that have been deemed by Intuit to have fallen below company expectations. Roughly 10pc of executives (director and above) will be let go and some executives will find their roles and responsibilities have been expanded.\n\nAdditionally, 80 technology roles will be consolidated at sites where Intuit will strategically grow technology teams and capabilities, for example in Atlanta, New York, Bangalore, Tel Aviv and Toronto. The sites that are closing currently employ more than 250 people, a portion of whom will be relocated to other premises. A further 300 roles are being eliminated across the company to streamline work and reallocate resources toward key growth areas.\n\nIntuit has a number of global locations across the America's, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Employees impacted by layoffs will be the recipients of a calendar invitation from their manager titled \"Leaving Intuit Discussion\" and Goodarzi will host a Town Hall on Tuesday, July 16 at 9:00 am PT to answer any questions employees may have.\n\nGoodarzi acknowledged it was an incredibly difficult day and thanked all those who had contributed to Intuit's success. He also expressed excitement at what the future holds for the company and its present and future employees.\n\n\"With the strength of our people, culture, and mission, we are positioned to take advantage of this AI revolution and revolutionise our customers' experiences to deliver undisputed benefits in ways that we could never imagine. Today is day one. Together, we will focus on the future and all the possibilities to power prosperity around the world,\" he concluded.\n\nEarlier this year Intuit was criticised by the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for, what the organisation described as, deceptive advertising practices. The FTC prohibited Intuit from advertising that any good or service is free unless it is actually free for all consumers.\n\nFind out how emerging tech trends are transforming tomorrow with our new podcast, Future Human: The Series.

The strategy also focuses on money movement, mid-market expansion for small businesses, and international growth.\n\n\"We do not do layoffs to cut costs, and that remains true in this case,\" Goodarzi writes. Intuit plans to hire approximately 1,800 new people with strategic functional skill sets primarily in engineering, product, and customer-facing roles such as sales, customer success, and marketing. And expects its overall headcount to grow in its fiscal year 2025, which begins Aug. 1.\n\nOf the employees who will depart Intuit, 1,050 are not meeting expectations based on a formal performance management process. The company believes they will be \"more successful outside of Intuit,\" Goodarzi writes. In addition, Intuit is reducing the number of executives (directors, directors, SVPs, and EVPs) by approximately 10%, expanding certain executive roles and responsibilities.\n\nIntuit is also consolidating 80 tech roles to sites where they are growing technology teams, including Atlanta, Bangalore, New York, Tel Aviv, and Toronto. The company is closing two sites in Edmonton and Boise that have over 250 employees, with a certain number of employees relocating to other sites within Intuit or leaving the company. Intuit is also eliminating more than 300 roles across the company to \"streamline work and reallocate resources toward key growth areas,\" according to the email.\n\nAll departing U.S. employees will receive a package that includes a minimum of 16 weeks of pay, plus two additional weeks for every year of service. They will have 60 days before they leave the company with a last day of Sept. 9. Employees outside the U.S. will receive similar support, taking into account local requirements.\n\n\"This timing allows everyone leaving to reach their July vesting date for restricted stock units and the July 31 eligibility date for annual IPI bonuses,\" Goodarzi writes. Those not on an IPI plan will be able to reach the eligibility date for July or Q4 incentives.

For over 40 years, we've had a successful track record of self-disruption and reinvention, transforming through multiple technological shifts. We were early to bet on and invest in AI, building one of the largest AI-driven expert platforms to fuel the success of consumers, small and mid-market businesses, and important partners like accountants, financial institutions, and marketing agencies who rely on us daily to prosper. With the introduction of GenAI, we are now delivering even more compelling customer experiences, increasing monetization potential, and driving efficiencies in how the work gets done within Intuit. But it's just the beginning of the AI revolution.\n\nGoodarzi then drew a direct correlation between AI's growing role and the decision to let 1,800 employees go.\n\nIntuit is in a position of strength; we have the strategy and momentum that we need to succeed. To fulfill our mission to power the prosperity of our customers around the world and strengthen our leadership position, we must accelerate our innovation and investments in the areas that are most important to our future success. With this context, I am sharing some very difficult decisions my leadership team and I have made to ensure we are able to increase investment in these key growth areas. Today we will be communicating to approximately 1,800 employees, which is 10% of our workforce, that they will be leaving Intuit. These are extremely painful decisions for me and my team because we deeply understand the impact these decisions have on our friends and colleagues who will be leaving. We are very grateful for the great work they have done and the amazing contributions they have made while at Intuit.\n\nInterestingly, the company will hire approximately 1,800 new employees, although they will be in engineering, product, and customer facing roles.\n\nWe do not do layoffs to cut costs, and that remains true in this case. The changes we are making today enable us to allocate additional investments to our most critical areas to support our customers and drive growth as detailed below. This includes reinvesting in the necessary skills and capabilities to support these areas, and, as such, we will hire approximately 1,800 new people primarily in engineering, product, and customer facing roles such as sales, customer success, and marketing. In context of the actions we are taking today, we expect our overall headcount to grow in FY25 and beyond.\n\nGiven that Intuit's overall headcount is remaining roughly the same, the 1,800 departing employees are clearly holding roles that the company no longer needs filled. The company says 1,050 employees are leaving as a result of not meeting the company's expectations. Intuit is also reducing the number of executives by 10%. The company is consolidating 80 technology roles in locations where it is continuing to invest and grow. Finally, Intuit is axing more than 300 jobs to streamline work and resources spent.\n\nGoodarzi ended by acknowledging how difficult the decision was, while striking an optimistic tone for the future.", "source": {"uri": "webpronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WebProNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_milano@webpronews.com", "name": "Matt Milano", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuit", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accountant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Sasan-Goodarzi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721520", "eventUri": "eng-9721520", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

This tool, supported by a network of experts, aims to provide seamless \"done-for-you\" experiences combined with human expertise.

The company is also ramping up its recruitment of top-tier engineering talent across the tech sector to support these advancements.\n\nConnecting People to Experts (Big Bet 2): Intuit's AI-driven expert platform is positioned as a market differentiator, integrating AI-powered human expertise at scale to meet the financial needs of consumers, small and mid-market businesses, and partners. The company plans to increase its investments in data and AI to better utilize comprehensive data, facilitating real-time connections between customers and the most suitable experts. This initiative includes bolstering teams with additional AI-augmented expert network personnel and hiring marketing professionals with specialized digital services expertise.\n\nAccelerating Money Solutions: Intuit's fintech platform, designed to manage end-to-end financial activities and improve cash flow for small and mid-market customers, will receive heightened investment. The focus is on delivering superior, seamless solutions for payments, capital, banking, bill payments, and invoicing across multiple regions. This effort will be supported by hiring experienced fintech professionals in engineering, design, risk management, and customer success.\n\nDisrupting the Mid-Market (Big Bet 5): Intuit aims to empower mid-market customers by providing an AI-driven expert platform tailored to their needs as their business complexities grow. This includes enhanced accounting and reporting capabilities, money solutions, human capital management, and customer acquisition solutions powered by AI experts. The company will accelerate investments in these areas, supported by recruiting professionals with extensive mid-market experience in product development, account management, marketing, sales, and customer success.\n\nAccelerating International Growth: Intuit plans to unify QuickBooks and Mailchimp into a global growth platform, particularly targeting markets in Canada, the UK, and Australia. Investments will focus on expanding the AI-driven expert platform and leveraging Mailchimp's international presence to spearhead growth in Europe and other regions. Intuit remains committed to its international hubs in London, Toronto, and Sydney, and will hire talent with international expertise in product development, engineering, and market strategy to drive this initiative forward.\n\nIntuit, which also makes online accounting software QuickBooks, said it will increase investments in generative AI and plans to expand into new markets including Canada, United Kingdom and Australia.\n\nThe note added that 300 roles were being eliminated to streamline work, while consolidating 80 technology roles to sites such as Atlanta, Bengaluru, Tel Aviv and others as part of the layoff plan.\n\nThe layoffs will cost Intuit between $250 million and $260 million, with substantial amounts of the charge expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter, the company said in a regulatory filing, Reuters news report said.\n\nIntuit expects to grow headcount in fiscal 2025 and beyond, Goodarzi said.\n\nIn May, Intuit reported a rise in third-quarter revenue

This includes hiring approximately 1,800 new people, primarily in engineering, product and customer-facing roles such as sales, customer success, and marketing.\n\nExactly when the new positions will be hired was not specified. Goodarzi did, however, say that Intuit expects its overall headcount to grow starting from the company's 2025 fiscal year, which starts Aug 1.\n\nThe savings from the layoffs will also be used to make further investments in what Intuit calls its \"Big Bets.\"\n\nBig Bet 1, \"Revolutionize Speed to Benefit,\" involves Intuit's generative AI-powered financial assistant, Intuit Assist, combined with its network of experts, enabling seamless \"done-for-you\" experiences with access to human expertise. To deliver this, Intuit plans to invest heavily in data and AI, leveraging \"GenOS\" to transform its products from traditional workflows to AI-native experiences that save time and increase customer savings.\n\nIntuit is focusing on its AI-driven expert platform for Big Bet 2, \"Connecting People to Experts,\" by increasing investments in data and AI to enhance real-time customer-expert connections and bolstering its teams with AI-augmented talent and digital marketing professionals. The company is also accelerating investments in its fintech platform, mid-market solutions and international growth.\n\nThe layoffs from Intuit, be them with plans to replace the laid-off staff, come during a year that has seen companies big and small lay off staff as ongoing macroeconomic headwinds cause issues for tech companies, particularly when it comes to raising fresh capital.\n\nLayoffs this month so far include Microsoft Corp., which reportedly laid off staff across multiple teams and geographies on July 4, although exactly how many employees were laid off was unclear. On July 9, robotic process automation software provider UiPath Inc. announced plans to cut 10% of its workforce, or around 420 employees, in a bid to increase operational efficiency.", "source": {"uri": "siliconangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SiliconANGLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuit", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fintech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UiPath", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UiPath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robotic process automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Strategic", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Strategic", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Relationship_Marketing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Relationship Marketing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://d15shllkswkct0.cloudfront.net/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2024/07/intuit.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721520", "eventUri": "eng-9721520", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 1222, "textEnd": 1227}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 2573, "textEnd": 2579}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 2647, "textEnd": 2653}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

The email goes on to say that Inuit expects its overall headcount to grow in its 2025 fiscal year, as it will hire approximately 1,800 people primarily in engineering, product, and customer-facing roles such as sales, customer success, and marketing.\n\n\"The changes we are making today enable us to allocate additional investments to our most critical areas to support our customers and drive growth,\" Goodzari said.\n\nGoodarzi said that approximately 1,050 of the layoffs are because the company has \"significantly raised the bar\" and that those employees \"are not meeting expectations.\" In addition to that, the company is eliminating more than 300 roles to \"streamline work and reallocate resources toward key growth areas.\"\n\nIntuit is also trimming its executives, which it defines as workers at the director level and above, by 10 percent.", "source": {"uri": "betakit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "BetaKit"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_riehl@betakit.com", "name": "Alex Riehl", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuit", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boise,_Idaho", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boise, Idaho"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boise, Idaho"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurboTax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TurboTax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangalore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Venture_Capital", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Venture Capital", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Start_Up", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Start Up", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Valuation_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Valuation Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://cdn.betakit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Intuit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721520", "eventUri": "eng-9721520", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

The IRS hopes to offer free direct tax filing for everyone next year?\n\nIntuit has announced plans to lay off 1,800 people, which is roughly 10 percent of its workforce.\n\nIt also claims it's not actually eliminating jobs overall - and will be hiring the same number of staff in Bangalore, Tel Aviv, and some US locations to do AI-related work.\n\nIntuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi shared the news in an email to employees Wednesday morning that was filled with references to his plans to become an artificial intelligence leader, and as such things need to change at the TurboTax maker.\n\n\"As I've shared many times, the era of AI is one of the most significant technology shifts of our lifetime,\" Goodarzi said in his missive, also shared publicly. \"For over 40 years, we've had a successful track record of self-disruption and reinvention ... we must accelerate our innovation and investments in the areas that are most important to our future success.\"\n\nThose areas all center around supporting customers with AI-powered products, according to the Intuit CEO, and presage a change in strategy at the software developer.\n\n\"Our vision is to be an AI-driven expert platform for mid-market customers, delivering industry-specific experiences to fuel their success as the complexity of their business grows,\" Goodarzi wrote. Intuit has been focusing on growing its mid-market business since 2019, we're told.\n\n... embedding AI in all our customer experiences, enabling our customers to manage their money\n\nIn order to further that mission, the California corporation plans to get rid of around 1,050 people \"who are not meeting expectations\" in the cuts announced today, and where those employees being eliminated are located wasn't made clear.\n\nThe cuts will also include a 10 percent reduction in the number of director or higher executive positions at Intuit, and the elimination of more than 300 roles \"to streamline work and reallocate resources toward key growth areas.\"\n\nIntuit's director of external corporate communications Kali Fry told The Register the biz considers its most critical growth areas to be \"embedding AI in all our customer experiences, enabling our customers to manage their money end-to-end, and accelerat[ing] our mid-market offerings and international growth.\"\n\nEighty technology roles at the developer are also being consolidated \"to sites where we are strategically growing our technology teams and capabilities,\" Goodarzi said. He explained two offices in Edmonton and Boise would be closed, impacting 250 employees, \"a certain number\" of whom were asked to relocate, with the rest terminated. The new tech roles will be located in Atlanta, Bangalore, within Maine and New York, Tel Aviv, and Toronto.\n\nThe 1,800 new jobs, replacing the same number cut, will be mostly in engineering, product, and customer-facing roles like sales, support and marketing, we're told.\n\n\"In context of the actions we are taking today, we expect our overall headcount to grow in FY25 and beyond,\" Goodarzi told employees.\n\nIntuit has been in the cross-hairs of US regulators of late, with the Federal Trade Commission ruling earlier this year that the tax filing app biz falsely advertised its products as \"free\" when most US folks filing taxes using Intuit's tech had to eventually pay for it. Intuit has said it believes the FTC lacked authority to make such a decision.\n\nThe IRS, meanwhile, just trialed a free tax preparation program to save Americans from the likes of Intuit's \"junk fees\" in a selection of states. The tax collectors said in April this Direct File pilot program was used by just over 140,000 taxpayers, and that the IRS saw \"strong interest\" in the system.\n\nThe agency subsequently made the program permanent and invited all states to take part. Meanwhile, Republicans have vowed to defund the Direct File system.\n\nWith Intuit officially on notice that it's likely to lose a chunk of its revenue - due to the above IRS program rendering the biz's filing prep software and services unnecessary for taxpayers - that refocus on mid-market customers makes a lot of business sense, and eliminating a bunch of jobs that are part of a now-outdated business model does, too.\n\nIntuit didn't directly answer questions about how its strategy, and accompanying layoffs, may be driven by the IRS's moves, telling us only that today's announcement was \"not related to a particular business.\" \u00ae", "source": {"uri": "theregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theregister.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(NASDAQ:INTU), the financial software company, retained a favorable outlook from investment firm Jefferies, which reiterated a Buy rating and a $770.00 stock price target for the company's stock. Intuit recently announced a restructuring of its workforce, with plans to reduce approximately 1,800 positions, equating to around 10% of its total headcount.\n\nDespite this reduction, the company aims to match the number of layoffs with new hires, focusing on strategic growth areas, and anticipates an increase in headcount for the fiscal year 2025 and beyond.\n\nThe current restructuring is slightly more significant than the previous workforce adjustment in June 2020, when Intuit reduced its workforce by roughly 7.5%, laying off 715 employees but subsequently hiring over 700 new staff members. Similar to the current initiative, the past re-hiring targeted strategic growth sectors within the company.\n\nIntuit has seen a consistent annual increase in headcount since the fiscal year 2015. The company's focus remains on small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), the mid-market, financial technology (fintech), and international expansion, all of which are expected to be bolstered by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Moreover, recent price hikes in QuickBooks (QB) services have been viewed positively by the investment firm.\n\nThe analyst from Jefferies highlighted Intuit's ongoing commitment to key growth drivers, suggesting confidence in the company's strategic direction. Intuit's reshuffling of its workforce is seen as a step towards aligning its resources with its long-term objectives, particularly in the areas of SMB, mid-market, fintech, and international operations, which are likely to benefit from enhanced AI capabilities.\n\nThe price target set by Jefferies indicates a continued bullish stance on Intuit's stock performance, as the company navigates through its latest organizational changes. The reiteration of the Buy rating and the $770.00 price target suggests that the investment firm believes Intuit's strategic adjustments will support its growth trajectory and contribute to its value proposition for investors.\n\nIn other recent news, Intuit Inc. has been the subject of several major developments. The company maintained its Outperform rating and $700 price target from BMO Capital, following an announcement of a company restructuring to bolster its artificial intelligence capabilities and strengthen its Live product offerings.\n\nConcurrently, Intuit has been assigned an Outperform rating and a $760 price target by RBC Capital, reflecting the company's strong market presence and successful shift to a subscription-based model.\n\nStill, Erste Group downgraded Intuit from Buy to Hold due to concerns about competitive pressures. In a strategic move, Intuit announced plans to acquire technology from Zendrive to enhance Credit Karma's usage-based auto insurance feature, Karma Drive.\n\nOn the financial front, Intuit's earnings per share estimates for fiscal year 2024 have been raised to roughly $16.80 from $16.32, indicating a positive revenue outlook.\n\nThese developments underscore the evolving landscape for Intuit as it navigates market challenges and opportunities. Notably, firms such as BofA Securities, Edward Jones, Susquehanna, and Piper Sandler have maintained positive ratings on Intuit's stock, despite some adjustments to their price targets.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuit", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fintech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickBooks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "QuickBooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nielsen_Media_Research", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nielsen Media Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subscription_business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Subscription business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vehicle insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Bank_of_Canada", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Royal Bank of Canada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earnings_per_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earnings per share"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Marketing_and_Advertising/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Marketing and Advertising/Consulting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Cash_Flow", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Cash Flow", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/Intuit_800x533_L_1630573020.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721520", "eventUri": "eng-9721520", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-06-", "textStart": 682, "textEnd": 691}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

RBC Capital recently initiated coverage on the company, setting a price target of $760, implying a 15% upside from the current price. Lead analyst Rishi Jaluria believes the firm can monetize GenAI across its products. Let's take some time to understand Intuit's business and break down RBC's bullish argument.\n\nIntuit has four main products: TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and MailChimp. TurboTax is a software and service for filing tax returns. Credit Karma provides access to credit scores and reports and helps track personal finances. QuickBooks is small business accounting software, and MailChimp is an email marketing platform for creating and tracking email campaigns.\n\nIntuit operates as four reportable segments: Small Business & Self-Employed, Consumer, Credit Karma, and ProTax. The Small Business & Self-Employed segment sells QuickBooks and MailChimp, making up 56% of total revenue. TurboTax is in the Consumer segment, making up 29% of total revenue.\n\nThe company's TurboTax platform managed 28% of IRS returns last year. The firm had a 70% market share amongst those who chose to file their returns without professional help. QuickBooks controls 81% of the small business accounting market share. This market is currently worth $20 billion and is expected to grow by 9.2% annually until 2029.\n\nIntuit's powerful market shares are one reason Jaluria believes the firm can greatly benefit from implementing GenAI. These market shares give them access to massive amounts of data, which they can use to train algorithms and deliver more value to their customers.\n\nRegarding TurboTax, Benjamin Franklin's phrase applies well: \"Nothing is certain, except death and taxes.\" Everyone must file their taxes, but almost no one is a tax expert. This can cause people to have a lot of questions when filing. RBC believes Intuit has a big opportunity to harness and monetize GenAI here. AI will allow the company's in-house human tax experts to provide faster and better answers to individual tax situations. Customers can also get questions answered directly by Intuit's GenAI.\n\nThis should lower costs and provide more value to customers, which should, in turn, keep those customers and drive them to use Intuit's other products.\n\nIntuit Assist is the firm's new financial assistant, which will use GenAI's power. The platform is being implemented across all of Intuit's products. The firm hopes to drive cost reduction and improved insights into taxes, personal finance, small business accounting, and marketing intelligence.\n\nWe already have some data on customers utilizing Intuit Assist. In the firm's earnings call last quarter, CEO Sasan Goodarzi said that more than 24 million customers used Intuit Assist to explain their refund last year. Nearly half of Credit Karma's 40 million active users now have access to GenAI capabilities.\n\nWith Credit Karma, customers can have a conversation with Intuit Assist. For example, they can ask specific questions to understand why one credit card is a better option for them than another. Goodarzi emphasized that if these features were not helping with monetization, the company would not have rolled them out to so many customers.\n\nThe firm grew revenues solidly in the quarter, up 12% from the previous year, and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) was up 11%. Growth in the Small Business & Self-Employed segment of 18% is particularly encouraging. This is the firm's largest and most consistent segment. It also has the highest operating margin in every quarter other than tax season. The Consumer segment revenue and margins spike in that quarter. Analysts expect net income to increase by 16% annually over the next three years.\n\nWhen it comes to valuation, the firm's forward P/E ratio sits at 36, in the 66th percentile of the U.S. technology sector. Many analysts are bullish on the shares, with 22 out of 31 rating the company as a Buy or Strong Buy. But, most are not as bullish as RBC, with the average price target only implying an upside of 6%.\n\nBefore you consider Intuit, you'll want to hear this.\n\nMarketBeat keeps track of Wall Street's top-rated and best performing research analysts and the stocks they recommend to their clients on a daily basis.

AG calls for continuance of FTC ban on 'deceptive' TurboTax ads", "body": "In January, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) delivered an opinion and final order prohibiting Intuit, parent company to TurboTax, from advertising its services as \"free\" unless they are free to all customers, or if stipulations are clearly communicated. The directive came after an investigation into deceptive advertising claims against the global financial technology company.\n\nIntuit has since appealed the FTC ruling in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. In response, D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb and Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, alongside 22 state attorneys general, filed a brief calling for the appeal to be rejected on June 24.\n\n\"Intuit misled taxpayers in D.C. and across the country with ads falsely claiming TurboTax was free,\" said Schwalb in a statement. \"Preying upon low-income taxpayers and military families who were eligible to file their taxes at no cost, Intuit pocketed millions of dollars in profit. The FTC's cease and desist order protects consumers from this type of unacceptable, illegal conduct.\"\n\nIntuit previously settled with a coalition of 50 states and D.C. in 2022, resolving state probes into allegations that the company misled consumers about TurboTax's services. The agreement included $141 million for Americans who paid to file their taxes on TurboTax when the software should have been free. Nearly 4.4 million customers across the country received a payment, according to Intuit.\n\nA few months before the January opinion and final order, the FTC's Chief Administrative Law Judge D. Michael Chappell ruled that Intuit participated in deceptive advertising. He ordered a cease and desist on these alleged practices.\n\nRepresentatives from Intuit have concerns surrounding the objectivity of the judgment, particularly because it was the FTC that lodged the suit and a judge employed by the agency who issued the ruling.\n\n\"We resolved the core of the FTC's complaint against us more than two years ago with the settlement with all of the state attorneys general,\" said Derrick Plummer, a spokesperson for Intuit. \"The FTC's five-year escapade against us is an overreach and waste of taxpayer dollars. Intuit has always been clear and fair with our customers.\"\n\n\"We have appealed the FTC's unconstitutional order to the federal appellate court and are confident that when our case is heard, we will win,\" he continued.\n\nAttorneys general from Maryland, Maine, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin joined Schwalb and Raoul in filing the June brief.\n\nThe officials urged the court to side with the FTC's opinion.\n\n\"Intuit's arguments in this appeal -- which attempt to invalidate the commission's opinion by claiming that it was not supported by substantial evidence and that the relief the commission ordered was unnecessary given the states' settlement -- would, if adopted, interfere with the states' interests in preventing deceptive advertising,\" wrote the attorneys general in the brief.", "source": {"uri":

The company's stock dipped by around 3.6% on the news.\n\nOn social media, the response could also be described as mildly negative.\n\nTechnologist Dare Obasanjo said the announcement \"epitomizes the simultaneous feast and famine that is today's tech industry.\" He Obasanjo also opined that the company had \"branded\" the laid off workers by publicly stating that the majority being laid off had failed to meet expectations.\n\nUnder a section in the blog post announcing the layoffs entitled \"Taking care of our people,\" Goodarzi writes:\n\n\"We've significantly raised the bar on our expectations of employee performance, resulting in approximately 1,050 employees leaving the company who are not meeting expectations and who we believe will be more successful outside of Intuit.\"\n\nThe company also says it's giving those laid off severance packages, 60 days notice, and access to career transition services and six months of continuing health care benefits.", "source": {"uri": "cointelegraph.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cointelegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tristan_greene@cointelegraph.com", "name": "Tristan Greene", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intuit", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fintech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Technology company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severance_package", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severance package"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=90,width=1200/https://s3.cointelegraph.com/uploads/2024-07/74d73895-9dff-476a-be78-1dd2f3507281.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9721520", "eventUri": "eng-9721520", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

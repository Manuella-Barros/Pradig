The false tests included pedestrian protection, side collisions and steering impact.\n\nNo safety problems were associated with the misconduct and people who own Toyota vehicles don't need to take any action, according to Toyota. Toyota's overseas production was not affected.\n\nToyota's chairman, Akio Toyoda apologized in June while announcing massive testing irregularities involving six models, including the Crown and the Lexus RX luxury models. Production of some models in Japan was halted.\n\n\"It is with deep regret that we were not able to properly conduct our certification operations, and we apologize to our stakeholders for any concern or inconvenience this may have caused them,\" Toyota said in a statement.\n\nToyota said workers did not clearly understand the rules for preparing documents required for certification applications or the basic importance of such work. Managers also lacked that understanding and were not adequately involved.\n\nThe company was carrying out an internal investigation after the earlier mishap, trying to correct the problem, when the latest oversight surfaced.\n\nThe wide-ranging fraudulent testing, which surfaced earlier at Japan's top automaker, involved the use of inadequate or outdated data in collision tests and incorrect testing of airbag inflation and rear-seat damage in crashes. Engine power tests also were falsified. The deceptive test results were also found on discontinued models.\n\nSimilar fraudulent tests were found at Mazda Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., and at Toyota group makers Hino Motors and Daihatsu Motor Co.\n\nToyota reported the latest findings to the government and renewed its promise to correct its corporate culture and its work habits.\n\nProduction of the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio and Yaris Cross, all small models for the Japanese market, has been suspended since June 3.

All told, they found eight new procedural violations affecting seven nameplates.\n\nThe revelations follow an embarrassing announcement on June 3 that Toyota and three other automakers -- Mazda Motor Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Suzuki Motor Corp. - had not been conducting vehicle testing in compliance with the ministry's certification standards.\n\nBut the revelations were especially embarrassing for Toyota, following earlier certification missteps at several Toyota Group companies, including its truck-making unit Hino, its minicar subsidiary Daihatsu and an engine and parts supplier called Toyota Industries Corp.\n\nThe continuing misconduct tarnished Toyota's image and distracted it from daily business as it looked backward to troubleshoot and correct problems.\n\nThe scandal also triggered an investor backlash against Chairman Akio Toyoda at the annual shareholders' meeting in June, when the longtime company leader saw his support rate fall to a record low.\n\nMeanwhile, Toyota's forced production suspension following the misconduct contributed to a 13 percent slide in global output in June. The slowdown may have dragged down earnings in April-June fiscal first quarter, a result that will be announced Aug. 1.\n\nThe initial misconduct identified in June forced Toyota to suspend deliveries of three affected vehicles still in production: the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio and Yaris Cross. Several affected models had already discontinued, including the Crown, Isis, Sienta and Lexus RX.\n\nToyota said July 31 that it plans to resume production of the Corolla Fielder, Corolla Axio and Yaris Cross in mid-September after the ministry confirms they are in compliance.\n\nThe newly identified violations, announced July 31, affect several vehicles still in production, but several of them were certified outside of Japan and apparently do not require suspension.\n\nThe Voxy and Noah vans, however, are Japan-market offerings and will be halted.\n\nOn those models, Toyota conducted improper occupant protective device testing in relation to their navigation displays. It tested with parts not used in mass production, the company said. Toyota said it suspended shipments July 29 and wasn't sure when they would resume.\n\nOther vehicles that underwent improper certification included the Lexus RX in 2015, the RAV4 in 2017, the Camry in 2017, the Toyota Harrier crossover in 2022 and the Lexus LM van last year.\n\nToyota blamed the lapses on on-site and managerial oversights.\n\nThe problems included unclear internal operational rules for preparing documents required for certification application and insufficient awareness of the importance of certification work.\n\nToyota also said management lacked full understanding of and involvement in certification.", "source": {"uri": "autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Automotive News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hans_greimel@autonews.com", "name": "Hans Greimel", "type":

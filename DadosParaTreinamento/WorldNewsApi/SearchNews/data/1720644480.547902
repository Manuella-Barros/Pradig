The clarification comes amidst ongoing claims by leaders from both parties that a joint AIADMK-BJP front in the recently-concluded Lok Sabha elections could have led to significant victories, thereby impacting the DMK-led INDIA alliance in Tamil Nadu.Who gets which ministry in Modi 3.0?

In 2014, NDA's vote share was 18.80 per cent. In 2024, the NDA's vote share is 18.28 per cent. So it's wrong to say that the BJP alliance has grown in TN. The vote share of BJP and DMK has gone down. But the media keeps talking only about AIADMK saying our votes have gone to others. Our votes haven\u2019t gone anywhere,\" he said.Notably, Palaniswami has extended his greetings to Narendra Modi who will be assuming the Office of Prime Minister on Sunday. \"I extend my hearty congratulations on behalf of the AIADMK to honourable Narendra Modi, on assuming the office of Prime Minister of India for the third consecutive term,\" Palaniswami said in his message.Both AIADMK and the BJP scored a zilch in Tamil Nadu in the Lok Sabha elections, with Chief Minister MK Stalin-led Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) emerging as the showstopper by bagging 22 of the 40 constituencies in the southern state. DMK's INDIA bloc ally Congress won 9 seats.Published By: Sahil SinhaPublished On: Jun 8, 2024ALSO READ | AIADMK blames Annamalai for the party's exit from BJP-led NDA allianceMust Watch", "summary": "<a href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/tamil-nadu/story/tamil-nadu-edappadi-palaniswami-says-no-alliance-with-bjp-in-2026-assembly-polls-2550719-2024-06-08\"> <img align=\"left\" hspace=\"2\" height=\"180\" width=\"305\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/aiadmk-general-secretary-edappadi-k-palaniswami-081302122-16x9.jpg?VersionId=8_QYPgvz_1XKzQykTjVE.yi89bXuVo.J\"> </a> No alliance with BJP in 2026 Tamil Nadu polls: AIADMK's Edappadi Palaniswami", "url": "https://www.indiatoday.in/india/tamil-nadu/story/tamil-nadu-edappadi-palaniswami-says-no-alliance-with-bjp-in-2026-assembly-polls-2550719-2024-06-08", "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202406/aiadmk-general-secretary-edappadi-k-palaniswami-081302122-16x9.jpg?VersionId=8_QYPgvz_1XKzQykTjVE.yi89bXuVo.J?size=1280:720", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 12:05:18", "author": "Shilpa Nair", "authors": ["Shilpa Nair"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.315}

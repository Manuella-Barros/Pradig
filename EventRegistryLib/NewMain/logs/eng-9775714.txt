Directed by Anthony Mandler, the film will play at AMC and Odeon locations, and many other locations globally. Interestingly enough, Trafalgar had Sept. 12 reserved on the Comscore release calendar for an untitled event film.\n\nUnlike AMC's first concert movie release, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, which arrived last October as a miracle to an event pic-starved theatrical marketplace straddled by the actors strike (opening to $93.2M stateside, and grossing $180.7M domestic, $267M global), Usher: Rendezvous in Paris arrives at an extremely competitive time at the domestic B.O., specifically in the wake of Warner Bros.' Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice (Sept. 6), which is expected to be huge. Usher: Rendezvous in Paris will open up against such rival wide entries as Lionsgate's Dave Bautista action comedy The Killer's Game and Blumhouse/Universal's Speak No Evil. While Eras Tour was the envy of many motion picture studios who lost out on bidding for the movie, AMC's immediate concert follow-up pic, Renaissance: A Film by Beyonce, wasn't as robust, opening in early December, a dead-time at the box office to $21.8M and fizzling to $33.9M domestic, $44M WW.\n\nUsher: Rendezvous in Paris includes the 80M record selling performer's chart-topping hits including \"Yeah!\", \"My Boo\", \"Love In This Club\" and more from his three-decade career. In addition to the lavish stage performance on screen, the movie will also reportedly have a docu-sensibility to it, similar to Renaissance.\n\nWorldwide screening details and ticketing will be available at UsherinParis.com on August 6 at 9:00 a.m. ET / 6:00 a.m. PT.\n\n\"Paris was a special experience for me as an entertainer and for my fans,\" said Usher. \"I hope those who weren't able to make it in person get to experience how special it was. As for those of you who were, I hope you experience the show and see what it takes to get there through a different lens.\"\n\n\"For 30 years Usher has captivated and entertained audiences through his music and concerts. Just a few months ago, he drew rave reviews for his stunning performance in front of 129 million people during the Super Bowl Half Time Show. Bringing his unparalleled concert experience to movie theatres for his fans around the world is a perfect fit for AMC Theatres Distribution,\" said Adam Aron, Chairman and CEO, AMC Theatres.\n\nMarc Allenby, CEO, Trafalgar Releasing, adds \"We are excited to continue our partnership with Sony Music Vision and AMC Theatres Distribution to bring the energy of Usher to movie theater audiences around the world. He is the perfect artist to support our shared vision of creating global experiences around concert films for artists that advance the evolution of the cinema into venues for all forms of entertainment.\"\n\nThe concert film will be released in the U.S. and globally by Trafalgar Releasing, in partnership with AMC Theatres Distribution.

After Taylor Swift did her part to save movie theaters with the surprise release of \"Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour\" last fall, AMC Theaters is partnering on the release of another event concert film, this time featuring R&B and pop superstar Usher.\n\nAMC Theatres along with Trafalgar Releasing and Sony Music Vision will release the concert film \"Usher: Rendezvous in Paris\" in theaters worldwide for a limited run between September 12-15. Tickets go on sale August 6.\n\n\"Rendezvous in Paris\" was filmed across eight different performances by Usher in France during Paris Fashion week at La Seine Musicale back in 2023 prior to his performance at the Super Bowl earlier this year. The concert film of course features some of his biggest hits like \"Yeah!,\" \"My Boo,\" \"Love In This Club\" and many more, and the stage show incorporated much of what he brought to his intimate Vegas residency shows.\n\n\"Paris was a special experience for me as an entertainer and for my fans,\" Usher said in a statement. \"I hope those who weren't able to make it in person get to experience how special it was. As for those of you who were, I hope you experience the show and see what it takes to get there through a different lens.\"\n\nThe film will be available at over 2,000 cinemas nationwide, including at AMC and Odeon locations, as well as other theaters globally. Unlike \"The Eras Tour,\" Trafalgar Releasing is primarily handling U.S. and global distribution, while AMC and Odeon will handle core marketing support. Sony Music Vision has all rights excluding theatrical.\n\n\"Usher: Rendezvous in Paris\" was directed by Anthony Mandler. It is a production of Arcovision, Kingdom Films, and Laffitte Group Productions. The film is produced by Anthony Mandler, Usher Raymond, and Ron Laffitte. Executive Producers for Kingdom Films are Aakomon Jones and Angelo Goppee. Executive Producer for Arcovision is Kwesi Collison.

He has also tirelessly distinguished himself as a devout humanitarian, raising tens of millions of dollars for various causes and uplifting youth via his New Look Foundation. Since 1999 he has been providing opportunities for young people in underserved communities and enabling them to flourish and achieve seemingly impossible dreams. A long-time supporter and Global Citizen Ambassador, USHER has performed at events since 2015 raising awareness to defeat poverty, defend the planet, and demand equity. A true outlier, he was equally at home on the stage of his sold-out My Way Las Vegas residency as he was on a 2016 government cultural mission to Cuba as part of President Barack Obama's Presidential Committee for Arts and Humanities. In 2024 he will be celebrating 30 years as an entertainer, headlined the Super Bowl LVIII halftime show and released his ninth studio album, COMING HOME.", "source": {"uri": "investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Music", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sony Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Boo_(Usher_and_Alicia_Keys_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "My Boo (Usher and Alicia Keys song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMC Theatres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeah!_(Usher_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yeah!

The movie will include performances of some of the Grammy winner's biggest hits like \"Yeah!,\" \"My Boo,\" and \"Love In This Club,\" as well as provide a \"glimpse inside life beyond the stage.\"\n\n\"Paris was a special experience for me as an entertainer and for my fans,\" Usher said. \"I hope those who weren't able to make it in person get to experience how special it was.

Days before the performance, he released his ninth studio album \"Coming Home.\" Last month, Usher was honored with a BET Lifetime Achievement Award. His Usher: Past Present Future Tour will kick off in August.\n\nThe Essentials: Ahead of Usher's Super Bowl halftime show, here are his Vegas must-haves\n\n\"Getting here has definitely not been easy, but it has been worth it,\" he said in his acceptance speech. \"This Life(time) Achievement Award, I don't know man, is it too early for me to receive it? Because I'm still running and gunning, and I still love this (work) like I did when I was 8 years old.\"\n\nUsher talks Super Bowl show, reveals most 'personal' song on new album: 'Oh, I'm ruined'\n\n\"Usher: Rendezvous In Paris\" will also follow concert films from Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 that both hit theaters last year. Swift's \"The Eras Tour,\" a filmed version of her hugely successful tour, debuted in October and grossed more than $260 million at the worldwide box office, making it the highest-grossing concert movie of all time.\n\n\"Renaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9,\" meanwhile, hit theaters last December and debuted at No. 1 at the box office, ultimately grossing over $40 million worldwide. Unlike \"The Eras Tour\" film, \"Renaissance\" incorporated behind-the-scenes elements and interviews.

The multiple GRAMMY Award-winning diamond-selling international megastar, dancer, entrepreneur, and philanthropist inspires change yet again.\n\nBeyond selling over 80 million records worldwide and collecting dozens of awards, he has simultaneously lit up the small screen on NBC's The Voice and the big screen in blockbusters such as Hustlers. He has also tirelessly distinguished himself as a devout humanitarian, raising tens of millions of dollars for various causes and uplifting youth via his New Look Foundation. Since 1999 he has been providing opportunities for young people in underserved communities and enabling them to flourish and achieve seemingly impossible dreams. A long-time supporter and Global Citizen Ambassador, USHER has performed at events since 2015 raising awareness to defeat poverty, defend the planet, and demand equity. A true outlier, he was equally at home on the stage of his sold-out My Way Las Vegas residency as he was on a 2016 government cultural mission to Cuba as part of President Barack Obama's Presidential Committee for Arts and Humanities. In 2024 he will be celebrating 30 years as an entertainer, headlined the Super Bowl LVIII halftime show and released his ninth studio album, COMING HOME.\n\nCategory: Company Release\n\nView source version on businesswire.com:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240730324910/en/\n\nCONTACT: MEDIA CONTACTS\n\nAMC Theatres:\n\nRyan Noonan, (913) 213-2183\n\nrnoonan@amctheatres.comTrafalgar Releasing:\n\npress@trafalgar-releasing.comSony Music Vision:\n\nDevan Schulte, (201) 805-5242\n\nDevan.Schulte@sonymusic.comUSHER\n\nThe Chamber Group\n\nChris@TheChamberGroup.com\n\nLydia@TheChamberGroup.com\n\nKEYWORD: EUROPE UNITED STATES NORTH AMERICA FRANCE KANSAS\n\nINDUSTRY KEYWORD: ENTERTAINMENT ONLINE MOBILE ENTERTAINMENT EVENTS/CONCERTS GENERAL ENTERTAINMENT TV AND RADIO CELEBRITY FILM & MOTION PICTURES THEATRE MUSIC\n\nSOURCE: AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc.\n\nCopyright Business Wire 2024.\n\nPUB: 07/30/2024 09:00 AM/DISC: 07/30/2024 09:00 AM\n\nhttp://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240730324910/en", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Music", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sony Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_Theatres", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMC Theatres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concert_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Concert film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odeon_Cinemas", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Odeon Cinemas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_in_This_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Love in This Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Boo_(Usher_and_Alicia_Keys_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "My Boo (Usher and Alicia Keys song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Mandler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Mandler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeah!_(Usher_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yeah!

The North American trek hits New York for four sold-out shows at Brooklyn's Barclays Center on Sept. 6, 7, 9 and 10.\n\nUsher will be taking the vibe of his hot-ticket Las Vegas residency, which ended last December, on the road.\n\n\"The reality is that, naturally, I want the rest of the world to have access to what people felt from these theater shows that I had here in Las Vegas,\" Usher told The Post in February.\n\n\"I'm going to curate it in a much different way because now I'm playing, obviously, bigger spaces, but I get a chance to immerse people in this experience and bring it live directly to you.\"\n\nAnd even going from a theater to arenas, Usher plans to make it still feel like an intimate, interactive experience.\n\n\"You have to put your phone down ... because I completely try to immerse you into the experience,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm in your face. I'm connecting with you. I want you to sing ... These songs, these words, they mean something.\"\n\nThis major Usher moment comes 30 years after the crooner released his self-titled debut album as a 15-year-old on Aug. 30, 1994 -- and 20 years after he released his blockbuster \"Confessions\" LP on March 23, 2004.\n\n\"If you go back to 'Confessions,' from the moment I did that album, it was like ... 'I'm gonna tell you some really difficult things, and I hope you can understand that,'\" he said of his \"brutally honest\" classic. \"You know, part of this is, you know, healing me by being able to say these things and being able to get this off my chest.\"\n\nAnd with his Past Present Future Tour, Usher is not done confessing yet.\n\n\"This entire phase of my life is really about respecting and honoring and praising the past ... being available and in the moment and authentic, clear, happy, joyous, creative and collaborative in the present, leading us into the future that looks much different than the past,\" he said.\n\n\"There's so many different things that we have yet to do.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usher_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Usher (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeah!_(Usher_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yeah!

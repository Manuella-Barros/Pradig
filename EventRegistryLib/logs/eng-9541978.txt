Supermarket managers said there was no access for supply trucks or employees trying to get to work. Mineral water sales were restricted in some supermarkets.\n\nVolunteer rescue operations after dark in Porto Alegre were also hampered by looting, with police providing security using boats and even

leave.\n\nPORTO ALEGRE, Brazil (AFP) -- Teams raced against the clock Thursday to deliver aid to flood-stricken communities in southern Brazil before the arrival of new storms forecast to batter the region again.\n\nSome 400 municipalities have been affected by the worst natural calamity ever to hit the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with at least 107 people dead and hundreds injured.\n\nMore than 164,000 people have been forced from their homes in the state capital Porto Alegre -- a city of some 1.4 million people -- and hundreds of other cities and towns.\n\nMany in the region have no access to drinking water or electricity, or even the means to call for help, with telephone and internet services down.\n\nA total of 136 people were reported missing and nearly 1.5 million have suffered damages in flooding the government and experts have linked to climate change.\n\nRescuers in boats and on jet skis were on Thursday traveling on streets turned into rivers, looking for people trapped in their homes or those reluctant to leave for fear of looting.\n\nIn the town of Canoas outside the state capital, a horse was hauled from a rooftop by rescuers in inflatable boats, according to images on local media.\n\nThe state's Guaiba River, which runs through Porto Alegre, reached historic levels this week, and officials have warned five dams were at risk of rupturing.\n\n\"The focus is still on rescues ... but we are working very hard on delivering humanitarian aid,\" Sabrina Ribas, a spokeswoman for civil defense force that handles disaster relief, told journalists.\n\nThese efforts may be hindered in the coming days, she added, given warnings of new downpours from Friday to Sunday.\n\nImpressive' solidarity\n\nIn a sports complex in downtown Porto Alegre, a makeshift shelter accommodates 450 people on mattresses scattered around the floor, as well as a few dozen dogs and a small pig.\n\n\"The solidarity is impressive,\" school director Resplande de Sa, 57, told AFP at a donation center as volunteers sorted through duvets, clothes and diapers as children played nearby in apparent oblivion about the tragedy around them.\n\nSeveral prisons have sought federal assistance after being left without potable water, according to the Criminal Justice Network nongovernmental organization.\n\nAt one jail, prisoners had to be moved to higher floors as floodwater entered the complex.\n\nThe disaster has damaged more than 60,000 homes and devastated the economy of the largely agricultural state, which normally supplies more than two-thirds of the rice consumed in Brazil.\n\nThe federal government on Thursday announced it would set aside $10 billion for reconstruction of the region.\n\nThe Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro was lit up Wednesday night in homage to the victims, with a message appealing for more donations.\n\nHelp arrived from outside Brazil as well.\n\nPope Francis sent 100,000 euros ($107,000) to help care for evacuees, and tycoon Elon Musk said his Starlink satellite company will donate 1,000 terminals to emergency responders \"and make usage for all terminals ... free until the region has recovered.\"\n\nOnly two of Porto Alegre's six water treatment plants were functioning, the mayor's office said earlier this week, and hospitals and shelters were being supplied by tankers.\n\nThe federal government, meanwhile, said it would import 200,000 tons of rice to guarantee supplies and preempt price speculation.", "source": {"uri": "courthousenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Court House News Service"},

Eighty percent of residents lack running water, prompting urgent calls for adherence to water rationing measures.\n\nPorto Alegre, a bustling metropolis in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, has been brought to its knees by the worst flooding the region has seen in over 80 years. The devastating waters have claimed at least 90 lives and left more than 130 people missing, disrupting the lives of millions and exposing the vulnerabilities of a city unprepared for such extreme weather events.\n\nLast Tuesday, the mayor of Porto Alegre issued a desperate plea to the city's residents, urging them to comply with a strict water rationing decree. This measure was necessary as the floods incapacitated five of the city's six water treatment facilities, leaving a staggering four-fifths of the population without running water.\n\nMaria Vit\u00f3ria Jorge, a yoga teacher in downtown Porto Alegre, represents just one of the thousands facing these harsh realities. With her apartment building flooded, she withdrew a significant portion of her savings to secure temporary housing for herself and her parents in a less affected state area. Her journey to safety highlights the difficult choices many residents are forced to make as they prioritize necessities over comfort and stability.\n\nThe flooding in Porto Alegre is part of a larger pattern of extreme weather events impacting different parts of the world. In Latin America, where many countries are prone to natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, the devastation in Porto Alegre is a grim reminder of the need for improved infrastructure and disaster preparedness.\n\nEfforts to rescue those stranded by the floods are ongoing. More rains are forecast for the region, exacerbating the already dire conditions. The city's airport and main bus terminal are submerged and closed, cutting off major transportation routes and making it challenging for aid to reach those in need.\n\nIn response to the crisis, other Brazilian states have mobilized support, sending trucks loaded with donations to the affected areas. However, the need for drinking water, food, and personal hygiene products remains critical, as public health experts warn of the increased risk of waterborne diseases, such as dengue fever and leptospirosis, which could further complicate the disaster response.\n\nAmidst this chaos, the community spirit remains strong. About 100 displaced individuals near the airport have set up makeshift camps, hoping to salvage what they can from their homes. The resilience displayed by these communities is commendable, but the situation remains precarious.\n\nThe national response has been swift, with Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva visiting the state to coordinate disaster response efforts alongside other government officials. The federal government also works to prevent looting and maintain security in disaster-struck areas, deploying National Guard troops to support local forces.\n\nThis catastrophe not only disrupts lives but also threatens the regional economy. Rio Grande do Sul is a major producer of rice, a staple in the Brazilian diet. The floods have delayed the harvest, potentially affecting food supply chains and forcing the country to consider importing rice and other staples to meet domestic needs.\n\nThe situation in Porto Alegre calls for a concerted effort at the national level and internationally. Latin American countries share similar risks regarding natural disasters, and there is a pressing need for regional solidarity and cooperation in disaster preparedness and response. Sharing resources, knowledge, and technology across borders could significantly enhance the region's ability to manage such crises effectively.\n\nAs Porto Alegre and its residents strive to recover and rebuild, the disaster underscores the urgent need for comprehensive urban planning and infrastructure development that can withstand the challenges posed by climate change and extreme weather events. It also highlights the importance of community resilience and the role of local and national governments in safeguarding their citizens against such unpredictable disasters.\n\nCatastrophe in Brazil: Rio Grande do Sul Faces Fatal Floods\n\nWhile the floods in Porto Alegre represent a significant setback, they also offer growth and improvement opportunities. By learning from this experience and investing in better preparedness, Brazil -- and Latin America -- can hope to mitigate the impacts of future natural disasters, protecting its people and their livelihoods against the increasing volatility of our global climate.", "source": {"uri": "latinamericanpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "latinamericanpost.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rationing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rationing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metropolis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Water treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Region, Brazil"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esporte_Clube_Vit\u00f3ria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Esporte Clube Vit\u00f3ria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yoga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federative_units_of_Brazil", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federative units of Brazil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterborne_diseases", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Waterborne diseases"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_station", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bus station"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leptospirosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leptospirosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dengue fever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earthquake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Environment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://latinamericanpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240509_Catastrophic-Floods-in-Brazil-A-Call-for-Regional-Solidarity-and-Action.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541978", "eventUri": "eng-9541978", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Supermarket managers said there was no access for supply trucks or employees trying to get to work. Mineral water sales were restricted in some supermarkets.\n\nVolunteer rescue operations after dark in Porto Alegre were also hampered by looting, with police providing security using boats and even jet skis.\n\n\"We are not going out to rescue people at night without an armed escort, because it has become too risky,\" volunteer Lauro Strogulski told Reuters.", "source": {"uri":

It's unbelievable what is going on here,\" she added.\n\nMeanwhile, Porto Alegre city hall warned civilian rescuers on Wednesday to halt their operations due to the forecast for additional rain, lightning storms and winds exceeding 80 km per hour, reports Reuters news agency.\n\nArmy troopers used amphibious armoured cars to rescue people from flooding in Canoas, just north of the city, where the waters have reached a depth of some 10 feet and the streets can only be navigated by boat.\n\nThe southern region of Rio Grande do Sul state was still under \"high risk\" of more flooding, with rainfall expected to restart in the come days, Brazil's national centre for natural disasters warned.\n\nIn a statement, weather forecaster MetSul said the region could witness \"very large\" floods \"of serious proportions\".\n\nMeanwhile, in neighboring Uruguay, storms and flooding have closed highways and left nearly 800 people displaced and over 3,000 people without power, according to the country's government.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lagoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tanker (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Venezuela"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amphibious warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}], "categories": [], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/brazil-rain-090401502-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=AT8Z6XuCHcHR6KV6NLs2tg2pGDh9eZY7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541978", "eventUri": "eng-9541978", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Many have no access to drinking water or electricity - or even the means to call for help, with telephone and internet services down in many places.\n\nOn Tuesday, state governor Eduardo Leite had warned the human toll was likely to rise as \"the emergency is continuing to develop\" in the state capital of Porto Alegre and other cities and towns. Some 15,000 soldiers, firefighters, police and volunteers were at work across the state, many in boats and jet skis, to rescue those trapped and transport aid.\n\nBut in Porto Alegre the rains returned on Wednesday, halting evacuation efforts. The mayor's office urged rescue boats to suspend their activities, citing the risk of electric shocks from lightning and strong winds of over 80 kilometers per hour.\n\nAuthorities urged people not to return to affected areas due to possible landslides and health hazards. \"Contaminated water can transmit diseases,\" civil defense spokeswoman Sabrina Ribas warned on Wednesday. Many people have been loath to leave their homes for the safety of shelters amid reports of abandoned properties being looted.\n\nThe National Confederation of Municipalities said about 61,000 homes - down from an earlier estimate of 100,000 - had been damaged or destroyed by unprecedented rains and floods in the state, with losses estimated at about 6.3 billion reais (some $1.2 billion.) Damage to schools, hospitals and municipal buildings amounted to about $69 million.\n\nPorto Alegre is home to about 1.4 million people and the larger metropolitan area has more than double that number. The state's Guaiba River, which runs through Porto Alegre, reached historic levels and five dams are at risk of rupturing, with two of them in \"imminent\" danger.\n\nThere were queues at public taps and wells as officials warned that the most urgent need for people stranded by impassable roads, collapsed bridges and flooded homes was drinking water. Only two of Porto Alegre's six water treatment plants were functioning, the mayor's office said Tuesday, and hospitals and shelters were being supplied by tankers.\n\nHelicopters were delivering water and food to communities most in need, while work continued on restoring road access. The Brazilian Navy was to send its \"Atlantic\" vessel Latin America's largest - to Rio Grande do Sul on Wednesday with two mobile water treatment stations. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has vowed there would be \"no lack of resources to meet the needs of Rio Grande do Sul.\"\n\nIn Gasometro, a part of Porto Alegre popular with tourists, the water continued to rise Wednesday, complicating rescue efforts. \"You can only cross on foot or by boat. There is no other way,\" 30-year-old resident Luan Pas told Agence France-Presse (AFP) next to a street turned into a stagnant, smelly river.\n\nOperations at the port of Porto Alegre have been suspended and its international airport indefinitely closed. The Air Force said the military base outside the town will receive commercial flights transporting aid and passengers.\n\nIn a rare dry spot in Porto Alegre's historic center, dozens of people gathered around a generator rented by a pharmacy on Wednesday to charge their cell phones. \"This is a parallel universe,\" said one of them, university professor Daniela da Silva, 30.\n\nThe Inmet meteorological institute has warned of more storms with heavy rains and winds in the south of the state and downpours over the weekend in the Porto Alegre region.\n\nDue to climate change, extreme or rare events \"are becoming more frequent and more extreme,\" Jose Marengo, research coordinator at Brazil's National Center for Natural Disaster Monitoring (Cemaden), told AFP.\n\nThe federal government, meanwhile, said it would import 200,000 tons of rice to guarantee supplies and preempt price speculation. The flooded region supplies more than two-thirds of the rice consumed in Brazil.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres extended his condolences in a statement to the people of Brazil, saying that \"disasters such as this are a reminder of the devastating effects of the climate crisis on lives and livelihoods.\"", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipality", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Municipality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Leite", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eduardo Leite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Region,_Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Region, Brazil"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telephone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lightning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_treatment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Water treatment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tanker (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dam", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dam"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landslide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_real", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazilian real"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazilian Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant\u00f3nio_Guterres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_America", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Latin America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_In\u00e1cio_Lula_da_Silva", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.lemde.fr/2024/05/09/755/0/5061/2530/1440/720/60/0/5294440_5423548-01-06.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541978", "eventUri": "eng-9541978", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 110, "textEnd": 115}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

"In south Brazil, race on to deliver aid ahead of new storms", "body": "The Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro was lit up Wednesday night in homage to the victims, with a message appealing for more donations\n\nTeams raced against the clock Thursday to deliver aid to flood-stricken communities in southern Brazil before the arrival of new storms forecast to batter the region again.\n\nSome 400 municipalities have been affected by the worst natural calamity ever to hit the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with at least 107 people dead and hundreds injured.\n\nMore than 164,000 people have been forced from their homes in the state capital Porto Alegre -- a city of some 1.4 million people -- and hundreds of other cities and towns.\n\nMany in the region have no access to drinking water or electricity, or even the means to call for help, with telephone and internet services down.\n\nA total of 136 people were reported missing and nearly 1.5 million have suffered damages in flooding the government and experts have linked to climate change.\n\nRescuers in boats and on jet skis were on Thursday traveling on streets turned into rivers, looking for people trapped in their homes or those reluctant to leave for fear of looting.\n\nIn the town of Canoas outside the state capital, a horse was hauled from a rooftop by rescuers in inflatable boats, according to images on local media.\n\nThe state's Guaiba River, which runs through Porto Alegre, reached historic levels this week, and officials have warned five dams were at risk of rupturing.\n\n\"The focus is still on rescues... but we are working very hard on delivering humanitarian aid,\" Sabrina Ribas, a spokeswoman for civil defense force that handles disaster relief, told journalists.\n\nThese efforts may be hindered in the coming days, she added, given warnings of new downpours from Friday to Sunday.\n\n- 'Impressive' solidarity -\n\nIn a sports complex in downtown Porto Alegre, a makeshift shelter accommodates 450 people on mattresses scattered around the floor, as well as a few dozen dogs and a small pig.\n\n\"The solidarity is impressive,\" school director Resplande de Sa, 57, told AFP at a donation center as volunteers sorted through duvets, clothes and diapers as children played nearby in apparent oblivion about the tragedy around them.\n\nSeveral prisons have sought federal assistance after being left without potable water, according to the Criminal Justice Network NGO.\n\nAt one jail, prisoners had to be moved to higher floors as floodwater entered the complex.\n\nThe disaster has damaged more than 60,000 homes and devastated the economy of the largely agricultural state, which normally supplies more than two-thirds of the rice consumed in Brazil.\n\nThe federal government on Thursday announced it would set aside $10 billion for reconstruction of the region.\n\nThe Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro was lit up Wednesday night in homage to the victims, with a message appealing for more donations.\n\nHelp arrived from outside Brazil as well.\n\nPope Francis sent 100,000 euros ($107,000) to help care for evacuees, and tycoon Elon Musk said his Starlink satellite company will donate 1,000 terminals to emergency responders \"and make usage for all terminals... free until the region has recovered.\"\n\nOnly two of Porto Alegre's six water treatment plants were functioning, the mayor's office said earlier this week, and hospitals and shelters were being supplied by tankers.\n\nThe federal government, meanwhile, said it would import 200,000 tons of rice to guarantee supplies and preempt price speculation.\n\nmr-rsr/mlr/bgs\n\nMore from this section\n\nACES Quality Management Partners with Infrrd to Provide AI-Powered Intelligent

Searches for missing people continue to be affected by wild weather.\n\nThe Australian government has warned travellers there is damage to infrastructure and essential services, transport may be disrupted and a state of emergency has been declared in some cities.\n\n\"If you're in an affected area, follow the advice of local authorities and monitor the media for updates,\" the Australian government's Smartraveller website states.\n\nThe advice level for Brazil is to exercise a high degree of caution overall \"due to the threat of violent crime\".\n\nThe Salgado Filho International Airport in Porto Alegre, the capital of Rio Grande do Sul state, is closed and it is not known when operations will resume.\n\nThe Air Force said the military base outside town will receive commercial flights transporting aid and passengers.\n\nThe devastating weather is far from over; the Inmet meteorological institute has warned of more storms with heavy rains and winds in the south of the state and downpours over the weekend in the Porto Alegre region.\n\nCompare the Market's manager of general insurance Adrian Taylor warns Australian travellers that most travel insurance providers will only cover natural disaster-related losses if the policy was taken out before it becomes a known event, which the floods now are.\n\n\"If you're on your way to Brazil or you're already there and don't yet have travel insurance, it's likely going to be too late to take out cover,\" he said.\n\nFor those with travel insurance, Mr Taylor advises: \"If people are in a safe place, the next best thing to do would be to contact their travel insurance provider if they are in need of further assistance, whether it be for cancellation of pre-booked activities or securing emergency accommodation or earlier flights out of the country where needed.\n\n\"For those Australians planning to head to southern Brazil, it is worth reconsidering whether you should travel now, or delay your trip.\n\n\"Financial relief may be available to those who purchased travel insurance prior to this event happening. This could come in the form of refunds for flights and accommodation or could cover the costs related to transferring flights and accommodation to later in the year.\"\n\nBrett Mitchell, the Australian managing director for Melbourne-based travel company Intrepid Travel, said travel was extremely difficult in some areas and tourists should stay informed, prepared and be cautious.\n\n\"Have a contingency plan in place in case of flooding or other travel disruptions,\" he told news.com.au.\n\n\"Know alternative routes, emergency contacts, and the location of the nearest embassy or consulate.\n\n\"Be prepared for changes to your travel itinerary - flights, trains, and roads may be affected, so remain flexible and patient while navigating through any disruptions.\"\n\nMr Mitchell said travellers should consider visiting alternative destinations than those impacted by extreme flooding and heavy rains.\n\n\"Heed the advice and instructions of local authorities,\" he said. \"If they advise against travelling to certain areas or recommend evacuation, you must comply for your safety.\"\n\nIntrepid Travel runs tours in Brazil but not in the areas affected by the floods, so they have had no impact to their itineraries.\n\nThe devastation in Rio Grande do Sul\n\nMany people in Rio Grande do Sul have no access to drinking water or electricity - or even the means to call for help, with telephone and internet services down in many places.\n\nPorto Alegre is home to about 1.4 million people and the larger metropolitan area has more than double that number.\n\nIn Gasometro, a part of Porto Alegre popular with tourists, the water continued to rise Wednesday, complicating rescue efforts.\n\n\"You can only cross on foot or by boat. There is no other way,\" 30-year-old resident Luan Pas told AFP next to a street turned into a stagnant, smelly river.\n\nOn Tuesday, state governor Eduardo Leite had warned the human toll was likely to rise as \"the emergency is continuing to develop\" in Porto Alegre and other cities and towns.\n\nSome 15,000 soldiers, firefighters, police and volunteers were at work across the state, many in boats and jet skis, to rescue those trapped and transport aid.\n\nBut in Porto Alegre the rains returned on Wednesday, halting evacuation efforts.\n\nThe mayor's office urged rescue boats to suspend their activities, citing the risk of electric shocks from lightning and strong winds of over 80 kilometres per hour.\n\nAuthorities urged people not to return to affected areas due to possible landslide and health hazards.\n\n\"Contaminated water can transmit diseases,\" civil defence spokeswoman Sabrina Ribas warned on Wednesday.\n\nMany people have been loath to leave their homes for the safety of shelters amid reports of abandoned properties being looted.\n\nThe National Confederation of Municipalities said about 61,000 homes - down from an earlier estimate of 100,000 - had been

400 municipalities have been affected by the worst natural calamity ever to hit the state of Rio Grande do Sul, with at least 107 people dead and hundreds injured.\n\nMore than 164,000 people have been forced from their homes in the state capital Porto Alegre -- a city of some 1.4 million people -- and hundreds of other cities and towns.\n\nMany in the region have no access to drinking water or electricity, or even the means to call for help, with telephone and internet services down.\n\nA total of 136 people were reported missing and nearly 1.5 million have suffered damages in flooding the government and experts have linked to climate change.\n\nRescuers in boats and on jet skis were on Thursday traveling on streets turned into rivers, looking for people trapped in their homes or those reluctant to leave for fear of looting.\n\nIn the town of Canoas outside the state capital, a horse was hauled from a rooftop by rescuers in inflatable boats, according to images on local media.\n\nThe state's Guaiba River, which runs through Porto Alegre, reached historic levels this week, and officials have warned five dams were at risk of rupturing.\n\n\"The focus is still on rescues... but we are working very hard on delivering humanitarian aid,\" Sabrina Ribas, a spokeswoman for civil defense force that handles disaster relief, told journalists.\n\nThese efforts may be hindered in the coming days, she added, given warnings of new downpours from Friday to Sunday.\n\n- 'Impressive' solidarity -\n\nIn a sports complex in downtown Porto Alegre, a makeshift shelter

Resplande de Sa, 57, told AFP at a donation center as volunteers sorted through duvets, clothes and diapers as children played nearby in apparent oblivion about the tragedy around them.\n\nSeveral prisons have sought federal assistance after being left without potable water, according to the Criminal Justice Network NGO.\n\nAt one jail, prisoners had to be moved to higher floors as floodwater entered the complex.\n\nThe disaster has damaged more than 60,000 homes and devastated the economy of the largely agricultural state, which normally supplies more than two-thirds of the rice consumed in Brazil.\n\nThe federal government on Thursday announced it would set aside $10 billion for reconstruction of the region.\n\nThe Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro was lit up Wednesday night in homage to the victims, with a message appealing for more donations.\n\nHelp arrived from outside Brazil as well.\n\nPope Francis sent 100,000 euros ($107,000) to help care for evacuees, and tycoon Elon Musk said his Starlink satellite company will donate 1,000 terminals to emergency responders \"and make usage for all terminals... free until the region has recovered.\"\n\nOnly two of Porto Alegre's six water treatment plants were functioning, the mayor's office said earlier this week, and hospitals and shelters were being supplied by tankers.\n\nThe federal government, meanwhile, said it would import 200,000 tons of rice to guarantee supplies and preempt price speculation.\n\nmr-rsr/mlr/bgs", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro

Supermarket managers said there was no access for supply trucks or employees trying to get to work. Mineral water sales were restricted in some supermarkets.\n\nVolunteer rescue operations after dark in Porto Alegre were also hampered by looting, with police providing security using boats and jet skis.\n\n\"We are not going out to rescue people at night without an armed escort, because it has become too risky,\" volunteer Lauro Strogulski told Reuters.", "source": {"uri": "odt.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Otago Daily Times Online News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Porto Alegre"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amphibious warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armored_car_(military)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armored car (military)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lagoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tractor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio Grande do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suburb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suburb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loader_(equipment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loader (equipment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderstorm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thunderstorm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldorado_do_Sul", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eldorado do Sul"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Eldorado do Sul"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canoas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Canoas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mineral water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Looting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jet aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supermarket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_water", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drinking water"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_disaster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural disaster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Emergency_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Emergency Preparation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.odt.co.nz/sites/default/files/story/2024/05/2024-05-07t023645z_1113557444_rc28l7axzrke_rtrmadp_3_brazil-rains.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9541978", "eventUri": "eng-9541978", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

It's a chaotic situation.\"\n\nThe state capital of Porto Alegre has been virtually cut off by the flooding, with the airport and bus station closed and main roads blocked.\n\n\"We cannot go to south Brazil right now to help our families even if we wanted to, so with our resources, we started making videos with English translations that we shared online to spread awareness of the damage caused by the floods and landslides,\" said Soares.\n\nBoth of their families are safe at the moment, but like thousands in Brazils's southern Rio Gande do Sul state, they still lack water and electricity as floodwaters inundate entire towns.\n\nResidents are left with empty supermarket shelves and closed gas stations, with shops rationing sales of mineral water.\n\nThe Silvas have been talking to the Brazilian community here in Victoria who have families in the flooded state to raise funds for south Brazil.\n\nThey started a GoFundMe page to help their families and the community with a portion going to safe institutions in Brazil that are directly involved with the rescuing, shelter and feeding those impacted by the recent flooding.\n\nRescue teams are racing against the clock to look for

The protesters jumped on stage during the October 4 musical, prompting ushers to lead the cast off stage as the audience booed. Just Stop Oil members locked themselves to the set, causing the show to be cancelled and the theatre to be evacuated. In a statement, William Village, chief executive of Delfont Mackintosh Theatres, announced that the audience would receive refunds. He said: \u201cFollowing our safety protocols, the audience were asked to leave the auditorium and the Met Police attended. Regrettably, there was insufficient time to enable us to complete the rest of the performance. \u201cWhilst we recognise the importance of free expression, we must also respect our audience\u2019s right to enjoy the event for which they have paid.\u201d The five were found guilty of aggravated trespass at Westminster Magistrates in April and sentenced on Friday. Hannah Taylor, 23, was given a community order for 12 months and a 15-day rehabilitation activity requirement, ordered to pay \u00a3279 in costs and a \u00a3114 victim surcharge. Hanan Ameur, 22 was given a 12 month community order, 15-days rehabilitation activity requirement, 80 hours unpaid work, \u00a3279 costs and \u00a3114 victim surcharge. Poppy Bliss, 19, was given a 12 month community order, 10-days rehabilitation activity requirement, 80-hours unpaid work, \u00a3279 cost and \u00a3114 victim surcharge. Two others were also found guilty of criminal damage. Lydia Gribbin, 28, was given a community order 12 months, 10-days rehabilitation activity requirement, 100 hours unpaid work, \u00a3279 costs and \u00a3114 victim surcharge. Noah Crane, 18, was given a community order for 12 months, 130 hours unpaid work, \u00a3279 costs and a \u00a3114 victim surcharge. Detective superintendent Sian Thomas, investigating, said: \u201cThe people in the audience on that evening had spent their hard-earned money and were entitled to enjoy an evening out before the disruptive actions of these people ruined it. \u201cWe have been clear time and again that while we will always respect peaceful protest, when there is clear criminality \u2013 as is the case here \u2013 then we will make arrests and seek to prosecute those responsible.\u201d", "summary": "<p>Performance was cancelled after protestors jumped onto the stage</p>", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/five-just-stop-oil-protestors-sentenced-invading-les-mis-stage-b1163153.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/04/18/15/0d462c5f77de25ee879eb436960386ecY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzEzNTM0ODg3-2.74021880.jpg?width=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/9s7ueqk1-BqwSYW3q.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:18:46", "author": "William Mata", "authors": ["William Mata"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.595}

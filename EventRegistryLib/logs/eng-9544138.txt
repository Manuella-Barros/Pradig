Etaga 3 years and Dr Richard Kofi 6 years of two tenures, which makes it a total of 14 years.\n\nFor the seat of chairman of Ughelli South Chapter of PDP, the Ughievwen Youth Congress in its analysis stated that Constituency I (Ughievwen) had Chief Hon.

To this end, the summit contends that all appointable positions are at the discretion and prerogative of the Governor of the State which are exclusively different from the political structure at the LGA level which the political ancestors in the Ughelli South have equitably delineated for peaceful coexistence of the groups in the LGA over the years.\n\n\"To this end, the local Government Council and PDP Chairmanship positions are electable-tenured positions duly recognized by the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and should not be traded on petty sentiments.

Etaga 3 years and Dr Richard Kofi 6 years of two tenures, which makes it a total of 14 years.\n\nFor the seat of chairman of Ughelli South Chapter of PDP, the Ughievwen Youth Congress in its analysis stated that Constituency I (Ughievwen) had Chief Hon. Michael Djegbe Oshetigho for 8 years on two tenures of 4 years each.\n\nWhile Constituency II (Olomu, Ewu, Effurun Otor, Arhavwarien and Okparebe) has held the local government area party chairmanship for 18 years and 1 month, with Chief Ashagbe 3 years; Late Chief Amos Itihwe 6 years; Chief Sam Obomohwoyeren 1 year; Chief Vincent Oduaran 4 years and Chief Francis Aguonigho 4 years.\n\n\"Thus, arising from the foregoing, the summit resolved that for justice, fairness and equity in Ughelli South LGA, Constituency I (Ughievwen) should be allowed to complete its outstanding Chairmanship terms as fulfilment of the zoning arrangement in Ughelli South Local Government Council, as anything short of this will be fully resisted by all youths. The summit therefore called on all God-fearing leaders of Ughelli South and elsewhere to support the justifiable demand of the peace-loving people of Ughelli South Constituency I (Ughievwen).\n\n\"That for justice, fairness and equity in Ughelli South LGA, Constituency I (Ughievwen) should be allowed to complete its outstanding PDP Local Government Chairmanship terms as a fulfilment of the zoning arrangement in Ughelli South Local Government Council, as anything short of this will be fully resisted. The Summit also called on all God-fearing leaders of Ughelli South and elsewhere to support the justifiable demand of the peace-loving people of Ughelli South Constituency I (Ughievwen).\n\n\"The summit is not unmindful of the political appointments in Ughelli South. To this end, the summit contends that all appointable positions are at the discretion and prerogative of the Governor of the State which are exclusively different from the political structure at the LGA level which the political ancestors in the Ughelli South have equitably delineated for peaceful coexistence of the groups in the LGA over the years.\n\n\"To this end, the local Government Council and PDP Chairmanship positions are electable-tenured positions duly recognized by the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and should not be traded on petty sentiments. Where a zoning arrangement is agreed upon by a group, (As enshrined in the PDP constitution) it should be respected. The Summit therefore called on all God-fearing leaders of Ughelli South to support the justifiable demand of the peace-loving people of Ughelli South Constituency I (Ughievwen),\" said the youths of Ughievwen Kingdom in the communique.\n\nThe youths at the summit agreed that Ughelli South is one big political family that has remained steadfast to the ideals of the PDP and will continue to deliver on all political fronts but vowed to resist all attempts to make Ughievwen a Second Fiddle in the local government area.\n\nThey expressed dissatisfaction over the continuous short-changing of Constituency I (Ughievwen) when it comes to the two chairmanship positions in the local government area despite its 62% voters' strength, abundant endowments of human, land mass and natural resources as well as a standing zoning arrangement between Constituency I (Ughievwen) and Constituency II (Olomu, Ewu, Effurun Otor, Arhavwarien and Okparebe).", "source": {"uri": "thenewsguru.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheNewsGuru"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emman_ovuakporie@thenewsguru.com", "name": "Emman Ovuakporie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Democratic_Party_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peoples Democratic Party (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ughelli_South", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ughelli South"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ughelli South"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_areas_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Local government areas of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delta State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delta State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ewu", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ewu"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olomu", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olomu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Olomu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udu,_Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Udu, Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Udu, Nigeria"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effurun", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Effurun"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Effurun"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_of_Nigeria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "States of Nigeria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://thenewsguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/316636AB-77DE-4E3F-9329-82923946CF8A.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544138", "eventUri": "eng-9544138", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-07-", "textStart": 374, "textEnd": 381}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

I felt something touch my leg that made me not be able to run.\n\n\"I heard people shouting that I had been shot on my right leg by the police. They rushed me to Central Hospital Ughelli after I lost much blood.\" she stated.\n\nAlso speaking, Mrs. Vivian Aphiare said, \"The number of police road blocks from their division to Oteri is over five, and for that reason, no tricycle or Keke would want to come towards the community.\n\n\"As that is not enough, they would come into the community to arrest our people illegally, and when you gets to the station to make an inquiry, they will ask you to bail your wards between the sum of N150,000 to N200,000.\n\n\"We were actually protesting to the palace to meet and complain to our royal father about the activities of the police, but on getting to the front of the police station, the police shot tear gas toward us, and as that was not enough, they opened gunshots on us without any iota of provocation.\n\n\"We want the police to leave the Oteri Road because we are tired of their excesses, intimidation, and illegal arrest and molestation of our children and husbands.\"\n\nOn her part, Mama Harvest Ugbuwiako said, \"We are protesting against the numerous roadblocks belonging to the police, the illegal arrest of our children, and the searching of their phones for no just cause.\n\n\"The police use the Pos machine to check the accounts of our children to know how much they have in their various accounts.\n\n\"The police have roadblock at Emurotu Isodje, GRA, Back of Government College, and front of the Ughelli Police station respectively and for that reason, no biker or Keke rider would be willing to come to Oteri.\n\n\"We don't have armed robbers and kidnappers in our community, but the police are making life difficult for the people of Oteri-Ughelli as their multiple check points caused transportation to increase from N100 to N500.\n\n\"They opened tear gas on us, shot at us, and one of our daughters was shot on the leg, and she is currently on admission at Ughelli Central Hospital. Many others were physically injured.\n\n\"Police are meant to mount roadblocks at the end of a community and not at the center of a town. They took three mobile phones of our children, iPhone 13, iPhone 8 and iPhone 12 -- and beat our woman secretary with planks.\n\n\"They planked other women with wood, and they are currently receiving treatment at different places. We do not want police on our roads again.\" She insisted.\n\nLamenting the torture of the police on them, the President General of the Oteri-Ughelli community, Hon. Erakpofoke Peter, said, \"What happened today was a peaceful protest by the women to tell the world that they no longer need police in Oteri because of their mishaps of illegal extortion.\n\n\"Their activities in the Oteri community are extremely inhuman, and we want to beg the government that we are no longer interested in the police station; they should look for a new site to go and leave our land.\n\n\"Our women no longer go to the market and when the new DPO was posted here, I told him about our challenges, and he saw reasons with me and promised that he was going to do something about it.\n\n\"The women came out to protest against what the police did in Oteri, they destroyed the young man's properties, his television, and carted away so many things from the apartment.\n\n\"The activities of the police has gone so bad that as of 9:00 p.m., you will never see a bike or Keke coming to Oteri because of their extortion, brutalisation, molestation and illegal arrest and as a result, they could not go market again, and that is their grievances.\"\n\nThose currently on admission are, Valentine Adomi 24, Edith Itive 37, Akaeze Joy 22,\n\nLoveth Brown-Tate, 42, with an injury to her right eye, Mrs. Lucky Philip, 48, with an injury to her right hand;

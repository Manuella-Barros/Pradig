After nearly 80% of the 2023 joint practices lasted two days, over two-thirds of the sessions this year are one-day affairs.\n\n\"One, to me, is plenty,\" New York Jets coach Robert Saleh said.\n\nThe argument against two-day joint practices is that the second day often is chippier and increases the possibility of injuries.\n\nAtlanta wide receiver Rondale Moore was carted off the field with a leg injury Wednesday as the Falcons practiced against the Miami Dolphins for a second straight day. Also Wednesday, the NFL fined the New York Giants and Detroit Lions $200,000 each for multiple fights that stretched across their two days of practicing against each other.\n\nThe NFL sent out a memo last month stating fights and unprofessional conduct at joint practices wouldn't be tolerated. Packers coach Matt LaFleur noted earlier in this offseason that \"sometimes it becomes a wrestling match out there or an MMA fight\" when joint practices extend to a second day.\n\n\"Every time I've ever had a joint practice, the first day will be a little rough and then the second one ends in a fight,\" Packers running back Josh Jacobs said.\n\nThe problems with this week's Falcons-Dolphins and Giants-Lions joint practices didn't necessarily result from both lasting two days.\n\nMoore suffered an apparent non-contact injury, so it just as easily could have happened if the Falcons had been practicing on their own. Much of the fighting between the Giants and Lions, including one brawl that injured Detroit cornerback Emmanuel Moseley, happened on their first practice day rather than their second.\n\nNFL teams are permitted to hold joint practices for as many as four days during training camp, and those can be divided in any way possible. For instance, the Los Angeles Rams are holding four separate one-day sessions against three different teams.\n\nThe Rams held their first joint workout with the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, and they'll meet again on Aug. 14. The Rams practiced with the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday and have a session with the Houston Texans on Aug. 22.\n\nRams quarterback Matthew Stafford said after Sunday's workout that he likes limiting joint practices to one day.\n\n\"I think there's probably less fights, which is good,\" Stafford said. \"You know, the second day is when everybody kind of gets a little charged up and gets going.\"\n\nIt also has been when some notable injuries have occurred.\n\nSaleh's Jets were in a second day of joint workouts with the Packers three years ago when defensive end Carl Lawson ruptured his Achilles tendon and safety Zane Lewis hurt his knee, knocking both players out for the entire season.\n\nSaleh shortened the Jets' two scheduled two-day joint practices last year to a single day each. The Jets practiced against the Washington Commanders on Thursday and have one-day sessions with the Carolina Panthers on Aug. 15 and the Giants on Aug. 21.\n\n\"Very rarely do you ever have a football player go through that much volume and intensity in back-to-back days,\" Saleh said. \"So you're not only subjecting our guys to the injury on Day 2, but also it's just very little production because they're just seeing red and they're fighting and they're avoiding their techniques.\"\n\nThat much was apparent during the Packers' joint practices with the New England Patriots last year. After the first day went by without any major incidents, three fights broke out about five minutes into their second joint workout.\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Dennis Allen explained why fights are more likely on the second day.\n\n\"You have the first day's practice,\" Allen said. \"One team or the other is going to feel like they got the better of the other team. Those coaches are going to go yell at their players. Their players are going to pissed off, and then that's how that stuff happens, right?\"\n\nSome don't see the need to have joint practices at all.\n\nThe reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders are the only teams not having any joint practices this year.\n\n\"I think the way we go about it -- I think we go fast, we practice hard, we do those things amongst ourselves, and the guys challenge each other,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"And I don't think there's a better way to do it, if your guys are willing to do that.\"\n\nPackers safety Xavier McKinney said he doesn't like joint practices because there's too much fighting and the action on the field is \"all vanilla stuff\" since neither team wants to reveal its entire playbook. McKinney said any joint practices that happen shouldn't last longer than a single day.\n\n\"Once you see the first practice, you're like, 'OK, you've seen me. I've seen you. We don't need to keep doing this,'\" McKinney said.\n\nBut others consider joint practices a valuable method of preseason preparation.\n\n\"I thought the two days were effective,\" Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said Wednesday. \"It's really important to see different looks, just seeing different nickel pressures, corner pressures, coverage structures, fronts. It creates a lot of good conversations. The meeting time after these practices is very productive, to talk through it all.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Dave Campbell, Dennis Waszak and John Wawrow, AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson, Dan

After nearly 80% of the 2023 joint practices lasted two days, over two-thirds of the sessions this year are one-day affairs.\n\n\"One, to me, is plenty,\" New York Jets coach Robert Saleh said.\n\nThe argument against two-day joint practices is that the second day often is chippier and increases the possibility of injuries.\n\nAtlanta wide receiver Rondale Moore was carted off the field with a leg injury Wednesday as the Falcons practiced against the Miami Dolphins for a second straight day. Also Wednesday, the NFL fined the New York Giants and Detroit Lions $200,000 each for multiple fights that stretched across their two days of practicing against each other.\n\nThe NFL sent out a memo last month stating fights and unprofessional conduct at joint practices wouldn't be tolerated. Packers coach Matt LaFleur noted earlier in this offseason that \"sometimes it becomes a wrestling match out there or an MMA fight\" when joint practices extend to a second day.\n\n\"Every time I've ever had a joint practice, the first day will be a little rough and then the second one ends in a fight,\" Packers running back Josh Jacobs said.\n\nThe problems with this week's Falcons-Dolphins and Giants-Lions joint practices didn't necessarily result from both lasting two days.\n\nMoore suffered an apparent non-contact injury, so it just as easily could have happened if the Falcons had been practicing on their own. Much of the fighting between the Giants and Lions, including one brawl that injured Detroit cornerback Emmanuel Moseley, happened on their first practice day rather than their second.\n\nNFL teams are permitted to hold joint practices for as many as four days during training camp, and those can be divided in any way possible. For instance, the Los Angeles Rams are holding four separate one-day sessions against three different teams.\n\nThe Rams held their first joint workout with the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, and they'll meet again on Aug. 14. The Rams practiced with the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday and have a session with the Houston Texans on Aug. 22.\n\nRams quarterback Matthew Stafford said after Sunday's workout that he likes limiting joint practices to one day.\n\n\"I think there's probably less fights, which is good,\" Stafford said. \"You know, the second day is when everybody kind of gets a little charged up and gets going.\"\n\nIt also has been when some notable injuries have occurred.\n\nSaleh's Jets were in a second day of joint workouts with the Packers three years ago when defensive end Carl Lawson ruptured his Achilles tendon and safety Zane Lewis hurt his knee, knocking both players out for the entire season.\n\nSaleh shortened the Jets' two scheduled two-day joint practices last year to a single day each. The Jets practiced against the Washington Commanders on Thursday and have one-day sessions with the Carolina Panthers on Aug. 15 and the Giants on Aug. 21.\n\n\"Very rarely do you ever have a football player go through that much volume and intensity in back-to-back days,\" Saleh said. \"So you're not only subjecting our guys to the injury on Day 2, but also it's just very little production because they're just seeing red and they're fighting and they're avoiding their techniques.\"\n\nThat much was apparent during the Packers' joint practices with the New England Patriots last year. After the first day went by without any major incidents, three fights broke out about five minutes into their second joint workout.\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Dennis Allen explained why fights are more likely on the second day.\n\n\"You have the first day's practice,\" Allen said. \"One team or the other is going to feel like they got the better of the other team. Those coaches are going to go yell at their players. Their players are going to pissed off, and then that's how that stuff happens, right?\"\n\nSome don't see the need to have joint practices at all.\n\nThe reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders are the only teams not having any joint practices this year.\n\n\"I think the way we go about it -- I think we go fast, we practice hard, we do those things amongst ourselves, and the guys challenge each other,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"And I don't think there's a better way to do it, if your guys are willing to do that.\"\n\nPackers safety Xavier McKinney said he doesn't like joint practices because there's too much fighting and the action on the field is \"all vanilla stuff\" since neither team wants to reveal its entire playbook. McKinney said any joint practices that happen shouldn't last longer than a single day.\n\n\"Once you see the first practice, you're like, 'OK, you've seen me. I've seen you. We don't need to keep doing this,'\" McKinney said.\n\nBut others consider joint practices a valuable method of preseason preparation.\n\n\"I thought the two days were effective,\" Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said Wednesday. \"It's really important to see different looks, just seeing different nickel pressures, corner pressures, coverage structures, fronts. It creates a lot of good conversations. The meeting time after these practices is very productive, to talk through it all.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Dave Campbell, Dennis Waszak and John Wawrow, AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson, Dan Gelston, Brett Martel and Dave Skretta and AP freelance writer Dan Greenspan contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

After nearly 80% of the 2023 joint practices lasted two days, over two-thirds of the sessions this year are one-day affairs.\n\n\"One, to me, is plenty,\" New York Jets coach Robert Saleh said.\n\nThe argument against two-day joint practices is that the second day often is chippier and increases the possibility of injuries.\n\nAtlanta wide receiver Rondale Moore was carted off the field with a leg injury Wednesday as the Falcons practiced against the Miami Dolphins for a second straight day. Also Wednesday, the NFL fined the New York Giants and Detroit Lions $200,000 each for multiple fights that stretched across their two days of practicing against each other.\n\nThe NFL sent out a memo last month stating fights and unprofessional conduct at joint practices wouldn't be tolerated. Packers coach Matt LaFleur noted earlier in this offseason that \"sometimes it becomes a wrestling match out there or an MMA fight\" when joint practices extend to a second day.\n\n\"Every time I've ever had a joint practice, the first day will be a little rough and then the second one ends in a fight,\" Packers running back Josh Jacobs said.\n\nThe problems with this week's Falcons-Dolphins and Giants-Lions joint practices didn't necessarily result from both lasting two days.\n\nMoore suffered an apparent non-contact injury, so it just as easily could have happened if the Falcons had been practicing on their own. Much of the fighting between the Giants and Lions, including one brawl that injured Detroit cornerback Emmanuel Moseley, happened on their first practice day rather than their second.\n\nNFL teams are permitted to hold joint practices for as many as four days during training camp, and those can be divided in any way possible. For instance, the Los Angeles Rams are holding four separate one-day sessions against three different teams.\n\nThe Rams held their first joint workout with the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, and they'll meet again on Aug. 14. The Rams practiced with the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday and have a session with the Houston Texans on Aug. 22.\n\nRams quarterback Matthew Stafford said after Sunday's workout that he likes limiting joint practices to one day.\n\n\"I think there's probably less fights, which is good,\" Stafford said. \"You know, the second day is when everybody kind of gets a little charged up and gets going.\"\n\nIt also has been when some notable injuries have occurred.\n\nSaleh's Jets were in a second day of joint workouts with the Packers three years ago when defensive end Carl Lawson ruptured his Achilles tendon and safety Zane Lewis hurt his knee, knocking both players out for the entire season.\n\nSaleh shortened the Jets' two scheduled two-day joint practices last year to a single day each. The Jets practiced against the Washington Commanders on Thursday and have one-day sessions with the Carolina Panthers on Aug. 15 and the Giants on Aug. 21.\n\n\"Very rarely do you ever have a football player go through that much volume and intensity in back-to-back days,\" Saleh said. \"So you're not only subjecting our guys to the injury on Day 2, but also it's just very little production because they're just seeing red and they're fighting and they're avoiding their techniques.\"\n\nThat much was apparent during the Packers' joint practices with the New England Patriots last year. After the first day went by without any major incidents, three fights broke out about five minutes into their second joint workout.\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Dennis Allen explained why fights are more likely on the second day.\n\n\"You have the first day's practice,\" Allen said. \"One team or the other is going to feel like they got the better of the other team. Those coaches are going to go yell at their players. Their players are going to pissed off, and then that's how that stuff happens, right?\"\n\nSome don't see the need to have joint practices at all.\n\nThe reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders are the only teams not having any joint practices this year.\n\n\"I think the way we go about it -- I think we go fast, we practice hard, we do those things amongst ourselves, and the guys challenge each other,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"And I don't think there's a better way to do it, if your guys are willing to do that.\"\n\nPackers safety Xavier McKinney said he doesn't like joint practices because there's too much fighting and the action on the field is \"all vanilla stuff\" since neither team wants to reveal its entire playbook. McKinney said any joint practices that happen shouldn't last longer than a single day.\n\n\"Once you see the first practice, you're like, 'OK, you've seen me. I've seen you. We don't need to keep doing this,'\" McKinney said.\n\nBut others consider joint practices a valuable method of preseason preparation.\n\n\"I thought the two days were effective,\" Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said Wednesday. \"It's really important to see different looks, just seeing different nickel pressures, corner pressures, coverage structures, fronts. It creates a lot of good conversations. The meeting time after these practices is very productive, to talk through it all.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Dave Campbell, Dennis Waszak and John Wawrow, AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson,

After nearly 80% of the 2023 joint practices lasted two days, over two-thirds of the sessions this year are one-day affairs.\n\n\"One, to me, is plenty,\" New York Jets coach Robert Saleh said.\n\nThe argument against two-day joint practices is that the second day often is chippier and increases the possibility of injuries.\n\nAtlanta wide receiver Rondale Moore was carted off the field with a leg injury Wednesday as the Falcons practiced against the Miami Dolphins for a second straight day. Also Wednesday, the NFL fined the New York Giants and Detroit Lions $200,000 each for multiple fights that stretched across their two days of practicing against each other.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nWaterloo residents have more than 1,000 signatures on petition to put high school plan on the ballot Teen charged in vape purchase gone wrong after attacking store clerk Man charged after trade-in vehicle in truck sale repossessed Downtown Waterloo bridges opening delayed until fall, no pedestrian use until 2025 Autistic man accused of breaking into co-worker's home to plant letter, smear boyfriend Pablo's Mexican Grill marking 20 years on Main Street in downtown Cedar Falls Clear Lake teen dies in two-vehicle crash Monday afternoon Man sentenced to prison in shooting that paralyzed robbery victim Lawsuit by man paralyzed in Waterloo officer-involved shooting thrown out Waterloo cleaning woman sentenced to probation for burglary, forgery Group effort: Cedar Valley Woodworkers build 17-foot desk for Waterloo library 2024 Courier Male Athlete of the Year: Jesup's Jack Miller Helicopter crashed near Nashua after striking powerlines, killing pilot Cedar Falls City Council to consider items related to more planned roundabouts STEVE CORBIN: Economists say Trump poses a threat to US economy\n\nThe NFL sent out a memo last month stating fights and unprofessional conduct at joint practices wouldn't be tolerated. Packers coach Matt LaFleur noted earlier in this offseason that \"sometimes it becomes a wrestling match out there or an MMA fight\" when joint practices extend to a second day.\n\n\"Every time I've ever had a joint practice, the first day will be a little rough and then the second one ends in a fight,\" Packers running back Josh Jacobs said.\n\nThe problems with this week's Falcons-Dolphins and Giants-Lions joint practices didn't necessarily result from both lasting two days.\n\nMoore suffered an apparent non-contact injury, so it just as easily could have happened if the Falcons had been practicing on their own. Much of the fighting between the Giants and Lions, including one brawl that injured Detroit cornerback Emmanuel Moseley, happened on their first practice day rather than their second.\n\nNFL teams are permitted to hold joint practices for as many as four days during training camp, and those can be divided in any way possible. For instance, the Los Angeles Rams are holding four separate one-day sessions against three different teams.\n\nThe Rams held their first joint workout with the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, and they'll meet again on Aug. 14. The Rams practiced with the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday and have a session with the Houston Texans on Aug. 22.\n\nRams quarterback Matthew Stafford said after Sunday's workout that he likes limiting joint practices to one day.\n\n\"I think there's probably less fights, which is good,\" Stafford said. \"You know, the second day is when everybody kind of gets a little charged up and gets going.\"\n\nIt also has been when some notable injuries have occurred.\n\nSaleh's Jets were in a second day of joint workouts with the Packers three years ago when defensive end Carl Lawson ruptured his Achilles tendon and safety Zane Lewis hurt his knee, knocking both players out for the entire season.\n\nSaleh shortened the Jets' two scheduled two-day joint practices last year to a single day each. The Jets practiced against the Washington Commanders on Thursday and have one-day sessions with the Carolina Panthers on Aug. 15 and the Giants on Aug. 21.\n\n\"Very rarely do you ever have a football player go through that much volume and intensity in back-to-back days,\" Saleh said. \"So you're not only subjecting our guys to the injury on Day 2, but also it's just very little production because they're just seeing red and they're fighting and they're avoiding their techniques.\"\n\nThat much was apparent during the Packers' joint practices with the New England Patriots last year. After the first day went by without any major incidents, three fights broke out about five minutes into their second joint workout.\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Dennis Allen explained why fights are more likely on the second day.\n\n\"You have the first day's practice,\" Allen said. \"One team or the other is going to feel like they got the better of the other team. Those coaches are going to go yell at their players. Their players are going to pissed off, and then that's how that stuff happens, right?\"\n\nSome don't see the need to have joint practices at all.\n\nThe reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders are the only teams not having any joint practices this year.\n\n\"I think the way we go about it -- I think we go fast, we practice hard, we do those things amongst ourselves, and the guys challenge each other,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"And I don't think there's a better way to do it, if your guys are willing to do that.\"\n\nPackers safety Xavier McKinney said he doesn't like joint practices because there's too much fighting and the action on the field is \"all vanilla stuff\" since neither team wants to reveal its entire playbook. McKinney said any joint practices that happen shouldn't last longer than a single day.\n\n\"Once you see the first practice, you're like, 'OK, you've seen me. I've seen you. We don't need to keep doing this,'\" McKinney said.\n\nBut others consider joint practices a valuable method of preseason preparation.\n\n\"I thought the two days were effective,\" Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said Wednesday. \"It's really important to see different looks, just seeing different nickel pressures, corner pressures, coverage structures, fronts.

After nearly 80% of the 2023 joint practices lasted two days, over two-thirds of the sessions this year are one-day affairs.\n\n\"One, to me, is plenty,\" New York Jets coach Robert Saleh said.\n\nThe argument against two-day joint practices is that the second day often is chippier and increases the possibility of injuries.\n\nAtlanta wide receiver Rondale Moore was carted off the field with a leg injury Wednesday as the Falcons practiced against the Miami Dolphins for a second straight day. Also Wednesday, the NFL fined the New York Giants and Detroit Lions $200,000 each for multiple fights that stretched across their two days of practicing against each other.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nTom and Molly Bedell's West Lake Okoboji home sells for state record $9.5M Olympic Athletics Results: USD's Chris Nilsen finishes 11th in pole vault group Sioux City's original guitar hero to be celebrated with a three-night musical extravaganza Sioux City-based Northwest AEA loses 12% of staff, many resign due to state law change 'We'll miss the place': Home on Sioux City's north side on market for first time in decades A shellfish guest: Chesapeake blue crab found at Sioux City Library Police release name of man pulled from Floyd River Toast on Hill offering classy breakfast and lunch to Okoboji Lakes visitors Fireworks serve as weekly grand finale for Arnolds Park's Saturday night concert series Sioux City schools vandalized with graffiti over weekend Sioux City woman gets probation for setting fire in house Sierra signage going up at former Sioux City Bed Bath & Beyond Sioux City Council to vote on resolution for faith-based treatment center 2 seriously hurt in crash near Moville Marriage licenses for August 5, 2024\n\nThe NFL sent out a memo last month stating fights and unprofessional conduct at joint practices wouldn't be tolerated. Packers coach Matt LaFleur noted earlier in this offseason that \"sometimes it becomes a wrestling match out there or an MMA fight\" when joint practices extend to a second day.\n\n\"Every time I've ever had a joint practice, the first day will be a little rough and then the second one ends in a fight,\" Packers running back Josh Jacobs said.\n\nThe problems with this week's Falcons-Dolphins and Giants-Lions joint practices didn't necessarily result from both lasting two days.\n\nMoore suffered an apparent non-contact injury, so it just as easily could have happened if the Falcons had been practicing on their own. Much of the fighting between the Giants and Lions, including one brawl that injured Detroit cornerback Emmanuel Moseley, happened on their first practice day rather than their second.\n\nNFL teams are permitted to hold joint practices for as many as four days during training camp, and those can be divided in any way possible. For instance, the Los Angeles Rams are holding four separate one-day sessions against three different teams.\n\nThe Rams held their first joint workout with the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, and they'll meet again on Aug. 14. The Rams practiced with the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday and have a session with the Houston Texans on Aug. 22.\n\nRams quarterback Matthew Stafford said after Sunday's workout that he likes limiting joint practices to one day.\n\n\"I think there's probably less fights, which is good,\" Stafford said. \"You know, the second day is when everybody kind of gets a little charged up and gets going.\"\n\nIt also has been when some notable injuries have occurred.\n\nSaleh's Jets were in a second day of joint workouts with the Packers three years ago when defensive end Carl Lawson ruptured his Achilles tendon and safety Zane Lewis hurt his knee, knocking both players out for the entire season.\n\nSaleh shortened the Jets' two scheduled two-day joint practices last year to a single day each. The Jets practiced against the Washington Commanders on Thursday and have one-day sessions with the Carolina Panthers on Aug. 15 and the Giants on Aug. 21.\n\n\"Very rarely do you ever have a football player go through that much volume and intensity in back-to-back days,\" Saleh said. \"So you're not only subjecting our guys to the injury on Day 2, but also it's just very little production because they're just seeing red and they're fighting and they're avoiding their techniques.\"\n\nThat much was apparent during the Packers' joint practices with the New England Patriots last year. After the first day went by without any major incidents, three fights broke out about five minutes into their second joint workout.\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Dennis Allen explained why fights are more likely on the second day.\n\n\"You have the first day's practice,\" Allen said. \"One team or the other is going to feel like they got the better of the other team. Those coaches are going to go yell at their players. Their players are going to pissed off, and then that's how that stuff happens, right?\"\n\nSome don't see the need to have joint practices at all.\n\nThe reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders are the only teams not having any joint practices this year.\n\n\"I think the way we go about it -- I think we go fast, we practice hard, we do those things amongst ourselves, and the guys challenge each other,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"And I don't think there's a better way to do it, if your guys are willing to do that.\"\n\nPackers safety Xavier McKinney said he doesn't like joint practices because there's too much fighting and the action on the field is \"all vanilla stuff\" since neither team wants to reveal its entire playbook. McKinney said any joint practices that happen shouldn't last longer than a single day.\n\n\"Once you see the first practice, you're like, 'OK, you've seen me. I've seen you. We don't need to keep doing this,'\" McKinney said.\n\nBut others consider joint practices a valuable method of preseason preparation.\n\n\"I thought the two days were effective,\" Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said Wednesday. \"It's really important to see different looks, just seeing different nickel pressures, corner pressures, coverage structures, fronts. It creates a lot of good conversations. The meeting time after these practices is very productive, to talk through it all.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Dave Campbell, Dennis Waszak and John Wawrow, AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson, Dan

The Jets practiced against the Washington Commanders on Thursday and have one-day sessions with the Carolina Panthers on Aug. 15 and the Giants on Aug. 21.\n\n\"Very rarely do you ever have a football player go through that much volume and intensity in back-to-back days,\" Saleh said. \"So you\u00b4re not only subjecting our guys to the injury on Day 2, but also it\u00b4s just very little production because they\u00b4re just seeing red and they\u00b4re fighting and they\u00b4re avoiding their techniques.\"\n\nThat much was apparent during the Packers\u00b4 joint practices with the New England Patriots last year. After the first day went by without any major incidents, three fights broke out about five minutes into their second joint workout.\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Dennis Allen explained why fights are more likely on the second day.\n\n\"You have the first day\u00b4s practice,\" Allen said. \"One team or the other is going to feel like they got the better of the other team. Those coaches are going to go yell at their players. Their players are going to pissed off, and then that\u00b4s how that stuff happens, right?\"\n\nSome don\u00b4t see the need to have joint practices at all.\n\nThe reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders are the only teams not having any joint practices this year.\n\n\"I think the way we go about it - I think we go fast, we practice hard, we do those things amongst ourselves, and the guys challenge each other,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"And I don\u00b4t think there\u00b4s a better way to do it, if your guys are willing to do that.\"\n\nPackers safety Xavier McKinney said he doesn\u00b4t like joint practices because there\u00b4s too much fighting and the action on the field is \"all vanilla stuff\" since neither team wants to reveal its entire playbook. McKinney said any joint practices that happen shouldn\u00b4t last longer than a single day.\n\n\"Once you see the first practice, you\u00b4re like, 'OK, you\u00b4ve seen me. I\u00b4ve seen you. We don\u00b4t need to keep doing this,\u00b4\" McKinney said.\n\nBut others consider joint practices a valuable method of preseason preparation.\n\n\"I thought the two days were effective,\" Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said Wednesday. \"It\u00b4s really important to see different looks, just seeing different nickel pressures, corner pressures, coverage structures, fronts. It creates a lot of good conversations. The meeting time after these practices is very productive, to talk through it all.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Dave Campbell, Dennis Waszak and John Wawrow, AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson, Dan Gelston, Brett Martel and Dave Skretta and AP freelance writer Dan Greenspan contributed to this report.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl\n\nLos Angeles Rams wide receiver Cooper Kupp (10) catches a pass during NFL football practice at The Bolt in El Segundo, Calif., on Sunday, August 4, 2024.

After nearly 80% of the 2023 joint practices lasted two days, over two-thirds of the sessions this year are one-day affairs.\n\n\"One, to me, is plenty,\" New York Jets coach Robert Saleh said.\n\nThe argument against two-day joint practices is that the second day often is chippier and increases the possibility of injuries.\n\nAtlanta wide receiver Rondale Moore was carted off the field with a leg injury Wednesday as the Falcons practiced against the Miami Dolphins for a second straight day. Also Wednesday, the NFL fined the New York Giants and Detroit Lions $200,000 each for multiple fights that stretched across their two days of practicing against each other.\n\nPeople are also reading... 1 dead after fiery crash on I-55/74 west of Bloomington Crash creates two-vehicle fire on I-55/74 west of Bloomington 'Love is love' at annual Pridefest in downtown Bloomington Bloomington Route 9 construction, closures expected until summer 2025 Rosie's Pub owner leaves beloved downtown business after 21 years Bloomington families displaced by Salvation Army project to house homeless veterans Heart of Illinois, Central Illinois conferences moving forward together in football Wisconsin man identified in fatal interstate crash in McLean County What are Gov.

Packers coach Matt LaFleur noted earlier in this offseason that \"sometimes it becomes a wrestling match out there or an MMA fight\" when joint practices extend to a second day.\n\n\"Every time I've ever had a joint practice, the first day will be a little rough and then the second one ends in a fight,\" Packers running back Josh Jacobs said.\n\nThe problems with this week's Falcons-Dolphins and Giants-Lions joint practices didn't necessarily result from both lasting two days.\n\nMoore suffered an apparent non-contact injury, so it just as easily could have happened if the Falcons had been practicing on their own. Much of the fighting between the Giants and Lions, including one brawl that injured Detroit cornerback Emmanuel Moseley, happened on their first practice day rather than their second.\n\nNFL teams are permitted to hold joint practices for as many as four days during training camp, and those can be divided in any way possible. For instance, the Los Angeles Rams are holding four separate one-day sessions against three different teams.\n\nThe Rams held their first joint workout with the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, and they'll meet again on Aug. 14. The Rams practiced with the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday and have a session with the Houston Texans on Aug. 22.\n\nRams quarterback Matthew Stafford said after Sunday's workout that he likes limiting joint practices to one day.\n\n\"I think there's probably less fights, which is good,\" Stafford said. \"You know, the second day is when everybody kind of gets a little charged up and gets going.\"\n\nIt also has been when some notable injuries have occurred.\n\nSaleh's Jets were in a second day of joint workouts with the Packers three years ago when defensive end Carl Lawson ruptured his Achilles tendon and safety Zane Lewis hurt his knee, knocking both players out for the entire season.\n\nSaleh shortened the Jets' two scheduled two-day joint practices last year to a single day each. The Jets practiced against the Washington Commanders on Thursday and have one-day sessions with the Carolina Panthers on Aug. 15 and the Giants on Aug. 21.\n\n\"Very rarely do you ever have a football player go through that much volume and intensity in back-to-back days,\" Saleh said. \"So you're not only subjecting our guys to the injury on Day 2, but also it's just very little production because they're just seeing red and they're fighting and they're avoiding their techniques.\"\n\nThat much was apparent during the Packers' joint practices with the New England Patriots last year.

After nearly 80% of the 2023 joint practices lasted two days, over two-thirds of the sessions this year are one-day affairs.\n\n\"One, to me, is plenty,\" New York Jets coach Robert Saleh said.\n\nThe argument against two-day joint practices is that the second day often is chippier and increases the possibility of injuries.\n\nAtlanta wide receiver Rondale Moore was carted off the field with a leg injury Wednesday as the Falcons practiced against the Miami Dolphins for a second straight day. Also Wednesday, the NFL fined the New York Giants and Detroit Lions $200,000 each for multiple fights that stretched across their two days of practicing against each other.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nWoman arrested after sharing 'all you can eat' order at Portage Applebee's Court ruling strikes down Indiana residential property tax policy Man identified in fatal motorcycle crash, Lake County coroner says NWI Business Ins and Outs: Cooper's Hawk, Lala's Ice Cream and Paleta Shop, and Levin Tire Center opening; Pet Haven and Hardee's closing UPDATE: Search underway for missing 17-year-old male caught in Lake Michigan waves Tuesday afternoon Davich: Behold, the finest lakefront beach and park in Northwest Indiana UPDATE: ID released of 17-year-old recovered from Lake Michigan The Original Rainbow Cone to open ice cream parlor in Dyer this month UPDATE: Rough Lake Michigan waters continue to conceal missing teen Davich: 'My dad was just killed here!'

Packers coach Matt LaFleur noted earlier in this offseason that \"sometimes it becomes a wrestling match out there or an MMA fight\" when joint practices extend to a second day.\n\n\"Every time I've ever had a joint practice, the first day will be a little rough and then the second one ends in a fight,\" Packers running back Josh Jacobs said.\n\nThe problems with this week's Falcons-Dolphins and Giants-Lions joint practices didn't necessarily result from both lasting two days.\n\nMoore suffered an apparent non-contact injury, so it just as easily could have happened if the Falcons had been practicing on their own. Much of the fighting between the Giants and Lions, including one brawl that injured Detroit cornerback Emmanuel Moseley, happened on their first practice day rather than their second.\n\nNFL teams are permitted to hold joint practices for as many as four days during training camp, and those can be divided in any way possible. For instance, the Los Angeles Rams are holding four separate one-day sessions against three different teams.\n\nThe Rams held their first joint workout with the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, and they'll meet again on Aug. 14. The Rams practiced with the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday and have a session with the Houston Texans on Aug. 22.\n\nRams quarterback Matthew Stafford said after Sunday's workout that he likes limiting joint practices to one day.\n\n\"I think there's probably less fights, which is good,\" Stafford said. \"You know, the second day is when everybody kind of gets a little charged up and gets going.\"\n\nIt also has been when some notable injuries have occurred.\n\nSaleh's Jets were in a second day of joint workouts with the Packers three years ago when defensive end Carl Lawson ruptured his Achilles tendon and safety Zane Lewis hurt his knee, knocking both players out for the entire season.\n\nSaleh shortened the Jets' two scheduled two-day joint practices last year to a single day each. The Jets practiced against the Washington Commanders on Thursday and have one-day sessions with the Carolina Panthers on Aug. 15 and the Giants on Aug. 21.\n\n\"Very rarely do you ever have a football player go through that much volume and intensity in back-to-back days,\" Saleh said. \"So you're not only subjecting our guys to the injury on Day 2, but also it's just very little production because they're just seeing red and they're fighting and they're avoiding their techniques.\"\n\nThat much was apparent during the Packers' joint practices with the New England Patriots last year. After the first day went by without any major incidents, three fights broke out about five minutes into their second joint workout.\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Dennis Allen explained why fights are more likely on the second day.\n\n\"You have the first day's practice,\" Allen said. \"One team or the other is going to feel like they got the better of the other team. Those coaches are going to go yell at their players. Their players are going to pissed off, and then that's how that stuff happens, right?\"\n\nSome don't see the need to have joint practices at all.\n\nThe reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders are the only teams not having any joint practices this year.\n\n\"I think the way we go about it -- I think we go fast, we practice hard, we do those things amongst ourselves, and the guys challenge each other,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"And I don't think there's a better way to do it, if your guys are willing to do that.\"\n\nPackers safety Xavier McKinney said he doesn't like joint practices because there's too much fighting and the action on the field is \"all vanilla stuff\" since neither team wants to reveal its entire playbook. McKinney said any joint practices that happen shouldn't last longer than a single day.\n\n\"Once you see the first practice, you're like, 'OK, you've seen me. I've seen you. We don't need to keep doing this,'\" McKinney said.\n\nBut others consider joint practices a valuable method of preseason preparation.\n\n\"I thought the two days were effective,\" Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said Wednesday. \"It's really important to see different looks, just seeing different nickel pressures, corner pressures, coverage structures, fronts. It creates a lot of good conversations. The meeting time after these practices is very productive, to talk through it all.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Dave Campbell, Dennis Waszak and John Wawrow, AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson, Dan

After nearly 80% of the 2023 joint practices lasted two days, over two-thirds of the sessions this year are one-day affairs.\n\n\"One, to me, is plenty,\" New York Jets coach Robert Saleh said.\n\nThe argument against two-day joint practices is that the second day often is chippier and increases the possibility of injuries.\n\nAtlanta wide receiver Rondale Moore was carted off the field with a leg injury Wednesday as the Falcons practiced against the Miami Dolphins for a second straight day. Also Wednesday, the NFL fined the New York Giants and Detroit Lions $200,000 each for multiple fights that stretched across their two days of practicing against each other.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Packers coach Matt LaFleur noted earlier in this offseason that \"sometimes it becomes a wrestling match out there or an MMA fight\" when joint practices extend to a second day.\n\n\"Every time I've ever had a joint practice, the first day will be a little rough and then the second one ends in a fight,\" Packers running back Josh Jacobs said.\n\nThe problems with this week's Falcons-Dolphins and Giants-Lions joint practices didn't necessarily result from both lasting two days.\n\nMoore suffered an apparent non-contact injury, so it just as easily could have happened if the Falcons had been practicing on their own. Much of the fighting between the Giants and Lions, including one brawl that injured Detroit cornerback Emmanuel Moseley, happened on their first practice day rather than their second.\n\nNFL teams are permitted to hold joint practices for as many as four days during training camp, and those can be divided in any way possible. For instance, the Los Angeles Rams are holding four separate one-day sessions against three different teams.\n\nThe Rams held their first joint workout with the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, and they'll meet again on Aug. 14. The Rams practiced with the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday and have a session with the Houston Texans on Aug. 22.\n\nRams quarterback Matthew Stafford said after Sunday's workout that he likes limiting joint practices to one day.\n\n\"I think there's probably less fights, which is good,\" Stafford said. \"You know, the second day is when everybody kind of gets a little charged up and gets going.\"\n\nIt also has been when some notable injuries have occurred.\n\nSaleh's Jets were in a second day of joint workouts with the Packers three years ago when defensive end Carl Lawson ruptured his Achilles tendon and safety Zane Lewis hurt his knee, knocking both players out for the entire season.\n\nSaleh shortened the Jets' two scheduled two-day joint practices last year to a single day each. The Jets practiced against the Washington Commanders on Thursday and have one-day sessions with the Carolina Panthers on Aug. 15 and the Giants on Aug. 21.\n\n\"Very rarely do you ever have a football player go through that much volume and intensity in back-to-back days,\" Saleh said. \"So you're not only subjecting our guys to the injury on Day 2, but also it's just very little production because they're just seeing red and they're fighting and they're avoiding their techniques.\"\n\nThat much was apparent during the Packers' joint practices with the New England Patriots last year. After the first day went by without any major incidents, three fights broke out about five minutes into their second joint workout.\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Dennis Allen explained why fights are more likely on the second day.\n\n\"You have the first day's practice,\" Allen said. \"One team or the other is going to feel like they got the better of the other team. Those coaches are going to go yell at their players. Their players are going to pissed off, and then that's how that stuff happens, right?\"\n\nSome don't see the need to have joint practices at all.\n\nThe reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders are the only teams not having any joint practices this year.\n\n\"I think the way we go about it -- I think we go fast, we practice hard, we do those things amongst ourselves, and the guys challenge each other,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"And I don't think there's a better way to do it, if your guys are willing to do that.\"\n\nPackers safety Xavier McKinney said he doesn't like joint practices because there's too much fighting and the action on the field is \"all vanilla stuff\" since neither team wants to reveal its entire playbook. McKinney said any joint practices that happen shouldn't last longer than a single day.\n\n\"Once you see the first practice, you're like, 'OK, you've seen me. I've seen you. We don't need to keep doing this,'\" McKinney said.\n\nBut others consider joint practices a valuable method of preseason preparation.\n\n\"I thought the two days were effective,\" Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said Wednesday. \"It's really important to see different looks, just seeing different nickel pressures, corner pressures, coverage structures, fronts. It creates a lot of good conversations. The meeting time after these practices is very productive, to talk through it all.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Dave Campbell, Dennis Waszak and John Wawrow, AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson, Dan

Packers coach Matt LaFleur noted earlier in this offseason that \"sometimes it becomes a wrestling match out there or an MMA fight\" when joint practices extend to a second day.\n\n\"Every time I've ever had a joint practice, the first day will be a little rough and then the second one ends in a fight,\" Packers running back Josh Jacobs said.\n\nThe problems with this week's Falcons-Dolphins and Giants-Lions joint practices didn't necessarily result from both lasting two days.\n\nMoore suffered an apparent non-contact injury, so it just as easily could have happened if the Falcons had been practicing on their own. Much of the fighting between the Giants and Lions, including one brawl that injured Detroit cornerback Emmanuel Moseley, happened on their first practice day rather than their second.\n\nNFL teams are permitted to hold joint practices for as many as four days during training camp, and those can be divided in any way possible. For instance, the Los Angeles Rams are holding four separate one-day sessions against three different teams.\n\nThe Rams held their first joint workout with the Los Angeles Chargers on Sunday, and they'll meet again on Aug. 14. The Rams practiced with the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday and have a session with the Houston Texans on Aug. 22.\n\nRams quarterback Matthew Stafford said after Sunday's workout that he likes limiting joint practices to one day.\n\n\"I think there's probably less fights, which is good,\" Stafford said. \"You know, the second day is when everybody kind of gets a little charged up and gets going.\"\n\nIt also has been when some notable injuries have occurred.\n\nSaleh's Jets were in a second day of joint workouts with the Packers three years ago when defensive end Carl Lawson ruptured his Achilles tendon and safety Zane Lewis hurt his knee, knocking both players out for the entire season.\n\nSaleh shortened the Jets' two scheduled two-day joint practices last year to a single day each. The Jets practiced against the Washington Commanders on Thursday and have one-day sessions with the Carolina Panthers on Aug. 15 and the Giants on Aug. 21.\n\n\"Very rarely do you ever have a football player go through that much volume and intensity in back-to-back days,\" Saleh said. \"So you're not only subjecting our guys to the injury on Day 2, but also it's just very little production because they're just seeing red and they're fighting and they're avoiding their techniques.\"\n\nThat much was apparent during the Packers' joint practices with the New England Patriots last year. After the first day went by without any major incidents, three fights broke out about five minutes into their second joint workout.\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Dennis Allen explained why fights are more likely on the second day.\n\n\"You have the first day's practice,\" Allen said. \"One team or the other is going to feel like they got the better of the other team. Those coaches are going to go yell at their players. Their players are going to pissed off, and then that's how that stuff happens, right?\"\n\nSome don't see the need to have joint practices at all.\n\nThe reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders are the only teams not having any joint practices this year.\n\n\"I think the way we go about it -- I think we go fast, we practice hard, we do those things amongst ourselves, and the guys challenge each other,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"And I don't think there's a better way to do it, if your guys are willing to do that.\"\n\nPackers safety Xavier McKinney said he doesn't like joint practices because there's too much fighting and the action on the field is \"all vanilla stuff\" since neither team wants to reveal its entire playbook. McKinney said any joint practices that happen shouldn't last longer than a single day.\n\n\"Once you see the first practice, you're like, 'OK, you've seen me. I've seen you. We don't need to keep doing this,'\" McKinney said.\n\nBut others consider joint practices a valuable method of preseason preparation.\n\n\"I thought the two days were effective,\" Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said Wednesday. \"It's really important to see different looks, just seeing different nickel pressures, corner pressures, coverage structures, fronts. It creates a lot of good conversations. The meeting time after these practices is very productive, to talk through it all.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Dave Campbell, Dennis Waszak and John Wawrow, AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson, Dan

The Jets practiced against the Washington Commanders on Thursday and have one-day sessions with the Carolina Panthers on Aug. 15 and the Giants on Aug. 21.\n\n\"Very rarely do you ever have a football player go through that much volume and intensity in back-to-back days,\" Saleh said. \"So you're not only subjecting our guys to the injury on Day 2, but also it's just very little production because they're just seeing red and they're fighting and they're avoiding their techniques.\"\n\nThat much was apparent during the Packers' joint practices with the New England Patriots last year. After the first day went by without any major incidents, three fights broke out about five minutes into their second joint workout.\n\nNew Orleans Saints coach Dennis Allen explained why fights are more likely on the second day.\n\n\"You have the first day's practice,\" Allen said. \"One team or the other is going to feel like they got the better of the other team. Those coaches are going to go yell at their players. Their players are going to pissed off, and then that's how that stuff happens, right?\"\n\nSome don't see the need to have joint practices at all.\n\nThe reigning Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Las Vegas Raiders are the only teams not having any joint practices this year.\n\n\"I think the way we go about it -- I think we go fast, we practice hard, we do those things amongst ourselves, and the guys challenge each other,\" Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \"And I don't think there's a better way to do it, if your guys are willing to do that.\"\n\nPackers safety Xavier McKinney said he doesn't like joint practices because there's too much fighting and the action on the field is \"all vanilla stuff\" since neither team wants to reveal its entire playbook. McKinney said any joint practices that happen shouldn't last longer than a single day.\n\n\"Once you see the first practice, you're like, 'OK, you've seen me. I've seen you. We don't need to keep doing this,'\" McKinney said.\n\nBut others consider joint practices a valuable method of preseason preparation.\n\n\"I thought the two days were effective,\" Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins said Wednesday. \"It's really important to see different looks, just seeing different nickel pressures, corner pressures, coverage structures, fronts. It creates a lot of good conversations. The meeting time after these practices is very productive, to talk through it all.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Dave Campbell, Dennis Waszak and John Wawrow, AP Sports Writers Mark Anderson, Dan

Saleh, though, wants that violence to be controlled.\n\nHe said, both after Tuesday's practice and on Wednesday, that he's not concerned about tempers flaring in Thursday's joint practice with the Commanders. But that practice surely will be scrutinized.\n\nAll NFL teams were reminded in a memo issued by the league last month that \"fighting and unprofessional conduct at joint practices would not be tolerated.\" The league clearly has placed an increased emphasis on keeping the joint sessions clean.\n\nIn theory, those heavy fines levied against the Giants and Lions will serve as a deterrent for teams like the Jets and Commanders and others conducting these similar practices. If they don't, then you might see a time when the joint practices go the way of the two-a-day practice days that were once commonplace in NFL camps. But two-a-days became extinct after the 2011 collective bargaining agreement thanks to NFL Players Association demands.\n\nThis is one reason for the increased joint practices teams have been conducting in recent years. They're a way to add some more physicality to practices in an effort to simulate game conditions.\n\nBut many teams, including the Jets, have virtually eliminated physical drills such as team goal-line situations and one-on-one pass-rushing in an effort to avoid injuries and more camp scuffles.\n\nSaleh last summer abruptly canceled a scheduled second joint practice session with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, seemingly to protect his players. The move irked the Buccaneers, who'd traveled to New Jersey for the two sessions and were left scrambling to find a place to practice in place of the day the Jets bailed on.\n\nThere were more than a dozen scuffles during the two days of joint practices between the Giants and Lions. The two teams cut practice short Tuesday because of multiple incidents.\n\n\"It's the same thing we always tell our guys -- we're just trying to get better, trying to compete,'' Saleh said Wednesday. \"It is heightened for sure, but ... I know DQ [Washington coach Dan Quinn]. He and I have a really good relationship. I know the way he coaches, he knows the way we coach, and I'm not overly concerned.\n\n\"Are there going to be a couple of shoving matches? I'm sure, but ... we do our best not to punch. I know we haven't been great at it here since [Tuesday's practice], but that's the big rule -- just don't punch.\n\n\"You're going to get into these shoving matches, but like I've told our guys, if you throw a punch, you're kicked out of a game, so don't do it in practice.''\n\nVeteran defensive lineman Quinnen Williams echoed his coach's message.\n\n\"The biggest thing is to keep the main thing the main thing,'' Williams said. \"It's going to be hot outside. It's going get feisty. But if you throw a punch in a game, you're out of the game. Me, C.J. [Mosley], Sauce [Gardner], Jermaine [Johnson], Quincy [Williams], the leaders, we speak to the defense and we treat every single practice like a game when it comes down to flags and execution.\n\n\"Joint practice is another day to work on being disciplined.''\n\nVeteran backup quarterback Tyrod Taylor, who played for the Giants last season, was well aware of the goings on at the Meadowlands earlier in the week. He knows how unproductive fights in joint practices can be.\n\n\"That's the furthest from what teams are trying to get done,'' Taylor said. \"It's about competing within the whistle. Obviously, at this point in time guys have been practicing in training camp for at least two weeks, so emotions are high, energy is high.\n\n\"Anytime you go against another group of guys that's not your own brothers and family, it's going to be part of that. Unfortunately, it happens, but it's part of the game.''\n\nIt's a part of the game that needs to be eliminated ... or else these joint practices will be. And then training camps will become so soft they'll resemble more of a participation-prize children's camp.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Saleh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Saleh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinnen_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quinnen Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lineman (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Quinn_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Quinn (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giants_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Giants Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrod_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrod Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-613b4r744-1723072265299.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1723057983&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9802170", "eventUri": "eng-9802170", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Williams Reveals Message to Jets To Prevent Fights", "body": "Joint practices are a useful training camp tradition, meant to give teams an opportunity to measure themselves up against a preseason opponent before gametime. Starters can get a full practice in, rather than a drive or two, and coaches can create the situations they want to see, rather than partaking in the exhibition.\n\nBut a tradition as old as joint practices are the skirmishes that break out among them.\n\nThe dog days of summer are cruel during padded practices, and tensions flare. After weeks of being surrounded by teammates, the chance to hit someone from another team is frequently taken advantage of.\n\nJust this past week, the New York Giants hosted the Detroit Lions for two joint practices. Receiver Malik Nabers showed out, and quarterback Daniel Jones looked good, too. But the only real takeaway was that so many fights broke out that practice was essentially wasted.\n\nWith the New York Jets poised to take on the Washington Commanders on the practice field before their preseason contest on Aug. 10, it will be imperative not to descend into the chaos of their stadium-sharing rivals.\n\nNew York defensive tackle Quinnen Williams spoke on Wednesday about his message to the team about said fights.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing is just keep the main thing the main thing,\" Williams said, via SNY. \"It's gonna get hot outside during joint practice. It's gonna be feisty out there ... The main thing is the main thing. If you throw a punch in a game, you're out of the game. So me, C.J. (Mosley), Sauce (Gardner), Jermaine (Johnson), Quincy (Williams), and all the leaders out there, we just speak to the defense.\n\n\"We go into every single practice every single day and treat it as a game when it comes down to flags, when it comes down to execution, when it comes down to being consistent.

Once again, this is an emotional game. Things happen but you just never want to see a physical fight on the football field. Hopefully, when the Eagles come in here, I'm gonna stress to our guys that's not what we're about. We're about tough in between the whistles.

People are throwing punches and hitting helmets and shoulder pads. I always thought these fights have always been silly because you can hurt yourself.\"\n\nFights and brawls during joint practice are not a matter of if but when.

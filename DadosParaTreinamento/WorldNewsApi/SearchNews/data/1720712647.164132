{"id": 232066612, "title": "The Sphere Has Reportedly Rescinded Its Ban On The Bong-Hitting Phish Fan", "text": "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Well, that\u2019s not always true. One bong-hitting Phish fan learned that a ban at Las Vegas\u2019 newest venue, The Sphere, actually extended to all other Madison Square Garden venues (including Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, The Beacon Theatre, The Chicago Theatre, and more). But it looks like the company had a change of heart. Yesterday (June 8), according to Variety, The Sphere rescinded its ban, but not for the reason you think. In a statement, the representative claimed the note was mistakenly sent out. \u201cThere was a breakdown in our process due to a change in personnel, which resulted in the letter being sent inadvertently,\u201d wrote the rep. \u201cThis customer is not banned from our properties, however, it is still against our policies, which are in accordance with local laws, to smoke, bring glassware into our venues, and disrupt other fans\u2019 enjoyment of the event.\u201d Footage of the incident wasn\u2019t retrieved from the venue\u2019s surveillance, but rather the concertgoer himself. On April 20 (nonetheless), the patron, only known by his Instagram hand @acid_farts, uploaded a video smoking from a bong inside the facility with the caption: \u201cFirst bong hit to ever be ripped in the @spherevegas @phish Somebody call @guinessworldrecords 4/20/24.\u201d Shorty after, he received a notice from that Madison Square Garden Entertainment\u2019s legal counsel notifying him that he was banned from returning to all of its properties. During an interview with Rolling Stone, he expressed no regret over his actions. \u201cI\u2019m really wearing it as a badge of honor,\u201d he said. He later went on to sell \u201cFree Acid Farts\u201d t-shirts to laugh about the incident, with proceeds going to the Divided Sky Foundation, an addiction recovery center founded by Phish\u2019s frontman Trey Anastasio. Now that the ban has been lifted, MSG security is sure to keep a keen eye on the cameras as they patiently await Acid Farts return.", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1600\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Trey-Anastasio-Phish-2023-getty-full.jpg?w=1600&amp;h=660&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"Trey Anastasio Phish 2023\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Trey-Anastasio-Phish-2023-getty-full.jpg?resize=1600,660 1600w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Trey-Anastasio-Phish-2023-getty-full.jpg?resize=1200,495 1200w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Trey-Anastasio-Phish-2023-getty-full.jpg?resize=852,351 852w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Trey-Anastasio-Phish-2023-getty-full.jpg?resize=1024,422 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Trey-Anastasio-Phish-2023-getty-full.jpg?resize=720,297 720w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Trey-Anastasio-Phish-2023-getty-full.jpg?resize=420,173 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (m", "url": "https://uproxx.com/indie/the-sphere-rescinds-ban-phish-fan-bong-statement/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Trey-Anastasio-Phish-2023-getty-full.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:15:42", "author": "Flisadam Pointer", "authors": ["Flisadam Pointer"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.465}

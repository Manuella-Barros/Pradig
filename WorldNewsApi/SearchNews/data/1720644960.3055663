A Ukrainian attack Friday on the small town of Sadove in Ukraine\u2019s partially occupied Kherson region killed 22 and wounded 15 people, Moscow-backed governor Vladimir Saldo said. Russian state news agency Tass cited Saldo as saying that Ukrainian forces first struck the town with a French-made guided bomb, then attacked again with a U.S.-supplied HIMARS missile. He said Ukrainian forces had \u201cdeliberately made a repeat strike to create greater numbers of casualties\u201d when \u201cresidents of nearby houses ran out to help the injured.\" Officials declared Saturday a day of mourning in Luhansk, and public events will be similarly cancelled Sunday and Monday in Kherson. Further east, Leonid Pasechnik, the Russia-installed governor in Ukraine\u2019s partially occupied Luhansk region, said Saturday that two more bodies had been pulled from the rubble following Friday\u2019s Ukrainian missile attack on the regional capital, also called Luhansk. Russian state news agency Interfax cited regional authorities as saying this brought the death toll to six. Pasechnik also said 60 people were wounded in the attack. Ukraine did not comment on either assault. Meanwhile, drone attacks between Russia and Ukraine persisted. Ukraine launched a barrage of drones across Russian territory overnight Friday, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said Saturday. Twenty-five drones were reportedly destroyed over Russia\u2019s southern Kuban and Astrakhan regions, the western Tula region, and the Moscow-annexed Crimean peninsula. On Saturday morning, officials said air defenses for the first time shot down Ukrainian drones over the North Ossetia region in the North Caucasus, some 900 km (560 miles) east of the front line in Ukraine\u2019s partially occupied Zaporizhzhia region. Russia\u2019s Ministry of Defense said that one drone had been destroyed, whereas regional Gov. Sergei Menyailo reported three downed drones over the region. Menyailo said that the target was a military airfield. Ukrainian air defense overnight shot down nine out of 13 Russian drones over the central Poltava region, southeastern Zaporizhzhia and Dnipropetrovsk regions, and the Kharkiv region in the northeast , Ukraine\u2019s air force said Saturday. Dnipropetrovsk regional Gov. Serhiy Lysak said the overnight drone attack damaged commercial and residential buildings. Later on Saturday, a Ukrainian military spokesman said Ukraine now controlled more than half of the town of Vovchansk , a flashpoint for fighting since Russia launched a renewed offensive in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Kharkiv region last month. \u201cMost of the city is under the control of the defense forces,\u201d Nazar Voloshin, spokesman for the Khortytsia ground forces formation, said on Ukrainian state TV. Independent confirmation of this claim wasn\u2019t immediately possible. Russia\u2019s Kharkiv push appears to be a coordinated new offensive that includes testing Ukrainian defenses in the Donetsk region further south, while also launching incursions in the northern Sumy and Chernihiv regions.", "summary": "Deadly attacks by Ukrainian forces in occupied regions prompt mourning as Russia-Ukraine drone clashes persist", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-kill-28-in-kherson-luhansk-898006", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/08/1095759-aa-2312518.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:21:07", "author": null, "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.325}

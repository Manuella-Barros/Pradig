To listen to \"The Tortured Poets Department\" with Swift's commentary, fans can simply say to Alexa, \"I'm a member of 'The Tortured Poets Department.'\"\n\nMore from Variety\n\nTaylor Swift's Record-Breaking First Day at Spotify With 'Tortured Poets' Didn't Stop at 200 Million Streams - It Actually Surpassed 300 Million\n\nTaylor Swift and Post Malone Burn Poems and Smash Windows in 'Fortnight' Music Video\n\nTaylor Swift Makes Spotify History as 'The Tortured Poets Department' Becomes First Album to Surpass 200 Million Streams in a Single Day\n\nThrough the experience, Swift has revealed the inspiration behind songs including \"Fortnight\" with Post Malone, \"Clara Bow,\" \"Florida!!!\" with Florence + the Machine, \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" and \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys.\"\n\n\"'Fortnight' is a song that exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album. One of which being fatalism -- longing, pining away, lost dreams,\" Swift said of the album's opening song. \"I think that it's a very fatalistic album in that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death. 'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say. It's that kind of album.\"\n\nOf \"Clara Bow,\" named after the silent film actress, Swift said the track is \"a commentary on what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time.\"\n\n\"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say, 'you know, you remind us of' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'but you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.' And that's how we teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you,\" she said. \"I picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these architypes of greatness in the entertainment industry. Clara Bow was the first 'it girl.' Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\n\"Florida!!!\" featuring Florence + the Machine is one of the rare songs on the album that doesn't see Swift directly speaking of a former lover. Swift said the inspiration for this track actually came from \"always watching 'Dateline.'\"\n\n\"People have these crimes that they commit; where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida,\" the singer added. \"They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in. I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, 'I want a new name. I want a new life. I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.' And so that was the jumping off point. Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida!\"\n\nAs for \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me,\" Swift revealed that she wrote the tune \"alone, sitting at the piano in one of those moments when I felt bitter about just all the things we do to our artists as a society and as a culture.\"\n\n\"There's a lot about this particular concept on 'The Tortured Poets Department,'\" she added. \"What do we do to our writers, and our artists, and our creatives? We put them through hell. We watch what they create, then we judge it. We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society we provoke that pain and we just watch what happens.\"\n\nLastly, Swift broke down the metaphor within \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys.\"\n\nThe song is about \"being somebody's favorite toy until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore,\" she said. \"Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind. We're still clinging on to 'No no, no. You should've seen them the first time they saw me. They'll come back to that. They'll get back to that.'\"\n\nListen to the track-by-track experience on Amazon Music here.\n\nBest of Variety\n\nNew Movies Out Now in Theaters: What to See This Week\n\nFrom 'The Sympathizer' to 'Three-Body Problem': The Best Book-to-Screen Adaptations to Read This Year\n\nWhat's Coming to Disney+ in April 2024\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say but it's that kind of album.\"\n\nFortnight\n\nAfter its release, fans speculated that the lyrics to Fortnight were in part about The 1975 singer Matty Healy, whom she was rumoured to be dating briefly last year following her split from British actor Joe Alwyn.\n\n\"Fortnight is a song that I think really exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album, one of which being fatalism - longing, pining away, lost dreams,\" Swift said.\n\nThere was also a music video for the song which featured US actors Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles from the classic film Dead Poets Society, and Post Malone posing as the star-crossed lover of Swift set in a dystopian romance.\n\nMy Boy Only Breaks His Favourite Toys\n\nSwift said My Boy Only Breaks His Favourite Toys, another song rumoured to be about Healy, is a track she wrote \"alone\", describing it as being written from the perspective of a child's toy.\n\n\"Being somebody's favourite toy, until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore,\" the 34-year-old said.\n\n\"Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of a sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind.\n\n\"We're still clinging on to 'No no, no, you should've seen them the first time they saw me, they'll come back to that, they'll get back to that'.\n\n\"So its kind of a song about denial really so that you can live in this world where there is still hope for a toxic broken relationship.\"\n\nFlorida!!!\n\nFlorida!!!, the song Swift said she wrote with British group Florence + The Machine, is about \"what happens when your life doesn't fit or the choices you've made catch up to you\".\n\n\"I'm always watching (US television show) Dateline, people have these crimes that they commit, where they immediately skip town and go to, they go to Florida.\n\n\"They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in. And I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, I want a new name, I want a new life, I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.\n\n\"And so that was the jumping off point behind where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida.\"\n\nWho's Afraid of Little Old Me?\n\nSwift said her track titled Who's Afraid of Little Old Me? was a song she wrote alone, sitting at the piano when she felt \"bitter\" about the way society treats musicians.\n\n\"Being in the public eye since I was a young teenager, there's a lot that that does to your perception of the world, your perception of yourself,\" she said.\n\n\"The idea that the world has this sense of ownership and not just a right, but they feel they have a responsibility to judge you and to critique you and to weigh in. That can really toy with you.\"\n\nThe US star said the concept of putting artists and creatives \"through hell\" is a consistent theme throughout the album.\n\n\"We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where sometimes, as a society, we provoke that pain and we watch what happens - so there's lines about feeling like I've been in the circus, those kind of metaphors, feeling like I'm sort of like a witch in a haunted house,\" she said.\n\nClara Bow\n\nThe final song with an introduction from Swift is Clara Bow, which she describes as a \"commentary on just what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time\".\n\nShe continued: \"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say, 'You know, you remind us of' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'But you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way'.\n\n\"And that's how we kind of teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you.\"\n\nSwift said she \"picked women who have done great things\" to appear in the song.\n\nShe added: \"Clara Bow was the first 'it girl'. Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department became the first album in Spotify history to reach more than

One of which being fatalism -- longing, pining away, lost dreams,\" Swift says of the album's first single.\n\n\"I think that it's a very fatalistic album in that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death. 'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say. It's that kind of album.\"\n\nFor \"Clara Bow\", the 34-year-old opens up about her experiences as a young female artist fighting for a record deal and constantly being pitted against other women.\n\n\"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say, 'you know, you remind us of--' and then they'd name an artist,\" Swift explains. \"And then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'but you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.'\"\n\n\"And that's how we teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you,\" she says.\n\n\"I picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these architypes of greatness in the entertainment industry,\" Swift continues. \"Clara Bow was the first 'it girl.' Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\nThe deep dive into \"Florida!!!\" may shock a lot of fans. Swift says the song, which features Florence + the Machine, is inspired by Dateline.\n\n\"People have these crimes that they commit; where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida,\" the singer says. \"They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in.\"\n\n\"I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, 'I want a new name. I want a new life. I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all,'\" she adds. \"And so that was the jumping off point. Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in?

These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say but it's that kind of album.\"\n\nAfter its release, fans speculated that the lyrics to Fortnight were in part about The 1975 singer Matty Healy, whom she was rumoured to be dating briefly last year following her split from British actor Joe Alwyn.\n\n\"Fortnight is a song that I think really exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album, one of which being fatalism - longing, pining away, lost dreams,\" Swift said.\n\nThere was also a music video for the song which featured US actors Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles from the classic film Dead Poets Society, and Post Malone posing as the star-crossed lover of Swift set in a dystopian romance.\n\nSwift said My Boy Only Breaks His Favourite Toys, another song rumoured to be about Healy, is a track she wrote \"alone\", describing it as being written from the perspective of a child's toy.\n\n\"Being somebody's favourite toy, until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore,\" the 34-year-old said.\n\n\"Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of a sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind.\n\n\"We're still clinging on to 'No no, no, you should've seen them the first time they saw me, they'll come back to that, they'll get back to that'.\n\n\"So its kind of a song about denial really so that you can live in this world where there is still hope for a toxic broken relationship.\"\n\nFlorida!!!, the song Swift said she wrote with British group Florence + The Machine, is about \"what happens when your life doesn't fit or the choices you've made catch up to you\".\n\n\"I'm always watching (US television show) Dateline, people have these crimes that they commit, where they immediately skip town and go to, they go to Florida.\n\n\"They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in. And I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, I want a new name, I want a new life, I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.\n\n\"And so that was the jumping off point behind where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida.\"\n\nSwift said her track titled Who's Afraid of Little Old Me? was a song she wrote alone, sitting at the piano when she felt \"bitter\" about the way society treats musicians.\n\n\"Being in the public eye since I was a young teenager, there's a lot that that does to your perception of the world, your perception of yourself,\" she said.\n\n\"The idea that the world has this sense of ownership and not just a right, but they feel they have a responsibility to judge you and to critique you and to weigh in. That can really toy with you.\"\n\nThe US star said the concept of putting artists and creatives \"through hell\" is a consistent theme throughout the album.\n\n\"We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where sometimes, as a society, we provoke that pain and we watch what happens - so there's lines about feeling like I've been in the circus, those kind of metaphors, feeling like I'm sort of like a witch in a haunted house,\" she said.\n\nThe final song with an introduction from Swift is Clara Bow, which she describes as a \"commentary on just what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time\".\n\nShe continued: \"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say, 'You know, you remind us of' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'But you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way'.\n\n\"And that's how we kind of teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you.\"\n\nSwift said she \"picked women who have done great things\" to appear in the song.\n\nShe added: \"Clara Bow was the first 'it girl'. Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department became the first album in Spotify history to reach more than 300 million streams in a single day, while Swift also became the most-streamed artist in a single day on the platform when her record was released on April 19, according to the streaming service.",

These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say,\" she noted. \"But it's that kind of album - it's about a dramatic, artistic, tragic kind of take on love and loss.\"\n\nShe said she \"always imagined\" that \"Fortnight\" occurred in an \"American town where the American Dream you thought would happen to you didn't.\"\n\n\"You ended up not with the person you loved and now you have to just live with that every day, wondering what would've been, maybe seeing them out,\" she explained. \"And that's a pretty tragic concept, really. So I was just writing from that perspective.\"\n\nShe also talked about the song \"Clara Bow\". Named after the silent film actress, Swift said \"Clara Bow\" is \"a commentary on what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time.\"\n\n\"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid.

Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\nIn \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" Swift said she used a metaphor \"from the perspective of a child's toy being somebody's favorite toy until they break you, and then don't want to play with you anymore.\"\n\n\"A lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning and then all of a sudden they break us, or they devalue us in their mind, and we're still clinging on to, 'No, no, no, you should've seen them the first time they saw me. They'll come back to that. They'll get back to that,'\" she said. \"So it's kind of a song about denial, really, so that you can live in this world where there's still hope for a toxic, broken relationship.\"\n\n\"Florida!!!\", featuring Florence + the Machine, is not inspired by a former relationship, but rather her experiences from \"always watching Dateline.\" Swift said she pondered the question of \" What happens when your life doesn't fit, or your choices you've made catch up to you, and you're surrounded by these harsh consequences and judgment, and circumstances did not lead you to where you thought you'd be and you just want to escape from everything you've ever known?

It's a very fatalistic album in that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death. 'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say. It's that kind of album.\"\n\nCelebrities Attending Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour\n\nLater, Swift breaks down \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" a song she produced with longtime collaborator Jack Antonoff. Swift explains, as the title suggests, the song is about \"being somebody's favorite toy until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore.\"\n\n\"Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind,\" she adds. \"We're still clinging on to 'No no, no. You should've seen them the first time they saw me. They'll come back to that.'\"\n\nAnd the \"Florida!!!\" singer even delved into her duet with Florence Welch, a song that was actually inspired by her love of \"Dateline.\"\n\n\"People have these crimes that they commit; where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida,\" Swift posits. \"They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in. When you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, 'I want a new name. I want a new life. I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.' And so that was the jumping off point.\"\n\nOther songs like \"Clara Bow\" and \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me\" explore the difficulties that come from life in the public eye.\n\nAs she says, Swift wrote the latter song \"alone, sitting at the piano in one of those moments when I felt bitter about just all the things we do to our artists as a society and as a culture.\"\n\n\"There's a lot about this particular concept on 'The Tortured Poets Department,'\" the 34-year-old continued. \"What do we do to our writers, and our artists, and our creatives? We put them through hell. We watch what they create, then we judge it. We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society we provoke that pain and we just watch what happens.\"\n\nAnd as for why she dedicated an entire track to a 1920s film star? Reflecting on her almost two decades of stardom, Swift calls the song a commentary on \"what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time.\"\n\nUltimately, the track is a message to the women in the industry who forged a path for younger artists.\n\n\"That's how we teach women to see themselves, as like, you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you,\" she added. \"I picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these archetypes of greatness in the entertainment industry. Clara Bow was the first 'it girl.' Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcnewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC New York"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eras_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Eras Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Antonoff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Antonoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florence Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline_NBC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dateline NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "It girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Nicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stevie Nicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archetype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2024/03/GettyImages-2053193467.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Blige Is 'Beyond Grateful' For 2024 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction\n\nNow that you've spent the entire weekend obsessively poring over all the lyrics on Taylor Swift's sprawling, 31-track The Tortured Poets Department, the singer has graciously stepped forward to offer Swifties some additional context.\n\nOn Monday morning (April 22), Amazon Music launched a track-by-track album experience featuring Swift providing commentary on the songs interspersed throughout the album's tracks; Swifties can also listen to the album with Taylor's full commentary by saying, \"Alexa, I'm a member of The Tortured Poets Department\" or in the Amazon Music app.\n\nDescribing the first single, \"Fortnight,\" which features Post Malone, Swift says, \"'Fortnight' is a song that exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album. One of which being fatalism -- longing, pining away, lost dreams. I think that it's a very fatalistic album in that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death. 'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say. It's that kind of album.\"\n\nSpeaking of another song fans have cued in on, \"Clara Bow,\" Swift says it was inspired by her experiences in the entertainment industry and the tendency to pit female artists against each other. \"'Clara Bow' is a song that I wrote as a commentary on what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time,\" Swift says. \"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say, 'you know, you remind us of' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'but you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.' And that's how we teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you.\"\n\nHer collaboration with Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine, \"Florida!!!,\" is described as being inspired by true crime. \"I'm always watching Dateline. People have these crimes that they commit; where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida,\" Swift says. \"They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in. I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, 'I want a new name. I want a new life. I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.' And so that was the jumping off point. Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida!\"\n\nThe singer's 11th studio album instantly became the most-streamed album in its first day on Amazon Music on Friday on its way to selling 1.4 million copies in its first day of release in the U.S.\n\nOther bits of insight Swift shares include the origin of \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" which she says is a metaphor woven from the perspective of a child's toy. \"Being somebody's favorite toy until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore. Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind,\" she says \"We're still clinging on to 'No no, no.

These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say but it's that kind of album.\"\n\nAfter its release, fans speculated that the lyrics to Fortnight were in part about The 1975 singer Matty Healy, whom she was rumoured to be dating briefly last year following her split from British actor Joe Alwyn.\n\nMeanwhile Swift said My Boy Only Breaks His Favourite Toys, another song rumoured to be about Healy, is a track she wrote \"alone\", describing it as being written from the perspective of a child's toy.\n\n\"Being somebody's favourite toy, until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore,\" the 34-year-old said.\n\n\"Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of a sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind.\n\n\"We're still clinging on to 'No no, no, you should've seen them the first time they saw me, they'll come back to that, they'll get back to that'.\n\n\"So its kind of a song about denial really so that you can live in this world where there is still hope for a toxic broken relationship.\"\n\nWhile Florida!!!, the song Swift said she wrote with British group Florence + The Machine, is about \"what happens when your life doesn't fit or the choices you've made catch up to you\".\n\n\"I'm always watching (US television show) Dateline, people have these crimes that they commit, where they immediately skip town and go to, they go to Florida.\n\n\"They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in.

Florida.\"\n\nSwift said her track titled Who's Afraid of Little Old Me? was a song she wrote alone, sitting at the piano when she felt \"bitter\" about the way society treats musicians.\n\n\"Being in the public eye since I was a young teenager, there's a lot that that does to your perception of the world, your perception of yourself,\" she said.\n\n\"The idea that the world has this sense of ownership and not just a right, but they feel they have a responsibility to judge you and to critique you and to weigh in. That can really toy with you.\"\n\nThe US star said the concept of putting artists and creatives \"through hell\" is a consistent theme throughout the album.\n\n\"We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where sometimes, as a society, we provoke that pain and we watch what happens - so there's lines about feeling like I've been in the circus, those kind of metaphors, feeling like I'm sort of like a witch in a haunted house,\" she said.\n\nThe final song with an introduction from Swift is Clara Bow, which she describes as a \"commentary on just what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time\".\n\nShe continued: \"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid.

She gave track-by-track commentary on \"Fortnight\" with Post Malone, \"Florida!!!\" with Florence + the Machine, \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" and \"Clara Bow.\"\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nSwift called the album \"an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time -- one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure.\" Additionally, she surprised fans by releasing 15 extra songs at 2 a.m., making The Tortured Poets Department a double album.\n\nSome fans speculated that the album is about her relationship with actor Joe Alwyn, while others think it's about her short-lived fling with The 1975 frontman Matty Healy. Here's what Swift had to say about these five songs, in her own words.\n\n[RELATED: 3 Taylor Swift Songs That Almost Didn't Make The Cut]\n\nTaylor Swift Reveals the Meanings Behind 5 Songs on The Tortured Poets Department\n\n\"Fortnight\" feat. Post Malone -- Swift began by explaining that \"Fortnight\" exhibits many of the themes that run through the album. \"One of [the themes] being fatalism -- longing, pining away, lost dreams. I think that it's a very fatalistic album in that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death,\" Swift said.\n\nShe continued, \"It's about a traumatic, artistic tragic kind of take on love and loss ... I always imagined that it took place in this American town where the American dream you thought would happen to you didn't. You ended up not with the person that you loved and now you just have to live with that everyday, wondering what would've been, maybe seeing them out. And that's a pretty tragic concept really so I was just writing from that perspective.\"\n\n\"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\" -- This song is from the perspective of a child's toy, Swift said, stating that being played with until you break is a lot like being in a relationship, \"being somebody's favorite toy until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore.\"\n\nShe continued, \"Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind. We're still clinging on to 'No no, no. You should've seen them the first time they saw me. They'll come back to that. They'll get back to that.' So it's kind of like a song about denial really so that you could live in this world where there's still hope for a toxic, broken relationship.\"\n\nThe Tortured Poet Explains Her Tortured Poetry\n\n\"Florida!!!\" feat. Florence + The Machine -- \"I think I was coming up with this idea of what happens when your life doesn't fit or the choices you've made catch up to you and you're surrounded by these harsh consequences and judgment and circumstances did not lead you to where you thought you would be,\" Swift explained. \"And you just want to escape from everything you've ever known. Is there a place you could go?\"\n\nThat place, for Taylor Swift, is apparently Florida. She explained that, when she watches the news, she wonders, where do criminals go to reinvent themselves? \"They go to Florida,\" she said. \"They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in.\"\n\nShe then related that phenomena to relationships. \"I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, 'I want a new name, I want a new life. I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all,'\" she said. \"And so that was the jumping off point behind 'Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in?' Florida!\"\n\n\"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" -- Taylor Swift explained that this song was one she wrote \"in one of those moments when I felt sort of bitter about all the things we do to our artists as a society and as a culture.\" She continued, \"What do we do to our writers, and our artists, and our creatives? We put them through hell. We watch what they create, then we judge it, we love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society we provoke that pain and we just watch what happens.\"\n\nAccording to Swift, this song was a true expression of how she feels about the way artists are treated and how she feels being in the public eye. She explained that she sometimes feels like \"a witch in a haunted house,\" and this song was a response to that.\n\nThe \"Commentary\" of the Song \"Clara Bow\"\n\n\"Clara Bow\" -- Swift described this song as a \"commentary\" on the music industry. \"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid,\" she began. \"And they'd say, 'you know, you remind us of...' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'but you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.' And that's how we kind of teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you.\"\n\nShe continued, \"[For the song] I picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these archetypes of greatness in the entertainment industry. Clara Bow was the first 'it girl.' Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music. So I just thought it would be interesting to talk about how weird that feels if we really add up that that's what we do as a society.\"\n\nFeatured Image by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for dcp", "source": {"uri": "americansongwriter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Songwriter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_boisvert@americansongwriter.com", "name": "Lauren Boisvert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_and_the_Machine", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florence and the Machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matty_Healy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matty Healy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_vocalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lead vocalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Alwyn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Alwyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "It girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Nicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stevie Nicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archetype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witchcraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Music industry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://americansongwriter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Taylor-Swift-5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Florida.\"\n\nSwift said her track titled Who's Afraid of Little Old Me? was a song she wrote alone, sitting at the piano when she felt \"bitter\" about the way society treats musicians.\n\n\"Being in the public eye since I was a young teenager, there's a lot that that does to your perception of the world, your perception of yourself,\" she said.\n\n\"The idea that the world has this sense of ownership and not just a right, but they feel they have a responsibility to judge you and to critique you and to weigh in. That can really toy with you.\"\n\nThe US star said the concept of putting artists and creatives \"through hell\" is a consistent theme throughout the album.\n\n\"We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where sometimes, as a society, we provoke that pain and we watch what happens - so there's lines about feeling like I've been in the circus, those kind of metaphors, feeling like I'm sort of like a witch in a haunted house,\" she said.\n\nThe final song with an introduction from Swift is Clara Bow, which she describes as a \"commentary on just what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time\".\n\nShe continued: \"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid.

Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department became the first album in Spotify history to reach more than

These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say but it's that kind of album.\"\n\nAfter its release, fans speculated that the lyrics to Fortnight were in part about The 1975 singer Matty Healy, whom she was rumoured to be dating briefly last year following her split from British actor Joe Alwyn.\n\nMeanwhile Swift said My Boy Only Breaks His Favourite Toys, another song rumoured to be about Healy, is a track she wrote \"alone\", describing it as being written from the perspective of a child's toy.\n\n\"Being somebody's favourite toy, until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore,\" the 34-year-old said.\n\n\"Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of a sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind.\n\n\"We're still clinging on to 'No no, no, you should've seen them the first time they saw me, they'll come back to that, they'll get back to that'.\n\n\"So its kind of a song about denial really so that you can live in this world where there is still hope for a toxic broken relationship.\"\n\nWhile Florida!!!, the song Swift said she wrote with British group Florence + The Machine, is about \"what happens when your life doesn't fit or the choices you've made catch up to you\".\n\n\"I'm always watching (US television show) Dateline, people have these crimes that they commit, where they immediately skip town and go to, they go to Florida.\n\n\"They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in. And I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, I want a new name, I want a new life, I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.\n\n\"And so that was the jumping off point behind where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida.\"\n\nSwift said her track titled Who's Afraid of Little Old Me? was a song she wrote alone, sitting at the piano when she felt \"bitter\" about the way society treats musicians.\n\nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)\n\n\"Being in the public eye since I was a young teenager, there's a lot that that does to your perception of the world, your perception of yourself,\" she said.\n\n\"The idea that the world has this sense of ownership and not just a right, but they feel they have a responsibility to judge you and to critique you and to weigh in. That can really toy with you.\"\n\nThe US star said the concept of putting artists and creatives \"through hell\" is a consistent theme throughout the album.\n\n\"We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where sometimes, as a society, we provoke that pain and we watch what happens - so there's lines about feeling like I've been in the circus, those kind of metaphors, feeling like I'm sort of like a witch in a haunted house,\" she said.\n\nThe final song with an introduction from Swift is Clara Bow, which she describes as a \"commentary on just what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time\".\n\nShe continued: \"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say, 'You know, you remind us of' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'But you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way'.\n\nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)\n\n\"And that's how we kind of teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you.\"\n\nSwift said she \"picked women who have done great things\" to appear in the song.\n\nShe added: \"Clara Bow was the first 'it girl'. Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department became the first album in Spotify history to reach more than 300 million streams in a single day, while Swift also became the most-streamed artist in a single day on the platform when her record was released on April 19, according to the streaming service.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Tue 23 Apr 2024, 11:22 AM Last updated: Tue 23 Apr 2024, 11:45 AM", "source": {"uri": "anglocelt.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Anglo Celt"},

In the new playlist, she describes the inspiration for songs like \"Fortnight,\" \"Clara Bow,\" \"Florida!!!\" and more.\n\n\"'Fortnight' is a song that exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album. One of which being fatalism -- longing, pining away, lost dreams,\" Swift says of the album's first track, featuring Post Malone. \"I think that it's a very fatalistic album in that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death. 'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say. It's that kind of album.\"\n\nSwift launched the music video for \"Fortnight,\" which she dubbed the album's first single, at 5 p.m. PT on Friday. It references the album title by including Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles, who starred in the beloved 1989 film \"The Dead Poets Society.\"\n\nThe other collaboration on the album, \"Florida!!!\" featuring Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine, sprung from Swift's true crime curiosity.\n\n\"I'm always watching 'Dateline.' People have these crimes that they commit; where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida,\" she says. \"They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in.

And so that was the jumping-off point. Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in?

One of which being fatalism -- longing, pining away, lost dreams,\" Swift explained.\n\n\"I think that it's a very fatalistic album in that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death. 'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say. It's that kind of album,\" she added.\n\nThere was much discussion online after Clara Bow was announced as one of the song titles on the track list about what the reference to early film star's name could mean.\n\nNow Swift herself is shedding light on her intentions, calling the song \"a commentary on what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time.\"\n\n\"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say, 'you know, you remind us of' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'but you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way',\" Swift recalls.\n\n\"And that's how we teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you,\" she added. \"I picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these archetypes of greatness in the entertainment industry.\"\n\nSwift continued, \"Clara Bow was the first 'it girl.' Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\nSwift's thought process as a songwriter should be invaluable for others aspiring to create their own music, as well as to her critics who don't appreciate the depths of her devotion to her craft. At the same time, these commentary tracks are clearly there to sell more Amazon Music subscriptions -- though that doesn't mean there isn't valuable insight to glean from them.\n\nOne other track that's generated a lot of online debate is the poignantly titled Florida!!! which features the band Florence + the Machine.\n\nSwift amusingly explains that the inspiration for this one is from her penchant for \"always watching 'Dateline.'\"\n\n\"People have these crimes that they commit; where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida,\" Swift noted. \"They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in.\"\n\nAs for how this ties into Swift's theme of a lover scorned that plays through most of the other tracks on The Tortured Poets Department, Swift explained, \"I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, 'I want a new name. I want a new life. I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.'\"\n\nShe concluded, \"And so that was the jumping off point. Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida!\"\n\nTwo other commentary tracks of note are her ruminations on Who's Afraid of Little Old Me and the catchy My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys.\n\nRegarding 'Little Old Me', Swift admits that she wrote it \"alone, sitting at the piano in one of those moments when I felt bitter about just all the things we do to our artists as a society and as a culture.\"\n\nShe expounded, \"There's a lot about this particular concept on 'The Tortured Poets Department'.\"\n\n\"What do we do to our writers, and our artists, and our creatives?\" Swift questioned, then answered: \"We put them through hell. We watch what they create, then we judge it. We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society we provoke that pain and we just watch what happens.\"\n\nAs for 'My Boy', Swift says it's a track about \"being somebody's favorite toy until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore.\"\n\nShe clarifies further, \"Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind. We're still clinging on to 'No no, no. You should've seen them the first time they saw me. They'll come back to that. They'll get back to that'\".\n\nAll in all, the Amazon Music Taylor Swift commentary tracks companion to The Tortured Poets Department are a must-listen for Swifties, and a fairly heady self-analysis from the artist herself, in her always preferred method of communication -- her own words.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_silverstein@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Josh Silverstein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Me_(5_Seconds_of_Summer_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Me (5 Seconds of Summer song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Alexa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_and_the_Machine", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florence and the Machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "It girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Nicks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stevie Nicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archetype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline_NBC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dateline NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women_in_Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Women in Music", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/High School", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Taylor-Swift-breaks-down-Tortured-Poets-Department-tracks.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Within three days, the 31-song record also became the most-streamed album globally in its first week on Amazon Music.\n\nOur review: Why Taylor Swift's 'Tortured Poets' is hauntingly brilliant\n\nWhich songs did Taylor Swift share commentary for?\n\nSwift only recorded intros for tracks that were among the original \"TTPD\" songs released midnight Friday.\n\nShe did voice notes for \"Fortnight,\" \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" \"Florida!!!\" \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" and \"Clara Bow.\"\n\n'Clara Bow' is Taylor Swift's commentary on the music industry\n\nThe history-making Grammy winner discusses what is behind the lyrics of some of her new tracks, revealing her inspirations and the themes in her new tunes.\n\nOn \"Clara Bow,\" Swift said it was written \"as a commentary on what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time.\"\n\n\"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid.

Through the playlist experience, the singer revealed the inspiration behind songs \"Fortnight\" featuring Post Malone, \"Florida!!!\" with Florence + the Machine, \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?,\" \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\" and \"Clara Bow.\"\n\nAfter its release, Swift called the album \"an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time -- one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure.\"\n\n\"This period of the author's life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up,\" she continued. \"There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed. And upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted. This writer is of the firm belief that our tears become holy in the form of ink on a page. Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it. And then all that's left behind is the tortured poetry.\"\n\nSwift later surprised fans by releasing a secret \"double album\" expansion of The Tortured Poets Department with 15 extra songs. \"It's a 2am surprise: The Tortured Poets Department is a secret DOUBLE album,\" Swift wrote on Instagram. \"I'd written so much tortured poetry in the past 2 years and wanted to share it all with you, so here's the second installment of TTPD: The Anthology. 15 extra songs. And now the story isn't mine anymore... it's all yours.\"\n\nBelow is what Swift had to say.\n\n\"'Fortnight' is a song that I think exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album. One of which being fatalism -- longing, pining away, lost dreams. I think that it's a very fatalistic album in that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death. 'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say but it's that kind of album,\" she said. \"It's about a traumatic, artistic tragic kind of take on love and loss. 'Fortnight' I always imagined that it took place in this American town where the American dream you thought would happen to you didn't. You ended up not with the person that you loved and now you just have to live with that everyday, wondering what would've been maybe seeing them out. And that's a pretty tragic concept really so I was just writing from that perspective.\"\n\nWhen announcing the song as the first single from the album, Swift explained her adoration for Post Malone, writing on Instagram alongside a photo with him: \"I've been such a huge fan of Post because of the writer he is, his musical experimentation and those melodies he creates that just stick in your head forever. I got to witness that magic come to life firsthand when we worked together on 'Fortnight.'\"\n\n\"It's a metaphor from the perspective of a child's toy, being somebody's favorite toy until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore. Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind. We're still clinging on to 'No no, no. You should've seen them the first time they saw me. They'll come back to that. They'll get back to that.' So it's kind of like a song about denial really so that you could live in this world where there's still hope for a toxic, broken relationship.\"\n\n\"I think I was coming up with this idea of what happens when your life doesn't fit or the choices you've made catch up to you and you're surrounded by these harsh consequences and judgment and circumstances did not lead you to where you thought you would be? And you just want to escape from everything you've ever known. Is there a place you could go?\" Swift explained.\n\nShe said she always watches Dateline and \"people have these crimes that they commit; where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida. They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in. I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, 'I want a new name. I want a new life. I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.' And so that was the jumping off point behind Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida!\"\n\n\"So being in the public eye since I was a young teenager, there's a lot that that does to your perception of the world, your perception of yourself. The idea that the world has this sense of ownership and not just a right but they feel they have a responsibility to judge you and critique you and to weigh in and that can really toy with you,\" Swift said. She said the song was one she wrote alone at the piano \"in one of those moments when I felt sort of bitter about all the things we do to our artists as a society and as a culture\" which, she said, is concept explored on the album. She added, \"What do we do to our writers, and our artists, and our creatives? We put them through hell. We watch what they create, then we judge it. We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society we provoke that pain and we just watch what happens.\"\n\nShe said at times she can feel like she's a \"witch in a haunted house\" when she's unable to cope using her normal coping mechanisms. \"This song was just a very very true way that I feel sometimes and it's always good when you can be honest about those things.\"\n\nSwift began describing the song as one that served as a \"commentary\" of what's seen in the industry over time. \"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say, 'you know, you remind us of...' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'but you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.' And that's how we kind of teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you,\" she said. \"So I had this idea that it's a conversation between the young woman sitting in the chair in front of the desk and the man in power or woman in power sitting behind the desk saying 'Oh you remind me so much of a women who came before you but don't worry you're better. We're going to make you the new her.' So I picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these archetypes of greatness in the entertainment industry. Clara Bow was the first 'it girl.' Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music. So I just thought it would be interesting to talk about how weird that feels if we really add up that that's what we do as a society.\"\n\nPhysical copies of the new album also reportedly include a handwritten poem Stevie Nicks wrote for Swift, featured on the LP gatefolds or CD booklets. The poem's header reads, \"For T -- and me...\" and throughout the poem, Nicks seemingly sets the stage for songs about heartbreak.\n\n\"He was in love with her/ Or at least she thought so/ She was brokenhearted/ Maybe he was too/ Neither of them knew. She was way too hot to handle/ He was way too high to try -- / He couldn't even see her/ He wouldn't open his eyes/ She was on her way to the stars/ He didn't say goodbye,\" the poem reads.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hollywood Reporter"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lexy_perez@hollywoodreporter.com", "name": "Lexy Perez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fatalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Anthology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_album", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Double album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_and_the_Machine", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florence and the Machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyperbole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "It girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatefold", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gatefold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Nicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stevie Nicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haunted_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Haunted house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archetype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_disc", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Compact disc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witchcraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Witchcraft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1986381340.jpg?w=1296", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

It's that kind of album.'\n\nIn addition to making Fortnight the lead single, she released an emotional music video, alongside Malone as her ex-lover.\n\nEthan Hawke and Josh Charles, who starred in Dead Poets Society, also made a cameo.\n\nAfter releasing the video, she wrote on social media: 'I wanted to show you the worlds I saw in my head that served as the backdrop for making this music. Pretty much everything in it is a metaphor or a reference to one corner of the album or another.'\n\n'For me, this video turned out to be the perfect visual representation of this record and the stories I tell in it. Post Malone blew me away on set as our tortured tragic hero and I'm so grateful to him for everything he put into this collaboration,' she concluded.\n\n'Fortnight is a song that exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album,' Swift explained.\n\nClara Bow\n\n'Clara Bow is a song that I wrote as a commentary on what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time,' Swift said.

I liked it there, it was weird but it was cool, come back!'\"\n\n\"The character in the song just felt like, 'I've just been exposed to a whole different galaxy and universe I didn't know was possible, how can you put me somewhere I was before?'\"\n\nDiscussing opening track \"Fortnight,\" which features Post Malone, Swift told Amazon Music that it \"exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album,\" one of the biggest being \"fatalism -- longing, pining away, lost dreams.\"\n\n\"I think that it's a very fatalistic album in that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death. 'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say,\" she said. \"It's that kind of album.\"\n\nIn her iHeartRadio commentary, she added that she \"always imagined that it took place in this, like, American town where the American Dream you thought would happen to you didn't, right?\"\n\nThe second guest act on The Tortured Poets Department comes in \"Florida!!!\" -- a haunting track that Swift both penned and sang with Florence and the Machine's Florence Welch.\n\nReflecting on the \"jumping-off point\" she used to write the tune with Welch, 37, during the record's iHeartRadio premiere, the Midnights songstress said, \"I think I was coming up with this idea of like, what happens when your life doesn't fit, or your choices you've made catch up to you, and you're surrounded by these harsh consequences and judgment, and circumstances did not lead you to where you thought you'd be, and you just want to escape from everything you've ever known, is there a place you could go?\"\n\n\"I'm always watching like... Dateline, people have these crimes that they commit, where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida,\" she said. \"They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in.\"\n\n\"And I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks: 'I want a new name, I want a new life, I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.' \"\n\nClosing track \"Clara Bow\" -- whose namesake is an actress from the silent film era -- is \"a commentary on what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time,\" Swift revealed to Amazon Music.\n\n\"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid,\" she said. \"And they'd say, 'You know, you remind us of...' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'But you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.' \"\n\n\"And that's how we teach women to see themselves, as, like, 'You could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you.'\"\n\nSo, when deciding who to name-drop in the \"The Lucky One\"-esque tune (Stevie Nicks, Bow and Swift herself), the singer said she \"picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these archetypes of greatness in the entertainment industry.\"\n\nClara Bow, Swift noted, \"was the first 'it girl,'\" while \"Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\n\"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" -- whose lyric \"You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me\" birthed the album's first viral meme -- was born from a moment of bitterness, Swift revealed on Amazon Music's track-by-track experience.\n\nSwift said she wrote the track alone, while \"sitting at the piano in one of those moments when I felt bitter about just all the things we do to our artists as a society and as a culture.\"\n\n\"There's a lot about this particular concept on The Tortured Poets Department,\" she continued. \"What do we do to our writers, and our artists, and our creatives? We put them through hell. We watch what they create, then we judge it.\"\n\n\"We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society we provoke that pain and we just watch what happens.\"\n\nAs the name hints, \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" is told \"from the perspective of a child's toy,\" the singer said on iHeartRadio's premiere commentary.\n\nThe song, which she penned alone, is about \"being somebody's favorite toy until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore -- which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind.\"\n\n\"We're still clinging on to 'No no, no. You should've seen them the first time they saw me. They'll come back to that. They'll get back to that.' So it's kind of like a song about denial, really,\" she said, \"so that you can live in this world where there's still hope for a toxic broken relationship.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHeartRadio", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "IHeartRadio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fatalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alien abduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florence Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Nicks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stevie Nicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline_NBC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dateline NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_and_the_Machine", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florence and the Machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyperbole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "It girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archetype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/P5XghXunIQYuM7hEMt4amIvEbk8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(722x384:724x386)/Taylor-Swift-TTPD-041824-tout3-7889ed0a24c64bd1a6d630056d6f8ace.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 132, "textEnd": 140}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

And they'd say, 'You know, you remind us of' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'But you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.' And that's how we teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you,\" she said.\n\nSwift added: \"I picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these archetypes of greatness in the entertainment industry. Clara Bow was the first 'it girl.' Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\n'Florida!!! (Featuring Florence + the Machine)' sees the singer shift gears and not directly focus on a former lover. Swift revealed that the inspiration for the song came from \"always watching Dateline.\"\n\nShe continued: \"People have these crimes that they commit; where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida. They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in. I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, 'I want a new name. I want a new life. I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.' And so that was the jumping off point. Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida!\"\n\nSpeaking of 'Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?', the singer explained that she created the track while \"alone, sitting at the piano in one of those moments when I felt bitter about just all the things we do to our artists as a society and as a culture.\"\n\n\"There's a lot about this particular concept on 'The Tortured Poets Department,'\" she continued. \"What do we do to our writers, and our artists, and our creatives? We put them through hell. We watch what they create, then we judge it. We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society we provoke that pain and we just watch what happens.\"\n\nElsewhere, Swift recalled that 'My Boy Only Breaks His Favourite Toys' is about \"being somebody's favourite toy, until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore.\n\n\"Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind. We're still clinging on to 'No no, no. You should've seen them the first time they saw me. They'll come back to that. They'll get back to that.'\"\n\n'The Tortured Poets Department' scored a three-star review from NME upon its release, with Laura Molloy writing: \"The pitfalls that mire her 11th studio album are all the more disappointing -- she's proven time and time again she can do better. To a Melbourne audience of her Eras Tour, Swift said that 'The Tortured Poets Department' came from a \"need\" to write. It's just that maybe we didn't need to hear it.\"\n\nIn other news, fans have speculated that Swift's 11th studio LP was written about The 1975 frontman Matty Healy. The pair were romantically linked for a short period in 2023.\n\nElsewhere, Patti Smith responded to Swift's name-check on the album. Smith has had her say on her name being dropped in the song in a social media post featuring a photo of her reading Thomas. \"This is saying I was moved to be mentioned in the company of the great Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. Thank you Taylor.\"\n\nNumerous artists are name-checked throughout 'The Tortured Poets Department'. The title track refers to a \"Lucy\", which fans seem convinced is a reference to Lucy Dacus, one third of the Grammy-winning group boygenius. Charlie Puth gets a shout out on the same song, while fans are also speculating about whether 'thanK you aIMee' is aimed at Kim Kardashian.\n\nSwift also mentioned the cult Scottish indie band The Blue Nile on 'Guilty As Sin?', which appears to be another nod to Healy. American 00's pop-punk band The Starting Line also responded to Swift after she referenced them on 'The Black Dog'.\n\nFollowing the LP's release, Swift will resume her career-spanning 'Eras Tour' in Europe next month before heading to the UK and Ireland in June. Swift is due to play eight shows at Wembley Stadium in London this summer as part of the run, with support coming from Paramore.", "source": {"uri": "nme.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NME Music

The album is expected to be another blockbuster in a career full of them, and Swift is projected to once again hold down the entire top 10 of next week's Billboard Hot 100. Swift isn't doing any traditional press for the album. Instead, she's using the art of the corporate deal to explain the LP's individual tracks. If you want to hear what she has to say about these songs, you'll need to be an Amazon Music subscriber.\n\nAs part of a new Amazon promotion, Taylor Swift gives little directors'-commentary introductions to each song on The Tortured Poets Department. (She only does the main-album songs, not the many bonus tracks that were added as a release-night surprise.) With most of the songs, the explanations are fairly self-explanatory. Here's what Swift says, for instance, about closing track \"Clara Bow,\" which namechecks herself alongside Bow and Stevie Nicks:\n\n\"Clara Bow\" is a song that I wrote as a commentary on what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time. I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid, and they'd say, \"You know, you remind us of...\" and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her: \"But you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.\" And that's how we teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you.\n\nI picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these archetypes of greatness in the entertainment industry. Clara Bow was the first \"it girl.\" Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\n\nSwift's explanation for her Florence Welch duet \"Florida!!!\" is a little more illuminating, since I couldn't really tell what that song was about:\n\nI'm always watching Dateline. People have these crimes that they commit; where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida. They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in. I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, \"I want a new name. I want a new life. I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.\" And so that was the jumping off point. Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida!\n\nIf you're an Amazon music subscriber, you can hear all of Taylor Swift's commentary here.

Following the release of her surprise double album, Swift called the 31-track LP \"an anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time -- one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure.\" The Tortured Poets Department became the most streamed album on Spotify the first day of its release, with more than 200 million streams in less than 24 hours.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nWhen discussing \"Fortnight,\" featuring Post Malone, Swift explained the dramatic themes of life and death in the album's first track, along with the message of fatalism, or the process of \"longing, pinning away, lost dreams.\"\n\n\"It's about a dramatic, artistic tragic kind of take on love and loss,\" Swift said about the first single. \"'Fortnight' I always imagined that it took place in this American town where the American dream you thought would happen to you didn't. You ended up not with the person that you loved and now you just have to live with that everyday, wondering what would've been maybe seeing them out. And that's a pretty tragic concept really, so I was just writing from that perspective.\"\n\nIn \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" Swift added the song is a metaphor for being a child's favorite toy until the toy breaks and is discarded. Swift compares this example to feeling broken in a crumbling relationship. \"We're still clinging on to 'No no, no,'\" Swift shared. \"You should've seen them the first time they saw me. They'll come back to that. They'll get back to that.' So it's kind of like a song about denial really so that you could live in this world where there's still hope for a toxic, broken relationship.\"\n\nThe singer also details \"Florida,\" featuring Florence + the Machine. Swift said she's an avid Dateline watcher, and drew inspiration from the people escaping law, eager to start a new life. \"I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, 'I want a new name. I want a new life. I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.' And so that was the jumping off point behind, 'Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida!'\"\n\nFor the 14th track, \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?,\" Swift discussed reaching pop stardom as a teenager and its impact on her self image. She shared that as a public figure, \"the world has this sense of ownership,\" and how people are quick to judge and critique her behavior. Swift wrote the song alone at a piano in a bitter state, she said, contemplating how society treats glamorized artists.\n\n\"What do we do to our writers, and our artists, and our creatives?\" Swift said. \"We put them through hell. We watch what they create, then we judge it. We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society we provoke that pain, and we just watch what happens.\"\n\nWhen describing the final track \"Clara Bow,\" Swift delved into her experience in the entertainment industry, specifically how record labels treat young female artists looking for a record deal. Swift describes Clara Bow as a the first \"It Girl,\" and Stevie Nicks as an inspiration for up and coming songwriters and artists.\n\n\"So, I had this idea that it's a conversation between the young woman sitting in the chair in front of the desk, and the man in power or woman in power sitting behind the desk saying 'Oh you remind me so much of a woman who came before you but don't worry, you're better,'\" Swift said. \"'We're going to make you the new her.' So I picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these archetypes of greatness in the entertainment industry.\"\n\nBest of Rolling Stone", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kalia_richardson@yahoo.com", "name": "Kalia Richardson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fatalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Me_(5_Seconds_of_Summer_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Me (5 Seconds of Summer song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LP record"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline_NBC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dateline NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_and_the_Machine", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florence and the Machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_wrestling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional wrestling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Nicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stevie Nicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archetype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Toys_and_Games", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Toys and Games", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Visual_Arts/Collectives", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Visual Arts/Collectives", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JeTX66p1qGcXCbuufqOD.A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/rollingstone.com/af676a1d3700e064f6e940872977d71c", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Within three days, the 31-song record also became the most-streamed album globally in its first week on Amazon Music.\n\nOur review: Why Taylor Swift's 'Tortured Poets' is hauntingly brilliant\n\nSwift only recorded intros for tracks that were among the original \"TTPD\" songs released midnight Friday.\n\nShe did voice notes for \"Fortnight,\" \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" \"Florida!!!\" \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" and \"Clara Bow.\"\n\nThe history-making Grammy winner discusses what is behind the lyrics of some of her new tracks, revealing her inspirations and the themes in her new tunes.\n\nOn \"Clara Bow,\" Swift said it was written \"as a commentary on what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time.\"\n\n\"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say, 'You know, you remind us of' and then they'd name an artist,\" she said.\n\nShe continued, \"And then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her: 'But you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.' And that's how we teach women to see themselves, as, like, you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you.\"\n\nSwift also talks about her song \"Florida!!!\" which features Florence + The Machine.\n\nIn the intro, Swift said, \"I'm always watching 'Dateline.' People have these crimes that they commit; where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida.\"\n\nSwift added that she thinks of Florida as a state where people can create a new identity and attempt to blend in. She said that after a heartbreak, part of her wanted to skip town and reinvent herself in the same way.\n\nIn \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me,\" Swift explored the pressure that comes with fame and being in the public eye.\n\n\"What do we do to our writers and our artists and our creatives? We put them through hell,\" Swift says.\n\n\"We watch what they create, then we judge it,\" she says. \"We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society we provoke that pain and we just watch what happens.\"\n\nCeleb reactions: Patti Smith was 'moved' by her mention in 'The Tortured Poets Department'\n\nThe commentary is available to stream on Amazon Music.\n\nAmazon Music customers can access the commentary tracks by asking Alexa, too, by saying, \"Alexa, I'm a member of 'The Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nContributing: KiMi Robinson, USA TODAY", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Me_(5_Seconds_of_Summer_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Me (5 Seconds of Summer song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Alexa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline_NBC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dateline NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_and_the_Machine", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florence and the Machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patti_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patti Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/usa_today_entertainment_893/94030668308134cf501d89353e84ec24", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

And now the story isn't mine anymore ... it's all yours.\"\n\nFans have since examined the lyrics trying to figure out the inspiration behind Swift's new songs. The overwhelming consensus was Swift's surprising split from Joe Alwyn and her subsequent fling with Matty Healy. (Swift's current boyfriend, Travis Kelce, also got subtle mentions in several of the tracks.)\n\nSwift has since offered more information about certain songs including \"Fortnight\" with Post Malone, \"Clara Bow,\" \"Florida!!!\" with Florence + the Machine, \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" and \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys.\"\n\n\"'Fortnight' is a song that exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album.

The first half of the album leaked on the internet before it could be officially released, a near-unprecedented breach in the Swift canon.\n\nAlthough Swift needs no help from conventional modes of promotion at this point, fans noticed over the weekend that Swift had enlisted the aid of big tech to disseminate her new tunes. Specifically, if you yell at your Amazon Alexa about Swift-related things, Swift herself will answer.\n\nAccording to Variety, if you tell your Alexa, cloyingly, \"I'm a member of the tortured poets department,\" Swift will revel the inspiration behind the tracks \"Fortnight,\" \"Clara Bow,\" \"Florida!!!,\" \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" and \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys.\"\n\n\"Fortnight,\" her song with rapper-slash-pop-star Post Malone, dropped last week with an accompanying music video, and via Alexa, Swift says that it is \"is a song that exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album.

'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say. It's that kind of album.\"\n\nOf \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" which, like the rest of the album, is almost certainly about Matty Healy, her problematic ex-paramour, Swift says that the track is about \"being somebody's favorite toy until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore.\"\n\n\"Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind,\" she continues. \"We're still clinging on to 'No no, no.'

For fans to hear Swift's insight into the new music, they merely need to say to their Alexa device, \"I'm a member of The Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nThis feature has Swift open up about the creation of \"Clara Bow,\" the song that closes out the double album's first half. Named after the famous actress who rose to fame in the silent film era before successfully transitioning to \"talkies,\" Swift wrote the song as \"a commentary on what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time.\"\n\n\"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid,\" she says. \"And they'd say, 'You know, you remind us of' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'But you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.' And that's how we teach women to see themselves, as like, 'You could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you.'\"\n\n\"I picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these archetypes of greatness in the entertainment industry,\" Swift continues. \"Clara Bow was the first 'it girl.' Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\nBow died in 1965 at the age of 60. Before TTPD's release, her great-granddaughter Brittany Grace Bell told TMZ that Clara would be thrilled that Swift introduced her to a new generation of fans. Bell also said that while Swift didn't reach out to her family to preview the song, they're happy for Swift to shed light on Bow's legacy.\n\nElsewhere in the Amazon Music commentary on TTPD, Swift reveals that \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me\" came from a moment when she felt \"bitter\" about \"the things we do to our artists as a society and as a culture.\"\n\nSwift says that society takes its writers, artists and creatives and puts them \"through hell.\"\n\n\"We watch what they create, then we judge it,\" she explains. \"We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society, we provoke that pain and we just watch what happens.\"\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department became Spotify's most-streamed album in a single day, topping the previous record-holder, Swift's 2022 album, Midnights. TTPD generated over 300 million streams. The album also sold 1.4 million copies in traditional album sales in the U.S., per Billboard. The album's first single, \"Fortnight,\" featuring Post Malone, racked up 18.4 million streams and will likely debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. If so, it would give Swift 12 chart-topping songs, tying her with The Supremes and Madonna.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_brow@usmagazine.com", "name": "Jason Brow", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Alexa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sound film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "It girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Nicks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stevie Nicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archetype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TMZ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TMZ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Supremes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Supremes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_Hot_100", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard Hot 100"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Billboard (magazine)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Musical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Taylor-Swift-Shares-the-Meaning-Behind-Clara-Bow-Song-From-TTPD.jpg?crop=0px%2C74px%2C1771px%2C931px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 74, "textEnd": 82}], "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

Fortnight\n\nWhile speaking about Fortnight, the haunting collab with Post Malone, Tay Tay revealed her first single from the album had to set the tone AND make a bold thematic statement:\n\n\"Fortnight is a song that exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album. One of which being fatalism -- longing, pining away, lost dreams. I think that it's a very fatalistic album in that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death. 'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say. It's that kind of album.\"\n\nWe love how Tay is so in tune with her craft. There are definitely songwriters who aren't self-aware enough to know they're being melodramatic! LOLz!\n\nMy Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\n\nThis one is pretty clear -- but no less devastating for it! Taylor says My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys is about \"being somebody's favorite toy until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore.\" But it's also about the delusion they'll want to play with you again! She went on to explain:\n\n\"Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind. We're still clinging on to 'No no, no. You should've seen them the first time they saw me. They'll come back to that. They'll get back to that.'\"\n\nHeartbreaking! The \"they'll come back to that\" narrative seems to be super common in TTPD. So sad. And the use of the toy as a metaphor is really striking.\n\nNo wonder that imagery hit just as hard in the '20s in The Velveteen Rabbit as it did nearly a century later in the Toy Story movies. Easier to decipher, but truly crushing.\n\nClara Bow\n\nAs fans quickly figured out when the tracklist debuted weeks ago, Clara Bow was named after the iconic silent film actress of the 1920s. Taylor used the \"first it girl\" as a jumping off point deep metaphor for how society teaches \"women to see themselves\":\n\n\"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say, 'you know, you remind us of' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'but you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.' And that's how we teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you. I picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these archetypes of greatness in the entertainment industry. Clara Bow was the first 'it girl.' Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\nWow! Definitely makes you sit down and think...\n\nFlorida!!!\n\nFlorida!!! featuring Florence and The Machine isn't about an ex or a past icon, though. Funnily enough, T-Swizzle said the song came straight from the fact Taylor is a true crime junkie with a habit of \"always watching Dateline.\" But it isn't a joke about the \"Florida man.\" There's something really romantic at play here:\n\n\"People have these crimes that they commit; where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida. They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in. I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, 'I want a new name. I want a new life. I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.' And so that was the jumping off point. Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida!\"\n\nWe kind of love that! Florida as the new frontier, not unlike the Old West how you can just lose yourself. Also, of course, not unlike the Old West in your chances of being the victim of gun violence increasing... Hey, not everything romantic is safe!\n\nWho's Afraid Of Little Old Me?\n\nTaylor has a much more somber explanation for Who's Afraid Of Little Old Me?. She revealed she wrote the track \"alone, sitting at the piano in one of those moments when I felt bitter about just all the things we do to our artists as a society and as a culture\". Ouch! In fact, she calls out society for wanting to \"provoke\" that kind of pain in artists:\n\n\"There's a lot about this particular concept on 'The Tortured Poets Department. What do we do to our writers, and our artists, and our creatives? We put them through hell. We watch what they create, then we judge it. We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society we provoke that pain and we just watch what happens.\"\n\nIt's a really interesting interrogation of our treatment of art and artists! It's certainly true lots of musicians and comedians tend to have less to say about universal plights once they live in mansions, get showered with adulation, and want for nothing. Is tall poppy syndrome, where the masses poke at those who rise above, at least somewhat in response to losing our heroes to the heavens?

Speculation has arisen among fans that the song could draw from Swift's own experiences, particularly in light of her past relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift)\n\n'Fortnight', a collaboration with Post Malone, carries a \"fatalistic\" essence, according to Swift, with dramatic lines exploring themes of love and its potentially destructive impact. The song encapsulates the hyperbolic nature of the album's overarching narrative.\n\nDelving into the track 'Florida!!!', Swift revealed that the inspiration struck while watching an episode of the American show Dateline. The song explores the desire for reinvention and anonymity following a breakup, with Florida serving as a metaphorical destination for starting anew.\n\nLastly, 'Clara Bow' draws attention to the regressive practice of measuring a woman artist's worth by comparing her to others. Swift shared her own experiences of being likened to other artists during her early career, highlighting the dismissive nature of such comparisons.\n\nAlso read: Taylor Swift's 'The Tortured Poets Department' savage takedown of Kim Kardashian leaves internet buzzing\n\nCover Image Source: Instagram", "source": {"uri": "me.mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable ME"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Me_(5_Seconds_of_Summer_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Old Me (5 Seconds of Summer song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Alwyn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Alwyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline_NBC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dateline NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbole", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyperbole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anonymity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Kardashian", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kim Kardashian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://sm.mashable.com/mashable_me/seo/default/33-6_wzm4.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Now, Swift is offering a direct glimpse into her mind and songwriting process through a new Amazon Alexa feature.\n\nOn Monday, Amazon launched an album experience featuring Swift's commentary on the inspiration behind some of the \"TTPD\" tracks. The feature can be accessed through the Amazon Music app, or by saying to an Alexa device, \"Alexa, I'm a member of the Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nRELATED: Taylor Swift mentions Bucks County band the Starting Line in new song\n\nTopics for Swift's commentary include the first single from the album, \"Fortnight\" with Post Malone, along with \"Clara Bow,\" \"Florida!!!\" with Florence + the Machine, \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" and \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys.\"\n\nAs a Swiftie, I had to give the feature a try ... for investigative journalism purposes, of course! So, I said the magic words to my Alexa, which played a beat of ominous music before informing me, \"You're in.\" Before I could revel in what felt like my initiation into an exclusive club, Swift's voice filled the airwaves:\n\n\"Hi, I'm Taylor, taking you behind the scenes of my new album in a unique listening experience called track-by-track, only on Amazon Music,\" she said.\n\nFrom there, Swift launched into the following explanation of \"Fortnight.\"\n\n\"'Fortnight' is a song that exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album. One of which being fatalism -- longing, pining away, lost dreams. I think that it's a very fatalistic album in that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death. 'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say. It's that kind of album.\"\n\nDoing my due diligence as a Swiftie, I filmed my initial interaction with Swift-via-Alexa and posted it to TikTok to share the news of the Alexa feature with other fans.\n\nBased on the comments on the video, some people didn't have as much luck utilizing the feature. Many claimed their Alexa misheard them, with multiple users saying their device thought they were asking to listen to \"Eclectic Donut.\"\n\nTechnological difficulties aside, this new feature gives fans a rare intimate look into the songwriting process of Swift, while also leaving the album largely open for Swifties to interpret and relate to things that have happened in their own lives.\n\nFor her explanation of the song \"Clara Bow,\" Swift discusses how the entertainment industry teaches women to see themselves \"like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you.\" \"Florida!!!\" is an ode to Swift watching \"Dateline\" and seeing how some criminals try to reinvent themselves in the Sunshine State, while \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys\" is about being with people who \"devalue us in their mind.\"\n\nAs for \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" Swift was inspired by \"bitter\" feelings about how society treats artists.\n\n\"What do we do to our writers, and our artists, and our creatives? We put them through hell,\" she says. \"We watch what they create, then we judge it. We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society we provoke that pain and we just watch what happens.\"\n\nListeners can also learn more about the meaning behind key words on the album by saying to their Alexa, \"Alexa, give me a 'Tortured Poets Department' word.\" Plus, a special \"TTPD\" introduction by Swift will play when users tell their devices, \"Alexa, play the latest album by Taylor Swift.\"\n\nSince the release of \"TTPD\" on Friday, Swift has been smashing records. \"TTPD\" became the first album to exceed 200 million streams in a single day, according to Variety. With the new release, the Berks County native became the most streamed artist in a single day in Spotify history, breaking her own record from when \"1989 (Taylor's Version)\" dropped in October. Amazon and Apple also said that Swift's album broke records across their respective streaming platforms, according to CNN.", "source": {"uri": "phillyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PhillyVoice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Alexa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Me_(5_Seconds_of_Summer_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Me (5 Seconds of Summer song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_and_the_Machine", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florence and the Machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songwriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Songwriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbole", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hyperbole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Investigative journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_diligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Due diligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclecticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eclecticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline_NBC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dateline NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ode"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berks_County,_Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Berks County, Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berks County, Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://media.phillyvoice.com/media/images/042324-taylor-swift-amazon-ale.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630-c0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

The first half of the album leaked on the internet before it could be officially released, a near-unprecedented breach in the Swift canon.\n\nAlthough Swift needs no help from conventional modes of promotion at this point, fans noticed over the weekend that Swift had enlisted the aid of big tech to disseminate her new tunes. Specifically, if you yell at your Amazon Alexa about Swift-related things, Swift herself will answer.\n\nAccording to Variety, if you tell your Alexa, cloyingly, \"I'm a member of the tortured poets department,\" Swift will revel the inspiration behind the tracks \"Fortnight,\" \"Clara Bow,\" \"Florida!!!,\" \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" and \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys.\"\n\n\"Fortnight,\" her song with rapper-slash-pop-star Post Malone, dropped last week with an accompanying music video, and via Alexa, Swift says that it is \"is a song that exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album.

An anthology of new works that reflect events, opinions and sentiments from a fleeting and fatalistic moment in time -- one that was both sensational and sorrowful in equal measure. This period of the author's life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up. There is nothing to avenge, no scores to settle once wounds have healed. And upon further reflection, a good number of them turned out to be self-inflicted. This writer is of the firm belief that our tears become holy in the form of ink on a page. Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it. And then all that's left behind is the tortured poetry (sic),\" Taylor said in her long post shared on her Instagram handle. And while her post reads that she has moved on from her lovers, who broke her heart and the trauma that she faced in her initial days, the songs talk about episodes from her life and depict that she is still clinging on to the hurt and betrayal.\n\nThe album's opening song, which also features Post Malone, explores a lot of the common themes recurrent in the album, including fatalism. \"Longing, pining away, lost dreams,\" Taylor explained, adding that she feels that The Tortured Poets Department is \"a very fatalistic album\" as there are a lot of \"very dramatic lines about life or death\" in it. 'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say. It's that kind of album,\" she divulged.\n\nClara Bow: An ode to women\n\nTaylor dedicated the song \"Clara Bow\" to the popular silent film actress. She said the song reflects what she has faced and witnessed in the industry over the years. Talking about the track, which speaks about the treatment of women in Hollywood, Taylor, added, \"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say, 'you know, you remind us of' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'but you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.' And that's how we teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you\". She revealed that she \"picked women who have done great things in the past\" and called them the \"archetypes of greatness in the entertainment industry\". \"Clara Bow was the first 'it girl.' Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music,\" she said. Interestingly, Stevie Nicks, former Fleetwood Mac singer, penned 'For T and Me,' a poem featuring as the written prologue on the physical copies of the The Tortured Poets Department.\n\nFlorida!!!: Of crime and violence\n\nTaylor collaborated with Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine for the track \"Florida!!!,\" which she said was inspired by true crime. Drawing parallels between criminals and heartbroken lovers, the singer explained, \"I'm always watching Dateline. People have these crimes that they commit; where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida. They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, and blend in. I think when you go through a heartbreak, there's a part of you that thinks, 'I want a new name. I want a new life. I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.' And so that was the jumping-off point. Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida!\"\n\nMy Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys: Heartbreak and self-worth\n\nOne of the most loved tracks from the album, \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" deals with the complexities of relationships and self-worth. \"Being somebody's favourite toy until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore. Which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind,\" Taylor said in her commentary. \"We're still clinging on to 'No no, no. You should've seen them the first time they saw me. They'll come back to that. They'll get back to that,\" she added.\n\nWho's Afraid Of Little Old Me?: Bitternes personified\n\n\"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?\" depicts how society first praises an artist and once they rise in their career, it tears them down. Dark in its lyrics and treatment, the track is layered and inspired by Taylor's own encounter with trolling and bullying. Commenting on its inspiration, Taylor, said, \"I felt bitter about just all the things we do to our artists as a society and as a culture. There's a lot about this particular concept in The Tortured Poets Department. What do we do to our writers, and our artists, and our creatives? We put them through hell. We watch what they create, and then we judge it. We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society we provoke that pain and we just watch what happens.\"\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department has smashed Amazon Music records since its release.

She described the song as exhibiting themes of fatalism, longing, and lost dreams, with dramatic lines about life and death that permeate the album.\n\nOne of the album's standout tracks, \"Florida!!!,\" features Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine. Swift revealed that the song explores the idea of escaping from the consequences of one's choices and starting anew, drawing inspiration from true crime stories where individuals often flee to Florida to reinvent themselves.\n\nAnother track, \"Clara Bow,\" named after the silent film actress, serves as a commentary on the entertainment industry's tendency to compare and replace female artists.\n\n\"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid,\" she said.\n\n\"And they'd say, 'You know, you remind us of...' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'But you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.'\n\n\"And that's how we teach women to see themselves, as, like, 'You could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you.'\"\n\nFinally, Swift discussed \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?,\" a track that gained attention for its viral meme potential. She revealed that the song was born out of bitterness and explores society's treatment of artists and creatives.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHeartRadio", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IHeartRadio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metaphor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Welch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florence Welch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alien abduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_and_the_Machine", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florence and the Machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Protagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_crime", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "True crime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/73d832df220050fa99fbe3374c932f83/crop/0x0/2044x1363/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2023/10/12/16971234746060.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

As she does with each new era, her Instagram has become engrossed with the new vibe of \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nShe released her album at midnight, which had 16 songs total. Swift featured fellow hit artist, Post Malone, on the first song of her album, titled \"Fortnight.\" Additionally, she also featured Florence + The Machine on her eighth song of the album, \"Florida!!!\"\n\n\"Fortnight\" is a slower, softer song, whereas \"Florida!!!\" is more upbeat and hype, as the title indicated. \"Fortnight\" acts like the poster child of her album, and it represents many of Swift's ideas and the atmosphere for \"The Tortured Poets Department.\" This song has the classic love song aura that is expected from Swift, which is likely why the album began with it.\n\nIn a characteristic Swift practice, this song includes one of her famous \"Easter eggs.\" There is a repeating line in the song that says, \"Another fortnight lost in America, move to Florida\" which was foreshadowing the song \"Florida!!!\" that came later in the album.\n\nFollowing \"Fortnight,\" Swift has a song titled after her album. This song has a continuation of her conventional love song vibes, but it has slightly less tact to it, with her using profanity that wasn't typically showcased in her previous albums. It still has a similar slow pace like \"Fortnight,\" but the true atmosphere of her new album begins to peek through with this song.\n\nSwift's album proceeds with several slow songs such as \"So Long, London,\" \"But Daddy I Love Him,\" \"Fresh Out The Slammer\" and \"Guilty As Sin?\" Her album is predominantly softer songs, distinctly on-brand for her theme.\n\nShe also has some fast-paced, upbeat songs strung throughout the album such as \"Florida!!!,\" \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" and \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\"\n\nUnlike Swift's conventional style, numerous songs on her album are explicit. Swift stated on her Instagram, \"This period of the author's [herself] life is now over, the chapter closed and boarded up.\" This album is Swift's way of healing old wounds and beginning to leave behind her past as she closed the door on it. She ended this post saying, \"Once we have spoken our saddest story, we can be free of it\" which was exactly what she was doing with this album.\n\nOnly two hours after \"The Tortured Poets Department\" was released, Swift posted an announcement on her Instagram stating that this album was \"a secret double album.\"\n\nSwift released 15 more tracks in what she called \"The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology.\"\n\nAccompanying the softer, slow songs that were dominant in the initial album, The Anthology has similar themes. The additional 15 songs included tracks such as \"The Black Dog,\" \"So High School,\" \"The Prophecy\" and \"The Manuscript,\" which is the final song of the album. \"The Manuscript\" is clearly indicative of the end of both Swift's album and that chapter of her life, with the final line of the song being \"Now and then I re-read the manuscript, but the story isn't mine anymore.\"\n\nSwift perfectly captures the poetry behind falling in love, heartbreak, ruminating on the past and taking a step forward to conclude those chapters in one's life. \"The Tortured Poets Department\" is another hit album by Swift and it has many of us waiting to see what comes next from her.", "source": {"uri": "uiargonaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Argonaut"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brooklynn_jolley@uiargonaut.com", "name": "Brooklynn Jolley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnight", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fortnight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_and_the_Machine", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florence and the Machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_song", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Love song"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atmosphere"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Slammer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Slammer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibraphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vibraphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profanity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Profanity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dog_(Led_Zeppelin_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Black Dog (Led Zeppelin song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophecy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prophecy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_album", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuscript", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuscript"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthology_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthology series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Poetry"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums_and_Frames", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Albums and Frames", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Crafts/Scrapbooking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Weddings/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.uiargonaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/t-swizzle.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 90, "textEnd": 98}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-05", "textStart": 190, "textEnd": 200}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

(WPRI) -- If you're a Taylor Swift fan, you've probably already listened to her new album \"The Tortured Poets Department\" several times over since she released it last week.\n\nBut you may not have noticed the New England connection that the songstress made in one of her songs.\n\nThe album's final track, \"Clara Bow,\" is named after a silent film actress who got her big break in New Bedford.\n\nThe New Bedford Whaling Museum made the connection between the song and its namesake in a social media post the day Swift's album was released.\n\nClara Bow, more commonly referred to as \"The 'It' Girl,\" rose quickly to stardom at a young age back in the 1920s. She landed her first supporting role at just 16 years old in the silent film \"Down to the Sea in Ships\" -- a silent romantic drama about a 19th-century Massachusetts whaling family.\n\n\"She played this rough-and-tumble actress,\" New Bedford Whaling Museum's Drew Furtado explained. \"She was fighting with the boys in the film, snuck onto a whale boat while out to sea, and was kind of causing a bit of trouble. She was definitely rebellious in the film.\"\n\nHer time in the silent film spotlight was short-lived, however.\n\nBow became quickly overwhelmed by the increasing public scrutiny tied to her rising in popularity. She struggled with her mental health and opted to leave the industry for good in the 1930s.\n\n\"There was a time where Clara Bow ran for political office and she tried to commit suicide,\" Furtado explained. \"She wrote in her journal at the time that she would 'rather be dead then live a public life.' It's a tragedy.

(Getty)\n\nTaylor Swift has explained why she wanted to write a song about Clara Bow, the Roaring Twenties actress and sex symbol who was rumoured to be bisexual.\n\nEver since the music superstar announced The Tortured Poets Department at the Grammy Awards in February, fans have questioned why she wrote a song entitled \"Clara Bow\" - the actress who retired from fame little more than 10 years after appearing in her first film, Beyond The Rainbow, in 1922.\n\nDubbed America's first \"It girl\", Bow was seen as a Hollywood sex symbol who led a life of wild parties and fan adoration - she reportedly received as many as 45,000 fan letters a month. She was one of the few to make the successful transition from silent films to the \"talkies\".\n\nAlthough she eventually settled down with husband, cowboy star Rex Bell, in 1931 and had two children, Bow was largely rumoured to have slept with both men and women beforehand, with some believing she had a fling with lesbian director Dorothy Arzner, who directed Bow in the 1929 silent film The Wild Party.\n\nSwift has now revealed why Bow, who died of a heart attack in 1965, came to mind when she was writing songs for the new album - and it's got nothing to do with Bow's alleged sexuality.\n\nThe track is \"a commentary on what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time,\" she told Amazon Music.\n\n\"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say: 'You know, you remind us of...' then they'd name an artist, and say something disparaging about her, [adding]: 'But you're so much better in this way or that way'.\"\n\nIn the song, Swift sings: \"You look like Clara Bow in this light, remarkable. All your life, did you know you'd be picked like a rose?\"\n\nIn the second verse, she continues: \"You look like Stevie Nicks in '75, the hair and lips. Crowd goes wild at her fingertips, half moonshine, a full eclipse.\"\n\nSwift went on to say: \"That's how we teach women to see themselves, like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you.\n\n\"I picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these archetypes of greatness in the entertainment industry. Clara Bow was the first 'It girl.' Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department, which also features a song that seemingly name-checks queer boygenius singer Lucy Dacus, broke global Spotify streaming records upon its release on Friday (19 April).\n\nIt became the first album to surpass 200 million streams in a single day, beating the record previously held by Swift's 2022 album, Midnights.\n\nIf the record secures the UK number one in the charts on Friday (26 April), Swift will draw level with Madonna for the most number one albums - 12 - by a female artist.", "source": {"uri": "thepinknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marcus_wratten@thepinknews.com", "name": "Marcus Wratten", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_symbol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sex symbol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "It girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaring_Twenties", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roaring Twenties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Hollywood_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classical Hollywood cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bisexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Bell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rex Bell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Arzner", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dorothy Arzner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sound film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cowboy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myocardial infarction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lesbian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boygenius", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boygenius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Nicks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stevie Nicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archetype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Dacus", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucy Dacus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/E-zines", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/E-zines", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://www.thepinknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/MixCollage-07-Feb-2024-02-26-PM-5661.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-19", "textStart": 2640, "textEnd": 2648}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-26", "textStart": 2861, "textEnd": 2869}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

There are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death. 'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say,\" according to Variety.\n\nFurther exploring the album's depth, Swift delved into the track 'Clara Bow,' named after the iconic silent film star. She explained how the song serves as a commentary on the industry's treatment of women, drawing from her own experiences navigating the music world.\n\nAnother standout track, 'Florida!!!' featuring Florence + the Machine, took inspiration from unexpected sources. Swift revealed that the song's genesis stemmed from her fascination with true crime narratives, particularly the phenomenon of individuals seeking reinvention in Florida after committing crimes, as per a report by Variety.\n\nAs the commentary unfolded, Swift peeled back the layers of metaphor within each track, offering listeners a deeper understanding of her lyrical and thematic choices.

Should \"poets\" not have been possessive? If it had been, was the singular or plural more appropriate? Was this a mistake? Or by design? English teachers, grammar hobbyists, and the standards editor of The New York Times weighed in. There is, they said, no intrinsically correct answer -- just one that differs based on the album title's intended meaning. The Tortured Poet's Department, for example, would imply a department belonging to a singular tortured poet, and perhaps her place of work or where one could go to find her. The Tortured Poets' Department would suggest a similar situation, just with all the tortured poets. In omitting the apostrophe altogether, it's the authors themselves who go under the microscope in The Tortured Poets Department -- though perhaps the singular would have been most appropriate.\n\nFew pop stars make their authorial voices as central to their work as Taylor Swift. She broke out in country music, a genre in which storytelling is fundamental. She writes her own songs, which are personal and, increasingly, meta-textual, in the sense that she has begun to tell stories about fame and its inherent self-mythologizing. In the best parts of The Tortured Poets Department, Swift advances this work, writing about herself not just as Taylor Swift the person but as Taylor Swift the performance. \"This town is fake, but you're the real thing,\" coos an industry insider to a young Swift in \"Clara Bow,\" the closing track of the double album's first half. But the Swift who wrote the song knows that \"the real thing\" is itself a sham when the job is telling tales. The Tortured Poets Department is full of its own stories -- of goodbyes and getaways and ghosting -- but its central character is Taylor Swift -- author. And it's consumed by whether or not she is a reliable narrator.\n\nWhat does it mean to write your own life? On \"How Did It End,\" Swift processes a breakup through the need to explain it -- to worried friends and eager gossipers alike -- and sees the story become theirs before she's even figured out the true answer for herself. \"Come one, come all, it's happening again,\" she sings, announcing her own heartbreak. In the first verse, Swift's use of \"we\" as she explores what went wrong seems to include just herself and her former partner. But by the second, the circle extends to friends, then cousins, then people around town. By the end, they've all drawn their conclusions -- despite the fact that Swift herself is still asking the titular question.\n\nPerhaps less subtly, \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart\" underscores that what we see from Swift is often an illusion. \"Lights, camera, bitch, smile -- even if you want to die,\" she sings, over poppy production that evokes the closing numbers of her blockbuster Eras Tour. This song is a statement about an emotionally turbulent period in her life, sure, and you feel for her, but it's also about what it means to be a performer and a professional -- and a good one. \"Try and come for my job,\" Swift says, tossed off, at the end of the track. If you read the separation of the personal and professional selves on the song as healthy, it's really a song about competence. Swift is practically begging her audience to understand that she is vocationally required to put on a show.\n\nIf some stories on The Tortured Poets Department are merely delusive, others are outright dangerous. On \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,\" the most eviscerating track of the album (and possibly of Swift's career), she wonders if an ex who love bombed, then ghosted, her, was a secret assassin or an author writing a tell-all -- with both possibilities presented as equally vicious. On \"The Bolter,\" having \"the best stories\" means having the scar tissue from a collection of bygone relationships. It's a far cheerier song than \"The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived,\" but it still suggests that a collection of tales to share over brunch is not much of a consolation prize.\n\nThe song \"The Albatross,\" an ethereal, if somewhat dozy, tune from the 2 a.m. release, draws a particularly poetic -- and meta-textual -- connection. In it, Swift references the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge's \"The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" in which a sailor on a boat caught off course shoots an albatross that was flying overhead. The ship's crew comes to view the bird as a curse, and forces the mariner to wear its corpse around his neck as a reminder of his bad deed.\n\nIt's an epic poem -- 626 lines long. In its time, it was criticized both for its wordiness and its inscrutability. Some scholars have argued it has no singular moral; others have said it has no moral at all.\n\nIn Tortured Poets, Swift likewise asks a lot of her audience. The album begs a close read and rewards fourth, fifth, sixth, and 16th listens. Many songs have third verses, unusual for pop tune packaging. The double album runs over an Easter egg-packed two hours. Swift has more than enough fans who want to do this homework -- and who feel rewarded by the excavation -- to set streaming record after record. But for those outside her core fan base who don't, it does become somewhat illegible. In the relatively lukewarm critical reception to the album, a main critique is its lack of concision. (Even as someone who enjoys the record, I tend to prefer its clear and declarative moments over its most intricate -- I'll take a line like \"I hope it's shitty in the Black Dog,\" for instance, over the slant rhymes of \"Fresh Out the Slammer.\") An album about the author's own writing suggests some required reading to even make sense of the premise.\n\nThe second half of the double album ends with \"The Manuscript,\" a piano ballad that reads a lot like the story of Swift recording the 10-minute version of \"All Too Well,\" and turning that story into a short film, which she did in 2021. One could read TTPD as a whole as a reference to Swift's need to write to move past events in her life, but \"The Manuscript\" is the only song on the record that tells that story.\n\nAnd the years passed\n\nLike scenes of a show\n\nThe Professor said to write what you know\n\nLookin' backwards\n\nMight be the only way to move forward\n\nThe song ends with Swift shedding herself of the entire ordeal. \"Now and then I reread the manuscript,\" she sings. \"But the story isn't mine anymore.\" Ending on that sentiment feels intentional. It's possible to overthink these things -- I'm reminded of a story the musician and author Michelle Zauner has told about meeting Swift at a Grammys after-party in 2023 and asking her a carefully-constructed question about parallels between her song \"invisible string\" and Ernest Hemingway's writing.\n\n\"OK, English major!\" Swift said, then walked away.\n\nMaybe it's not that deep. Or maybe Swift had had two cosmos and didn't feel like chatting. But it's also possible that history's most personal pop star actually does want some veil of mystery between Taylor Swift and Taylor Swift. She has shared quite a lot over the years, and it's possible to read TTPD as a reflection on what it means to have written your entire life into art and commerce. Sometimes, Swift seems to find that the answer is catharsis. But more often, it sounds like the real person is no match for the storybook version. The pen can heal, she seems to say.

But in between mournful ballads about exes and vengeful shots at her enemies, there is one uplifting, feel-good song. Or at least, that's how it sounds on first listen. On \"Clara Bow,\" Taylor Swift fawns over a \"dazzling\" new starlet proclaiming her \"the real queen.\" The song's final verse caused a lot of chatter online, but now Swift is confirming who the track is really about.\n\nIn the first two verses, Swift imagines conversations with people who compare her to 20th century it-girl Clara Bow and '70s rocker Stevie Nicks, but in the song's final lines, she seems to shift the focus to an up-and-coming pop star who's being compared to her.\n\nYou look like Taylor Swift / In this light / We're loving it. / You've got edge she never did / The future's bright / Dazzling.\n\nThe verse inspired a lot of discourse among fans, who were divided over who Swift might be addressing. Four popular guesses arose: Olivia Rodrigo, Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams, or a combination of all three artists. All three of these rising stars have been seen as mentees of Swift's at one point or another, and can be seen as having an \"edge\" on Swift in certain ways, with Rodrigo diving into a more pop-punk sound and Carpenter embracing sexual jokes as her calling card.\n\nSwift broke down what \"Clara Bow\" is about on Amazon Music.\n\n\"It's a commentary on what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time,\" Swift said. \"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say, 'you know, you remind us of' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'but you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way.'\"\n\nAs Swift explained, much of the song is the singer addressing her younger self from the point of view of record execs. \"That's how we teach women to see themselves, as like you could be the new replacement for this woman who's done something great before you,\" she said. \"I picked women who have done great things in the past and have been these archetypes of greatness in the entertainment industry. Clara Bow was the first 'it-girl.' Stevie Nicks is an icon and an incredible example for anyone who wants to write songs and make music.\"\n\nSo, what about that turn at the end? From Swift's explanation, it sounds like she's not declaring one specific singer the next Taylor Swift, but rather warning all new women in the industry to beware how executives speak to them. Comparisons may be flattering, but they can also be insidious.", "source": {"uri": "elitedaily.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Elite Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Carpenter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sabrina Carpenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracie_Abrams", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gracie Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-punk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop-punk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Rodrigo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Rodrigo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_girl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "It girl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_Nicks", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stevie Nicks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Archetype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Emo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Emo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2024/4/23/af703e7a-f8ae-413b-971b-44a5656458fb-getty-1719490292.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&fm=jpg&fp-x=0.4862&fp-y=0.3008", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 141, "relevance": 1}

The re-recording of \"Reputation\" is the second to last installment in Swift's reclaiming of her first six studio albums after signing a record deal with Republic Records.\n\nSwift began re-recording her albums after record executive Scooter Braun's acquisition and later selling of the singer's first six studio albums, taking away her ability to purchase her own work. Swift was forced to re-record her music because she refused to renew her contract with Big Machine Records Inc., the company Braun had acquired.\n\nAt the 66th Annual Grammy Awards ceremony, Swift announced the release of \"TTPD\" after picking up six awards for her critically acclaimed album \"Midnights.\"Many fans took to social media to claim it was a breakup album, following the end of the singer's six-year-long relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn.\n\nSwift later took to Instagram to clarify that the album was following the stories of \"13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life.\"\n\nHowever, the announcement of the singer's 11th album had many conclude that the new release would give insight into her life following her breakup with Alwyn and into her emotional state throughout her sold-out stadium world tour, \"The Eras Tour.\"\n\nOn the track \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,\" many fans believe/speculate the noises in the background of the song are the singer's in-ear monitors, reflecting the album's timeline.\n\n\"The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night/ I can show you lies/ 'Cause I'm a real tough kid/ I can handle my s***/ They said, 'Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it,' and I did\"sings Swift. Expressing how she is seen by her fans while performing. She also described how in reality, she was struggling with her breakup with Alwyn, which has been speculated to have happened at the beginning of the tour.\n\nThe track \"So Long, London,\" references the song \"London Boy,\" on the singer's 7th album, \"Lover,\" serving as its paradox, closing the curtains to the relationship that brought the singer her love for London. \"So Long London\" describes the end of a relationship and a city forever associated with it.\"For so long, London/ Stitches undone/ Two graves, one gun/ I'll find someone,\" said Swift.\n\nAnother paradox on the album lies in the title of the track \"loml,\" which, according to theories from her fans, Swift uses to signify her many emotions following her breakup from Alwyn, the title serving both as an acronym for the phrase \"love of my life\" and \"loss of my life.\"\n\n\"If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary/ What we thought was for all time was momentary,\" Swift sings, describing how what she saw as forever wasn't as important or long-lasting as she had hoped.\n\nThe singer seemingly uses this album to describe her brief fling with The 1975's frontman, Matty Healy, whom she dated shortly after breaking up with Alwyn. Fans have taken to TikTok and X, formerly known as Twitter, to express how, on the title track of the album, Swift describes someone who uses a typewriter, which Healy is stylistically known for using.\n\nAlthough it is unclear who the singer refers to on the track \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" the singer references a partner. She describes herself as a doll metaphorically for her place in their relationship. \"I know I'm just repeating mys\u0435lf/ Put me back on my shelf/ But first, pull the string,\" Swift sings over a drum-reliant beat, reminiscent of her sound in her 5th studio album, \"1989.\"\n\n\"TTPD,\" the album's namesake, showcases the singer's ability to powerfully express her feelings during what she describes as one of the 'hardest things' she's experienced through story-telling, but also through her ability to be, simply, a poet.\n\nSwift collaborates with two other musicians on \"TTPD\" -- Post Malone and Florence + The Machine -- both of whom she has been longtime friends with. Swift also works with Jack Antonoff, a producer she has worked alongside on various projects, including \"Reputation\" and sister albums Folklore and Evermore.\n\nThe album's first trackfeatures singer, Post Malone, who has recently been undergoing a transition to the country music genre.\n\nTheir song, \"Fortnight,\" is the only one on the album so far that has its own music video. Swift uses the music video to showcase the imagery of insanity reflected in the lyrics, by depicting herself in a mental health facility. The music video for the song also features surprise cameos from Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles, who both starred in the movie \"Dead Poets Society,\" which has been speculated to have inspired the album's title.\n\nThe second collaboration on the album is with Florence Welch, titled \"Florida!!!\" The song seemingly refers to Swift's tour stops in Florida in 2023, the first tour stops after her breakup with Alwyn.\n\n\"I need to forget, so take me to Florida/I've got some regrets/ I'll bury them in Florida,\" Swift sings alongside Welch, describing Florida as an escape, a place where she can simply forget and leave behind her problems. The song is co-written by actress Emma Stone, another of Swift's longtime friends.\n\nThe singer also uses this album to refer to her public image through the track \"Who's Afraid of Little Old Me.\" The singer appears to use the title to refer to how the media tries to downsize her, whether through the lawsuit she was involved in with Ticketmaster or peoples' questioning of her relationship with football star Travis Kelce.\n\nSwift responds to peoples' questioning of her actions and publicization of her personal life in the song \"Clara Bow,\" which references 1920's actress Clara Bow, whose rise to fame led to her being known as the world's first \"It Girl,\" which allowed tabloids to speculate closely on her personal life, as well as unveiling her romantic life for the world to know.",

The international pop sensation, who was recently confirmed to be related to poet Emily Dickinson, seamlessly incorporates poetry, symbolism, and wordplay into her songs.\n\nHer recent literary-themed album, The Tortured Poet's Department, is no different.\n\nHence, with the album's premiere on April 19, 2024, the multi-Grammy winner broke down some of her lyrics in a special commentary.\n\nHere are some of her songs she explored per various commentaries via People Magazine.\n\nThe opening track of the record, Swift told Amazon Music that the Fortnight \"exhibits a lot of the common themes that run throughout this album,\" particularly \"fatalism - longing, pining away, lost dreams.\"\n\nShe also shared in her iHeartRadio commentary that she \"always imagined that it took place in this, like, American town where the American Dream you thought would happen to you didn't.\"\n\nReflecting on the theme of Florida!!!, Swift explained, \"I think I was coming up with this idea of like, what happens when your life doesn't fit, or your choices you've made catch up to you, and you're surrounded by these harsh consequences and judgment, and circumstances did not lead you to where you thought you'd be, and you just want to escape from everything you've ever known, is there a place you could go?\"\n\nSwift explained that My Boy Only breaks His Favorite Toys is written \"from the perspective of a child's toy.\"\n\nFor Swift, the song reflects the feeling of \"being somebody's favorite toy until they break you and then don't want to play with you anymore -- which is how a lot of us are in relationships where we are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind.\"", "source": {"uri": "thenews.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The News International"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Word play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Symbol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Poetry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poet", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Poet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emily Dickinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHeartRadio", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IHeartRadio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Dream"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Quotations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.thenews.com.pk/assets/uploads/updates/2024-04-23/l_1181536_111349_updates.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-04-", "textStart": 491, "textEnd": 499}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

We put them through hell. We watch what they create, then we judge it. We love to watch artists in pain, often to the point where I think sometimes as a society we provoke that pain and we just watch what happens,\" said Taylor.\n\nTaylor said the track Who's Afraid of Little Old Me is the most reflective of the above idea. She wrote the tune \"alone, sitting at the piano in one of those moments when I felt bitter about just all the things we do to our artists as a society and as a culture.\"\n\nTaylor said the song talks about how some of us are like in relationships: boy toys. \"We are so valued by a person in the beginning, and then all of the sudden, they break us or they devalue us in their mind.\" Swifties have been speculating that the album is in reference to Taylor's troubled relationship with British actor Joe Alwyn, which ended a year ago.\n\nTaylor says Fortnight, her collaboration with Post Malone, has the \"fatalistic\" essence of the album. \"There are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death. 'I love you, it's ruining my life.' These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say. It's that kind of album,\" she said.\n\nTaylor said that while watching the American show Dateline, she realised how people yearn to make a new identity for themselves post a breakup. \"There's a part of you that thinks, 'I want a new name. I want a new life. I don't want anyone to know where I've been or know me at all.' And so that was the jumping off point. Where would you go to reinvent yourself and blend in? Florida!\"\n\nNamed after the renowned 1920s Hollywood actor, the song talks about the regressive idea of measuring a woman artist's achievement by telling her which other woman artist she's \"replaced.\" \"I used to sit in record labels trying to get a record deal when I was a little kid. And they'd say, 'you know, you remind us of' and then they'd name an artist, and then they'd kind of say something disparaging about her, 'but you're this, you're so much better in this way or that way,'\" Taylor explained.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Me_(5_Seconds_of_Summer_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Old Me (5 Seconds of Summer song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fatalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortnight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fortnight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Alwyn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Alwyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline_NBC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dateline NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_label", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record label"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/04/23/1600x900/ttpd_1713849652442_1713849673901.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

\"Little did you know your home's really only a town you're just a guest in / So you work your life away just to pay for a time-share down in Destin.\"\n\nWelch joins her on the chorus before easing

Florida!\" she concluded.\n\nWelch posted a snippet from the song on her Instagram the day of Swift's album release.\n\n\"Me and my ghosts we had a hell of a time,\" Welch said in the caption.\n\nShe added, \"Honoured to be in this department.\"\n\nSwifties have shared Spotify canvas videos on X of Swift filming Welch as she recorded her vocals for \"\"Florida!!!\"\n\nThe \"TTPD\" chairman turns the camera to show her making an excited face before the clip ends.\n\nTheir voices pair well on the haunting track. Swift paints the scene in the first verse, describing a woman who is ready to flee her hometown. \"And this city reeks of driving myself crazy,\" she says.\n\nAs the pre-chorus begins, she continues, \"Little did you know your home's really only a town you're just a guest in / So you work your life away just to pay for a time-share down in Destin.\"\n\nWelch joins her on the chorus before easing into her solo verse. \"Well, me and my ghosts, w\u0435 had a hell of a time / Yes, I'm haunt\u0435d, but I'm feeling just fine / All my girls got their lace and their crimes / And your cheating husband disappeared, well / No one asks any questions here,\" she ominously says, like a person of interest in an episode of \"Dateline.\"\n\nIn the lengthy bridge, the musicians talk about forgetting their past regrets and leaving everything behind for Florida.\n\nAlthough \"Florida!!!\" is a standalone track in terms of sound and subject on the album, the Sunshine State is also referenced in the lead single \"Fortnight\" with Post Malone, the only other featured artist on \"TTPD.\"\n\nRead the rest of the cinematic lyrics from \"Florida!!!\" below.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType":

Fans enjoy the Easter eggs just as much as the songs themselves.\n\nWhile mentions of ex-boyfriends and frenemies are easier to pinpoint, sometimes it takes a history lesson to understand Swift's references.\n\nI'm looking at you, \"Clara Bow.\"\n\nAfter watching the music video for the album's first single, \"Fortnight,\" I came up with a theory.\n\nDid Taylor Swift take inspiration from infamous Massachusetts resident Lizzie Borden for her latest single?\n\nI think so.\n\nThanks to Amazon Music, Swifties can listen to their idol give insight into each track from the Tortured Poets Department. Fans simply have to say to Alexa, \"I'm a member of the 'The Tortured Poets Department,\" and they will be treated to the new album accompanied by commentary from Swift.\n\nThe singer gives insight into several tracks, one being \"Fortnight\" with Post Malone.\n\n'Fortnight' is a song that exhibits a lot of common themes that run throughout the album. One of them being fatalism - longing, pining away, lost dreams. I think that it's a very fatalistic album in that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death.\n\nREAD MORE: Taylor Swift Fans React to 'The Tortured Poets Department'\n\nLizzie Borden knows a thing or two about life and death. She will always be remembered as the woman who was tried and acquitted of the 1892 hatchet murders of her father and stepmother in Fall River.\n\nREAD MORE: New England's Oldest Pet Cemetery Holds Lizzie Borden's Beloved Dogs\n\nThe late 19th century was years ahead of Instagram, so there are only a handful of known photographs of Borden, but in each one, she can be seen in elaborate Victorian gowns with wide-set bangs and well-kept curls.\n\nWhen I watched the music video for \"Fortnight\" and saw Swift sitting behind her typewriter in an extravagant black dress, I immediately thought of Lizzie.\n\nThen, I looked closer at the lyrics: \"I want to kill him\" and \"I want to kill her.\"\n\nBorden was certainly accused of killing a \"her\" and a \"him.\" While she was never institutionalized the way Swift was in the music video, history shows that Borden thought about it.\n\nWhile awaiting trial in a Taunton jail cell, she once wrote to a friend saying, \"I think soon they can take me up the road, to the insane asylum.\"\n\nThat sounds eerily similar to Swift's lyrics, \"I was supposed to be sent away / But they forgot to come and get me.\"\n\nBorden was 32 when she was accused of the crimes. Swift turned 34 in December 2023.\n\nI'll let you be the judge of the correlation, but if Swift took the time to learn more about actress Clara Bow, who famously got her start in a film set in New Bedford, it's not all that crazy to think her research brought her to Fall River and Lizzie Borden.", "source": {"uri": "fun107.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FUN 107"}, "authors": [{"uri": "maddie_levine@fun107.com", "name": "Maddie Levine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lizzie_Borden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lizzie Borden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Alexa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hatchet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borden_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Borden County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Borden County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typewriter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Typewriter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Victorian era"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taunton,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Taunton, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Taunton, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Bedford,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Bedford, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Bedford, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_River,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fall River, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fall River, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Emo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Emo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/519/files/2024/04/attachment-Untitled-design-2024-04-23T072630.471.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

People have these crimes that they commit; where do they immediately skip town and go to? They go to Florida.'\n\n'They try to reinvent themselves, have a new identity, blend in.

I think that it's a very fatalistic album in that there are lots of very dramatic lines about life or death.'\n\n'\"I love you, it's ruining my life.\" These are very hyperbolic, dramatic things to say. It's that kind of album.'\n\nShe also delved into other tracks and their meaning, including Who's Afraid Of Little Old Me?, My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys, Down Bad and Clara Bow - which she said was written 'as a commentary on what I've seen in the industry that I've been in over time.'\n\nOther records TTPD has broken include the star having the biggest first-week sales to date, per Billboard.\n\nThe LP also became Spotify's most pre-saved countdown and she broke her own record of single-week vinyl sales.\n\nShe also talked about Fortnight featuring Post Malone - which became Spotify's most-streamed song in a single day\n\nEarlier last week on April 19, Swift notably dropped the music video for Fortnight, with not only Post Malone making an appearance, but also Dead Poets Society stars Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles\n\nOn Spotify, TTPD also became the most-streamed album in a single day with over a whopping 300 million streams.\n\nEarlier last week on April 19, Swift notably dropped the music video for Fortnight, with not only Post Malone making an appearance, but also Dead Poets Society stars Ethan Hawke and Josh Charles.\n\nNot long after the music video released on Friday, Taylor took to her main Instagram page to share a series of behind-the-scenes images.\n\nShe also shared a message to her fans about the meaning behind the music video and penned, 'When I was writing the Fortnight music video, I wanted to show you the worlds I saw in my head that served as the backdrop for making this music.'\n\n'Pretty much everything in it is a metaphor or a reference to one corner of the album or another.

When Swift surprise-announced her eleventh studio album while accepting the gramophone for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, the internet was set ablaze with questions on what this album would sound like and whom it would be about. After a very public breakup with actor Joe Alwyn, a quick blip with The 1975 frontman Matty Healy, and a love story with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, there seemed to be a lot of fodder Swift could pull from. However, with her red lips as zipped as ever, Swift left most to the imagination, dropping a few hints here and there, and completely building overwhelming anticipation for what is set to be the biggest album release of the year (it quickly became the most-streamed album in a single day n Spotify history).\n\nNow, some of the speculation has been put to rest. And yes, the Easter eggs did lead fans in the right direction: it was a double album. An additional 15 tracks arrived at 2 A.M. on release night, bringing the grand total to 31 tracks and 2 hours and five minutes of Swiftian lore. Here, two editors and Taylor Swift fans head into The Tortured Poets Department to discuss the album.\n\nSelena Schorken: My immediate first thought was just, I'm devastated for her. It is so heartbreaking and so sad. She's willing to go there, she's willing to pull back the curtain and show us the rawest most vulnerable moments in her life. That's why we love Taylor. Even though she feels like she's talking about something so specific in her life, there's so many people that have related to that exact thing. I'm still processing all of the melodies, but there were lyrics that made me go, \"Oh!\" right off the bat.\n\nSamuel Maude: One of my biggest fears is that an artist I adore drops an album I don't like, and I don't really love \"Fortnight\" with Post Malone. I think it is a fine song, but it wasn't 100 percent for me. So to start, I was very nervous. When we got to \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys,\" I was finally in and got it. It feels like a project for her. There are songs that are really relatable, but these songs feel very unique to her experience, in a way that we haven't heard from Taylor before. This is possibly her most personal album ever.\n\nSam: So to be clear, we're talking before the music video has been released. Do you think this is the right lead single?\n\nSam: I think Taylor Swift picks singles for herself. Sometimes, it really works. Sometimes, it really doesn't. I think \"Anti-Hero\" was the perfect lead single for Midnights. I think \"Cardigan\" was a great lead single for Folklore, and \"Willow\" was a great lead single for Evermore. Then for Lover I think she picked \"ME!\" for her. In Miss Americana, [the documentary about Swift] it looked like she had the most fun writing that song in the studio. She wanted the first song to be a celebration.\n\n[\"Fortnight\"] is not my favorite song at all on this album, but she is making a Frankenstein reference, and I think she's trying to position herself as this well-versed literary human who knows about classics. I think it makes sense to pick a song that has very intense allusions and has Post Malone on it, who people love.\n\nSelena: What would you have picked?\n\nSam: I think \"My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys.\" What would you have picked?\n\nSelena: Probably the title track.\n\nSelena: I was up at midnight to listen to the whole first chunk. Right around 1 A.M., a friend texted me about the countdown [on Taylor's Instagram]. I thought, I might as well stay up if it's another 30 minutes or so, I can make it. I was so tired. She had us up until 2:30 in the morning. Insanity.\n\nSam: I wasn't actually going to stay up, but I was texting two Swiftie friends, and they started to give me hell for not staying up until midnight. So I somehow stayed awake. My roommate, who did a listening session with a few friends, knocked on my door at 2:05 A.M. He was like, \"There's 15 more songs.\" I went to bed. I feel geriatric. Can we please move album releases to 8 P.M.?\n\nSelena: The thing is, though, I do feel like the collective experience is part of a Taylor drop. The reason why it's so fun to be a Swiftie is because all of us are unhinged, and so we are all willing to jump. We're going to stay up until 2:30 in the morning to listen, because this is our Super Bowl.\n\nSam: I totally agree. Taylor Swift has created this community of fans who really love to celebrate together. I think of all of the YouTube channels or TikToks I see of people listening to an album for the first time together. It's special. People love to dissect the lyrics with their friends. They love to get lost in a song together. I was alone last night, but I know a lot of people who weren't. That's cool.\n\nI do think she could have done kind of a Folklore/Evermore moment. She could have released part two down the line. Thinking as a business person, she could have sold a whole other string of vinyls and merch. They could have been sister albums again. So, I've been really racking my brain on this drop. It didn't feel like the Midnights 3 A.M. drop, where it was seven extra songs. This was a whole other album that felt a little different to me.\n\nSelena: If the first part is 1989/Folklore, the second part felt much more Folklore/Evermore.\n\nSam: 100 percent. My theory is that it was personal. She wanted to close this chapter, which is so clear with the last song being \"The Manuscript,\" where she alludes to wanting to stop talking about this. Matty, Joe. It's done. I'm done. If she split this into two album cycles, that would be tough.\n\nWe haven't had a true Taylor Swift breakup album in so long, because she was with Joe, or at least we thought. Maybe she was like, 'Okay, let me write the breakup album. Let me write about Matty, too. And then let's move on to happiness. Let's move on to me.' That's really special.\n\nSam: I think it's one of the best songs on the album. This song felt very Florence + The Machine. It felt like \"King\" or \"Free\" from Dance Fever. I love a moment where I feel like the music is screaming.\n\nSelena: I'm a massive Florence + The Machine fan. I've been waiting with bated breath for this one. Honestly, just the drums, that's probably my favorite little thing about Florence + The Machine, their drum buildup. You just want to be in your car, fist bumping in the air. Is it my favorite Taylor collaboration ever? That might be too bold to say, but I'm very content with it.\n\nSelena: I was so sad. Instant depression, that was my first thought. It's beautiful though, and the amount of times that she talks about marriage and babies, and all of these hopes and dreams that she had for this relationship, it wrecked me. I can't imagine that many years with someone and then they either don't put in the effort or something goes wrong. It is so crushing.\n\nShe also said, \"It was legendary, it was momentary.\" That was really beautiful to me, to acknowledge the weight of a relationship that lasts that many years while also realizing in the grand scheme of life, it's just a momentary chapter in her larger story.\n\nSam: I think Taylor's so good at weaving in these gorgeous piano ballads into sometimes a very produced album. It worked.\n\nSelena: She gets into the chorus, and I'm just like, \"This girl is too funny.\" She's saying what we're all thinking: \"I'm so depressed. I act like it's my birthday every day.\" I just sat there thinking, This is for all of us anxious overachievers that are still very capable at putting on a happy face. There have been so many times in my life in which, behind the scenes, I'm in the trenches. But, I'm also experiencing some of the happiest, most fun times in my life simultaneously. You have to find that balance of grief for your pain and the shiny parts of your life. You're going to listen to this song on your way to work and think: I can do this. I can face this.\n\nSelena: I can't imagine that she would [add this to the Eras Tour], given that it's already a three and a half hour show. I would be sad for any fan that has one thing on the Eras Tour that they're looking forward to, and it gets cut. Maybe I can see her doing some of these as surprise songs or adding two songs to the permanent set list in some capacity. But you know what? I would not be shocked if she did not tour this. It seems like she wants to close this chapter of her life. She needed this emotional release and she needed to get it out of her system. It was a cathartic experience.\n\nSam: I disagree actually. I think she's going to cut stuff and add stuff. I don't think she can make this tour longer. Now that everyone can see the tour film on Disney+, she can change it for Europe. I think she'll like tour specifically Lover, Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights to their fullest extent because she hasn't toured those in Europe yet, but I'm curious if something's going to happen during that first show where there's this song cut and then at some point, it's going to be the Tortured Poets Department.\n\nI also think we know Taylor loves a deluxe album, and so I think there are more The Tortured Poets Department songs. I think there's five more songs or remixes that are going to drop on a deluxe album of this. Like The Called Into the Office version or something.\n\nSelena: Even though I'm a massive Swiftie, I'd love to see her take a momentary break and enjoy her life. I am secondhand exhausted for her. I would love for her to just have the space to be herself.\n\nSam: But, can she really stop writing music? Is this just a part of her? I really do think of Taylor as a little tortured. She talks about how she has voice notes of things she's thinking about in the middle of the night. Midnights is about essentially sleepless nights. I think a lot of the best artists in the world have talked about how they feel like a little haunted, and I don't see a world in which Taylor Swift could actually and realistically take a break.\n\nSelena: Yeah, I don't know if she'd want to take a break. That's what makes her such an excellent artist. Whether she was getting paid millions of dollars to do it or not, she would always be writing music on her phone, jotting down notes. She would always be putting pieces together and writing a story. She has so much space to explore writing in other capacities. Whether she trickles into writing scripts or writing books, whatever that looks like, I think she's a true artist to her core. Stopping that flow of writing would never really happen for someone like her.\n\nSelena: The second I heard \"touch down,\" I was like...girl.\n\nSam: I mean come on. My family is huge Kansas City Chiefs fans, and my dad is historically a Taylor Swift hater. But in this moment, the Chiefs, Travis Kelce, and Taylor Swift have actually brought my family together. My dad thinks Taylor might be their good luck charm. He's like, \"As long as the Chiefs are winning, I have to be a fan.\" It's united my family. I will always be a fan of the Kelce-Swift relationship; it softens our family dynamics.\n\nSelena: I love listening to these ones about Travis because for as serious as she is and as sad as the album is, she just reminds us that those giddy feelings are also important and not too girlish.\n\nSelena: I feel like this era doesn't necessarily feel aesthetically or sonically catered to my personal music taste. In terms of lyricism, this ranks really high for me due to her vulnerability and the access that she's giving. The rawness, the emotions. Lyrically, I feel like I have to put it slightly above Folklore only because it's more personal. This isn't some story about a high schooler or some made-up thing. This is her. It's the craftsmanship of Folklore, but the personal Taylor Swift that we've always known in that.\n\nSam: This is going to rank in the middle of my Taylor album rankings. I like this album, I can jam out, but, it is very long, even the songs. In this age of music, where songs are sometimes two minutes, which I also think is a little rotted, it's unheard of to have an album where most of the songs are four minutes plus. You were sitting in a song for a while, so when she added 15 more songs and the album became a two-hour album, I got a little lost in the middle. I'm very excited we're having long albums and songs, because a two minute song is sometimes very upsetting, but this felt a little muddy. In the second part, all of the songs began blending together.\n\nThis album feels almost so personal to her that I haven't fully related so much to it yet. There are songs I do want to put on repeat. But, I didn't have the same reaction to it that I had when I first listened to Reputation or Midnights.\n\nSelena: Maybe I'm just too tired to process, but it did feel like there's maybe five songs in the first chunk that this morning I thought: Let me go listen to these again, because I really liked those. Then in the second chunk, for 50 percent I was like, \"Which song was that?\"\n\nSam: I think it's just a symptom of it being long. When you release an album that's this big and don't edit it down, it can be overwhelming. It's going to take me months to be able to identify all of the songs.\n\nSam: Those capital letters on \"thanK you aIMee\" are...interesting.\n\nPerhaps one of Taylor's strongest themes throughout all of her music is revenge. She's not afraid to call people out or make music that makes people probably go into a bunker. That said, the capitalization of the three letters with this song was a big \"Whoa!\" to me. It's one of the most direct call-outs we've seen from Taylor.\n\nShe is unafraid. She's taking risks with her lyrics on this record. People on the internet have thought some of the lyrics were bad, that they're a little try-hard. She's labeling herself the chairman of the Tortured Poets Department. She's opening herself up to that criticism. I think the best artists have the harshest critics, especially poets.\n\nWhat she's doing here that's really cool is that she's saying screw you all. She's not afraid to be cheesy or weird or have a lyric that's just a miss. She says her own name in \"Clara Bow.\" She calls out her fans a little bit in \"But Daddy, I Love Him.\" We haven't seen that before. Also calling her fans daddy? As a gay man, I was like, \"Yes, thank you.\" Anyway, she wasn't afraid to go there. She wasn't afraid to take risks. It's hot.\n\nSelena: I agree. In her earlier albums, she used to capitalize letters to send secret messages. With \"thanK you alMee,\" for her to spell it out in a song title? It's fearless and unapologetic. She didn't want speculating or some ambiguous headline. She was like, \"I'm telling you, it is about K-I-M.\"\n\nSam: Spelling really is fun.\n\nSelena: She's shedding a lot of expectations and a lot of layers. There's this release through all of the stages of heartbreak, devastation, and grief. We are experiencing this Taylor Swift as what she feels is her true self. She's gotten to this age where she feels secure enough that she doesn't have to hide. She can be sad, excited, giddy, all of these things, and share them all with us.", "source": {"uri": "elle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ELLE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnights", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midnights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evermore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Evermore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folklore_(Taylor_Swift_album)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Folklore (Taylor Swift album)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jonathan Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_single", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lead single"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selena", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Selena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Malone", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Post Malone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_and_the_Machine", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florence and the Machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Toy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Hero_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-Hero (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matty_Healy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matty Healy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willow (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardigan_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cardigan (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me!", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Me!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award_for_Best_Pop_Vocal_Album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_album", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Double album"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americana_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Americana (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frankenstein"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phonograph"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Music video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Alwyn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Alwyn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clara Bow"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-ttpd-the-black-dog-6622de06efdaa.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.502xh;0,0.146xh&resize=640:*", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9501988", "eventUri": "eng-9501988", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

The Tortured Poets Department is a great album. Her last release, Midnights, was just nice. But dynamo Taylor did it. This is her career best musically and vocally because she is wild, angry, fiercely defiant, just like every woman with a broken heart.\n\nAriana Grande did it with her latest release Eternal Sunshine. I mean she cleared out the emotional baggage left by her divorce from Dalton Gomez using her music with a breakup album. And now here comes Taylor Swift with her own breakup album, The Tortured Poets Department, which is said to be songs about the breakup of her six-year relationship with the British actor and musician Joe Alwyn.\n\nNow Taylor has always been open about having composed songs about her exes, like for Jake Gyllenhaal, The Moment I Knew and for Joe Jonas, Forever and Always and others. So, is The Tortured Poets Department indeed about Alwyn? He must have been extra special to rate not just a song or two but an entire album.\n\nOr maybe Taylor was just putting down her being broken hearted in songs and making a windfall out of it. Remember she makes windfalls out of everything which is why she is a billionaire. Well, nothing also new about broken-hearted songs. These songs sell a lot. Frank Sinatra built his career on those, I'm a Fool to Want You and In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning. And so here is the Taylor version.\n\nSurprise! The Tortured Poets Department is a great album. I was not expecting this. Her last release, Midnights was just nice. I really thought her magic was beginning to wane. Besides, there was her ERAs Tour, all those re-recordings of her oldies for the Taylor Version, plus that breakup. But dynamo Taylor did it. I say this is her career best musically and vocally because she is wild, angry, fiercely defiant just like every woman with a broken heart. And oh, she sounds so endearing navigating words about painful emotions with a sigh or a little catch in her throat.\n\nThere are sixteen tracks written and produced with her usual collaborators, Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner of The National. Fan favorites are now making themselves felt like the charming Fortnight featuring Post Malone and Down Bad, which rationalizes being in love or the oh so real, I Can Do It with a Broken Heart, which I am sure every woman can relate to. Think although she does it in jampacked arenas, we do have the same feelings while in the throes of a broken heart.\n\nAnd this brings me to a \"why did I not think about that\" moment with The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived. Taylor is wildly angry and has created music to match. I think breaking dishes would be appropriate in the soundtrack. And then she winds down and it is with the gloriously beautiful So Long London. Here is bye-bye love and see you again London said to the accompaniment of church bells or is that Taylor singing?\n\nNo matter. I think that with The Tortured Poets Department, Taylor has opened the door to a new era of creativity that will keep her on top for another decade or more.\n\nAnd now a look at this week's Top 25 titles from Spotify's Top 50 Philippines Playlist before the songs from The Tortured Poets Department take over.

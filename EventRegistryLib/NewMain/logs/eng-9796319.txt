Nick has covered the San Francisco 49ers and the NFL at ESPN since 2016, having previously covered the St. Louis Rams for 12 years, including three years (2013 to 2015) at ESPN. In his 10 years with the company, Nick has led ESPN's coverage of the Niners' 2019 Super Bowl run, Colin Kaepernick's protest, the Rams making Michael Sam the first openly gay player drafted to the NFL, Sam's subsequent pursuit of a roster spot and the team's relocation and stadium saga. You can follow Nick via Twitter @nwagoner\n\nAfter an offseason full of back and forth, the San Francisco 49ers are now willing to listen to trade offers for Brandon Aiyuk and have given the star wide receiver permission to negotiate a contract with other teams.\n\nIt represents a significant change for the 49ers, who did not have the same willingness to listen to trade offers at the start of training camp.\n\n49ers coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed Tuesday that Aiyuk has permission to negotiate with other teams but said there's still a scenario where a deal gets done to keep Aiyuk in San Francisco.\n\n\"It's been at this point for a little bit, so nothing really new to me,\" Shanahan said. \"You're always disappointed when you can't keep hold of all your players or it's not going exactly right. I don't like losing anybody, so that's why I'm hoping it does work out here. But right now, we don't have that solved yet. I hope it does.\"\n\nThe New England Patriots, Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers have been in contact with the Niners and are interested in trading for Aiyuk, sources told ESPN.\n\nThe Steelers' talks with the 49ers had been stalled as of Monday night, but the teams reengaged in trade discussions Tuesday in an ever-fluid situation that still involves other teams as well, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\nThe Patriots have been attempting to acquire Aiyuk for months, and it has been a slow process from their side, according to sources. New England is willing to make Aiyuk one of the top five highest-paid wide receivers in the NFL in terms of average salary per year, according to a source.\n\nPatriots first-year head coach Jerod Mayo wouldn't confirm that the Patriots have been granted permission to negotiate with Aiyuk, but did acknowledge that he spoke with current New England receiver Kendrick Bourne, because Bourne's name has surfaced in reports as someone who could be included in a potential trade.\n\n\"It was a good conversation. Once again, I feel like the story is so much further along than anything else,\" Mayo said Tuesday before the Patriots' practice. \"I just wanted to make sure we cleared the air. I do believe in being transparent with the players and really setting those guys at ease.\"\n\nWhen asked about reports linking the Browns to Aiyuk and whether he is a player who could help Cleveland, coach Kevin Stefanski said, \"I don't really get into reports or speculate ... I'm really just focused on today and practice.\"\n\nStefanski also said he would keep private any conversations he's had with wide receiver Amari Cooper, whose name has been floated in a hypothetical deal for Aiyuk.\n\nThe situation could lead to several outcomes, including Aiyuk staying with the 49ers and playing out the fifth-year option on his rookie deal that would pay him $14.124 million, sources said. Other teams are willing to pay Aiyuk more than twice as much, but he has balked so far at multiple offers, according to sources.\n\nThe 49ers also have to be comfortable with any trade compensation, and sources told ESPN that the reigning NFC champions are willing to keep Aiyuk.\n\nThroughout the Aiyuk saga, which has involved plenty of pushback from Aiyuk using social media and culminating in an official trade request at the start of camp, the Niners have been adamant about not wanting to hurt their chances of winning the Super Bowl this year.\n\nThe idea of trading Aiyuk, who was a second team All-Pro and the team's best receiver in 2023, would almost certainly do that unless San Francisco gets an impactful player or two in return. A source told ESPN on Tuesday that interested teams have been more willing to talk about including players and picks, which has helped the Niners become more open to a deal in the past couple of weeks.\n\nAiyuk was at the 49ers' facility Tuesday but did not participate in practice as he continued his \"hold in.\" Through the team's first 11 practices of training camp, Aiyuk has often been spotted watching practice from the sideline but that hasn't happened the past couple of sessions. He has, however, been attending meetings and participating regularly in those.\n\n\"Brandon's a great player so it's real hard to be better when you lose a great player,\" Shanahan said. \"We've got to look into anything. We've got to understand the situation we're in, what that looks like and it does take time so hopefully it'll all work out the best for him and the best for us in the long run.\"\n\nThe 49ers listened to offers for Aiyuk before and during April's NFL draft but rebuffed those offers because they wouldn't get enough in return. Since then, the league's wide receiver market has exploded with multiple top wideouts -- including Justin Jefferson, A.J. Brown, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jaylen Waddle and others -- signing lucrative long-term extensions.\n\nOnce the draft passed, the Niners shut down Aiyuk trade discussions in part because of their Super Bowl aspirations this season. The idea of trading Aiyuk for draft picks in 2025 and beyond would not help attain that goal. Niners defensive end Nick Bosa said Tuesday that trading Aiyuk at all would make it that much more difficult.\n\n\"I think it would be huge [to lose him],\" Bosa said. \"I trust John [Lynch] and Kyle but he's a very tough player to replace.\"\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area reported late Monday night that the 49ers have \"negotiated the framework of trades\" that would send Aiyuk to the Patriots or Browns.\n\nAiyuk, 26, reported for the 49ers' training camp but has not practiced as he seeks a new deal.\n\nThe Patriots' lengthy pursuit of Aiyuk traces back to February, when executive vice president of player personnel Eliot Wolf shared his hope to \"weaponize the offense.\" The Patriots selected Drake Maye with the No. 3 overall pick in the draft, and one of their goals has been to surround the former North Carolina quarterback with more talent to aid in his development.\n\nNew England attempted in March to sign free agent wide receiver Calvin Ridley, who ultimately landed with the Tennessee Titans on a four-year, $92 million deal.", "source": {"uri": "africa.espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If not, Aiyuk might end up staying in San Francisco whether with a new contract or on a fifth-year option.\n\nFor now, the situation remains status quo despite swirling rumors about Aiyuk's status.\n\n\"I'm not going any specifics with offers, contracts, trades, anything like that. But what I can tell you guys is nothing has changed,\" coach Kyle Shanahan said Tuesday. \"A lot was out yesterday and stuff, but from the situation that we're in with Brandon, nothing's changed.\"\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area reported Monday night that the Niners have agreed to potential deals with Cleveland and New England that could happen if Aiyuk was willing to agree to a long-term deal with those teams.\n\nAiyuk reportedly would prefer a deal with Pittsburgh but the Steelers would also have to meet the 49ers asking price for one of their top players.\n\nShanahan said he doesn't expect a resolution to be imminent.\n\n\"You always want it to be. Badly,\" he said. \"But this stuff does take time. Every day I hope it gets resolved. But I have no timetable on it. It didn't surprise me coming into this. ... Hopefully it will get resolved sooner than later.\"\n\nRelated Story: 49ers QB Brock Purdy Shows Benefits of Healthy Offseason Early in Training Camp\n\nAiyuk skipped the entire offseason program, including a mandatory minicamp in June, as he waited for a lucrative extension to replace the fifth-year option on his rookie deal.\n\nHe reported to training camp in late July after making a trade request but has refused to practice. He is attending team meetings and is not being fined.\n\nAiyuk had been set to play on the fifth-year option worth about $14.1 million this season and wanted San Francisco to make him the latest receiver to cash in with a long-term deal. Ten receivers before Aiyuk had signed contracts worth at least $70 million already this offseason with Justin Jefferson's four-year, $140 million extension with Minnesota setting the top of the market.\n\nRelated Story: Joshua Dobbs Seeks Stability With 49ers After Wild 2023 Season\n\nAiyuk had been a key part of San Francisco's offense last season as he formed a great connection with quarterback Brock Purdy. Aiyuk had 75 catches and a career-high 1,375 yards last season with seven touchdowns as he earned second-team All-Pro honors.\n\nHis absence would be hard to overcome if San Francisco has designs on getting back to the Super Bowl and winning it this upcoming season.\n\n\"Brandon's a great player,\" Shanahan said. \"It's real hard to be better when you lose a great player.

San Francisco had handed out megadeals the past four offseasons to George Kittle, Fred Warner, Deebo Samuel and Nick Bosa.\n\nThose weren't easy negotiations but Warner's pushed into training camp with Samuel missing a few practices in 2022 and Bosa not signing until less than a week before the opener last season.\n\nBosa described the process as \"brutal\" and said he had doubts it would end with a new contract at times last summer.\n\n\"As it got closer and closer (to the season), it gets pretty dicey,\" Bosa said. \"But I definitely didn't want to be traded. It's a good place to be. I'm very thankful and grateful to be paid and here, because I don't think there are many other organizations that are as good as this one.\"\n\nThe 49ers are also without another of their top offensive players with All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams holding out of camp in search of an improved contract. Shanahan had no updates on Williams' status and said he hopes \"that gets resolved as soon as possible too.\"\n\nNOTES: RB Christian McCaffrey strained his calf and will likely miss a couple of weeks of practice. ...

Per NBC Sports Bay Area, the San Francisco 49ers have negotiated the frameworks of potential trades with both the Cleveland Browns and New England Patriots. It's now up to the star wideout and his camp to choose his next contract.\n\nThe Patriots are aggressively pursuit Aiyuk and are willing to make him one of the NFL's top-five highest-paid receivers, according to ESPN. The Browns and Steelers are also in the mix to land Aiyuk, per the report.\n\nThe 49ers have reportedly accepted what the Browns and Patriots offered for Aiyuk, and now it comes down to the money. The report indicates the 49ers could receive a veteran wide receiver and a package of picks in return for their No. 1 wideout.\n\nThis development comes after NFL Media reported Monday evening that contract talks between Aiyuk and the 49ers had stalled, and that it was more likely Aiyuk would be traded than find an extension in San Francisco.\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area had previously reported that the 49ers gave permission to Aiyuk to negotiate deals with the Browns, Steelers Patriots and the Washington Commanders.\n\nWashington eventually dropped out while Pittsburgh -- which was reportedly initially unwilling to match San Francisco's asking price -- has reengaged talks with the 49ers, according to ESPN. So, the Steelers appear to be back in the mix alongside New England and Cleveland. If they can also reach a framework deal with the Niners front office, they'd only need to negotiate a deal with Aiyuk at that juncture.\n\nIt will be fascinating to see what San Francisco is accepting for its All-Pro wideout. Reports indicated that before the 2024 NFL Draft, the 49ers were in search of a first-round pick. Pro Football Talk reported that Aiyuk's agent was given permission at that time to see if other teams would pay the wide receiver what he was after. At the time, that price was reportedly $28 million per year. Aiyuk's agent found five different teams willing to give that contract to Aiyuk, but those five teams could not meet the 49ers' desired trade compensation.\n\nThe wide receiver market has, of course, been very active this offseason, and there are now four pass-catchers who have secured contracts that include averages of at least $30 million per year.\n\nBrandon Aiyuk SF * WR * #11 TAR105REC75REC YDs1342REC TD7FL1 View Profile\n\nThe former No. 25 overall pick out of Arizona State had his best NFL season yet in 2023, as Aiyuk caught 75 passes for a career-high 1,342 yards and seven touchdowns. His 17.9 yards per reception ranked second in the NFL among qualified players behind George Pickens, while his 3.1 yards per route run ranked third behind Tyreek Hill and Nico Collins.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jordan_dajani@cbssports.com", "name": "Jordan Dajani", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Bay_Area", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Bay Area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyreek_Hill", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyreek Hill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State Sun Devils football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/08/05/28fc2c5e-6312-4455-b966-3854cbc67a70/thumbnail/1200x675/e75fbeabe92e96446d0dd9debe0e2ec9/aiyuk-g.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796319", "eventUri": "eng-9796319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

But what I can tell you guys is nothing has changed,\" coach Kyle Shanahan said Tuesday. \"A lot was out yesterday and stuff, but from the situation that we're in with Brandon, nothing's changed.\"\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area reported Monday night that the Niners have agreed to potential deals with Cleveland and New England that could happen if Aiyuk was willing to agree to a long-term deal with those teams.\n\nAiyuk reportedly would prefer a deal with Pittsburgh but the Steelers would also have to meet the 49ers asking price for one of their top players.\n\nShanahan said he doesn't expect a resolution to be imminent.\n\n\"You always want it to be. Badly,\" he said. \"But this stuff does take time. Every day I hope it gets resolved. But I have no timetable on it. It didn't surprise me coming into this. ... Hopefully it will get resolved sooner than later.\"\n\nAiyuk skipped the entire offseason program, including a mandatory minicamp in June, as he waited for a lucrative extension to replace the fifth-year option on his rookie deal.\n\nHe reported to training camp in late July after making a trade request but has refused to practice. He is attending team meetings and is not being fined.\n\nAiyuk had been set to play on the fifth-year option worth about $14.1 million this season and wanted San Francisco to make him the latest receiver to cash in with a long-term deal. Ten receivers before Aiyuk had signed contracts worth at least $70 million already this offseason with Justin Jefferson's four-year, $140 million extension with Minnesota setting the top of the market.\n\nAiyuk had been a key part of San Francisco's offense last season as he formed a great connection with quarterback Brock Purdy. Aiyuk had 75 catches and a career-high 1,375 yards last season with seven touchdowns as he earned second-team All-Pro honors.\n\nHis absence would be hard to overcome if San Francisco has designs on getting back to the Super Bowl and winning it this upcoming season.\n\n\"Brandon's a great player,\" Shanahan said. \"It's real hard to be better when you lose a great player. So we got to look at anything. We got to understand the situation we're in and what that looks like. That does take time. So hopefully it'll all work out best for him and best for us in the long run.\"\n\nThe Niners have done a good job keeping their homegrown stars drafted since Shanahan and general manager John Lynch took over in 2017. San Francisco had handed out megadeals the past four offseasons to George Kittle, Fred Warner, Deebo Samuel and Nick Bosa.\n\nThose weren't easy negotiations but Warner's pushed into training camp with Samuel missing a few practices in 2022 and Bosa not signing until less than a week before the opener last season.\n\nBosa described the process as \"brutal\" and said he had doubts it would end with a new contract at times last summer.\n\n\"As it got closer and closer (to the season), it gets pretty dicey,\" Bosa said. \"But I definitely didn't want to be traded. It's a good place to be. I'm very thankful and grateful to be paid and here, because I don't think there are many other organizations that are as good as this one.\"\n\nThe 49ers are also without another of their top offensive players with All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams holding out of camp in search of an improved contract. Shanahan had no updates on Williams' status and said he hopes \"that gets resolved as soon as possible too.\"\n\nNOTES: RB Christian McCaffrey strained his calf and will likely miss a couple of weeks of practice. ... RB Elijah Mitchell has a strained hamstring and will miss about a week, leading to the Niners bringing back RB Matt Breida. Breida rushed for 1,902 yards for San Francisco from 2017-19 before being traded to Miami. ... P Mitch Wishnowsky is out with knee irritation and the 49ers will need to bring in a punter for the exhibition opener on Saturday at Tennessee. ... Rookie WR Jacob Cowing returned to practice after missing time with a hamstring injury. ... Rookie WR Ricky Pearsall tweaked his shoulder in practice and left early. ...

Even top NFL insiders like Adam Schefter has wavered on reports.\n\nIn an attempt to put all that we know - right now, anyway - in one place, let's sum up the news that's out there and figure out where Pittsburgh might stand.\n\nWhat Teams Are Involved?\n\nBy most accounts, the New England Patriots, Cleveland Browns, and Pittsburgh Steelers are seen as the three most active teams in trade discussions. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport noted them all in a Tuesday report. He referred to the trade talks as \"active.\" He also confirmed the Steelers are \"for sure in it\" but said the Patriots and Browns were further along in talks than Pittsburgh.\n\nOf course, for any trade to be reached, two obstacles must be bridged. Giving the 49ers enough trade compensation for them to make the move and deal away a top wide receiver, and have Aiyuk agree to join his new team under sufficient contract terms. No small feats to line everything up.\n\nWeren't The Steelers Out?\n\nThat was the reporting last night when 49ers' beat writer Matt Maiocco said the Steelers were \"no longer an option\" after failing to meet the 49ers' trade demands. Even in that report, it was important to note the reason wasn't because of Pittsburgh's unwillingness to meet Aiyuk's contractual ask.\n\nHowever, Adam Schefter, hours after believing the Steelers were out of the running, tweeted Tuesday afternoon that Pittsburgh had \"re-engaged\" in talks with San Francisco.\n\nMaiocco responded by reiterating his Monday night report but noted Pittsburgh is Aiyuk's preferred destination.\n\nGiven the fluidity of the situation, it's hard to call any team is out until there's an actual trade in place. It's unclear if the new talks involved a better offer from Khan or if the 49ers were having a hard time finding another deal.\n\nWhere Does Aiyuk Want To Go?\n\nThe 49ers and Aiyuk have leverage. The 49ers obviously dictate who they say \"yes\" to in a trade. And if they want to keep him, they can, and Aiyuk can't do much about it. But Aiyuk also has say in where he ends up. Any team who wants to trade for him will need to have a long-term deal set in place. No team will give up the assets required to acquire him without a deal figured out, lest they risk not getting an extension done and having Aiyuk enter next offseason a pending free agent.\n\nIf Aiyuk doesn't want to go to a team or doesn't like their contract offer, he can refuse and essentially shut down the trade.\n\nAs Maiocco posted above, Pittsburgh seems to be the place Aiyuk would prefer to go. He's made overtures at Pittsburgh all offseason be it tweeting about Mike Tomlin, liking team Instagram posts, or wearing a Pittsburgh Pirates' hat. In his conversation with The Pivot podcast in late June, Aiyuk said he believed he'd play for either the 49ers, Commanders, or Steelers. Good friend and Washington Commanders QB Jayden Daniels would make for a logical landing spot but it doesn't seem like the Commanders are incredibly engaged in a deal (though nothing should be ruled out). That leaves Pittsburgh high on Aiyuk's list.\n\nHowever, Mike Silver reports Aiyuk hasn't completely crossed Cleveland or New England off his list.\n\nHow Much Does Aiyuk Want?\n\nContractually, he's clearly not happy with what the 49ers have offered. While nothing is known for certain, Aiyuk is believed to want between $28-30 million average yearly value. San Francisco best offers have reportedly been around the $26 million mark. Of course, structure of the deal is equally as important and could be tricky for Pittsburgh, as Dave Bryan has outlined. While there are ways to overcome the Steelers' precedents, it's an element that would need to be hammered out.\n\nWhat Does San Francisco Want? What Are Teams Willing To Give?\n\nReporting has varied but closer towards the draft, the 49ers were seeking a first round pick. Post-draft, they're almost certainly looking for draft capital but now, they could also want a player in return to help their roster win now, the 49ers a Super Bowl contender.\n\nOf the three frontrunners, the Patriots' offer is unclear. What has been reported is New England is willing to make Aiyuk a top-five paid wide receiver. From an APY standpoint, that would put him above Jaylen Waddle's $28.25 million mark.\n\nHow about the Browns? ESPN's Jeff Darlington reported Cleveland may part with WR Amari Cooper in a deal, sending him to San Francisco. While that would be a loss for Cleveland, especially after giving Cooper a slight raise (though it was incentive-based), Aiyuk is younger and has a longer-term future. Trading Cooper would also reduce the amount of draft capital the Browns would need to give up. Which is good because after spending the past two years sitting out drafts following the Deshaun Watson trade, they're probably not thrilled about parting with more early-round selections.\n\nAs for Pittsburgh, it's not certain what Khan is willing to give up. A high draft pick seems like a given, at least a second round. What player could the Steelers give? That's up for plenty of debate. There's certainly no high-prize wide receiver they could give back the way Cleveland could Cooper. While you could try to drum up scenarios about OT Dan Moore Jr., WR Calvin Austin III, or TE Darnell Washington, that's all speculation and hardly needle-movers in a deal. And no, the Steelers aren't trading away OLB Alex Highsmith, a move that would come with over $22 million in dead money.\n\nWill The Steelers Land Aiyuk?\n\nNo one knows. Clearly. But Pittsburgh is definitely in the mix. And if Aiyuk wants to come to Pittsburgh more than anywhere else, and the Steelers can bridge those obstacles of trade compensation and contract, there's a puncher's chance Omar Khan pulls it off.\n\nPerhaps he's willing to make the 49ers sweat and offer less than other teams, hoping Aiyuk will put the pressure on the organization to trade him for 80 cents on the dollar just to have a resolution and end a sage that's dragged on for months. Putting a number on it is tough but Pittsburgh has a real shot.\n\nRelated Items:Brandon Aiyuk, Pittsburgh Steelers, Trending Recommended for you James Daniels 'Went Out Of His Way' To Talk To Troy

What a massive misreading and misplaying of the entire negotiation with Brandon Aiyuk, from his cryptic comments last spring all the way to the stark clarity of this situation right now.\n\nThe 49ers' leaders, from Jed York to Paraag Marathe to John Lynch to Kyle Shanahan, missed something here. They underestimated the wide-receiver market and Aiyuk's commitment to getting what he feels he deserves. They fumbled away the moment when it seemed like this deal was very close in May. They miscalculated the economics.\n\nThe 49ers are the ones responsible for putting together this roster and managing the finances, not Aiyuk, and they messed this up. Which could merely cost them their best shot at throwing a parade in February.\n\nIf the 49ers trade Aiyuk -- as now seems close to imminent -- because they couldn't go up to $28 million a year or $30 million or whatever, what a devastating step backward for a team that supposedly is all-in for a Super Bowl title. What an admission: Well, gee, I guess the 49ers are almost all-in?\n\nOf course, it's still possible that Aiyuk's hard-ball tactics (ask for a trade, report to camp but decline to practice, set a price too high for the 49ers to meet) are all meant to squeeze the most out of the 49ers at this exact moment. That he'll eventually sign a long-term deal if the team budges a little more. And it's still possible that the 49ers' own hard-ball tactics (agreeing to trade terms with Cleveland and New England, according to NBC Sports Bay Area's Matt Maiocco, if Aiyuk can come to contract terms with those teams) are designed to shove Aiyuk back to the negotiating table once and for all. Maybe hardball plus hardball is the only way this could've worked.\n\nBut it sure doesn't feel like that's the way this is headed. It doesn't even seem like the 49ers' principals feel that way. They understand the reality. This star negotiation has gone off the rails in a way that they haven't experienced in this era.\n\nShanahan wasn't quite talking about Aiyuk's 49ers career in the past tense on Tuesday, but it was something close to that.\n\n\"It's been at this point for a little bit,\" Shanahan said, when asked if this needs to be resolved soon. \"So it's nothing really new to me. You're always disappointed when you can't keep hold of all your players or it's not going exactly right. I don't like losing anybody. So that's why I'm hoping it does work out here. But right now, we don't have that solved yet.\"\n\nLet's say, for argument's sake, that Aiyuk has been a grueling negotiating partner, that the 49ers have made multiple offers, raising the value each time, and that Aiyuk's camp hasn't lowered the asking price and has only raised the number as other receivers have reset the market multiple times. That doesn't seem far-fetched.\n\nBig-time negotiations often take perilous turns. The 49ers' negotiations with Nick Bosa last year, which stretched into the week before the regular-season opener, were full of problems. But the 49ers gave in and did what it took to get Bosa signed to the richest contract for a non-quarterback at that time, so they did not lose him. And why wouldn't Aiyuk try to test the 49ers like Bosa did, since he just watched how well it worked?\n\nAiyuk isn't at the same level of value as Bosa, but the 49ers will be worse if they trade him now, because you never get equal value back for a star when you trade him in August. That's panic time. Teams have put together their rosters. The draft isn't for another eight months. There is no way the 49ers will get true market value from the Patriots, Browns or the Steelers (presumably Aiyuk's favored destination, now part of the trade talks, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter).\n\nAs Bosa himself said on Tuesday, when asked what the 49ers would lose if Aiyuk is traded: \"I trust John and Kyle, but he's a very tough player to replace.\"\n\nThe time for the 49ers to have made this kind of decision would've been back in April, when they admitted they were taking calls from other teams on Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel but didn't like what they were offered. They would've gotten more for Aiyuk back then (a top-30 draft pick they could've immediately turned into a player who they would have had right now in camp) than they will now. And they wouldn't have gone through all these months of uncertainty, disconnect and strain.\n\nIf Aiyuk was not signable by the 49ers, they should've realized that in April. That's the timeframe in which they traded DeForest Buckner back in 2020, by the way. Instead, the 49ers concluded that they could negotiate this out. Aiyuk showing up for camp as a \"hold-in\" probably affected the 49ers' thinking. But he apparently hasn't budged. The 49ers will only go so high. And both sides are at the brink.\n\nIf the Patriots, Steelers and Browns are theoretically ready to meet Aiyuk's price, why is it too high for the 49ers? If the 49ers could've signed Aiyuk by just going a little higher in May, why didn't they realize what they'd be risking if they didn't move up one last time? If Aiyuk is a disposable asset for the 49ers, can you picture what this offense is going to look like on third down when Brock Purdy is scrambling around and it's Ricky Pearsall, Jauan Jennings or Chris Conley trying to break free from press coverage, not Aiyuk? And can you picture what happens if the 49ers try to replace Aiyuk with a high draft pick the future, maybe Dante Pettis 2.0? Or the next Danny Gray?\n\nThe 49ers' offense will still be formidable without Aiyuk, presuming the top guys stay healthy and the 49ers eventually come to contract terms with holdout superstar left tackle Trent Williams. But it won't be as good as it could be. Probably not as good as it has to be to win a championship.\n\n\"I mean, Brandon's a great player, so it's real hard to be better when you lose a great player,\" Shanahan said of the trade talk. \"So you've gotta look at anything, you've gotta understand the situation we're in, what that looks like. And that does take time. Hopefully it'll work out best for him and best for us in the long run.\"\n\nThink of it in context of the 49ers' top NFC rivals. What did the Lions do all offseason? Give extensions to all of their top guys. No panic trades. The Eagles have been tossing out rich contracts to their own stars for the last several years. Green Bay just gave a massive new deal to Jordan Love. The Rams just re-did Matt Stafford's deal.\n\nGood teams accumulate a lot of talent; the great ones keep that talent around as long as possible. And the 49ers are getting ready to -- or bluffing that they will -- trade Aiyuk, who has great chemistry with Purdy and does every large and little thing Shanahan wants a WR to do. This feels reckless. Short-sighted.\n\nAnd let me poke a hole in the general argument that the 49ers have to be disciplined with their salary-cap situation now because of the looming $200 million-plus deal coming for Purdy next offseason. Yes, that will be a massive contract that will affect the 49ers and York's pocketbook for years. Yes, that eventually will have a major impact on the 49ers' salary cap. But any future Purdy deal won't actually really unbalance the 49ers' cap until 2026 at the earliest, because these large contracts are always structured to drastically limit the hits in the first few years.\n\nFor instance, Trevor Lawrence just signed a five-year, $275 million contract ($55 million a year) with Jacksonville, but his cap number this year is a relatively moderate $15 million, and $17 million in 2025. The deal Jalen Hurts signed in April 2023 is an even closer parallel to the Purdy situation, because both Hurts and Purdy weren't first-round picks with first-round-pick salary structures. Hurts signed a five-year, $255 million contract ($51 million a year) with the Eagles in April 2023. His cap number that season was just $6.1 million, and it's $13.6 million this season.\n\nSo Purdy's new deal almost certainly won't push his cap hit past $20 million until 2027. The 49ers have room and time to maneuver around that figure. They also currently have $31.5 million in available cap space, according to OverTheCap.com, and the NFL salary cap goes up by 10 to 14 percent every year.\n\nIf the 49ers trade Aiyuk, it will mostly be about the team trying to beat another star in a negotiation and it blowing up on them. Hey, all owners have a limit to what they want to pay. The Yorks have committed a lot of money to this very talented roster and it's their right to decide where the boundaries are. But if it costs them a 26-year-old All-Pro receiver who has great chemistry with Purdy, what are the 49ers really gaining by this? And if they lose him, do the 49ers realize how much it'll cost to try to replace him -- and what they might lose out on while they try?", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Both star edge rusher Nick Bosa and head coach Kyle Shanahan spoke candidly about the situation on Tuesday, and neither sounded confident the organization would retain the reliable wideout.\n\nBosa acknowledged that the trade rumors are far from ideal, via NinersNation.com's Kyle Posey.\n\n\"Nick Bosa on Brandon Aiyuk's situation: 'It's brutal. I trust [GM] John [Lynch] and Kyle, but he's a very tough player to replace.'\"\n\nAiyuk has been reliable for San Francisco since the team selected him 25th overall in 2020. The Arizona State alum has totaled 3,931 receiving yards across 62 games thus far, which averages out to approximately 1,078 yards per full 17-game season. Aiyuk has also totaled 25 scores and 269 catches.\n\nShanahan has been spoiled with the ability to throw Aiyuk in the mix with Deebo Samuel, Christian McCaffrey, and George Kittle over the last couple of seasons. However, the veteran coach has to focus on the players he can rely on to show up in Week 1, via NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.\n\n\"I mean, you want it to be [resolved] badly, but this stuff does take time,\" Shanahan said. \"Every day I hope it gets resolved, but I have no timetable on it, didn't surprise me coming into this. I'm going about coaching the team, getting them ready for Week 1, and hopefully it'll get resolved sooner rather than later.\"\n\nThe 44-year-old then assured that \"there's a scenario for anything\" when asked if the team could still work out a long-term deal with Aiyuk.\n\nHow will this saga play out?\n\nBrandon Aiyuk holds the cards in any trade scenario with the 49ers\n\nWhile Aiyuk can't force San Francisco to give him a top-of-the-market extension due to the team's ability to franchise tag him for the next two seasons, he can reject any contract offer from any potential trade partner the team has. On top of that, the club is unlikely to get a return for the 2023 second-team All-Pro honoree that would help in its chase for a Super Bowl this season.\n\n\"Brandon's a great player, so it's real hard to be better when you lose a great player,\" Shanahan continued. \"So, we've got to look at anything, we've got to understand the situation we're in, what that looks like, and that does take time. Hopefully, it'll all work out best for him and best for us in the long run.\"\n\nRegardless, Shanahan insists that there isn't a bombshell update yet.\n\n\"I'm not getting into anything specific with offers, contracts, trades, anything like that, but what I can tell you is nothing has changed. I know a lot was out yesterday and stuff, but from the situation with Brandon, nothing has changed.\"", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_valdez@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Joshua Valdez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Shanahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bosa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Bosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_McCaffrey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christian McCaffrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kittle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Kittle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State Sun Devils football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchise_tag", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Franchise tag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Kyle-Shanahan-Nick-Bosa-break-silence-on-Brandon-Aiyuk-trade-rumors.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796319", "eventUri": "eng-9796319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports / Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBrandon Aiyuk being traded away by the San Francisco 49ers has intensified in the last couple of days.\n\nNo significant progress has been made on a contract extension. Both Aiyuk and the 49ers clearly have dug into their stances with neither side looking to cave. So, a trade is what seems to be the recourse here with an agreement bleak.\n\nTrading Aiyuk is not a wise move at all for the 49ers, especially at this point of the year. What the 49ers could get in return for Aiyuk will most likely not be able to fill in for him or shrink the hole left by him. Even Nick Bosa knows that replacing him will be difficult.\n\n\"I think it'd be huge,\" said Bosa if Aiyuk was traded. \"I trust John and Kyle, but he's a very tough player to replace.\"\n\nAiyuk is especially a tough player to replace when Week 1 against the New York Jets is in about a month. If a trade was going to take place, then the 49ers should've done so before the NFL draft. That way they could've at least found their immediate replacement and got him embedded.\n\nNow, at this point, they would be foolish to want to trade him. I don't see how they could get any player that will even shrink the hole left by him in half. All the 49ers will do is hurt their chances at winning the Super Bowl in 2024. By no means will the offense regress tremendously.\n\nThey'll surely still be a handful for most defenses, but Aiyuk's loss will lower how threatening the offense is. Not to mention they are removing Purdy's best receiving option. Just let him play on the final year of his deal and franchise tag him after. Why make the team worse by trading him?\n\nBesides, this is really all the 49ers' own doing. They always choose to draw out these negotiations because of how they play hardball. Bosa knows it all too well.\n\n\"I'm not gonna comment too much on it, but they are tough. That's for sure.\" Bosa said.\n\nTrading Aiyuk now has more risk than reward. It can potentially have rattling ramifications on the players. Seeing one of their best players get shipped out is sure to jolt them at least a bit and make the season start off weird.\n\nThat is what is easy to overlook. The emotional reaction to seeing Aiyuk traded. Yes, they're all professionals, but how can the players not feel some type of way of seeing Aiyuk be sent out in a year where they are trying to win it all?\n\nWe'll see soon what the 49ers and Aiyuk end up deciding.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bosa", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nick Bosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVIII", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiant_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allegiant Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bosa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bosa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7227,h_4065,x_0,y_647/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_49ers/01j4mqqrm0dgttagnne9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796319", "eventUri": "eng-9796319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Aiyuk desires a high-paying contract, the 49ers may have to choose to trade him to avoid losing him for nothing. The Steelers were in the mix for Aiyuk after initial speculation, making the Browns and Patriots among the preferred trade destinations.\n\nIt's looking more and more likely that the San Francisco 49ers and Brandon Aiyuk are nearing a divorce, as the two sides are struggling to agree to terms on a contract extension.\n\nAiyuk is entering the final year of his rookie contract, and is seeking a new contract that will make him one of the highest-paid receivers in the league.\n\nIn a standstill like this with a player on an expiring contract, the team has to make a difficult decision - trade the player now or risk losing the player for nothing next offseason in free agency. It's quite clear the 49ers' front office does not think the 26-year-old is worth the price he is asking for in negotiations.\n\nSan Fransisco's hand may be forced here because of the looming contract situations surrounding Brock Purdy and Trent Williams.\n\nAs Aiyuk has been \"holding in\", Williams has not been present at all for training camp, as he wants a revised contract that gives him guaranteed money - there is no more guaranteed money on his current deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Purdy is eligible for a contract extension next offseason. With the quarterback market exploding this offseason, the 24-year-old signal caller could sign a deal with $60 million AAV.\n\nWith these variables - in addition to the start of the season on the horizon - the 49ers' decision will come sooner rather than later.\n\nThere have been three teams that have emerged as favorites to land the former 2020 first-round pick:\n\nCleveland Browns New England Patriots Pittsburgh Steelers\n\nOn Monday night, Matt Maiocco reported that San Francisco had worked out deals with the Browns and Patriots.\n\nAiyuk does not have a no-trade clause in his contract, but he virtually has one in this situation, as he has to agree to an extension with one of these teams for the trade to materialize.\n\nBased on the current circumstances, it's obvious that Aiyuk is not interested in either of these teams, as nothing has transpired yet, despite trade compensation being agreed upon.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: The Arizona State product is coming off his best season of his career, catching 75 passes for 1,342 yards and seven touchdowns. Aiyuk achieved those numbers as the third option on an offense that ranked 31st in pass attempts last season.\n\nWhich of these three situations makes the most sense for both sides to work out a trade? This will evaluate quarterback situations, trade compensation, and affordability.\n\nRelated How Brandon Aiyuk Fits With the New England Patriots\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers have a trade proposal set up with the New England Patriots for All-Pro wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk.\n\n1 New England Patriots - Cap Space and Need With a rookie quarterback on the roster and plenty of cap space, the Patriots make the most sense.\n\nIn terms of winning, this may be the least desirable option for Aiyuk. However, in terms of money and opportunity to be a go-to option, New England can offer both, with $43 million in cap space and a thin depth chart at WR.\n\nNew England is heavily invested in Drake Maye's future, and the best way to give your rookie quarterback the best chance to succeed is to supply him with a clear-cut WR1.\n\nNew England Patriots Current WR Depth Chart\n\nWR1\n\nKendrick Bourne\n\nWR2\n\nDemario Douglas\n\nWR3\n\nJuju Smith-Schuster\n\nWR4\n\nK.J. Osborn\n\nWR5\n\nJavon Baker\n\nAny team that goes after Aiyuk clearly views him as that type of player and will prioritize featuring him in the offense.\n\nThe rumored package in place is Kendrick Bourne and picks, which is not a steep price tag for a receiver entering his prime, especially with a quarterback who will be playing on an affordable contract for the next four seasons. The Patriots would not be mortgaging their future, and they desperately need a top option in the passing game.\n\nCompeting for a Super Bowl will not be part of the equation, but if Aiyuk is looking for an expanded role, making top wideout money, and is interested in being part of a quarterback's development, then New England may make the most sense.\n\n2 Pittsburgh Steelers - Which Wideout Goes The Other Way? The Steelers may belong at the top of this list, but the parameters of a potential trade make it difficult.\n\nESPN's NFL insider Adam Schefter made an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday morning, saying that he does not \"expect Pittsburgh to be a landing spot at all.\"\n\nThis came after reports surfaced on Monday night that the Steelers were no longer in the race for Brandon Aiyuk.\n\nHowever, hours after saying Pittsburgh was unlikely to pull off a trade, Schefter reported that the Steelers and 49ers had re-engaged in conversations on Tuesday regarding Aiyuk.\n\nThis actually may be the perfect fit for both sides, but San Francisco seems to be unwilling to trade Aiyuk without a receiver included in the trade.\n\nGeorge Pickens or Roman Wilson could be the pieces the 49ers require in a trade package for Aiyuk. It's speculation, but based on the fact that San Francisco is seeking a wideout in any deal, it would make sense for one of those two players to be brought up in discussions.\n\nIf reports come out that the Steelers do not have to include Pickens or Wilson, then they would propel them to the top of this list.\n\nThe potential sacrifice Pittsburgh may have to make is the reason it is the second in this discussion. Other than that, it actually is a perfect fit. In addition, it is Aiyuk's preferred destination.\n\n3 Cleveland Browns - Dire Cap Situation Lack of cap flexibility makes trading for Aiyuk illogical from a Browns' perspective.\n\nFrom a pure football standpoint, landing Aiyuk would make a ton of sense for the Browns. However, the cap situation in 2025 makes things quite difficult.\n\nThere is no problem this season with Aiyuk's contract, as Cleveland has almost $30 million in cap space, but next year is a different story.\n\nFor any team who makes this trade, they will have to sign the 26-year-old receiver to an expensive contract extension. The fact is - the Browns are nearly $60 million over the 2025 cap, and this move will limit their ability to build a sustaining roster next season and beyond.\n\nAmari Cooper is the rumored receiver to be exchanged for Aiyuk - in addition to draft picks sent to the 49ers - in a potential trade. Cooper is entering the final year of his contract - which Cleveland restructured recently.\n\nThis may be an unpopular opinion, but flipping Cooper for Aiyuk would actually be a 'win' for the Browns, as Aiyuk is four years younger and entering his prime years. Cooper may be viewed as the better player right now, but it is unlikely he is back in Cleveland after this season, so the Browns could get something in return, rather than losing him for nothing next offseason.\n\nOn the other side of the coin - while Aiyuk offers more for the long-term - Cooper is still a reliable, top option in a passing attack. The 30-year-old wideout would also be a cheaper option, as he is currently a $20 million cap hit this season. Meanwhile, Aiyuk would most likely be close to a $30 million cap hit.\n\nAnother obstacle is that Deshaun Watson is commanding over $60 million per year, eating up a large percentage of the salary cap.\n\nThe Browns would have one of the best young skill-position groups in the league going forward by trading for Aiyuk.\n\nHowever, with a quarterback on a fully-guaranteed contract - who has struggled with injuries the last couple of seasons - it may be wiser to invest in the offensive line and build the receiving corps through the draft.\n\nAll statistics are courtesy of Pro Football Reference unless stated otherwise. All salary cap and contract info is courtesy of Spotrac.\n\nRelated How Brandon Aiyuk Fits With the Cleveland Browns\n\nThe Second-Team All-Pro's arrival would give the Browns' deep receiving corps a

Currently, it sounds as if Aiyuk's options are to return to San Francisco, although he hasn't gotten a contract offer he likes, or get traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cleveland Browns or New England Patriots.\n\nAccording to NFL Media's Mike Garafolo, Aiyuk's \"preferred destination\" is Pittsburgh.\n\n\"Some folks said the Steelers were out of it. Steelers were never out of it, and they're not out of it as we sit here right now. It sounds like, if you piece this all together, that that would be Aiyuk's preferred destination of all the teams that we've talked about. So it's just gotta get to the point maybe where the Steelers can sweeten the pot when it comes to the trade offer with the 49ers and then we can get to the point where Aiyuk can get a deal done with the Steelers and get over there,\" Garafolo said on The Insiders on Tuesday.\n\nNew England is prepared to give Aiyuk top-five receiver money, while Cleveland might have the best trade package to offer San Francisco. But none of Pittsburgh, New England nor Cleveland will trade for Aiyuk without a new deal in place, so it matters where Aiyuk wants to play. If he doesn't want to go to Cleveland or New England, he won't agree to an extension. He has a lot of leverage, but the 49ers also need to maximize their return for their All-Pro receiver.\n\nThat's where it sounds as if Pittsburgh is coming up short right now. Cleveland and New England both have more assets to offer the 49ers, and assuming the Steelers don't want to give up a first-round pick, the 49ers might prefer offers from Cleveland or New England.\n\nBrandon Aiyuk is a fan of Mike Tomlin, tagging him in a tweet in March which initially spurred trade rumors and liking his posts on Instagram. Playing under Tomlin could be a factor in Aiyuk wanting to come to Pittsburgh over the other destinations.\n\nIf Aiyuk does wind up getting traded to the Steelers, it'll be interesting to see the structure of his extension and obviously what the team could give up. It sounds like this will be wrapped up soon, so we may know Aiyuk's future home sooner rather than later.\n\nRelated Items:Brandon Aiyuk, Mike Garafolo, Mike Tomlin, The Insiders, Trending Recommended for you Watch: The Depot 180 -- August 6 -- Episode 440 Mike Tomlin: Justin Fields Has 'Really Been Focused On His Lower Body In The Pocket' Patriots Backing Up The Brinks Truck, 'Willing To Make Aiyuk One Of The Top Five Highest Paid Receivers,' Says Mike Reiss", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_clark@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Joe Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tomlin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tomlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/BrandonAiyukStock7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796319", "eventUri": "eng-9796319", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-06", "textStart": 2389, "textEnd": 2397}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

If not, Aiyuk might end up staying in San Francisco whether with a new contract or on a fifth-year option.\n\nFor now, the situation remains status quo despite swirling rumors about Aiyuk's status.\n\n\"I'm not going any specifics with offers, contracts, trades, anything like that. But what I can tell you guys is nothing has changed,\" coach Kyle Shanahan said Tuesday. \"A lot was out yesterday and stuff, but from the situation that we're in with Brandon, nothing's changed.\"\n\nNBC Sports Bay Area reported Monday night that the Niners have agreed to potential deals with Cleveland and New England that could happen if Aiyuk was willing to agree to a long-term deal with those teams.\n\nAiyuk reportedly would prefer a deal with Pittsburgh but the Steelers would also have to meet the 49ers asking price for one of their top players.\n\nShanahan said he doesn't expect a resolution to be imminent.\n\n\"You always want it to be. Badly,\" he said. \"But this stuff does take time. Every day I hope it gets resolved. But I have no timetable on it. It didn't surprise me coming into this. ... Hopefully it will get resolved sooner than later.\"\n\nAiyuk skipped the entire offseason program, including a mandatory minicamp in June, as he waited for a lucrative extension to replace the fifth-year option on his rookie deal.\n\nHe reported to training camp in late July after making a trade request but has refused to practice. He is attending team meetings and is not being fined.\n\nAiyuk had been set to play on the fifth-year option worth about $14.1 million this season and wanted San Francisco to make him the latest receiver to cash in with a long-term deal. Ten receivers before Aiyuk had signed contracts worth at least $70 million already this offseason with Justin Jefferson's four-year, $140 million extension with Minnesota setting the top of the market.\n\nAiyuk had been a key part of San Francisco's offense last season as he formed a great connection with quarterback Brock Purdy. Aiyuk had 75 catches and a career-high 1,375 yards last season with seven touchdowns as he earned second-team All-Pro honors.\n\nHis absence would be hard to overcome if San Francisco has designs on getting back to the Super Bowl and winning it this upcoming season.\n\n\"Brandon's a great player,\" Shanahan said. \"It's real hard to be better when you lose a great player. So we got to look at anything. We got to understand the situation we're in and what that looks like. That does take time. So hopefully it'll all work out best for him and best for us in the long run.\"\n\nThe Niners have done a good job keeping their homegrown stars drafted since Shanahan and general manager John Lynch took over in 2017. San Francisco had handed out megadeals the past four offseasons to George Kittle, Fred Warner, Deebo Samuel and Nick Bosa.\n\nThose weren't easy negotiations but Warner's pushed into training camp with Samuel missing a few practices in 2022 and Bosa not signing until less than a week before the opener last season.\n\nBosa described the process as \"brutal\" and said he had doubts it would end with a new contract at times last summer.\n\n\"As it got closer and closer (to the season), it gets pretty dicey,\" Bosa said. \"But I definitely didn't want to be traded. It's a good place to be. I'm very thankful and grateful to be paid and here, because I don't think there are many other organizations that are as good as this one.\"\n\nThe 49ers are also without another of their top offensive players with All-Pro left tackle Trent Williams holding out of camp in search of an improved contract. Shanahan had no updates on Williams' status and said he hopes \"that gets resolved as soon as possible too.\"\n\nNOTES: RB Christian McCaffrey strained his calf and will likely miss a couple of weeks of practice. ... RB Elijah Mitchell has a strained hamstring and will miss about a week, leading to the Niners bringing back RB Matt Breida. Breida rushed for 1,902 yards for San Francisco from 2017-19 before being traded to Miami. ... P Mitch Wishnowsky is out with knee irritation and the 49ers will need to bring in a punter for the exhibition opener on Saturday at Tennessee. ... Rookie WR Jacob Cowing returned to practice after missing time with a hamstring injury. ... Rookie WR Ricky Pearsall tweaked his shoulder in practice and left early. ...

Remember, they went hard after free agent receiver Calvin Ridley, were willing to spend big for him, but Ridley ended up in Tennessee. Now, they're willing to spend big to try to entice Aiyuk to want to come to New England.\"\n\nAiyuk getting top-five receiver money would pay him around $30 million per season and put him in the same group as Justin Jefferson, A.J. Brown, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle. Waddle is the only member of that foursome who doesn't make at least $30 million per year -- he comes in right under at $28.2 million.\n\nMoney is obviously a massive motivator for Aiyuk and the reason he wants out of San Francisco, which made the Super Bowl last season. Aiyuk is set to make $14.1 million this season and wants a big pay increase.\n\nThe Patriots clearly see Aiyuk as a No. 1 receiver and want to pay him as such. The Arizona State product totaled 75 receptions for 1,342 yards and seven touchdowns in 2023.\n\nNew England has competition for Aiyuk with the Cleveland Browns reportedly having a trade framework in place with the 49ers as well. The Pittsburgh Steelers are said to have \"re-engaged\" in trade talks with the 49ers, too.

There is even the possibility, one that is intensifying lately, of Aiyuk being traded. McCaffrey had an odd reference in his answer to Rose and Wyche. Here is part of what he had to say.\n\n\"For me, I don't deal with it,\" said McCaffrey. \"That's not part of my job. That's not part of my position. I think, obviously as a former teammate, err, you know teammate of his in general any teammate that you have you love and respect them. You want the best for them. As far as the business side of this game goes, it's always difficult. I stay out of it completely. That's way above my pay grade.\"\n\nUnreal. McCaffrey refers to Aiyuk as his \"former teammate.\" Does McCaffrey know something we don't? Does he already view Aiyuk as good as gone from the 49ers? Or was it simply a slip up? If you take his word for it, then it was a simple slip up or he already views Aiyuk as departed since he \"stays out\" of it all.\n\nRegardless, it just fuels all the weirdness lately with Aiyuk and the 49ers. Reports have constantly fluctuated with whether or not a trade is in the works and the likelihood of it. At this point, it feels like a trade is inevitable despite it not being wise of the 49ers to do so.\n\nNick Bosa has already made it clear that it'll be tough to replace Aiyuk if he is traded, so he doesn't appear to be a fan of it. I doubt anyone on the team is, but it doesn't matter what they think. This is the ugly side of the business and one that they must come to grips with if a trade occurs.\n\n\"Obviously we always wish the best for any of our teammates whether they're here or not,\" McCaffrey said. \"Obviously we hope he's here.

His teammate, Brandon Aiyuk, is now facing a similar situation, with the significant difference being that the 49ers are currently entertaining trade offers for the disgruntled receiver.\n\nBosa spoke to reporters after Tuesday's practice and was asked what the loss of Aiyuk might mean for the 49ers.\n\n\"I think it'd be huge,\" Bosa responded. \"I trust John and Kyle, but he's a very tough player to replace.\"\n\nBosa refers to general manager John Lynch and head coach Kyle Shanahan, the 49ers' brain trust, who is responsible for building and maintaining their competitive roster. Earlier in the offseason, the duo expressed confidence that a contract extension could be worked out with Aiyuk. However, reports now suggest that San Francisco has already worked out the frameworks of potential trades with the Cleveland Browns and New England Patriots and that the Pittsburgh Steelers have re-entered the trade discussions.\n\nAiyuk must decide whether to pursue more money with organizations like the Browns or Patriots or compete for a Super Bowl with the 49ers.\n\nUnsatisfied with the lack of progress in the contract talks, Aiyuk requested a trade before reporting to training camp with his teammates. However, the receiver has refrained from participating in any on-field work during this stalemate.\n\n\"It's brutal, especially when you're here and you have that extra pressure on you,\" Bosa commented. \"I've talked to him a few times, just as a friend, but when it comes to what's actually going on behind closed doors, I have no knowledge or input.\"\n\nThe hopeful Bosa added, \"It'll get worked out.\"\n\nBosa acknowledged that the 49ers can be tough negotiators. He admitted that, toward the end, he had some doubts last year that his own contract talks would be resolved.\n\n\"As it got closer and closer, it gets pretty dicey, but I definitely didn't want to be traded,\" Bosa shared. \"It's a good place to be, for sure.

They've also begun negotiating again with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nOf that trio, only the Browns have a wide receiver who might be able to help the 49ers replace Aiyuk. That's 30-year-old Amari Cooper who is set to enter free agency next offseason. New England's receiving corps isn't great. Neither is Pittsburgh's, which helps explain why the clubs are interested in giving up assets to pay Aiyuk top-of-market money.\n\nNot getting a top-end receiver back in an Aiyuk trade would suddenly turn a strong point of the 49ers' roster into a question mark. Here's what their depth chart might look like in Week 1 without Aiyuk, and without another WR to replace him:\n\nSamuel is one of the best playmakers in the NFL. He's also put together an outstanding training camp by all accounts. Regardless of how the Aiyuk situation plays out, having Samuel atop the depth chart is extremely helpful in the 49ers' pursuit of a championship.\n\nThis is where things get dicey. Jennings has been outstanding in his role for the 49ers since being selected in the seventh round of the 2020 draft. He debuted the following year and immediately carved out a niche as a ferocious blocker, reliable third-down target, and perpetual pot-stirrer with opposing defenders. While he has thrived in that role, he has only 78 catches for 963 yards and seven touchdowns as a pro. For reference, Aiyuk posted 1,342 yards and seven touchdowns on 75 receptions just last season. Moving into the No. 2 spot would help Jennings' overall production, but it might also expose some of the weaknesses in his game that aren't as apparent when he's running as the No. 3 at the position.\n\nAiyuk's absence would also thrust the 49ers' first-round pick from this year's draft into a larger role. He might already be in line to take some WR3 snaps, but his runway to adapt to the NFL was much longer with Aiyuk alongside Samuel atop the depth chart. Pearsall becomes essential in a world where Aiyuk isn't in San Francisco. He would likely take on the bulk of the WR3 snaps and perhaps more depending on how Jennings produced in his bigger role. To make matters more difficult for the No. 31 overall pick, he's already missed time in camp because of a hamstring injury. A shoulder injury also forced him out of Tuesday's practice ahead of the 49ers' preseason opener.\n\nWith Aiyuk on the roster, Conley is likely headed for a practice squad spot. Without Aiyuk the 49ers may need Conley to be a catch-all for any shortcomings with Jennings or Pearsall. That's not an ideal scenario for a soon-to-be 32-year-old wide receiver who has 29 catches the last three years. Conley is a perfect extra receiver and special teams contributor when he's up from the practice squad. Asking him to do much more than that may leave the 49ers disappointed.\n\nA nice training camp has put Bell back in real contention for a roster spot if Aiyuk is with the team. Without Aiyuk, he's a virtual lock for a roster spot. He didn't produce much as a rookie seventh-round pick last year, but Bell has stepped up as a receiver in camp this year to go with his special teams contributions. Perhaps Bell has made enough progress that the 49ers feel good about moving him up in the offense. That will be a huge question mark going into the year.\n\nThe rookie fourth-round pick's role probably doesn't change much without Aiyuk. He's been dealing with a hamstring strain that kept him from getting into the first couple weeks of camp. Cowing's adjustment to NFL size and speed with pads on will be paramount in determining how effective he can be as a pro. In Year 1, however, the goal may be for him to return punts and run gadget plays on offense. Without Aiyuk there may be more opportunities for him to get into games, but his overall role doesn't figure to change dramatically.\n\nDanny GrayTrent Taylor\n\nGray and Taylor could both find their way onto the roster over a player like Conley or Bell. Taylor is a punt return specialist who has had flashes as a pass catcher in camp. Gray is a third-year former third-round pick who has a ton of speed, but he hasn't been able to harness it within the 49ers' offense. A kick return job might be his best chance to grab a spot.\n\nTay Martin\n\nMartin is an intriguing former undrafted free agent who has been primarily on the 49ers' practice squad the last two years. He'll need a big finish to camp to climb onto the back end of the roster.\n\nFrank DarbyTerique Owens\n\nDarby has two catches in three years as a pro and doesn't figure to be in the mix for the active roster.

Nothing has been finalized as of Tuesday evening, but Christian McCaffrey dropped another significant hint about Aiyuk's future.\n\nSpeaking to Chris Rose and Steve Wyche of NFL Network, McCaffrey accidentally referred to the 26-year-old Aiyuk as \"a former teammate.\" The reigning rushing champion quickly realized his mistake and attempted to correct himself:\n\n\"It's not part of my job, it's not part of my position. Obviously, as a former teammate...or you know, a teammate of his in general, any teammate that you have you love, you respect them. You want the best for them.\"\n\nIt's hard not to interpret Christian McCaffrey's \"former teammate\" reference as a hint that the 49ers have informed him about a looming Aiyuk trade. Again, nothing has been confirmed at this time.\n\nAlso Read: Rumored Blockbuster Trade Details Revealed For What The Patriots And Browns Will Be Sending The 49ers For Superstar WR Brandon Aiyuk\n\nInterestingly, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported on Tuesday afternoon that the Pittsburgh Steelers have also re-emerged as players in the Aiyuk sweepstakes. Leading up to the 2024 NFL Draft, the Steelers had been linked to the two-time 1,000-yard receiver.\n\nThere's always the outside chance that the 49ers will reach an agreement on an extension with Aiyuk, but the clock is ticking on that front. With Week 1 approaching, it's obvious that all parties would like to reach a resolution as soon as possible.\n\nThe 49ers will open their 2024 season with a home tilt against Aaron Rodgers and the New York Jets at Levi's Stadium in a \"Monday Night Football\" clash on Sept. 9.\n\nLast season, Run CMC ran the ball 272 times for 1,459 yards and 14 touchdowns to go along with 67 receptions for 564 yards and seven receiving scores. And yet, the-28-year-old may see his already- heavy workload increase if the 49ers end up trading their superstar wide receiver.\n\nAlso Read: REPORT: 49ers Have \"Trade Framework In Place\" To Send Superstar WR Brandon Aiyuk To Either The Patriots Or Browns But There Is One Major Detail Holding Both Deals Back", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoegler@totalprosports.com", "name": "Alex Hoegler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_McCaffrey", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christian McCaffrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wyche", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Wyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chris Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Bay_Area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Bay Area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi's_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Levi's Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monday_Night_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monday Night Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/christianmccaffreybrandonaiyuk-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796319", "eventUri": "eng-9796319", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-09", "textStart": 1943, "textEnd": 1950}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

The team has yet to reach a contract extension with their star wide receiver, who, frustrated by the situation, requested a trade before reporting to training camp. Until recently, the 49ers had consistently stated their unwillingness to trade Aiyuk, but the situation has now shifted.\n\nWith no resolution in sight, the 49ers have changed their stance and are now open to discussing potential trades with interested teams. San Francisco has even worked out the frameworks for trades with the Cleveland Browns and New England Patriots. In addition to draft compensation, the 49ers reportedly seek a veteran receiver to help fill Aiyuk's potential void. For the Browns, that player is reportedly Amari Cooper, while for the Patriots, it is likely former 49ers receiver Kendrick Bourne.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers are also reportedly involved in discussions, and the 49ers have given Aiyuk's agent permission to negotiate with other teams regarding a contract and trade.\n\nAlthough Aiyuk has been present with his teammates during training camp, he has not participated in practices, effectively \"holding in\" while the stalemate continues.\n\nRunning back Christian McCaffrey discussed the situation with NFL Network's Chris Rose and Steve Wyche after Tuesday's practice and discussed his disgruntled teammate.\n\nWhen asked how 49ers players are handling the drama, McCaffrey said, \"For me, I don't deal with it. That's not part of my job. It's not part of my position. I think, obviously, as a former teammate ... or ... teammate of his in general, any teammate that you have, you love, you respect them, you want the best for them.\"\n\nMcCaffrey's reference to Aiyuk as a \"former teammate\" was likely an inadvertent slip, but it underscores the level of uncertainty surrounding the situation within the organization.\n\nMcCaffrey added, \"Obviously, we always wish the best for any of our teammates, whether they're here or not. Obviously, we hope he's here. Just, it's a tough part of the business.\"\n\nAiyuk is slated to earn $14.124 million in 2024 on a team-exercised fifth-year option.

Go get him.", "body": "San Francisco 49ers receiver Brandon Aiyuk takes the field for a playoff game against Green Bay on Jan. 20.\n\nAfter months of speculation, San Francisco has put want-away wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk on the market. The Steelers are among the teams kicking the tires.\n\nIf the Steelers don't get Aiyuk, it's a failure by management.\n\nIf Cleveland gets Aiyuk, the Steelers will finish last in the AFC North. (The Browns and New England are both reportedly hot on Aiyuk's trail.)\n\nSure, the Steelers will have to give the 49ers too much to get Aiyuk, and have to pay Aiyuk too much to keep him.\n\nBut teams often overspend to get a player they need. The Steelers need Aiyuk.\n\nTheir wideouts are inadequate, which will render their passing game inadequate. That's even if Russell Wilson does well at quarterback.\n\nThe Steelers can tough out yardage on the ground. Oppenheimer will maximize the tight ends, even if they're not that good.\n\nBut the Steelers will be in trouble whenever they trail by two scores (or more) in the second quarter (or later). The opposition's pass coverage will collapse on receiver George Pickens. The Steelers won't be able to score points fast. Aside from taking too much time when you're behind, long drives provide more opportunity for mistakes.\n\nAiyuk changes all that. He's a legit top receiver. He'd free up Pickens.\n\nThe Steelers should absolutely get Aiyuk. Give up a first-round pick plus whatever. Aiyuk is 26. In his prime.\n\nLet Pickens go when his contract expires after the 2025 season. He's a head case anyway. Pickens will get mad when Aiyuk usurps targets. When Pickens doesn't get paid, he'll get more mad.\n\nNo big deal. Aiyuk is more reliable. Get Aiyuk, ditch Pickens when the time comes, draft another receiver in the interim.\n\nIs Aiyuk worth $30 million per season?\n\nHe probably isn't. But he's very good. Do you want to win or not?\n\nT.J. Watt's cap hit is $30.4 million, He's never won a playoff game.\n\nMinkah Fitzpatrick's cap hit is $21.3 million. He's never won a playoff game.\n\nIt's about how much you impact winning. Aiyuk would impact winning. The Steelers might even win a playoff game.\n\nOr not. Aiyuk would offer no guarantees. Not even a playoff spot. But it's worth the risk.\n\nDo the Steelers and Mike Tomlin put too much emphasis on Tomlin never having a losing season?\n\nI used to think not. Now, I'm not so sure.\n\nIn 2019, Ben Roethlisberger popped his elbow during the season's second game. The Steelers were 0-2. They should have tanked. Maybe they would have finished low enough to draft a new franchise quarterback. Perhaps Justin Herbert.\n\nInstead, they traded their first-round pick for 2020 to Miami for Fitzpatrick.\n\nFitzpatrick is a great safety. He helped that year's Steelers scratch and claw to 8-8, preserving Tomlin's streak.\n\nBut the Steelers missed the playoffs. Had they made the postseason, it would have been a quick exit. No hope with Duck Hodges at quarterback.\n\nWas it more important to finish 8-8 then or to win 11 or 12 games now?\n\nI see the Steelers as a nine- or 10-win team. Adding Aiyuk changes the offense. It ups the ante. Makes the Steelers more comeback-friendly. Maybe gets a couple more victories.\n\nGetting Aiyuk would retroactively eliminate the stupidity of trading Diontae Johnson to Carolina without a Plan B at wideout.\n\nVan Jefferson is getting extra work via the JUGS football throwing machine. Three hundred balls per day, we're told.\n\nThat should enable Jefferson to be an effective No. 2 receiver behind Pickens. If the JUGS football throwing machine ever plays quarterback.\n\nIf the Steelers don't get Aiyuk, that would stink.\n\nIf Cleveland gets Aiyuk, it would be a disaster. Cleveland's roster is very good. Aiyuk would be a considerable upgrade, even if Amari Cooper goes the other way in a trade with San Francisco.\n\nMaybe the Steelers could make Justin Fields into a latter-day \"Slash.\" If Fields doesn't win the fictional battle for the starting quarterback job.\n\nHere's hoping Fields plays a lot in Friday's exhibition opener against Houston at Acrisure Stadium.\n\nHere's further hoping that Fields goes about 10 for 10, maybe throws a couple of touchdowns. Perhaps a decent-sized run and a rushing TD. No turnovers.\n\nI want the citizens to rally behind the second-string quarterback from the get-go. It will make the commotion all the bigger when Wilson throws his first incompletion Week 1 at Atlanta. God forbid Wilson gets picked.\n\nI believe Wilson will be the Steelers' saving grace.\n\nBut an instant quarterback controversy would be what's best for business.", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_madden@triblive.com", "name": "Mark Madden", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tomlin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Tomlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Roethlisberger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ben Roethlisberger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkah_Fitzpatrick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minkah Fitzpatrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._J._Watt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T.

The 49ers have reportedly reached a framework for deals with the New England Patriots and Cleveland Browns while negotiating with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nDuring Tuesday's training camp, McCaffrey conducted an interview with NFL Network. Steve Wyche asked the star running back how 49ers players are dealing with Aiyuk's absence when McCaffrey made an interesting word choice he tried taking back.\n\n\"I don't deal with it. That's not part of my job. That's not part of my position.\" McCaffrey said. \"Obviously as a former teammate ... or teammate of his in general -- any teammate you have -- you love, you respect them. You want the best for them.\"\n\nMcCaffrey elaborated more on his position, but everyone was likely already too busy clipping the part where he called Aiyuk a \"former teammate.\"\n\n\"I stay out of it completely,\" McCaffrey added. \"That's way above my pay grade, I just try to focus on what I can do every single day. But obviously, we always wish the best for any of our teammates, whether they're here or not. Obviously, we hope he's here.\"\n\nPerhaps McCaffrey is privy to an upcoming trade, or maybe he's just speculating like those who rushed to inaccurately claim a deal already happened Monday. The running back also could have just legitimately misspoke.\n\nEither way, time is running out for the 49ers to resolve their Aiyuk situation before opening their season on Monday, Sept. 9.\n\nRelated: Report: 49ers Have 2 Teams Lined Up For Brandon Aiyuk Trade", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_gould@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Gould", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_McCaffrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian McCaffrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wyche", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Wyche"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796319", "eventUri": "eng-9796319", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-09", "textStart": 1634, "textEnd": 1641}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

They've also begun negotiating again with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nOf that trio, only the Browns have a wide receiver who might be able to help the 49ers replace Aiyuk. That's 30-year-old Amari Cooper who is set to enter free agency next offseason. New England's receiving corps isn't great. Neither is Pittsburgh's, which helps explain why the clubs are interested in giving up assets to pay Aiyuk top-of-market money.\n\nNot getting a top-end receiver back in an Aiyuk trade would suddenly turn a strong point of the 49ers' roster into a question mark. Here's what their depth chart might look like in Week 1 without Aiyuk, and without another WR to replace him:\n\nDeebo Samuel\n\nJanuary 20, 2024; Santa Clara, CA, USA; San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel (19) runs against Green Bay Packers linebacker De'Vondre Campbell (59) during the first quarter in a 2024 NFC divisional round game at Levi's Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nSamuel is one of the best playmakers in the NFL. He's also put together an outstanding training camp by all accounts. Regardless of how the Aiyuk situation plays out, having Samuel atop the depth chart is extremely helpful in the 49ers' pursuit of a championship.\n\nJauan Jennings\n\nSEATTLE, WASHINGTON - NOVEMBER 23: Jauan Jennings #15 of the San Francisco 49ers reacts during the first half against the Seattle Seahawks at Lumen Field on November 23, 2023 in Seattle, Washington. (Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images)\n\nThis is where things get dicey. Jennings has been outstanding in his role for the 49ers since being selected in the seventh round of the 2020 draft. He debuted the following year and immediately carved out a niche as a ferocious blocker, reliable third-down target, and perpetual pot-stirrer with opposing defenders. While he has thrived in that role, he has only 78 catches for 963 yards and seven touchdowns as a pro. For reference, Aiyuk posted 1,342 yards and seven touchdowns on 75 receptions just last season. Moving into the No. 2 spot would help Jennings' overall production, but it might also expose some of the weaknesses in his game that aren't as apparent when he's running as the No. 3 at the position.\n\nRicky Pearsall\n\nMay 10, 2024; Santa Clara, CA, USA; San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Ricky Pearsall (14) runs drills during the 49ers rookie minicamp at Levi\u00d5s Stadium in Santa Clara, CA. Mandatory Credit: Robert Kupbens-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAiyuk's absence would also thrust the 49ers' first-round pick from this year's draft into a larger role. He might already be in line to take some WR3 snaps, but his runway to adapt to the NFL was much longer with Aiyuk alongside Samuel atop the depth chart. Pearsall becomes essential in a world where Aiyuk isn't in San Francisco. He would likely take on the bulk of the WR3 snaps and perhaps more depending on how Jennings produced in his bigger role. To make matters more difficult for the No. 31 overall pick, he's already missed time in camp because of a hamstring injury. A shoulder injury also forced him out of Tuesday's practice ahead of the 49ers' preseason opener.\n\nChris Conley\n\nJan 7, 2024; Santa Clara, California, USA; San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Chris Conley (84) is tackled by Los Angeles Rams cornerback Derion Kendrick (left) and safety John Johnson III (bottom) during the second quarter at Levi's Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports\n\nWith Aiyuk on the roster, Conley is likely headed for a practice squad spot. Without Aiyuk the 49ers may need Conley to be a catch-all for any shortcomings with Jennings or Pearsall. That's not an ideal scenario for a soon-to-be 32-year-old wide receiver who has 29 catches the last three years. Conley is a perfect extra receiver and special teams contributor when he's up from the practice squad. Asking him to do much more than that may leave the 49ers disappointed.\n\nRonnie Bell\n\nAug 19, 2023; Santa Clara, California, USA; San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Ronnie Bell (10) runs with the football during the fourth quarter against Denver Broncos cornerback Faion Hicks (29) at Levi's Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Stan Szeto-USA TODAY Sports\n\nA nice training camp has put Bell back in real contention for a roster spot if Aiyuk is with the team. Without Aiyuk, he's a virtual lock for a roster spot. He didn't produce much as a rookie seventh-round pick last year, but Bell has stepped up as a receiver in camp this year to go with his special teams contributions. Perhaps Bell has made enough progress that the 49ers feel good about moving him up in the offense. That will be a huge question mark going into the year.\n\nJacob Cowing\n\nMay 10, 2024; Santa Clara, CA, USA; San Francisco 49ers rookie wide receiver Jacob Cowing (83) runs drills during the 49ers rookie minicamp at Levi\u00d5s Stadium in Santa Clara, CA. Mandatory Credit: Robert Kupbens-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe rookie fourth-round pick's role probably doesn't change much without Aiyuk. He's been dealing with a hamstring strain that kept him from getting into the first couple weeks of camp. Cowing's adjustment to NFL size and speed with pads on will be paramount in determining how effective he can be as a pro. In Year 1, however, the goal may be for him to return punts and run gadget plays on offense. Without Aiyuk there may be more opportunities for him to get into games, but his overall role doesn't figure to change dramatically.\n\nOn the bubble\n\nOctober 4, 2020; Santa Clara, California, USA; San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Trent Taylor (15) is tackled by Philadelphia Eagles safety Rudy Ford (36) during the first quarter at Levi's Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDanny Gray\n\nTrent Taylor\n\nGray and Taylor could both find their way onto the roster over a player like Conley or Bell. Taylor is a punt return specialist who has had flashes as a pass catcher in camp. Gray is a third-year former third-round pick who has a ton of speed, but he hasn't been able to harness it within the 49ers' offense. A kick return job might be his best chance to grab a spot.\n\nLong shots\n\nAug 25, 2023; Santa Clara, California, USA; San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Tay Martin (86) runs with the ball against Los Angeles Chargers cornerback Deane Leonard (33) during the second quarter at Levi's Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Sergio Estrada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nTay Martin\n\nMartin is an intriguing former undrafted free agent who has been primarily on the 49ers' practice squad the last two years. He'll need a big finish to camp to climb onto the back end of the roster.\n\nPractice squad candidates\n\nMay 10, 2024; Santa Clara, CA, USA; San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Terique Owens (84) runs drills during the 49ers rookie minicamp at Levi\u00d5s Stadium in Santa Clara, CA. Mandatory Credit: Robert Kupbens-USA TODAY Sports\n\nFrank Darby\n\nTerique Owens\n\nDarby has two catches in three years as a pro and doesn't figure to be in the mix for the active roster.

A once innocent back and forth, routine for the Kyle Shanahan 49ers nearly every summer, has quickly devolved into a nasty cold war with both sides entrenched in their stances. It's been six months since the Niners endured their latest crushing defeat on the sport's biggest stage once again. Now, as the team prepares to embark on another promising climb, it's plagued by the lack of clarity surrounding the status of one of its most important offensive pieces. How did we get here?\n\nFor the first roughly 80% of the offseason, it looked as though the 49ers and Brandon Aiyuk would go through the motions of a typical San Francisco contract negotiation before signing the 2020 first round pick to an extension that reflected his value. The draft passed without a deal, further signaling that Aiyuk would remain in red and gold. Then, purgatory. Negotiations stalled, and soured eventually to the point where Aiyuk and his camp formally requested a trade in early July. Still even then, experts remained optimistic that the two sides would hammer out a deal. That attitude has changed in the last week. The Niners' brass has dug its heels into the fresh turf at Levi's, and as Aiyuk continues to hold in, his time frame to make a decision is at the 11th hour.\n\nThings have come to a head. The Niners made it clear in the last 24 hours that they have an offer out to Brandon Aiyuk, and they have the framework of a trade in place to both the Cleveland Browns and the New England Patriots. The ball is in Aiyuk's court, but is he willing to take the shot?\n\nMatt Maiocco joined Tolbert and Copes on Monday afternoon, and for the first time in months had little clarity to offer on a day that saw rumors flying back and forth more than they had throughout the entire saga. Hours before he reported that deals were in place with the Browns and Patriots, Maiocco said he wasn't sure that Aiyuk truly wanted to be dealt when he requested a trade in July. The hardball strategy may have backfired for Aiyuk, who now finds himself actually faced with the autonomy he publicly asked for. If he does head for seemingly greener pastures, he likely wouldn't be the first to find that you don't know what you got until it's gone.\n\nWhat may happen next, if it hasn't fully played out yet, is that the market will tell Aiyuk exactly how much he's worth. If a team like the Browns or Patriots is willing to pay him the ~$30M he wants, then the Niners' hand would be forced. Even then, if the willing team (cough cough, New England) doesn't have the assets to give back to the Niners, SF still holds the leverage to say no thanks.\n\nIf he is gone, Brandon Aiyuk will be remembered as a good 49er with a lot of \"what if\" attached to his name in the halls of Levi's Stadium. What if his rookie offseason hadn't been derailed by Covid? What if he hadn't spent much of his sophomore season working his way out of the infamous Kyle Shanahan dog house? What if Chris Jones had been blocked in overtime and a wide open Aiyuk was hit in the back of the end zone for a Super Bowl overtime touchdown? If he departs, he will have made it to the final four in three of his first four seasons without hoisting football's biggest prize.\n\nAiyuk is a great player, but a replaceable one. He isn't a Christian McCaffrey, or a Trent Williams, or Nick Bosa. The Niners will be able to fill that hole in production. What he does become now, and where the sadness may set in for some Niner fans, is the latest tally on the list of significant 49er players to be a part of championship caliber teams without winning a Lombardi. Joe Staley. Frank Gore. Patrick Willis. Deforest Buckner. Arik Armstead. The list goes on. With every new name added to this list, the bleak possibility of the entire era holding that distinction becomes a little more real. And that's an ominous reality for 49er fans.", "source": {"uri": "knbr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KNBR 680 AM"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Maiocco", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Maiocco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Shanahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi_Strauss_&_Co.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Levi Strauss & Co."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_turf", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial turf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Jones_(defensive_tackle,_born_1994)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Jones (defensive tackle, born 1994)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_McCaffrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian McCaffrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arik_Armstead", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arik Armstead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gold_Rush", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California Gold Rush"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Staley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Staley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Willis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Willis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Gore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi's_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Levi's Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "End zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bosa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Bosa"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn.socast.io/6616/sites/1484/2024/06/10095114/aiyuk.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796319", "eventUri": "eng-9796319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Ayuik would then have a decision between the two if he did not want to sign a contract extension with the 49ers.\n\nFor a long time, Pittsburgh felt like a likely destination but was not mentioned in Maiocco's report.\n\nMike Garafolo of the NFL Network pushed back on the idea, saying the Steelers are still in the mix for the wide receiver. In fact, Garafolo believes Pittsburgh is where Aiyuk ultimately wants to end up. The return on a trade would need to be sweetened for San Francisco and for now, the two are in a \"standoff.\"\n\n\"Some folks said the Steelers are out of it,\" Garafolo said on NFL Network. \"The Steelers were never out of it, and they're not out of it as we sit here right now, as well. It sounds like, if you piece this all together, that would be Aiyuk's preferred destination of all the teams that we've talked about.\n\n\"So it's just got to get to the point where the Steelers can sweeten the pot when it comes to the trade offer with the 49ers. And then we can get to a point where Aiyuk can get a deal done with the Steelers and get over there. But in the meantime, it is a standoff right now. There has been no progress. It feels like we're getting closer, but we're doing it very slowly.\"\n\nPittsburgh made two big moves at quarterback this offseason, acquiring Russell Wilson and Justin Fields. No matter who starts, weapons will need to surround them to make the Steelers' offense go. George Pickens is certainly one, hoping to build off his first-ever 1,000-yard season in the NFL.\n\nAiyuk would seemingly fit in perfectly and potentially fit a No. 1 role. Being compensated as such is obviously a big desire as well. San Francisco may not be able to offer Aiyuk as much as somebody like Pittsburgh, Cleveland, or New England.\n\nPreseason games for the NFL will begin on Thursday. All three of the teams reportedly interested in Aiyuk will be in action and are a few weeks away from the regular season beginning. As Garafolo mentioned, the entire process is moving quite slowly, meaning Aiyuk will continue to wait to put on pads ahead of the 2024 season.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "griffin_mcveigh@on3.com", "name": "Griffin McVeigh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Bay_Area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Bay Area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796319", "eventUri": "eng-9796319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Aiyuk has been unhappy with this contract with the 49ers, has requested a trade and has made it known that the Steelers would be his top destination to be traded to.\n\nThe 49ers up to this point have been very reluctant to even entertain the idea of trading Aiyuk, but on Monday, a few reports surfaced that the 49ers are now indeed open to trading him. Andrew Fillipponi reported that the Steelers are indeed in the mix for Aiyuk. A number of national reporters like Adam Schefter reported that the Steelers were at least in the discussion as possible destinations.\n\nThere have also been reports that the Browns and Patriots are in the mix for Aiyuk and his services. NFL Network reported as of Monday evening that there was no deal in place for Aiyuk but that several teams, including the Steelers, are on some level in the mix and talking to the 49ers.\n\nI honestly will be incredibly shocked if the Steelers actually do make a deal to trade for Aiyuk. I know Omar Khan and Co. are doing things a little differently than their predecessors, but a deal like this feels like it would be a little too far out of the comfort zone for the Steelers.\n\nThey balked at paying Diontae Johnson more than $18 million per year. They never paid Antonio Brown $20 million per year. And now they are going to pay Aiyuk, who is nowhere close to the receiver Brown was, $30 million per year?\n\nI could totally see them making the trade for Aiyuk if there wasn't a requirement to give him a new contract that breaks the bank. The Steelers generally pay their own players big money once it is established they earned it but don't usually pay big money for other team's players.\n\nThey have changed their ways on some levels since Khan took over, but I have to see them pay a receiver from another team $30 million per year before I believe it. Maybe I am being too much of a cynic, but I don't think I am, and I am pretty sure this is a lot more wishful thinking than reality.\n\nLook, I have been wrong before. If I am wrong here, I will gladly admit it. But this just doesn't feel like a deal the Steelers are overly motivated to get done for a variety of reasons. The biggest of the reasons not to pay Aiyuk in the neighborhood of the $30 million per year that he wants is that the Steelers salary cap situation is likely going to change dramatically over the next two seasons.\n\nRight now, their offense is really cheap, but that won't be the case in the next two years.\n\nThe Steelers currently are paying Russell Wilson $1.21 million this year, Justin Fields $3.23 million and Kyle Allen $1.15 million, which means their quarterback position is costing them less than $6 million. That number is likely to increase significantly next year and beyond, and that's especially true if Fields, who so far in camp has taken almost all of the first-team reps, is the starter this season and plays well enough to merit a new contract with the Steelers.\n\nThere are some flights of fantasy that the Steelers could get Fields at some sort of a discount, but the going rate for a good quarterback is $40 million-plus. The going rate for a potential franchise quarterback is $50 million-plus. I am not saying Fields will command that much, but the top 16 quarterbacks in the NFL salary-wise all make $40 million or more. I can't imagine any scenario in which Fields gets a contract as a starter if he doesn't perform among the top half of starting quarterbacks.\n\nEven if Wilson is the starter and plays really well for the entire season and the Steelers decide they want to sign him to an extension, he won't come cheap. He likely wouldn't command the $40 million a younger player like Fields would, given his age, but I would imagine he would get a deal similar to Baker Mayfield, who is set to make $33 million per year. That is a huge jump in salary cap hit from what he costs them this year.\n\nI suppose there are other ways the Steelers could handle the quarterback position that are less expensive, but at some point, they are likely going to have to pay the piper at that position. Then there is a new deal for Cam Heyward likely in the works in the near future, as well as Broderick Jones (top tackles make $20 million-plus), Joey Porter Jr. (top corners make $18 million-plus) and then George Pickens (as we've established, top receivers cost in the neighborhood of $30 million).\n\nThat's not to say the Steelers can't fit a deal for Aiyuk under the salary cap, especially with the wizard of cap manipulation Khan in charge. But it may be tricky, as the Steelers are living a charmed life in terms of what they are paying their players on the offensive side of the ball currently.\n\nThere are some who believe the price tag in terms of trade return could be hefty for Aiyuk, but I don't. The Steelers rarely ever overpay or lose in a trade. And even if it costs a first-round draft pick to get Aiyuk, it is similar to the Minkah Fitzpatrick trade in that the Steelers would essentially be using a first-round pick to bring in a proven commodity, not a rookie with no track record.\n\nI don't think the cost to trade for Aiyuk will be too much, but I do think the price tag, especially if it does reach $30 million or so, is hefty. The salary cap space a deal like that would eat up could be significant considering he is a receiver and there are a number of positions that are higher on the priority list.\n\nAll of this for a player whose value to the Steelers is debatable versus what he costs in terms of salary and trade chips. Yes, he is a major upgrade over whoever the Steelers' second receiver is, but I don't think he is the kind of player who dramatically changes the game for the Steelers. He is coming off his best season, in which he had 1,342 yards and seven touchdowns, but he did so in a receiver-friendly offense. I am not sure how much that would translate to the Steelers.\n\nI definitely think Aiyuk is an upgrade, but I don't think he warrants the cost it would take to get him and keep him. The Steelers may actually pull off a trade for Aiyuk, but it won't shock me if this is more offseason rumor mill and wishful thinking than anything else.", "source": {"uri": "bradfordera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bradford Era"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diontae_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diontae Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Fields", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Fields"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Allen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Allen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Porter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joey Porter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Heyward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cameron Heyward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Mayfield", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baker Mayfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkah_Fitzpatrick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minkah Fitzpatrick"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/bradfordera.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/8/ed/8edaa718-5446-11ef-b332-375c03599c73/66b2a9805779d.image.jpg?crop=1739%2C913%2C0%2C139&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796319", "eventUri": "eng-9796319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Would Bourne alone be enough to pry Aiyuk away from the 49ers? Most likely not. Therefore, speculation is the only route to rely on until any ground-breaking developments see the light of day.\n\n\"I would think at least it would be a second (round pick) next year, Matthew Judon and possibly Kendrick Bourne,\" Boston Sports Journal's Greg Bedard suggested on NBC Sports Boston's \"Boston Sports Tonight.\" \"... Keion White is ready to take over for Matthew Judon. Matthew Judon's been a pain in the rear end, you get rid of that. Kendrick Bourne, I know San Francisco loves him. (49ers head coach) Kyle Shanahan loves him. He's still on PUP, I don't think he's coming off anytime soon. But if that's an additional carrot, I go for it.\"\n\nAiyuk -- an obvious upgrade over Bourne -- came just shy of a Super Bowl victory last season in San Francisco. Yet, following an offseason of both sides failing to find common ground on a long-term extension, the 26-year-old's availability sprung out of the ground, prompting teams such as the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns to rush to the negotiations table. New England, who's also been in the mix having eyed Aiyuk for the past few months, could provide him with two key incentives in Foxboro: The opportunity to be one of the NFL's highest-paid wide receivers and the role of being the team's No. 1 option. Enticing enough? We'll see.\n\nLast season, Aiyuk tallied a career-high 1,342 receiving yards with San Francisco while also totaling seven touchdowns on 105 targets. That level of production could potentially do wonders by New England's fresh new core of quarterbacks -- Jacoby Brissett, Drake Maye and Joe Milton III -- as first-year head coach Jerod Mayo looks to repair the franchise's identity. It was (very) clear that entering the offseason the Patriots needed some form of star power along with a quarterback to guide the team's future. Training camp and preseason action will perhaps indicate that second priority, but investing in Aiyuk will be the biggest tell sign that the Patriots aren't content will the dark cloud that's hovered over Gillette Stadium ever since Tom Brady's departure in 2020.\n\nIt's up to Aiyuk whether to pack his bags for New England or Cleveland", "source": {"uri": "nesn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NESN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gio_rivera@nesn.com", "name": "Gio Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Judon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Judon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Bourne", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kendrick Bourne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Boston", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Boston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Shanahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hispanic_whites", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Non-Hispanic whites"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_Maye", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drake Maye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Milton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Milton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacoby_Brissett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacoby Brissett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerod_Mayo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerod Mayo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillette_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gillette Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxborough,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Foxborough, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://nesn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/08/Brandon-Aiyuk-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796319", "eventUri": "eng-9796319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Curran and Phil Perry analyze the pros and cons to pursuing an Aiyuk trade.\n\nOne of the most talented wide receivers in the NFL is available on the trade market, and the New England Patriots are reportedly in the mix.\n\nThe six-time Super Bowl champions have many weaknesses on their roster. You could make a strong case they have more glaring needs than wide receiver. Left tackle immediately comes to mind. But it's painfully obvious that this team lacks true difference-makers on offense -- players who keep opposing defensive coordinators up at night.\n\nThe opportunities to acquire these kinds of stars are rare, so when you have a chance to get one, it's often foolish not to at least try.\n\nAnd in Aiyuk's case, it sounds like the Patriots are giving this pursuit a strong effort. The Patriots, Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers are among the teams in the mix for Aiyuk, per multiple reports, although it's unknown if any of those teams will be able to land the veteran wideout. Aiyuk wants a new contract, and if he's unwilling to sign long term with a particular team, it's going to be tough for that franchise to complete a trade.\n\nThe Patriots are one of the few teams able to offer Aiyuk the high salary he wants. They still have around $43 million in salary cap space, per OverTheCap, which is the second-most of any team.\n\nIn the latest episode of the Patriots Talk Podcast, our Patriots insider Phil Perry explained why New England should use its financial flexibility to surround rookie quarterback Drake Maye with expensive players at important positions, primarily wide receiver and left tackle.\n\n\"You have these different tools with which to build your team,\" Perry said. \"One is that 2025 first-round pick. One is all of this money you're still able to spend because you're not paying big dollars to a quarterback, a wide receiver, a tackle. ... You don't really have much money devoted to the edge of your defense or cornerback, either.\n\n\"So the most expensive positions in the sport, for the most part, you are not paying an expensive player. You have, even after all of these re-signings, so much money to spend. You could (acquire Aiyuk) and still go after a left tackle in free agency next year. That is feasible.\n\n\"This is your time to get wild with the spending because you have a young quarterback -- even if he's not going to play -- you have a young QB on a rookie contract. It's one of the most valuable things in sports, and it's why they have the flexibility to do something like Aiyuk and more at other positions around Maye. Give him that environment he needs to find out if he's good or not, to find out how good he can be. And then when it's time to pay him, then you can make decisions that correlate with how good he is as a player.\"\n\nNot only do the Patriots have the financial flexibility to pursue Aiyuk, acquiring a player of his caliber also could accelerate Maye's development. This is important because the Patriots did not surround their last first-round quarterback, Mac Jones, with enough high-end talent at the skill positions. New England cannot afford to make that same mistake with Maye, and there are many recent examples of teams giving a young QB a stud veteran wideout and making it work.\n\n\"We've seen the Bills take their highly drafted young quarterback (Josh Allen) and see him go up a significant level,\" Perry said. \"He went up a bit with Cole Beasley, then they added Stefon Diggs to the mix and he became one of the best quarterbacks in the league. Tua Tagovailoa, it goes without saying, they surrounded him with great offensive talent and a great offensive coaching staff, and his stats have gone through the roof. A.J. Brown and Jalen Hurts in Philadelphia (is another example).\"\n\nThere's no guarantee that Maye and Aiyuk would enjoy the same success as the aforementioned QB/WR duos, but it's probably worth taking the gamble to find out.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsportsboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mac Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Hurts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Hurts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefon_Diggs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stefon Diggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tua_Tagovailoa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tua Tagovailoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Allen_(quarterback)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Allen (quarterback)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Beasley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Beasley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.nbcsportsboston.com/2024/08/Brandon-Aiyuk-USATSI_19588311.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796319", "eventUri": "eng-9796319", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

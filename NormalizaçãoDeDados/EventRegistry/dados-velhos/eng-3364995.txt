There's Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, Prince William and Prince Harry's emotional ode, The Story of Diana, a grand, sweeping overture of her life, and Diana -- Her Story, the transatlantic doc with murky ethics.\n\nAnd last night, another joined the fold: Diana: In Her Own Words, on National Geographic.\n\nThere's plenty more Diana docs on the horizon. But National Geographic's stands out because it's completely narrated by Diana herself: the audio is supplied from the \"Morton tapes,\" or a series of secret interviews recorded by the Princess and sent to the journalist Andrew Morton.\n\nDone in 1991, the tapes (which were the basis for his 1992 bestselling book, Diana: Her True Story) catch the princess at a troubled time: plagued by tabloid rumors, hounded by the press, her marriage irrevocably broken. Diana: In Her Own Words revisits these scandals, but with Diana's own explanations, painting an intimate and raw portrait of one of the world's most famous women.\n\nBelow, are her most riveting and revealing quotes.\n\n\"I felt I was a lamb to the slaughter. And I knew it.\"\n\nOnly 19 years old when she married Prince Charles, Diana became a global celebrity overnight -- and, according to her, was woefully unprepared and unsupported. On her wedding day, she felt more like a sacrificial lamb rather than a blushing bride.\n\n\"I remember crying my heart out.\"\n\nOn the outside, Prince Charles and Princess Diana's honeymoon was a storybook one: they split their time between a yacht and the castle of Balmoral in the Scottish Highlands. Yet for Diana, it was misery. Overwhelmed with royal life wrecked with insecurity of Charles's feelings for Camilla (she claimed to catch him wearing cufflinks that she gave him, and spotted a photo of her in his diary), she turned to bulimia to cope.\n\n\"I threw myself down the stairs. Charles said I was crying wolf... and I said I just felt so desperate, and I started crying my eyes out. He said I'm not going to listen to this, you are always doing this to me, I'm going riding now. So I threw myself down the stairs. Bearing in my mind I was carrying a child.\"\n\nThis moment -- where Diana confesses her depression was so severe that she threw herself down stairs while pregnant with William -- is one of the darkest of the documentary. Yet, it's also one of the most groundbreaking. Simply put, no one talked about this kind of stuff in the nineties. They barely talk about it now. The fact that the Princess of Wales opened up about her mental health problems was game changing.\n\n\"I was 'a problem'. And they registered Diana as 'a problem'. She's different, she's doing everything that we never did. Why?\"\n\nDespite her blue blood background, it's been reported that Diana always felt like an outsider within the royal family. Yet it ran deeper than that: she felt like a \"problem.\"\n\nThis quote referenced Diana's morning sickness, which made her struggle through some official events. But it soon became to mean more: it was about her bulimia, her anxiety, her loneliness, all of which she felt the royal family ignored instead of helped with.\n\n\"I remember saying to myself, 'Right Diana. It's not good. You've got to change it right round, with this publicity.... You've been chosen to this position, so you must adapt to it and stop fighting it. And I knew I could it, if I chose a different angle.\"\n\nThanks to her natural warmth and charm, Diana's nickname was the \"People's Princess.\" In the documentary, Diana describes the day she decided to no longer be meek sidekick, but a celebrity who could change the world. Soon after, she made headlines for her signature stigma-shattering move: shaking an AIDS patient's hand without gloves.\n\n\"I said, 'Camilla I'd just like you to know that I know exactly what's going on.' And she said, 'I don't know what you're talking about.' And I said, 'I know what's going on between you and Charles, and I just want you to know that. . . don't treat me like an idiot.'\"\n\nFaced with damning evidence about her affair with Charles's, Diana finally confronted Camilla at a private birthday party. Camilla denied it, but she held her ground -- finally standing up to the other woman that wedged herself in her marriage.\n\n\"I am performing a duty as the Princess of Wales...but at least when I finish my, as I see it, my 12 or 15 years as Princess of Wales. I don't see it as any longer, funny enough...I always knew I would never be the next Queen, put it that way.\"\n\nThis quote, where Diana admits she never saw herself as the Queen of England, is sadly prophetic: she died six years later.\n\nStill need another Diana doc dose?

She was like a creature locked in a piece of amber. There forever -- beautiful, young, vulnerable and damaged,\" said royal biographer Penny Junor.\n\nBorn on July 1, 1961, Diana grew up in an aristocratic family with ties to the monarch -- her father worked for the late king George VI and Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nShe grew up with three siblings, in a childhood marred by the bitter break-up of her parents.\n\nShe left school at 16 with no qualifications and went to finishing school in Switzerland, before getting a job in a nursery in London.\n\nFrom the moment she was linked to Charles, however, her life changed.\n\nThe prince was under increasing pressure to find a bride, and at the age of 32, he proposed -- perhaps too soon.\n\nDiana said they only met 13 times before their wedding.\n\nShe quickly fulfilled her primary duty as princess, with the birth of an heir, William, the following year, followed by Harry two years later.\n\nDiana was a hands-on, adoring mother, and also possessed a remarkable empathy that drew people to her. Coupled with a strong sense of style, she rode a wave of popular and media enthusiasm for the monarchy.\n\nShe used her position to champion some of the most marginalised groups in society, shaking hands with patients with AIDS and leprosy, who were viewed as pariahs at the time.\n\nBut beneath the surface she was in turmoil, plagued by bulimia and wracked by self-doubt made worse by the feeling that her husband did not love her -- and the rest of the royals did not care.\n\nRumours that the marriage was in trouble broke into the open in 1992, after Andrew Morton lifted the lid on Diana's misery with a revelatory book, tactically endorsed by the princess herself.\n\nThat year ended with the bombshell announcement that the royal couple would separate.\n\nThe scandal only deepened with further recriminations and allegations appearing in the media, before first Charles and then Diana admitted to being unfaithful.\n\nIn her 1995 interview with the BBC's Panorama programme, Diana gave her version of events, admitting her affair with army officer James Hewitt, but also criticising the royals and questioning her husband's ability to be king.\n\nThis crossed a line. A few weeks later, the queen, who had already publicly expressed her sadness at the situation, wrote to both Charles and Diana urging them to seek a divorce.\n\nOn August 28, 1996, the divorce was granted and Diana was stripped of her title of Her Royal Highness. The fairytale was over. Still a princess, Diana remained in the public eye.\n\nShe found new love in Dodi Fayed, the son of millionaire businessman Mohamed Al Fayed, who was also killed with her on August 31, 1997, as their car was chased by paparazzi through the streets of Paris.\n\nThe outpouring of public grief was immense.\n\nMillions of flowers were left outside her home at Kensington Palace, and thousands lined the streets of London to pay their last respects at her funeral.\n\nMuch of the popular anger over her death was directed at the royal family, fuelled by the queen's initial refusal to return to London to greet the crowds, and there was a surge of republicanism.\n\nTwo decades on, public support for the monarchy is as strong as ever and Charles -- with Camilla -- has to a large extent been rehabilitated.\n\nBut neither will likely ever match the popularity of his first wife, the self-styled \"queen of people's hearts\".", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location":

She was like a creature locked in a piece of amber. There forever -- beautiful, young, vulnerable and damaged,\" said royal biographer Penny Junor.\n\nBorn on July 1, 1961, Diana grew up in an aristocratic family with ties to the monarch -- her father worked for the late king George VI and Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nShe grew up with three siblings, in a childhood marred by the bitter break-up of her parents.\n\nShe left school at 16 with no qualifications and went to finishing school in Switzerland, before getting a job in a nursery in London.\n\nFrom the moment she was linked to Charles, however, her life changed.\n\nThe prince was under increasing pressure to find a bride, and at the age of 32, he proposed -- perhaps too soon.\n\nDiana said they only met 13 times before their wedding.\n\nShe quickly fulfilled her primary duty as princess, with the birth of an heir, William, the following year, followed by Harry two years later.\n\nDiana was a hands-on, adoring mother, and also possessed a remarkable empathy that drew people to her. Coupled with a strong sense of style, she rode a wave of popular and media enthusiasm for the monarchy.\n\nShe used her position to champion some of the most marginalized groups in society, shaking hands with patients with AIDS and leprosy, who were viewed as pariahs at the time.\n\nBut beneath the surface she was in turmoil, plagued by bulimia and wracked by self-doubt made worse by the feeling that her husband did not love her -- and the rest of the royals did not care.\n\nRumors that the marriage was in trouble broke into the open in 1992, after Andrew Morton lifted the lid on Diana's misery with a revelatory book, tactically endorsed by the princess herself.\n\nThat year ended with the bombshell announcement that the royal couple would separate.\n\nThe scandal only deepened with further recriminations and allegations appearing in the media, before first Charles and then Diana admitted to being unfaithful.\n\nIn her 1995 interview with the BBC's Panorama program, Diana gave her version of events, admitting her affair with army officer James Hewitt, but also criticizing the royals and questioning her husband's ability to be king.\n\nThis crossed a line. A few weeks later, the queen, who had already publicly expressed her sadness at the situation, wrote to both Charles and Diana urging them to seek a divorce.\n\nOn August 28, 1996, the divorce was granted and Diana was stripped of her title of Her Royal Highness. The fairytale was over.\n\nStill a princess, Diana remained in the public eye.\n\nShe found new love in Dodi Fayed, the son of millionaire businessman Mohamed Al Fayed, who was also killed with her on August 31, 1997, as their car was chased by paparazzi through the streets of Paris.\n\nThe outpouring of public grief was immense.\n\nMillions of flowers were left outside her home at Kensington Palace, and thousands lined the streets of London to pay their last respects at her funeral.\n\nMuch of the popular anger over her death was directed at the royal family, fueled by the queen's initial refusal to return to London to greet the crowds, and there was a surge of republicanism.\n\nTwo decades on, public support for the monarchy is as strong as ever and Charles -- with Camilla -- has to a large extent been rehabilitated.\n\nBut neither will likely ever match the popularity of his first wife, the self-styled \"queen of people's hearts\".", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [],

And in the upcoming PBS special Diana - Her Story, producers uncover rare video of Diana telling the unlikely story of how she -- a shy, unassuming teenager -- caught the eye of Queen Elizabeth's eldest son Prince Charles, forever changing her fate from private teacher to public figurehead.\n\n\"When the [relationship] really started to get serious . . . I must have been 18 and a half,\" the late princess recalls in the special premiering August 22. \"I was asked to stay with some friends in Sussex, and they said, 'Oh, the Prince of Wales is staying the night because he's playing polo.' So I thought, 'Well, I haven't seen him for ages, he's just broken up with his girlfriend; [his great-uncle Lord] Mountbatten's just been killed. And I said it will be nice to see him.\"\n\nDiana goes on to recount her experience reuniting with Prince Charles in Sussex in 1980, and how it was different from her previous brush with the royal in 1977, when he was dating Diana's older sister, Lady Sarah.\n\n\"I thought, 'I am quite impressed this time around,' \" Diana says, before sharing how her future husband -- 13 years her senior -- came on quite strongly that evening, \"like a bad rash . . . following me around like a puppy.\"\n\nThe first clip from the documentary, which was shared exclusively with Vanity Fair, includes archival footage of a teenage Diana being bombarded by press who badger the blushing future princess on the street with questions about a possible engagement.\n\nThe excerpt also reveals Diana and her friend James Colthurst reflecting on her unusual courtship with Charles, as well as her pre-princess days living in a flat on Old Brompton Road.\n\n\"I was so happy there,\" Diana says. \"I had three girls living with me. I had the best time of my life.\"\n\nDiana - Her Story includes additional footage of Princess Diana speaking candidly about her days before, during, and after her troubled marriage to Prince Charles, as well as interviews with Diana's closest friends.\n\nTo read about the other Princess Diana specials this month -- celebrating the late royal on the 20th anniversary of her death -- click here.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "wgt": 100, "id": 114, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing", "wgt": 100, "id": 245, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100, "id": 246, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/AudioVisual", "wgt": 100, "id": 655, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/AudioVisual"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304376", "label": {"eng": "Vanity Fair (magazine)"}}, {"location": null, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sussex", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sussex"}, "type": "loc", "id": "304514"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "305633", "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306262", "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306297", "label": {"eng": "Kindergarten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "309503", "label": {"eng": "Teacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "318988", "label": {"eng": "PBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "328830", "label": {"eng": "Polo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "330715", "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345182", "label": {"eng": "Princess"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "354698", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "358170", "label": {"eng": "Courtship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "365004", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Sarah_Chatto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "378078", "label": {"eng": "Lady Sarah Chatto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "381491", "label": {"eng": "Diana (mythology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badger", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "389321", "label": {"eng": "Badger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Mountbatten,_1st_Earl_Mountbatten_of_Burma", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "413032", "label": {"eng": "Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nobility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "503375", "label": {"eng": "British nobility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Brompton_Road", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1151784", "label": {"eng": "Old Brompton Road"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Story_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "1330492", "label": {"eng": "Her Story (video game)"}}]}

The latest, National Geographic's \"Diana: In Her Own Words,\" takes audio snipes from a series of interviews Diana conducted for a book Andrew Morton was writing in 1991. The most recent revelation to come out of the documentary takes aim at Diana's marriage to Prince Charles -- specifically the wedding and how she felt even before they said \"I do.\"\n\nIn National Geographic's \"Diana: In Her Own Words,\" which aired last night, Princess Diana is said to almost have called off the royal wedding of the century. In her own words, Diana discusses how she felt right after becoming engaged to Prince Charles. \"I went upstairs, had lunch with my sisters who were there, and I said, 'I can't marry him. I can't do this. This is absolutely unbelievable. And they were wonderful and said, 'Well, bad luck, Duch. Your face is on the tea towel, so you're too late to chicken out,'\" Diana revealed.\n\nThe royal couple was married in 1981, with over 750 million people all over the world tuning in for the first televised royal wedding, and with all the cameras pointed at her, and her now iconic wedding dress, it's no wonder the Princess described that day as \"the worst day of my life.\"\n\nRelief didn't come for Diana after the pomp and circumstance of the world's most famous wedding (until then). \"I remember crying my heart out on my honeymoon,\" she said in the tapes.

(Reuter file photo)\n\nBut for many ordinary people, her troubles -- revived once again in a slew of new documentaries and interviews -- made her only more popular.\n\n\"Like Marilyn Monroe, she has frozen in time. She was like a creature locked in a piece of amber. There forever -- beautiful, young, vulnerable and damaged,\" said royal biographer Penny Junor.\n\nBorn on July 1, 1961, Diana grew up in an aristocratic family with ties to the monarch -- her father worked for the late king George VI and Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nShe grew up with three siblings, in a childhood marred by the bitter break-up of her parents.\n\nShe left school at 16 with no qualifications and went to finishing school in Switzerland, before getting a job in a nursery in London.\n\nFrom the moment she was linked to Charles, however, her life changed.\n\nThe prince was under increasing pressure to find a bride, and at the age of 32, he proposed -- perhaps too soon.\n\nDiana said they only met 13 times before their wedding.\n\nShe quickly fulfilled her primary duty as princess, with the birth of an heir, William, the following year, followed by Harry two years later.\n\nThis file photo taken on August 19, 1995 shows Britain's Diana, Princess of Wales (L), and her sons Prince Harry, (C) and Prince William. (AFP)\n\nDiana was a hands-on, adoring mother, and also possessed a remarkable empathy that drew people to her. Coupled with a strong sense of style, she rode a wave of popular and media enthusiasm for the monarchy.\n\nShe used her position to champion some of the most marginalised groups in society, shaking hands with patients with AIDS and leprosy, who were viewed as pariahs at the time.\n\nBut beneath the surface she was in turmoil, plagued by bulimia and wracked by self-doubt made worse by the feeling that her husband did not love her -- and the rest of the royals did not care.\n\nRumours that the marriage was in trouble broke into the open in 1992, after Andrew Morton lifted the lid on Diana's misery with a revelatory book, tactically endorsed by the princess herself.\n\nThat year ended with the bombshell announcement that the royal couple would separate.\n\nThe scandal only deepened with further recriminations and allegations appearing in the media, before first Charles and then Diana admitted to being unfaithful.\n\nIn her 1995 interview with the BBC's Panorama programme, Diana gave her version of events, admitting her affair with army officer James Hewitt, but also criticising the royals and questioning her husband's ability to be king.\n\nThis crossed a line. A few weeks later, the queen, who had already publicly expressed her sadness at the situation, wrote to both Charles and Diana urging them to seek a divorce.\n\nOn August 28, 1996, the divorce was granted and Diana was stripped of her title of Her Royal Highness. The fairytale was over.\n\nThe combination of file photos of Princess Diana (AFP)\n\nStill a princess, Diana remained in the public eye.\n\nShe found new love in Dodi Fayed, the son of millionaire businessman Mohamed Al Fayed, who was also killed with her on August 31, 1997, as their car was chased by paparazzi through the streets of Paris.\n\nThe outpouring of public grief was immense.\n\nMillions of flowers were left outside her home at Kensington Palace, and thousands lined the streets of London to pay their last respects at her funeral.\n\nMuch of the popular anger over her death was directed at the royal family, fuelled by the queen's initial refusal to return to London to greet the crowds, and there was a surge of republicanism.\n\nTwo decades on, public support for the monarchy is as strong as ever and Charles -- with Camilla -- has to a large extent been rehabilitated.\n\nBut neither will likely ever match the popularity of his first wife, the self-styled \"queen of people's hearts\".\n\nGet latest news & live updates on the go on your pc with News App. Download The Times of India news app for your device.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [],

She was like a creature locked in a piece of amber. There forever -- beautiful, young, vulnerable and damaged,\" said royal biographer Penny Junor.\n\n- 13 dates before marriage -\n\nBorn on July 1, 1961, Diana grew up in an aristocratic family with ties to the monarch -- her father worked for the late king George VI and Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nShe grew up with three siblings, in a childhood marred by the bitter break-up of her parents.\n\nShe left school at 16 with no qualifications and went to finishing school in Switzerland, before getting a job in a nursery in London.\n\nFrom the moment she was linked to Charles, however, her life changed.\n\nThe prince was under increasing pressure to find a bride, and at the age of 32, he proposed -- perhaps too soon.\n\nDiana said they only met 13 times before their wedding.\n\nShe quickly fulfilled her primary duty as princess, with the birth of an heir, William, the following year, followed by Harry two years later.\n\nDiana was a hands-on, adoring mother, and also possessed a remarkable empathy that drew people to her. Coupled with a strong sense of style, she rode a wave of popular and media enthusiasm for the monarchy.\n\nShe used her position to champion some of the most marginalised groups in society, shaking hands with patients with AIDS and leprosy, who were viewed as pariahs at the time.\n\nBut beneath the surface she was in turmoil, plagued by bulimia and wracked by self-doubt made worse by the feeling that her husband did not love her -- and the rest of the royals did not care.\n\n- Crossed a line -\n\nRumours that the marriage was in trouble broke into the open in 1992, after Andrew Morton lifted the lid on Diana's misery with a revelatory book, tactically endorsed by the princess herself.\n\nThat year ended with the bombshell announcement that the royal couple would separate.\n\nThe scandal only deepened with further recriminations and allegations appearing in the media, before first Charles and then Diana admitted to being unfaithful.\n\nIn her 1995 interview with the BBC's Panorama programme, Diana gave her version of events, admitting her affair with army officer James Hewitt, but also criticising the royals and questioning her husband's ability to be king.\n\nThis crossed a line. A few weeks later, the queen, who had already publicly expressed her sadness at the situation, wrote to both Charles and Diana urging them to seek a divorce.\n\nOn August 28, 1996, the divorce was granted and Diana was stripped of her title of Her Royal Highness. The fairytale was over.\n\n- 'Queen of people's hearts' -\n\nStill a princess, Diana remained in the public eye.\n\nShe found new love in Dodi Fayed, the son of millionaire businessman Mohamed Al Fayed, who was also killed with her on August 31, 1997, as their car was chased by paparazzi through the streets of Paris.\n\nThe outpouring of public grief was immense.\n\nMillions of flowers were left outside her home at Kensington Palace, and thousands lined the streets of London to pay their last respects at her funeral.\n\nMuch of the popular anger over her death was directed at the royal family, fuelled by the queen's initial refusal to return to London to greet the crowds, and there was a surge of republicanism.\n\nTwo decades on, public support for the monarchy is as strong as ever and Charles -- with Camilla -- has to a large extent been rehabilitated.\n\nBut neither will likely ever match the popularity of his first wife, the self-styled \"queen of people's hearts\".", "date":

The visual imagery will be overlaid with Diana's voice, played directly from the transcriptions.\n\nREAD MORE: Princess Diana TV special set to examine death conspiracy theories\n\nShe discusses a variety of topics, including how she and Prince Charles met, his relationship with now-wife Camilla Parker Bowles, her personal battle with bulimia and her occasional thoughts of suicide. Of course, she describes at length how the pressure of suddenly becoming a royal was almost unbearable.\n\nDiana is very candid on her courtship with Prince Charles, saying at the beginning, he was \"all over [her] like a rash.\"\n\nAfter the pair were married, Diana describes an isolation from both her own family and her new royal family; this is when she developed bulimia.\n\n\"Everybody knew about the bulimia in the family,\" she says in the recordings. \"They all blamed the failure of the marriage on the bulimia, and that's taken some time to get them to think differently.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Princess Diana's brother 'pleads' with U.K. broadcaster not to air candid recordings\n\nIn one of the more jaw-dropping confessions, Diana says she confronted Bowles about the affair she was having with Prince Charles.\n\n\"I'm sorry I'm in the way,\" she supposedly said to Bowles. \"I'm in the way, and it must be hell for both of you. But I do know what's going on, don't treat me like an idiot.\"\n\nDiana's brother, Earl Spencer, has reportedly reached out to Britain's Channel 4 and asked them not to air the recordings due to the pain it will cause her sons.\n\n\"The excerpts have never been shown before on television and are an important historical source,\" said a spokesperson for Channel 4. \"We carefully considered all the material used in the documentary and, though the recordings were made in private, the subjects covered are a matter of public record and provide a unique insight into the preparations Diana undertook to gain a public voice and tell her own personal story. This unique portrait of Diana gives her a voice and places it front and centre at a time when the nation will be reflecting on her life and death.\"\n\nPrincess Diana died in a car crash in Paris, France, on Aug. 31, 1997.\n\n(You can watch the trailer and hear snippets of the recordings in the video, above.)\n\n'Diana: In Her Own Words' airs on National Geographic on Monday, Aug. 14 at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nFollow @CJancelewicz", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Music", "wgt": 100, "id": 55, "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Music"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings", "wgt": 100, "id": 57, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Recordings"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "wgt": 100, "id": 60, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "wgt": 100, "id": 96, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Archives", "wgt": 100, "id": 1683, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Archives"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Reference/Archives/Regional", "wgt": 100, "id": 1732, "label": "dmoz/Reference/Archives/Regional"}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302838", "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303328", "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306136", "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306262", "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "312962", "label": {"eng": "Channel 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "330715", "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345550", "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulimia_nervosa", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "352692", "label": {"eng": "Bulimia nervosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "354698", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "381491", "label": {"eng": "Diana (mythology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla,_Duchess_of_Cornwall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "512622", "label": {"eng": "Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "540611", "label": {"eng": "Death of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponsored_Content_(South_Park)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "1283290", "label": {"eng": "Sponsored Content (South Park)"}}]}

PBS is no different, airing \"Diana -- Her Story\" on Aug. 22 at 7 p.m. MT on KUED.\n\nSince the film is, as it states, \"her story,\" it unapologetically tells the tale of Diana's time as royalty from her perspective, often at the expense of the United Kingdom's monarchy.\n\nLike some of the other new documentaries, \"Diana -- Her Story\" features rare footage from Diana's 1992 interviews with her speech coach, Peter Settelen, whom she hired to help reinvent her public persona after her divorce from Prince Charles.\n\nThe 54-minute show portrays Diana's point of view through her private sessions with Settelen and modern interviews with some of her closest friends: her confidant James Colthurst, her ballet teacher Anne Allan, her private secretary Patrick Jephson and her personal protection officer Ken Wharfe.\n\nFollowing Diana's life from when Charles courted the 18-year-old to her tragic early death at 36 in a car accident in Paris, the film neither attempts to make a complete summary of what happened during that time nor does it show the monarchy's perspective of Diana or her story. All focus is given to Diana.\n\nThose who are less familiar with the drama that took place among Diana, Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles may find some details lacking. The film assumes the viewer comes with a certain amount of background knowledge, perhaps especially considering that, at the time of her death in 1997, Diana was considered to be one of the most famous women in the world.\n\nTwo decades later, \"Diana -- Her Story\" does not try to reiterate what has already been said but attempts to find something new to say about the \"people's princess\" -- a difficult task. Much of the story is familiar: A young, naive Diana loved the prince she married, expecting the fairy tale the media promised. Sadly, it wasn't long before she discovered Charles' long-term affair with Parker Bowles and, in despair, turned to bulimia, because, as she said in the film, \"I chose to hurt myself instead of hurting (the monarchy).\"\n\nSome of the more shocking revelations from the new footage include marriage advice Diana received from the queen. When Diana asked Queen Elizabeth II what she should do about her husband's affair, the monarch told her she didn't know and that \"Charles is hopeless.\" Diana also told Settelen that even Charles' father, Prince Philip, had told his eldest son he could always go back to Parker Bowles if his marriage didn't work out.\n\nIt is inspiring to hear from Diana about her decision to \"cut her own path\" after she and Charles separated. The monarchy is portrayed as the villain during this time, as those closest to Diana explain how the future king feared having to compete with his ex-wife for popular appeal.\n\nOne of the loveliest aspects of the film is the portrayal of Diana's love of dance, including a mention that if she hadn't been a princess she would have been a dancer. A beautiful montage of \"Swan Lake\" -- the ballet Diana saw at one of her last public appearances before she died two months later -- and footage of Diana's time as princess toward the end of the film create an emotional experience. The viewer is left wondering what Diana's life could have been if she'd had the chance early on to define it for herself.\n\nThe most scathing view on the monarchy comes at the end from Jephson when he says, \"A lot of the things that I admired about the monarchy for me died with the Princess of Wales.\" He said he was particularly upset by the way the monarchy treated her before she passed away.\n\nCertainly, the monarchy isn't given a chance to defend itself in this case, but the documentary never pretends to do anything but show Diana's story through her eyes.\n\nContent advisory:

(File photo) Princess Diana's letters may fetch over USD 125,000 at auctionBritish princes discuss their mother Diana in new documentaryPrincess Diana's personal items to go on display at Buckingham Palace to mark her 20th death anniversary\n\nPublic anger at the monarchy following the death of Princess Diana marked a turning point for the royal family, forcing a revolution in its communications machine that helped revive the brand. As mourners left thousands of bouquets of flowers at the gates of Buckingham Palace and nearby Kensington Palace, after Diana's death on August 31, 1997, the royal family were nowhere to be seen.\n\nPrince Charles, divorced from Diana, and his mother Queen Elizabeth II remained at their Scottish residence of Balmoral, saying nothing for days. Despite the British public's mounting anger at the royal response or lack thereof it was not until the day before Diana's funeral that the queen finally broke her silence with a live broadcast to the nation.\n\nThe monarch's distance from the public outpouring of grief for the woman dubbed the \"people's princess\" by then prime minister Tony Blair caused resentment. Having been immersed in protocol and tradition for centuries, the royals quickly realised they were in urgent need of an image overhaul.\n\nIn her tribute to Diana, the queen said: \"I for one believe that there are lessons to be drawn from her life and from the extraordinary and moving reaction to her death.\" The result was royals \"having to become more professional, and having to take real control and take outside advice and better professional people,\" public relations expert Mark Borkowski told AFP.\n\nThe out-of-touch Buckingham Palace press office, which Borkowski remembers used to close over the weekends while some of the most interesting Diana stories unfolded, underwent a shake-up.\n\nSluggish employees were replaced with PR-savvy professionals. Patrick Jephson, Diana's former private secretary, said the current image of the monarchy was the product of a \"very sophisticated news management campaign\".\n\nThe current media strategy focusses on distributing positive information about the monarchy, while at the same time protecting the royals' privacy. One of the first tasks post-Diana was to create a more \"human\" image for the queen, who had been reported as being more concerned about her dogs and horses than her citizens.\n\nCharles, mocked for being haughty and stiff, has also gone through a revamp since his ex-wife's death. \"He has spent an enormous amount of money hiring very sophisticated, professional, political-style spin doctors to manage his image,\" Jephson said.\n\nThe investment has paid off, with the public's gradual acceptance of Charles's relationship with his former mistress Camilla, whom he married in 2005.\n\nFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App\n\nTags: British Royals Princess Diana", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100, "id": 355, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "84296"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302736", "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303765", "label": {"eng": "Family (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303766", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304369", "label": {"eng": "Information"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "305625", "label": {"eng": "Tony Blair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "305814", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "306327", "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308000", "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308814", "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "330715", "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345550", "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "354698", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "381491", "label": {"eng": "Diana (mythology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmoral_Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "394320", "label": {"eng": "Balmoral Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "515977", "label": {"eng": "Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "540611", "label": {"eng": "Death of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Borkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "545147", "label": {"eng": "Mark Borkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managing_the_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1121815", "label": {"eng": "Managing the news"}}]}

When Prince William tucks in tiny heirs George, 4, and Charlotte, 2, he regales them with tales of his late mother, Princess Diana. His eldest is particularly fond of the narrations. \"George loves to hear stories about the trips and adventures Diana went on,\" a source close to William, 35, and his wife, Duchess Kate reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly. \"By sharing memories, both children, especially George, have been able to feel a connection to her.\"\n\nThey're hardly alone. Two decades after the then-36-year-old princess and her film producer boyfriend Dodi Al Fayed perished in an August 31, 1997 car crash, the People's Princess still captivates. More than 6 million viewers tuned in to watch ABC's two-night documentary, The Story of Diana -- just one of many TV specials dedicated to the anniversary of her passing -- to glean new details about the charming princess.\n\n\"Obviously 99.9 percent of the people had never seen her or met her, but they felt something in her that was fascinating and intriguing and a force for good,\" her brother Lord Charles Spencer, 53, explained in the special. \"Diana deserves a place in history. This was a special person.\"\n\nOne with an extraordinary story. Prince Charles' courtship of the kindergarten teaching assistant -- the sister of his ex-flame -- was laced with formalities. Diana called the future king \"sir\" and spent just 12 dates with him before he proposed at Buckingham Palace in February 1981. When he and Diana later showed off her new 18-carat sparkler, she told reporters she was \"of course\" in love with her fianc\u00e9, causing him to crack, \"Whatever loves means.\"\n\nLittle improved after their fairy-tale vows. In recordings, Diana has said she developed an eating disorder after her husband called her chubby. And then there's what she called \"the Camilla thing\" -- Charles' affair with now-wife Camilla Parker Bowles. By the time the princess learned she was expecting William, their marriage was in such a state, \"I threw myself down the stairs,\" she revealed in footage that aired in National Geographic's Diana: In Her Own Words. \"I just felt so desperate.\"\n\nBut it was Prince Harry's 1984 birth that spelled the end of their duo's troubled marriage. \"As suddenly as Harry was born,\" Diana said, \"it just went bang, our marriage.

She was like a creature locked in a piece of amber. There forever -- beautiful, young, vulnerable and damaged,\" said royal biographer Penny Junor.\n\n13 DATES BEFORE MARRIAGE\n\nBorn on July 1, 1961, Diana grew up in an aristocratic family with ties to the monarch -- her father worked for the late king George VI and Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nShe grew up with three siblings, in a childhood marred by the bitter break-up of her parents.\n\nShe left school at 16 with no qualifications and went to finishing school in Switzerland, before getting a job in a nursery in London.\n\nFrom the moment she was linked to Charles, however, her life changed.\n\nThe prince was under increasing pressure to find a bride, and at the age of 32, he proposed -- perhaps too soon.\n\nDiana said they only met 13 times before their wedding.\n\nPRIMARY DUTIES\n\nShe quickly fulfilled her primary duty as princess, with the birth of an heir, William, the following year, followed by Harry two years later.\n\nDiana was a hands-on, adoring mother, and also possessed a remarkable empathy that drew people to her.\n\nCoupled with a strong sense of style, she rode a wave of popular and media enthusiasm for the monarchy.\n\nShe used her position to champion some of the most marginalised groups in society, shaking hands with patients with AIDS and leprosy, who were viewed as pariahs at the time.\n\nBut beneath the surface she was in turmoil, plagued by bulimia and wracked by self-doubt made worse by the feeling that her husband did not love her -- and the rest of the royals did not care.\n\nCROSSED A LINE\n\nRumours that the marriage was in trouble broke into the open in 1992, after Andrew Morton lifted the lid on Diana's misery with a revelatory book, tactically endorsed by the princess herself.\n\nThat year ended with the bombshell announcement that the royal couple would separate.\n\nThe scandal only deepened with further recriminations and allegations appearing in the media, before first Charles and then Diana admitted to being unfaithful.\n\nIn her 1995 interview with the BBC's Panorama programme, Diana gave her version of events, admitting her affair with army officer James Hewitt, but also criticising the royals and questioning her husband's ability to be king.\n\nThis crossed a line.\n\nA few weeks later, the queen, who had already publicly expressed her sadness at the situation, wrote to both Charles and Diana urging them to seek a divorce.\n\nOn August 28, 1996, the divorce was granted and Diana was stripped of her title of Her Royal Highness. The fairy tale was over.\n\nQUEEN OF PEOPLE'S HEARTS\n\nStill a princess, Diana remained in the public eye.\n\nShe found new love in Dodi Fayed, the son of millionaire businessman Mohamed Al Fayed, who was also killed with her on August 31, 1997, as their car was chased by paparazzi through the streets of Paris.\n\nThe outpouring of public grief was immense.\n\nMillions of flowers were left outside her home at Kensington Palace, and thousands lined the streets of London to pay their last respects at her funeral.\n\nMuch of the popular anger over her death was directed at the royal family, fuelled by the queen's initial refusal to return to London to greet the crowds, and there was a surge of republicanism.\n\nTwo decades on, public support for the monarchy is as strong as ever and Charles -- with Camilla -- has to a large extent been rehabilitated.\n\nBut neither will likely ever match the popularity of his first wife, the self-styled \"queen of people's hearts\".", "date":

One bear described as in \"near mint\" condition is listed for $507,000. And it's not the only bear with a six-figure price tag.\n\nBut as antiques appraiser Lori Verderame, who has appeared on Discovery Channel's Auction Kings, advises, an item's worth should be based on what it's actually sold for. \"When you see... $507,000, that's not credible because you have to find a sales record for someone (who) actually paid the bill for that.\"\n\nThe sold for prices tell another story.\n\nIn July, a version of the bear -- because yes, there are different versions -- sold for $1,000. Another sold that same month for just $1.\n\nSo how much is your Princess really worth? As Dr. Lori explains a \"magic number doesn't exist\" as many factors come into play, including the condition and version of the bear. Is the tag still attached or has it fallen off? Also, different versions of the Princess bear were made in different parts of the world with different materials. Dr. Lori says a bear filled with PVC pellets \"is key to the high evaluation.\"\n\nThe upcoming 20-year anniversary of Princess Diana's death on Aug. 31 makes now an ideal time to sell, she advises.\n\n\"These two weeks before the end of August... is really the time when people should be focusing on 'This is the time to sell my Diana Beanie Baby,' because the market only spikes at certain times -- usually at 25 years, 50 years, 100 years,\" she says.\n\nTo those perusing eBay for a Princess bear, Dr. Lori issues a warning about sellers. \"They're not gonna tell you what it's really worth because they want you to buy it for the highest price possible.\"\n\nDr, Lori explains the hope that one's Beanie Baby collection could be valuable shouldn't be lost. \"Anytime you have such big numbers of production, you're gonna have some that are worth less than others,\" Dr. Lori reasons, \"But because it's a Beanie Baby, we all think automatically, 'Oh it can't be worth anything,' and that's really a mistake.\"\n\nFor future collections, focusing on items that have a historical context is a good rule of thumb, according to Dr. Lori. \"Collect stuff that relates to history,\" she says, \"because it will increase in value.\"\n\nMore: More photos of Princess Diana, her sons released from personal collection\n\nMore: Princess Diana TV programming, books to mark 20th anniversary of her death\n\nRemembering Princess Diana Fullscreen Princess Diana was born into a British noble family as the Honorable Diana Spencer, daughter of John Spencer, Eighth Earl of Spencer.

But the relationship was cut short after not quite two months following a lavish vacation together on a yacht in the French Riviera.\n\nThe pair died together in a car crash in Paris that Dodi's father Mohamed long asserted was a conspiracy executed by British intelligence organisation MI6 under the orders of Prince Philip.\n\nHasnat Khan (1995-1997)\n\nHasnat was the antithesis of Dodi - extremely private, not ostentatious in any way, and sombre. He was in a secret romance with Diana for two years and they were largely unknown as a couple. They spent the majority of their time together in Kensington Palace - where they could avoid the paparazzi and would occasionally venture out together in Hasnat's Chelsea neighbourhood with Diana disguised in a dark wig and sunglasses.\n\nHasnat was a modestly paid junior surgeon employed by the NHS when he and Diana met. He worked 90-hour weeks and usually wanted to sleep when he got home. According to Diana's friend Rosa Monckton, Hasnat was the one who initiated the breakup over their vastly different lives and her subsequent relationship with Dodi was to make Hasnat jealous.\n\nJames Hewitt (1986-1991)\n\nRumours of infidelity began swirling in the early 90s as Prince Charles and Diana's marriage began to crack in public. Charles had been having a longstanding extramarital affair with now-wife Camilla Parker-Bowles, and Diana later began an extra-marital relationship with Major James Hewitt that lasted five years.\n\nIn 1995, six months after his retirement from the military, writer Anna Pastemark published the book Princess in Love with Hewitt as a major source. It alleged that Hewitt had romanced Diana from 1986 to 1991. Diana confirmed the affair in her 1995 Panorama interview.\n\nBarry Mannakee (1985)\n\nA recent Channel 4 documentary called Diana: In Her Own Words, revealed the extent of her affair with bodyguard Barry Mannakee, who was married with two children. It claimed that she \"fell deeply in love\" with him but said she did not have sex with him. Prince Charles's close sources believe otherwise.\n\nDiana candidly recalls the love affair and admits she was \"playing with fire\" and \"got burned\".\n\nShe said: \"I was quite happy to give it all up... just to go off and live with him. Can you believe it? And he kept saying he thought it was a good idea too.\"\n\nDiana added: \"When I was 24, 25, I fell deeply in love with somebody who worked in this environment.\"\n\n\"And it was all found out and he was chucked out and then he was killed. And that was the biggest blow of my life I must say.\"\n\nMannakee died in a road traffic accident shortly after their affair in 1987.\n\nOliver Hoare (1992)\n\nThe Islamic art dealer and friend of Prince Charles became close to Diana in 1992 - and was 16 years her senior. He was a suave aristocrat and Diana became \"obsessed\" with him, according to People.\n\nThings turned bizarre when Hoare was spotted by one of Diana's bodyguards \"semi-naked behind a potted bay tree in a Kensington Palace corridor, smoking a cigar,\" Daily Mail reported.\n\nHe was scared off the romance after receiving a series of what were described by police as \"nuisance calls\" - allegedly from Diana herself.\n\nJames Gilbey (1992-1993)\n\nThe car salesman was a supposed paramour during Diana's marriage and the centre of the \"Squidgygate\" scandal after being caught on tape having intimate phone conversations with the Princess.\n\nHe called her \"darling\" and most famously \"Squidgy\" - which caused an uproar when the tapes were leaked to the British press and put enough strain on the relationship to end it.\n\nPrince Charles (1981-1996)\n\nDiana first met Charles, Prince of Wales, when she was 16 in 1977. At the time he was dating her older sister, Lady Sarah. They began courting during the summer of 1980 and they had only met 13 times, according to Diana, before they married on 29 July 1981 at St Paul's Cathedral.\n\nThe couple had two sons from the marriage, Princes William and Harry, but the couple's incompatibility and age difference of almost 13 years rose to the surface after five years.\n\nMarital difficulties were first reported in 1985 before rumours of affairs emerged, and they publicly separated in 1992 before officially divorcing in 1996.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100,

First, as a style icon, a modern designer's muse, and in a fashion exhibition at Kensington Palace. And second, as a documentary subject, in the widely publicised Diana, Our Mother and Diana, In Her Own Words.\n\nThese are all competing versions of \"the Diana story\". The fashion icon status depoliticises her life (and death) to reposition her within consumer culture. The documentaries politicise her as a wife, mother and victim.\n\nBut who gets to narrate her story? In her life and death, multiple actors have stepped forward. Her former butler, Paul Burrell, wheels out his version whenever someone gives him airtime. Britain's tabloid press have seemingly (and conveniently) forgotten the way they treated her and accused the broadcaster of Diana, In Her Own Words of exploitation. The monarchy have tried to celebrate her life in the least provocative way possible, using her wardrobe and jewellery. Even her sons, William and Harry, have offered their personal story of what happened in the lead up to her death.\n\nAside from her famous interview on BBC's Panorama in 1995, Diana was given very little opportunity to be the storyteller of her own life.\n\nSo did the most controversial of the documentaries, Diana, In Her Own Words, do what it promised, and give her a voice? The British broadcaster Channel 4 claimed it did, and in some ways, they were right. The programme's use of recordings made by Diana's voice coach, Peter Settelenin, revealed a view of her marriage to Prince Charles which was remarkably blunt and candid. She openly demonstrated negative feelings towards Charles, Camilla Parker-Bowles, and the Queen.\n\nBut at the same time, of course, she didn't have editorial control over the documentary. Director Tom Jennings spliced the clips together into what he deemed a coherent narrative. The large amount of archive footage used as padding in the documentary, as well as the interminably gloomy flute music and sombre narration, acted as anchors of meaning. The programme appeared to manipulate its audience to see Diana as a tragic, doomed, and mistreated figure.\n\nThe reaction to Diana, In Her Own Words also raises interesting questions about the royal PR machine. Despite its attempt to sanitise the memory of Diana in a fashion exhibition, it did commission Diana, Our Mother, on ITV - a surprisingly candid documentary for the traditionally emotionless monarchy.\n\nThat documentary clearly demonstrates that Diana left her mark on the monarchy. The royal family learnt through her popularity - and their own unpopularity following her death - that adopting a more informal and familiar PR strategy might be useful. The Diana \"brand\" can be seen in the emotional work undertaken by Harry in his openness about mental health, and William's public devotion to his wife and children. The cold, hands-off monarchy has been (at least partly) left behind by the younger generation.\n\nIn a working culture which relies on long-term, steady employment, this is certainly notable, and suggests something must have triggered it.\n\nRoyal ramifications\n\nThe monarchy has enjoyed a period of remarkable popularity since William and Kate's wedding in 2011, so it seems unlikely one documentary will derail this. But the public's reaction to Diana, In Her Own Words must have stirred up some bad memories, particularly for Camilla, who was vilified throughout.\n\nThe work Buckingham Palace put into changing public opinion about Camilla was examined in Steve Hewlett's documentary Reinventing the Royals. In it he described a relentless, strategic attempt to sanitise Camilla's name in the public imagination. Her wedding to Charles in 2005 was seen as its ultimate triumph - but fresh public support for Diana now has the potential to do irrevocable damage to Camilla's carefully crafted popularity.\n\nIf the documentary did cause Buckingham Palace to panic, the next question for them is how the royal PR machine can attempt to rewrite the Diana story in a way which works for them. William and Harry's publicised emotional ordeal certainly goes some way towards this, as they are cultivated to be the face of a modern monarchy.\n\nChannel 4's decision to air the documentary proves Diana is still enough of a pull for media institutions to blatantly defy their carefully cultivated relationship with the monarchy. So is Diana always going to be a threat to the royal image machine? And if so, why? Is it because she reveals something to us about the institutional power of monarchy, and the symbolic violence arguably that goes alongside this? She was clearly vulnerable before, during and after her marriage to Charles, yet seemingly received little or no help from Buckingham Palace. As long as she kept up her work popularising the monarchy for a new generation, she was left to fend for herself.\n\nThe real question is whether the royal family - and others - should be allowed to rewrite the Diana story for their own gain. At what point do they rescind the right to make her \"work\" for them? When she separates from her royal husband? When she's stripped of her royal title? After she's dead? And when does her story become her own - and not part of other people's carefully crafted narratives?", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Online_Writing/Fiction", "wgt": 100, "id": 246, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Online Writing/Fiction"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques_and_Styles", "wgt": 100, "id": 1380, "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Techniques and Styles"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "302636", "label": {"eng": "Music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "302926", "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303325", "label": {"eng": "Culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "303766", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304555", "label": {"eng": "Marriage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "304929", "label": {"eng": "Narrative"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "305814", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306262", "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306327", "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_network)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "306548", "label": {"eng": "ITV (TV network)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "312962", "label": {"eng": "Channel 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabloid_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "317708", "label": {"eng": "Tabloid journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "318052", "label": {"eng": "Icon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "330715", "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "331403", "label": {"eng": "Butler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "334277", "label": {"eng": "Flute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "345550", "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "354698", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "381491", "label": {"eng": "Diana (mythology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla,_Duchess_of_Cornwall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "512622", "label": {"eng": "Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Burrell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "549931", "label": {"eng": "Paul Burrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Jennings", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "899312", "label": {"eng": "Tom Jennings"}}]}

Here's how Diana has been remembered so far ahead of the 20th anniversary of her death:\n\nPrince William and Prince Harry\n\nDiana's two children participated in the documentary, \"Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy,\" which premiered on HBO in the U.S. last month.\n\nBoth recalled what their mother was like in the documentary. William said that Diana \"was very informal and really enjoyed the laughter and the fun, but she understood there was a real life outside palace walls and she wanted us to see it for a very young age,\" the Washington Post reported.\n\nHarry, who called Diana \"just the best mother ever,\" also described Diana dressing him and his brother.\n\n\"I genuinely think she got satisfaction out of dressing myself and William up in the most bizarre outfits, normally matching,\" he was quoted as saying. \"It was weird shorts and, like, shiny shoes with the old clip-ons. And looking back at the photos, it just makes me laugh. I just think, 'How could you do that to us?!'\"\n\nElton John\n\nThe musician, who famously performed at Diana's funeral, also appeared in the documentary.\n\nDiana was famous for her AIDS activism. John said, \"It was considered to be a gay disease and for someone who was in the royal family and who was a woman and who was straight and to have someone care from the other side was an incredible gift.\"\n\nPRINCESS DIANA HAD 'A LONELY MISERABLE LIFE INSIDE THE PALACE,' BIOGRAPHER CLAIMS\n\nLord Charles Spencer\n\nDiana's brother participated in an ABC documentary that premiered earlier this month, \"The Story of Diana.\" He was quoted as saying that his sister \"was a special person, and not just a beautiful one.\"\n\n\"Obviously 99.9 percent of the people had never seen her, or met her, but they felt something in her that was fascinating and intriguing, and a force for good,\" he said.\n\nBuckingham Palace\n\nTo honor Diana, the desk from her sitting room at Kensington Palace has been put on display in one of the Buckingham Palace rooms, which palace visitors can see until October 1.\n\nDiana's photos, leather briefcase, ballet shoes, and case of music cassette tapes are included in the display.\n\n\"Amongst the tapes in the case are albums by Diana Ross, Elton John and George Michael,\" the Royal Collection Trust says online.\n\nKensington Palace\n\nIn January, plans were announced for a Diana statue at Kensington Palace, Diana's former home.\n\n\"It has been 20 years since our mother's death and the time is right to recognize her positive impact in the UK and around the world with a permanent statue,\" Diana's sons said in a statement at the time.\n\nKensington Palace said it hoped that the statue would be unveiled before the end of the year.\n\nIn February, an exhibit showcasing Diana's clothing, titled, \"Diana: Her Fashion Story,\" opened at the palace.\n\n\"Trace the evolution of the Princess's style, from the demure, romantic outfits of her first public appearances, to the glamour, elegance and confidence of her later life,\" the charity Historic Royal Palaces says online.\n\nIn April, a temporary White Garden in the palace's Sunken Garden opened, which will be up until September, People reported.\n\nIt \"has been planted with flowers and foliage, inspired by memories of the Princess's life, image and style,\" according to Historic Royal Palaces.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100, "id": 128, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion"}, {"uri":

The reality is, they just knew a part of the Diana story. CBS News explores the public and private life of a complex woman and the lingering questions surrounding her death.\n\n\"Her name was Diana and the world fell in love with her,\" \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King says in an encore of \"Princess Diana: Her Life | Her Death | The Truth\" airing Saturday at 9/8c on CBS. \"But her fairy tale life also had a heartache - it did not have a happily ever after ending.\"\n\nThis summer it will be 20 years since the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. To mark the anniversary, King anchors the broadcast from Althorp, the princess's family estate in England. Through the words of those who knew her, who admired her, in her own words, and through the rich archive of CBS News, the special looks at the impact Princess Diana had on Britain, the monarchy and the world and features interviews with close friends who open up about their personal conversations Princess Diana in the weeks leading up to her death. In fact, friend Lana Marks reveals something surprising -- the man who was the only one true love of her life.\n\nFrom her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981 until her tragic death on Aug. 31, 1997 in a horrific car crash in the Pont de I'Alma road tunnel in Paris, Princess Diana was a public draw, but there was much more behind the headlines most people never knew.\n\n\"I think Diana's death robbed the world of an extraordinary, luminous character,\" says author Patrick Jephson. \"She leaves an unfillable gap on the world stage.\"\n\nBehind the crown and the designer dresses, Diana was a complicated and occasionally unpredictable woman, say those who knew her best. \"She always said, 'I want to be normal,'\" says Ken Wharfe, her former bodyguard. \"The tragedy is, with being a member of the royal family, it's almost impossible to be normal.\"\n\nShe was far from normal. In fact, the marriage that captured the hearts of people around the world was a struggle. In public they played their parts, but in private it was a different story. They would fight, says author Sally Bedell Smith, and she would taunt Prince Charles by telling him he'd never be king.\n\n\"And there was one moment when they were having a big fight, and he was down on his knees praying, and Diana was hitting him even as he was praying,\" Bedell Smith says. \"That was the kind of intensity of the discord that they had.\"\n\nJust as the world watched as Prince Charles and Diana married, they watched as the marriage unraveled. They also followed along as Princess Diana reemerged in public life alone after the divorce and right up until she died. At the time, the summer of 1997 was supposed to be a time of self-discovery and new beginnings. She was no longer a member of the royal family and was dating businessman Dodi Al Fayed. It all ended when they piled into a Mercedes and sped off from the Ritz hotel in Paris with paparazzi chasing them.\n\nWhen the Mercedes reached the Pont de I'Alma road tunnel, driver Henri Paul lost control. He sideswiped a slower moving white Fiat that drove off.\n\nHer death was just as controversial as her life. Almost immediately conspiracy theories were raised about what happened. Were the paparazzi somehow responsible? Had someone tampered with the Mercedes? What about that white Fiat? Did the driver intentionally cause the crash? And what could have been done to prevent the crash?\n\nAt Buckingham Palace, Princess Diana's former home, the flag did not immediately fly at half mast, raising even more questions.\n\nThe two-hour special, produced by the team at \"48 Hours,\" also takes viewers on a journey through the four independent investigations in two separate countries that followed. The broadcast examines each of the theories and finally puts to rest what really happened the night she was killed in a car crash.\n\n\"It was just not the kind of ending one would have expected for anyone, let alone Diana,\" says Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty Magazine.\n\n\"Princess Diana:Her Life | Her Death | The Truth\" also features interviews with journalist Richard Kay, writer Peter York, Diana's friend and employer Mary Robertson, historian David Starkey, dancer Wayne Sleep and others.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation", "wgt": 100, "id": 72, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Transportation"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100, "id": 128, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life", "wgt": 100, "id": 355, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/End-of-Life"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Personal_Pages", "wgt": 100, "id": 745, "label": "dmoz/Society/Philosophy/Personal Pages"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual_Reality/Multi-User_Systems", "wgt": 100, "id": 814, "label": "dmoz/Computers/Virtual Reality/Multi-User Systems"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "wgt": 100, "id": 1032, "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113913"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242110"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Althorp"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Althorp", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Althorp"}, "type": "loc", "id": "290750"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303766", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_tale", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "303786", "label": {"eng": "Fairy tale"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306243", "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS", "type": "org", "score": 5, "id": "309051", "label": {"eng": "CBS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312911", "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_This_Morning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "313548", "label": {"eng": "CBS This Morning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "316648", "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "330715", "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gayle_King", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "333253", "label": {"eng": "Gayle King"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-mast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "335372", "label": {"eng": "Half-mast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "354698", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/48_Hours_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "524745", "label": {"eng": "48 Hours (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "540611", "label": {"eng": "Death of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "576454", "label": {"eng": "Henri Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodi_Fayed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "588953", "label": {"eng": "Dodi Fayed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_of_Charles,_Prince_of_Wales,_and_Lady_Diana_Spencer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "708053", "label": {"eng": "Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Bedell_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "1118194", "label": {"eng": "Sally Bedell Smith"}}]}

The late mother to Prince William and Prince Harry certainly left her mark on the world due to her ability to bravely push the boundaries and benevolently impact others.\n\nAlthough Diana was praised around the world and adored by her two boys, the princess had a difficult personal life due to her rocky marriage, which was apparently all but a fairy tale right from the start. New tapes released and video footage of Lady Di show the late royal speaking about her stormy marriage and the affair that brought it to an end.\n\nWithin the footage, Princess Diana even shares how she developed Bulimia, and states that it was a result of discovering the affair her husband was carrying on with Camilla Parker Bowles, whom Charles is now married to.\n\nDuring the recordings that have been revealed, Princess Diana referred to Charles as a \"bad rash\" when discussing his courtship. The two only met 13 times before becoming engaged, and as the Independent relays, Diana stated,\"I was brought up in a way that when you got engaged to someone, you loved them.\"\n\nDiana became so distraught about the affair, which had been ongoing since the early 80's, that she went to Queen Elizabeth II for advice. Charles' own mother simply stated \"I don't know what you should do, Charles is hopeless.\"\n\nThis rare recording of Princess Diana discussing bulimia and marital issues is truly heartbreaking. https://t.co/PfFYoTi4vD\n\n-- InStyle (@InStyle) August 16, 2017\n\nThe eating disorder was Diana's way of dealing with the affair quietly, as the publication notes. Diana says in the video footage \"Everyone in the family knew about the bulimia,\" and everyone blamed the bulimia for the reason that the marriage failed. Diana added that the eating disorder was a \"discreet\" way to deal with the pain as opposed to turning to substance abuse.\n\n#DianaInHerOwnWords features secret recordings of Princess Diana discussing her battles with bulimia, anxiety & more. pic.twitter.com/JNDofiZXd5\n\n-- EntertainmentTonight (@etnow) August 14, 2017\n\nDespite recent rumors that Prince William will become king instead of his father, new reports indicate that Charles will become King of England in 2021 when Queen Elizabeth abdicates the throne, as the Hertfordshire Mercury reports.

And as the monarch slowly steps back from some royal duties, her grandchildren Princes William and Harry are taking on more public roles - helped by a well-oiled media machine that helped burnish their image in the public eye.\n\n\"The whole place has been revolutionised,\" Borkowski said.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100, "id": 253, "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "84296"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302677", "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303150", "label": {"eng": "Queen (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303765", "label": {"eng": "Family (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303766", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304369", "label": {"eng": "Information"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "305625", "label": {"eng": "Tony Blair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305763", "label": {"eng": "2012 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "305814", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306327", "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308000", "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308814", "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "311528", "label": {"eng": "James Bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Craig", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "327258", "label": {"eng": "Daniel Craig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "330715", "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342151", "label": {"eng": "Prince William, Duke of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345550", "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_sex", "type": "org", "score": 3, "id": "351739", "label": {"eng": "Phone sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "354698", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "381491", "label": {"eng": "Diana (mythology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmoral_Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "394320", "label": {"eng": "Balmoral Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "515977", "label": {"eng": "Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "540611", "label": {"eng": "Death of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Borkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "545147", "label": {"eng": "Mark Borkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managing_the_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1121815", "label": {"eng": "Managing the news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(propaganda)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1279197", "label": {"eng": "Spin (propaganda)"}}]}

A trailer for Diana, 7 Days sees the royal siblings share their memories about their mum, in particular, how the nation and world dealt with her shock death in 1997. William was 15 when their mother died, while Harry was just 12.\n\n\"I remember people's hands were wet because of the tears that they had just wiped away,\" said Harry, speaking in the 30-second trailer. William recalled having to walk behind his mother's coffin at the funeral, saying: \"It was one of the hardest things I've ever done, that walk. I felt like she was almost walking along beside us, to get us through it.\"\n\nThe trailer for the BBC documentary has been released\n\nDiana's brother Earl Spencer and her sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale also feature in the BBC documentary, as do the Princess' lady-in-waiting Anne Beckwith-Smith and Lt Col Malcolm Ross, Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain's Office. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair and two government officials also recall their memories of the week following Diana's death.\n\nThe documentary focuses on how Diana's sudden and tragic passing catapulted the British public into one of the most extraordinary weeks in modern history. The synopsis for the film, made by award-winning filmmaker Henry Singer, questions: \"What was it about Diana that explained such an outpouring of grief? What did that week reveal about the British public's relationship with the monarchy, then and now? And how - if at all - has Britain changed in the aftermath?\"\n\nVIEW GALLERY\n\nWilliam said that walking behind his mother's coffin was \"the hardest thing\" he's ever done\n\nHighlights from ITV's Princess Diana documentary\n\nHer sons Prince William and Harry are speaking publicly and in depth about their mother for the first time, on Diana's 20th death anniversary. The BBC documentary comes after ITV released their own special in July, which looked at the Princess' life and legacy. Starring in Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, William, 35, explained: \"Her 20th anniversary year feels like a good time to remember all the good things about her and hopefully provide a different side that others haven't seen before.

", "uri": "709513902", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-15T00:45:00Z", "time": "00:45:00", "body": "Star in stripes: Diana's 'regular shoe', with its 2in heel as seen here during a visit to Lambeth, South London during 1991\n\nCourt shoes, cone heels, evening pumps, slip-ons, loafers: the sheer number of shoes Diana wore as Princess of Wales could almost have rivalled Imelda Marcos.\n\nWhen we look at it today, we can see exactly how Diana's shoe choices traced all the ups and downs of the story of her life -- especially when it came to her romance with Charles.\n\nStep by step, from the moment she stood next to her fiance in the garden of Buckingham Palace, head held blushingly on one side in a self-conscious effort to look shorter, right through to being an elegant woman who walked tall -- '6ft 3in in high heels', as designer Bruce Oldfield put it -- it's all there.\n\nHer changing styles also mirror the rise of the shoe designer in fashion. Indeed, we've now reached a point at which designers such as Alessandro Michele, creative director at Gucci, are avidly referencing everything the young Diana wore in the early Eighties. Even her gawky early ' royal appearance' footwear has become retrospectively fashionable.\n\nIn her 'Shy Di' years, Diana ordered pair after pair of low-heeled court shoes in a rainbow of colours to match every conceivable outfit. She was careful never to overstep the heel height mark. Jimmy Choo remembers that when he first knew Diana, she ordered heels at 'two inches only, no higher than that'.\n\nThey were pointed, with a V-cut, and became what she called 'my regular shoe'. Her shoe size, incidentally, is thought to have been six-and-a-half.\n\nOnly gradually did the hemlines go up, the skirts narrow and the heels start to rise. In the last two years of her life, her marriage behind her, she entered her super-groomed phase of elegant, strappy slingbacks. There were no tights, just tanned legs, and she was long past caring about giving the impression of being shorter.\n\nShe laughed when Jimmy Choo warned that a pair of four-inch evening heels might be difficult to move in.\n\n'I won't be going out walking here and there,' she said. 'I want to be taller than the men.'\n\nBreaking the bare leg taboo\n\nFor generations, it had been unthinkable for a lady to go without tights in public, let alone a member of the Royal Family.\n\nDiana was the first royal to break ranks on the stuffy rule, ditching hosiery in summer to allow her tanned, race-horse legs to be seen au naturel -- a trend which revolutionised the way women dress to this day.\n\nDaring to bare: Diana goes tights-free at an official engagement in 1995. The first time Diana was seen tights-free was on the school run in 1989 and as her hemlines rose above the knee her bare legs were just part of her style\n\nThe first time Diana was seen tights-free was on the school run, taking William and Harry to Wetherby pre-prep in 1989.\n\nHer off-duty habit wasn't much remarked on -- for one thing, she was wearing calf-length skirts at that point -- but by 1991, as her hemlines rose, it became obvious Diana was daring to bare her legs on official occasions as well.\n\nBy the late Nineties, save for the times she wore 10-denier black tights, her bare legs in dresses well above the knee were just part of the progressive style she'd made her own.\n\nHow Diana set the nude shoe rules\n\nIf there's one thing every woman knows about dressing for weddings, christenings and family parties, it's the 'Nude Shoe' rule.\n\nSince Kate, Carole and Pippa Middleton came on the scene in 2011, wearing L.K.Bennett nude 'Sledge' court shoes at nearly all public occasions, they have become royal uniform.\n\nPale imitation: Diana pioneered the nude heel look that Kate so loves. The Queen and Duchess of Cornwall have also followed\n\nIn fact, Diana pioneered the look 14 years earlier. In 1997, she'd already hit on the trick of enhancing her one-coloured Versace, Jacques Azagury and Catherine Walker shift dresses with pale beige shoes, thereby visually lengthening her legs.\n\nHer shoes were by designers such as Jimmy Choo, Gina and Versace. Where Diana led, the Duchess of Cornwall, Duchess of Cambridge and even the Queen, on occasion, have followed.\n\nHer life-long love of Jimmy Choo\n\nToday, the name Jimmy Choo is an internationally accepted synonym for 'strappy stilettos', a British mega-brand valued at around \u00a3702 million.\n\nYet the company's most famous customer, the woman still most associated with the label, is Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nThe relationship Diana forged with Choo himself over seven years, and the countless spindly-heeled designs she ordered for her new life away from Prince Charles, effectively built the brand.\n\nHigh life: Diana in an array of her favourite Jimmy Choo heels. She met the designer in 1990, long before he was a household name and when he had the capacity to make just 20 pairs a week. He says he lost count of how many he made for Diana\n\nBack in 1990, Jimmy Choo, who was born in Malaysia and came to study shoe-making at London's Cordwainers College, was just one man in a small workroom in Hackney, with the capacity to make just 20 pairs of shoes a week.\n\nIt was before shoes became major fashion statements, long before Sex And The City made 'Jimmy Choos' and 'Manolos' household names.\n\nKeep it simple! Diana rejected Choo's suggestion of adding crystals or pearls to her footwear while she chose his comfortable, flat pumps with a V-cut in front for running around in the day\n\nDiana discovered him through the designer Tomasz Starzewski, who took him to Kensington Palace when she needed shoes to match her dresses.\n\nChoo's special talent was making shoes quickly by hand. He says he lost count of how many he made for Diana. He became her footwear equivalent of Catherine Walker, someone she trusted to craft things exactly as she wanted -- sleek, glamorous and increasingly sexy as time went on.\n\n'She said: \"Keep it simple!\" ' he says, remembering how she rejected all his ideas about adding crystals and pearls. For running around during the day, she wanted his comfortable, flat pumps with a V-cut in front, but Choo also observed her transformation into a woman who no longer had any doubts about emphasising her statuesque 5ft 10in height.\n\nBy the mid-Nineties, Diana was in control of her own image: she ordered proper heels, often with Choo's signature cross-straps, to set off the brief, sculpted shifts and short pencil-skirt suits she was buying.\n\nThe ice-blue satin slingbacks she paired with a Catherine Walker dress at the Christie's sale of her dresses in June 1997 had towering 4in heels. She had found her signature style.\n\nIn 2001, Choo sold his company, but he says he'll never forget the influence Diana had on his career.\n\nHis last order from her was for a pair of flat, champagne grosgrain pumps. Sadly, he never got to deliver them.\n\nDiana's fashion-forward flats\n\n'The Princess of Wales is the Eighties Super-Sloane,' announced The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook, published in 1982, the year after she married.\n\nThe satirical directory by Ann Barr and Peter York delighted in listing the ways the young Diana exemplified the traditional shopping behaviour of the well-brought-up girl, all the way down to her 'Rangerette' casual shoes.\n\nSure-footed: Diana in her Tod's beige suede loafers in Angola in 1997\n\nThe book called her style 'New Romantic gone sensible' -- a brilliant summation of her early tastes, including her teaming of flat shoes with knickerbockers..\n\n'They suit her sporty legs, and now that the fashion is for flat shoes, they look just right,' wrote Barr and York. The pair added slyly: 'Although we know why she wore them.' Flats for the young Diana, in other words, were necessary to prevent her from towering over her new husband.\n\nLater in life, when she wasn't wearing slinky heels, Diana still adhered to the classic Sloane casual shoe-code.\n\nDiana teamed flat shoes with knickerbockers in classic Sloane style, left and chose pink Converse while watching Charles play polo in 1986. The Princess also picked cowboy boots in the mid-eighties to follow a trend on the King's Road at the time\n\nThe Princess is seen in white moccasins, left, a pair of sensible loafers, which were her default look for occasions, both private and public, and a tasselled pair of boots as she dropped William and Harry off at school in 1993\n\nEven her favourite mid-Eighties cowboy boots were her personal interpretation of a Sloaney trend much in evidence on the King's Road at the time.\n\nMainly, though, her default look drew on the upper-class preference for Gucci loafers and conventional Ferragamo patent pumps with broad, Petersham bows on the toes.\n\nShe wore them on hundreds of occasions in private: on polo fields, on outings with the children, dashing to the shops and on her incognito visits to night shelters.\n\nBut it is the image of her walking through an area of Red Cross landmine clearance in Angola in 1997 that remains indelible. The fact she was wearing Tod's loafers is a footnote, but a telling one. Here was a girl with the most privileged of backgrounds who had become one of the world's most visible humanitarian campaigners.", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri":

a pretty, delicate metallic watch with a thin strap.\n\nThe other, more masculine, watch with a chunky brown leather strap belonged to Prince Charles.\n\nAt the time she was snapped wearing the watches, the couple were engaged and got married later that month.\n\nAnd there's a sweet reason for the doubling up of accessories.\n\nThe image was taken while the young Diana was watching Prince Charles play polo at the Guards Polo Club in Windsor, during July 1981.\n\nShe put on Charles' watch as a tribute to him and to wish him good luck, according to Marie Claire.\n\nDiana 'wore racy underwear to lure Charles back from Camilla' -

Not these upper-class aristocrats who don't understand the people,\" said Borkowski.\n\nThe media strategy appears to have succeeded, with the queen continuing her record-breaking reign with the support of her subjects.\n\n\"I think the monarchy under the stewardship of Her Majesty the Queen has certainly learnt lessons throughout the time\".\n\nAnd as the monarch slowly steps back from some royal duties, her grandchildren Princes William and Harry are taking on more public roles -- helped by a well-oiled media machine that helped burnish their image in the public eye.\n\n\"The whole

They try to leave discreetly shortly after midnight in a Mercedes.\n\nChased by paparazzi on motorcycles, the powerful sedan careers at high speed into a pillar in an underpass near the Alma Bridge opposite the Eiffel Tower on the north bank of the River Seine.\n\nDiana is pulled out of the Mercedes, which has been reduced to twisted metal, by rescue workers.\n\nAl-Fayed and their chauffeur, who the probe shows had a high level of alcohol in his blood, die instantly. Their bodyguard is seriously injured.\n\nSeven photographers are arrested. From the next day, photographs of the crash will be offered to magazines for a million dollars each.\n\nDiana is taken to Pitie-Salpetriere university hospital where at 4:00 am (0200 GMT) she dies of massive chest injuries after two hours of desperate surgery.\n\nFrance's ambassador to Britain telephones Queen Elizabeth II's aides at Balmoral, in Scotland, where the Queen, her husband the Duke of Edinburgh, Charles as well as the couple's two children, William, 15 and Harry, 12, are holidaying over the summer.\n\nBritain awakes in mourning. Under a grey sky hundreds of tearful Londoners start to lay flowers in front of Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, the princess's residence.\n\nA tearful young Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair pays homage to \"the people's princess\".\n\nThe world reacts with dismay. US president Bill Clinton says he is \"profoundly saddened\".\n\nIn India Mother Teresa prays for Diana, just days before her own death, and US rock star Michael Jackson cancels a concert in Belgium in shock.\n\nThe press is the first to be accused. Diana's brother Charles Spencer says newspapers have blood on their hands.\n\nEmbarrassed, the British tabloid press elevates Diana to the status of an icon.\n\n\"Born a Lady. Became our Princess. Died a Saint,\" writes the Daily Mirror.\n\nThe popular fervour grows. At Saint James's Palace, where Diana's body is taken, it takes eleven hours to reach condolence books.\n\n\"The vision of the bouquets of flowers is amazing: a veritable sea, almost a hundred metres long,\" AFP writes.\n\nThe organisation of the funeral proves complex.\n\nSince her divorce Diana is no longer known as \"Her Royal Highness\" and does not have the right to a state funeral, although she still had the title of princess.\n\nBut Britons call for a tribute worthy of their \"queen of hearts\".\n\nAnger mounts at the silence of the royal family, still holed up in Balmoral.\n\nNewspapers, furious that the Union Jack flag is not flying at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, call on the Queen to address her subjects.\n\nThe Sun tabloid asks : \"Where is our Queen ? Where is our flag ?\" It says not flying the flag is a \"stark insult to Diana's memory \".\n\nThe Queen decides on September 5 to pay homage to her former daughter-in-law, whom she did not like, in a televised speech for only the second time in her reign. She then publicly bows before Diana's coffin.\n\n\"If they (the royals) fail to heed her lesson, they will bury not just Diana on Saturday -- but their future too,\" The Guardian broadsheet warns, as nearly a quarter of Britons call for the abolition of the monarchy in a poll.\n\nThe next day, nearly a million people watch as the funeral procession passes in a deep silence punctuated by sobs and tolling bells.\n\nTheir heads bowed, the two princes follow the coffin, accompanied by Prince Charles, the Duke of Edinburgh and her brother Earl Spencer, under the eyes of 2.5 billion television viewers around the world.\n\nAt Westminster Abbey, 2,000 invitees, including US First Lady Hillary Clinton, Blair, opera singer Luciano Pavarotti, former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and US film star Tom Cruise attend the ceremony.\n\nElton John adapts his song \"Candle in the Wind\", rewriting the lyrics in homage to Diana.\n\nIn the afternoon, the princess is buried discreetly on a small island at Althorp, Diana's ancestral home.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100, "id": 926, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death"}, {"uri":

Not these upper-class aristocrats who don't understand the people,\" said Borkowski.\n\nThe media strategy appears to have succeeded, with the queen continuing her record-breaking reign with the support of her subjects.\n\n\"I think the monarchy under the stewardship of Her Majesty the Queen has certainly learnt lessons throughout the time\".\n\nAnd as the monarch slowly steps back from some royal duties, her grandchildren Princes William and Harry are taking on more public roles -- helped by a well-oiled media machine that helped burnish their image in the public eye.\n\n\"The whole place has been revolutionised,\" Borkowski said.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Consulting", "wgt": 100, "id": 407, "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Consulting"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "84296"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302677", "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303765", "label": {"eng": "Family (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303766", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304369", "label": {"eng": "Information"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "305625", "label": {"eng": "Tony Blair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305763", "label": {"eng": "2012 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "305814", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "306327", "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308000", "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308814", "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "311528", "label": {"eng": "James Bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Craig", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "327258", "label": {"eng": "Daniel Craig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342151", "label": {"eng": "Prince William, Duke of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345550", "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "354698", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "381491", "label": {"eng": "Diana (mythology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmoral_Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "394320", "label": {"eng": "Balmoral Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "515977", "label": {"eng": "Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "540611", "label": {"eng": "Death of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Borkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "545147", "label": {"eng": "Mark Borkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "650009", "label": {"eng": "Media strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managing_the_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1121815", "label": {"eng": "Managing the news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(propaganda)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1279197", "label": {"eng": "Spin (propaganda)"}}]}

New reports indicate that Princess Diana detailed the overwhelming pressure she felt whenever she was in the royal spotlight.\n\nKate Middleton knows that Princess Diana struggled with fame and her role as a member of the British royal family. She was also the most photographed person in the world and was constantly chased by the paparazzi. Diana had a difficult time separating her personal life from her public persona. While there's no doubt that Princess Diana was a dotting mother to her two sons, Prince William and Prince Harry, she did confess to taking on too many roles at once.\n\nPrincess Diana reportedly said in her tapes, \"One minute I was nobody and the next minute I was Princess of Wales, mother, media toy, member of this family, you name it. It was just too much for one person at that time.\"\n\nFor Kate Middleton, she simply doesn't want to make the same mistakes that Princess Diana did while she was still married to Prince Charles. That's why she's treating everything with caution. Sure, the Duchess of Cambridge loves all the attention that she gets from the media, but she doesn't want to end up like a victim the same way Princess Diana did. That's why she's making her own set of royal rules, whether people like it or not.\n\nIt's no wonder that many critics believe there's an internal power struggle between Queen Elizabeth and Kate Middleton behind closed doors. The Duchess has made it clear that her family and her two children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, are her number one priority. Even though both she and Prince William are going to be full-time royals now, Kate still insists on taking Prince George to school and picking him up every morning.\n\nIn some ways Kate Middleton is exactly like Princess Diana as she wants to raise her children with a normal, positive upbringing.

She was like a creature locked in a piece of amber. There forever -- beautiful, young, vulnerable and damaged,\" said royal biographer Penny Junor.\n\n- 13 dates before marriage -\n\nBorn on July 1, 1961, Diana grew up in an aristocratic family with ties to the monarch -- her father worked for the late king George VI and Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nShe grew up with three siblings, in a childhood marred by the bitter break-up of her parents.\n\nShe left school at 16 with no qualifications and went to finishing school in Switzerland, before getting a job in a nursery in London.\n\nFrom the moment she was linked to Charles, however, her life changed.\n\nThe prince was under increasing pressure to find a bride, and at the age of 32, he proposed -- perhaps too soon.\n\nDiana said they only met 13 times before their wedding.\n\nShe quickly fulfilled her primary duty as princess, with the birth of an heir, William, the following year, followed by Harry two years later.\n\nDiana was a hands-on, adoring mother, and also possessed a remarkable empathy that drew people to her. Coupled with a strong sense of style, she rode a wave of popular and media enthusiasm for the monarchy.\n\nShe used her position to champion some of the most marginalised groups in society, shaking hands with patients with AIDS and leprosy, who were viewed as pariahs at the time.\n\nBut beneath the surface she was in turmoil, plagued by bulimia and wracked by self-doubt made worse by the feeling that her husband did not love her -- and the rest of the royals did not care.\n\n- Crossed a line -\n\nRumours that the marriage was in trouble broke into the open in 1992, after Andrew Morton lifted the lid on Diana's misery with a revelatory book, tactically endorsed by the princess herself.\n\nThat year ended with the bombshell announcement that the royal couple would separate.\n\nThe scandal only deepened with further recriminations and allegations appearing in the media, before first Charles and then Diana admitted to being unfaithful.\n\nIn her 1995 interview with the BBC's Panorama programme, Diana gave her version of events, admitting her affair with army officer James Hewitt, but also criticising the royals and questioning her husband's ability to be king.\n\nThis crossed a line. A few weeks later, the queen, who had already publicly expressed her sadness at the situation, wrote to both Charles and Diana urging them to seek a divorce.\n\nOn August 28, 1996, the divorce was granted and Diana was stripped of her title of Her Royal Highness. The fairytale was over.\n\n- 'Queen of people's hearts' -\n\nStill a princess, Diana remained in the public eye.\n\nShe found new love in Dodi Fayed, the son of millionaire businessman Mohamed Al Fayed, who was also killed with her on August 31, 1997, as their car was chased by paparazzi through the streets of Paris.\n\nThe outpouring of public grief was immense.\n\nMillions of flowers were left outside her home at Kensington Palace, and thousands lined the streets of London to pay their last respects at her funeral.\n\nMuch of the popular anger over her death was directed at the royal family, fuelled by the queen's initial refusal to return to London to greet the crowds, and there was a surge of republicanism.\n\nTwo decades on, public support for the monarchy is as strong as ever and Charles -- with Camilla -- has to a large extent been rehabilitated.\n\nBut neither will likely ever match the popularity of his first wife, the self-styled \"queen of people's hearts\".", "date":

She was a massive Princess Diana fan and attended as many public engagements with the princess as she could.\n\nShe has now shared secrets from their meetings and has opened an exhibitions of photographs she took from them.\n\nExplaining how she initially got interested in the royal, she said it was sparked after the royal wedding with the then Diana Spencer and Prince Charles.\n\nShe told Independent.ie: \"It was nothing to do with an interest in photography, my interest was purely in Diana. In 1981 when she got married, my mum, who is English, had a great interest in it and bought me a book on the royal wedding, and that started my interest in Diana from 1981 on.\n\n\"I was 12 when she got married and I had no real interest in the royal family really. It was her, when she got married and the whole razzmatazz about her.\"\n\nRecalling the pair's first meeting, she said: \"In 1988 I went to London to do my nurse training and Diana was going to a theatre down the road from me in Bromley.\n\n\"I was down to see what was going on, and I saw her going into the theatre. I waited for three hours till she came out, and she came over.\n\n\"She shook hands and said a few words. I couldn't believe it, I was amazed.\"\n\nThe married mum-of-two said described the princess as \"charismatic\".\n\nShe explained: \"Really it was about meeting her and she'd get to know you, she'd see the same faces, me and 10 or 11 other people who always tried to go to her engagements as much as possible.\n\n\"She'd say things like 'Have you no work to go to?' and I'd explain I was a nurse and worked weekends, and would have days off during the week.

Not these upper-class aristocrats who don't understand the people,\" said Borkowski.\n\nThe media strategy appears to have succeeded, with the queen continuing her record-breaking reign with the support of her subjects.\n\n\"I think the monarchy under the stewardship of Her Majesty the Queen has certainly learnt lessons throughout the time\".\n\nAnd as the monarch slowly steps back from some royal duties, her grandchildren Princes William and Harry are taking on more public roles - helped by a well-oiled media machine that helped burnish their image in the public eye.\n\n\"The whole place has been revolutionised,\" Borkowski said.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "type": "loc", "id": "76"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "84296"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "type": "loc", "id": "86522"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "302677", "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303150", "label": {"eng": "Queen (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303765", "label": {"eng": "Family (biology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "303766", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "304369", "label": {"eng": "Information"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "305625", "label": {"eng": "Tony Blair"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "305763", "label": {"eng": "2012 Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "305814", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "306327", "label": {"eng": "Monarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308000", "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "308814", "label": {"eng": "Monarch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "311528", "label": {"eng": "James Bond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Craig", "type": "person", "score": 1, "id": "327258", "label": {"eng": "Daniel Craig"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_William,_Duke_of_Cambridge", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "342151", "label": {"eng": "Prince William, Duke of Cambridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "345550", "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "354698", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "381491", "label": {"eng": "Diana (mythology)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balmoral_Castle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "394320", "label": {"eng": "Balmoral Castle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "515977", "label": {"eng": "Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "540611", "label": {"eng": "Death of Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Borkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "545147", "label": {"eng": "Mark Borkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "650009", "label": {"eng": "Media strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managing_the_news", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1121815", "label": {"eng": "Managing the news"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(propaganda)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "1279197", "label": {"eng": "Spin (propaganda)"}}]}

They try to leave discreetly shortly after midnight in a Mercedes.\n\nChased by paparazzi on motorcycles, the powerful sedan careers at high speed into a pillar in an underpass near the Alma Bridge opposite the Eiffel Tower on the north bank of the River Seine.\n\nDiana is pulled out of the Mercedes, which has been reduced to twisted metal, by rescue workers.\n\nAl-Fayed and their chauffeur, who the probe shows had a high level of alcohol in his blood, die instantly. Their bodyguard is seriously injured.\n\nSeven photographers are arrested. From the next day, photographs of the crash will be offered to magazines for a million dollars each.\n\nDiana is taken to Pitie-Salpetriere university hospital where at 4:00 am (0200 GMT) she dies of massive chest injuries after two hours of desperate surgery.\n\nFrance's ambassador to Britain telephones Queen Elizabeth II's aides at Balmoral, in Scotland, where the Queen, her husband the Duke of Edinburgh, Charles as well as the couple's two children, William, 15 and Harry, 12, are holidaying over the summer.\n\n- The 'people's princess' -\n\nBritain awakes in mourning. Under a grey sky hundreds of tearful Londoners start to lay flowers in front of Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, the princess's residence.\n\nA tearful young Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair pays homage to \"the people's princess\".\n\nThe world reacts with dismay. US president Bill Clinton says he is \"profoundly saddened\".\n\nIn India Mother Teresa prays for Diana, just days before her own death, and US rock star Michael Jackson cancels a concert in Belgium in shock.\n\nThe press is the first to be accused. Diana's brother Charles Spencer says newspapers have blood on their hands.\n\nEmbarrassed, the British tabloid press elevates Diana to the status of an icon.\n\n\"Born a Lady. Became our Princess. Died a Saint,\" writes the Daily Mirror.\n\n- Popular grief -\n\nThe popular fervour grows. At Saint James's Palace, where Diana's body is taken, it takes eleven hours to reach condolence books.\n\n\"The vision of the bouquets of flowers is amazing: a veritable sea, almost a hundred metres long,\" AFP writes.\n\nThe organisation of the funeral proves complex.\n\nSince her divorce Diana is no longer known as \"Her Royal Highness\" and does not have the right to a state funeral, although she still had the title of princess.\n\nBut Britons call for a tribute worthy of their \"queen of hearts\".\n\n- Royal silence -\n\nAnger mounts at the silence of the royal family, still holed up in Balmoral.\n\nNewspapers, furious that the Union Jack flag is not flying at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, call on the Queen to address her subjects.\n\nThe Sun tabloid asks : \"Where is our Queen ? Where is our flag ?\" It says not flying the flag is a \"stark insult to Diana's memory \".\n\nThe Queen decides on September 5 to pay homage to her former daughter-in-law, whom she did not like, in a televised speech for only the second time in her reign. She then publicly bows before Diana's coffin.\n\n\"If they (the royals) fail to heed her lesson, they will bury not just Diana on Saturday -- but their future too,\" The Guardian broadsheet warns, as nearly a quarter of Britons call for the abolition of the monarchy in a poll.\n\n- Billions watch funeral -\n\nThe next day, nearly a million people watch as the funeral procession passes in a deep silence punctuated by sobs and tolling bells.\n\nTheir heads bowed, the two princes follow the coffin, accompanied by Prince Charles, the Duke of Edinburgh and her brother Earl Spencer, under the eyes of 2.5 billion television viewers around the world.\n\nAt Westminster Abbey, 2,000 invitees, including US First Lady Hillary Clinton, Blair, opera singer Luciano Pavarotti, former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and US film star Tom Cruise attend the ceremony.\n\nElton John adapts his song \"Candle in the Wind\", rewriting the lyrics in homage to Diana.\n\nIn the afternoon, the princess is buried discreetly on a small island at Althorp, Diana's ancestral home.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100, "id": 926, "label":

As soon as she became an official member of the royal family, she majorly repaired what some people considered to be a huge divide between the British royals and the country's common people.\n\n\u00a9 Getty / Bettmann She was affectionate, she was personable, and she deeply cared about the health and safety of others. And it was this passion that was her sole reason for not wanting to be anything other than the people's princess.\n\nDiana spoke about why she never saw herself becoming queen during her infamous BBC interview with Martin Bashir in 1995.\n\n\"I'd like to be a queen of people's hearts, but I don't see myself being queen of this country,\" she said. \"I don't think many people would want me to be queen, and when I say many people, I mean the establishment that I'm married into.

But the true marker of her legacy isn't a statue or a best seller: it's her son, Prince Harry.\n\nAlthough both her children have done a tremendous job preserving her memory, Harry in particular is emulating his late, great mother. Here are five different ways he's carrying on her legacy, and showing that, although she may be gone, she is not forgotten.\n\nHis Charitable Causes\n\nGenerally, royals pick charities that reflect their interests: Prince Charles heads several environmental groups, and Camilla Parker Bowles is the patron of the National Osteoporosis Society, due to family history with the disease.\n\nPrince Harry is known for his work with veterans and the military. But he also has two other causes that stand out: land mines and AIDS.\n\nAstute royal watchers will remember that land mines and AIDS were Diana's main missions. In 1987, she shook hands with an HIV-positive man, without gloves, which disbanded dangerous stigmas. She's also largely credited with the success of the Ottawa Treaty, a 1997 piece of anti-land mine legislature.\n\nPrince Harry is now picking up where she left off, making sure he preserves her accomplishments while doing so. This April, he gave a passionate speech about Diana on International Mine Awareness Day: \"Twenty years ago, in the last months of her life, my mother campaigned to draw attention to the horrific and indiscriminate impact of land mines . . . let's make future generations proud and finish what we started.\"\n\nHis Undeniable Sincerity\n\nWith their posh education and impeccable media training, most royals have the traits of \"polite,\" \"well spoken,\" and \"nice\" down cold. But Prince Harry has one that can't be taught: sincerity.\n\nIn a 2015 poll, Prince Harry was crowned Britain's most popular royal -- yes, ahead of Will, Kate, Charles, and the queen. The reason? People think he's a genuine guy, and they like him. No, not \"approve,\" not \"respect\" -- like.\n\nTake it from Daphne Dunne, a 97-year-old woman from Australia who loves Prince Harry so much that she waited for hours to see him, twice: \"He really is a lovely young [man] and he's warm and genuine and really cares,\" she said, according to the Belfast Telegraph.\n\nThis praise is remarkably similar to the type that Diana -- called the \"People's Princess\" -- used to get. She had a \"genius for people and she could connect with anyone,\" her brother Charles Spencer said.\n\nThe British royal family is often accused of being cold, but Prince Harry, like Diana, melts the ice.\n\nHe Fights the Press\n\nMuch of Diana's legacy is positive: the charity work, the charm, the fashion. Yet, there's also a dark part -- the press.\n\nDiana was relentlessly hounded by them, much more so than other royals. She was young, beautiful, and embroiled in scandals. Many still blame the paparazzi for her death. \"It is a point to remember that of all the ironies about Diana, perhaps the greatest was this: A girl given the name of the ancient goddess of hunting was, in the end, the most hunted person of the modern age,\" Earl Spencer said in his eulogy.\n\nAs an adult, Prince Harry will not let himself, or his loved ones, be abused like Diana. Last November, Kensington Palace released a scathing statement regarding his relationship with Meghan Markle. \"[She] has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public -- the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and Web article comments,\" it read. \"It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is 'the price she has to pay' and that 'this is all part of the game.' He strongly disagrees. This is not a game -- it is her life and his.\"\n\nHe Uses Honesty as a Policy\n\nDiana shattered protocol when she gave an unsanctioned interview to the BBC and opened up about her marriage, depression, and struggle with bulimia. This past June, Prince Harry followed in her footsteps when he confessed his own inner demons regarding his mother's death and societal pressures to Newsweek.\n\nUnlike many other members of the royal family, Prince Harry and Princess Diana realized that sharing struggles is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength. By airing their own problems, it can help others who are hurting, too.\n\nHe's Got a Wild Side\n\nThe public often calls Prince Harry the \"Party Prince,\" thanks to his wild antics and mischievous behavior. Turns out, that's a trait he got from his fun-loving Diana.\n\nIn the HBO documentary Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, the prince said his mother was \"a total kid, through and through.\" She'd smuggle sweets into his and William's socks, sneak them into the movies, and one time, even invited a bunch of supermodels to embarrass Prince William. Her motto? \"Be naughty, but don't get caught,\" said Harry.\n\nAt age 32, Prince Harry has a long royal life ahead of him -- but his mother would already be proud.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100, "id": 41, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100, "id": 594, "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining", "wgt": 100, "id": 604, "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Mining"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "wgt": 100, "id": 1031, "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belfast"}, "type": "loc", "id": "91866"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "id": "302926", "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "306079", "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "306417", "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "id": "307250", "label": {"eng": "HIV/AIDS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_mine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "309809", "label": {"eng": "Land mine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paparazzi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "312911", "label": {"eng": "Paparazzi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Royal_Family", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "329310", "label": {"eng": "British Royal Family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "330020", "label": {"eng": "Patronage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 4, "id": "330715", "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "345550", "label": {"eng": "Kensington Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulimia_nervosa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "352692", "label": {"eng": "Bulimia nervosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles,_Prince_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "354698", "label": {"eng": "Charles, Prince of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camilla,_Duchess_of_Cornwall", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "512622", "label": {"eng": "Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa_Treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "574861", "label": {"eng": "Ottawa Treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Osteoporosis_Society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "945938", "label": {"eng": "National Osteoporosis Society"}}]}

For the next week, up to her spectacular funeral, Britain was plunged into an unprecedented outpouring of popular grief which shook the monarchy.\n\nHere is how the week unfolded: Divorced for the past year from heir to the throne Prince Charles, Diana, 36, and her new millionaire lover, Egyptian Dodi Al-Fayed, are stalked by a posse of press photographers over the summer as they holiday in the Mediterranean.\n\nThey arrive in the afternoon of August 30 in Paris and dine in the evening at the Hotel Ritz, in the luxurious Place Vendome. They try to leave discreetly shortly after midnight in a Mercedes. Chased by paparazzi on motorcycles, the powerful sedan careers at high speed into a pillar in an underpass near the Alma Bridge opposite the Eiffel Tower on the north bank of the River Seine.\n\nDiana is pulled out of the Mercedes, which has been reduced to twisted metal, by rescue workers. Al-Fayed and their chauffeur, who the probe shows had a high level of alcohol in his blood, die instantly. Their bodyguard is seriously injured.\n\nSeven photographers are arrested. From the next day, photographs of the crash will be offered to magazines for a million dollars each. Diana is taken to Pitie-Salpetriere university hospital where at 4:00 am (0200 GMT) she dies of massive chest injuries after two hours of desperate surgery.\n\nFrance's ambassador to Britain telephones Queen Elizabeth II's aides at Balmoral, in Scotland, where the Queen, her husband the Duke of Edinburgh, Charles as well as the couple's two children, William, 15 and Harry, 12, are holidaying over the summer.\n\nBritain awakes in mourning. Under a grey sky hundreds of tearful Londoners start to lay flowers in front of Buckingham Palace and Kensington Palace, the princess's residence. A tearful young Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair pays homage to \"the people's princess\". The world reacts with dismay. US president Bill Clinton says he is \"profoundly saddened\".\n\nIn India Mother Teresa prays for Diana, just days before her own death, and US rock star Michael Jackson cancels a concert in Belgium in shock. The press is the first to be accused. Diana's brother Charles Spencer says newspapers have blood on their hands.\n\nEmbarrassed, the British tabloid press elevates Diana to the status of an icon. \"Born a Lady. Became our Princess. Died a Saint,\" writes the Daily Mirror.\n\nThe popular fervour grows. At Saint James's Palace, where Diana's body is taken, it takes eleven hours to reach condolence books. \"The vision of the bouquets of flowers is amazing: a veritable sea, almost a hundred metres long,\" AFP writes.\n\nThe organisation of the funeral proves complex. Since her divorce Diana is no longer known as \"Her Royal Highness\" and does not have the right to a state funeral, although she still had the title of princess.\n\nBut Britons call for a tribute worthy of their \"queen of hearts\". Anger mounts at the silence of the royal family, still holed up in Balmoral. Newspapers, furious that the Union Jack flag is not flying at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, call on the Queen to address her subjects. -- AFP", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [{"uri":

I chose her dresses, I did wonderful flower arrangements. I chose her jewels - I was her best friend. I think she understood my sexuality.'\n\nHe didn't come out as gay until March this year, announcing that he was to marry his partner Graham Cooper, 58, just nine months after divorcing his wife of 32 years Maria.\n\nPaul struggled with his sexuality whilst growing up in mining community in Derbyshire, admitting that he kept things hidden from his father.\n\nHe said: 'I was the son of a coal miner in the North of England, not allowed to express his sexuality. I said to Mandy, do you know I had a dolly in a shoebox and I hid it in the gas cupboard?\n\nHe started working with Prince Charles and Diana in 1987 and stayed with until she died in 1997\n\n'My mother knew but that was my secret, you see. That was my sexuality I'd hidden away. I never realised that.'\n\nDespite coming out almost twenty years after Diana died, Paul admits he enjoyed keeping secrets with the people around him.\n\n'I think in my world, in my life, to gain someone's trust, to gain that bond, I learned that we could trade off. If you look after me, I'll look after you and that's the way it went,' he said.\n\n'And that's the way it went all my life with my wise, with the queen with my mother, with Diana. It was the same pattern.'\n\nPaul, who has written four books about his time working for the royal family, says he should have had therapy as soon as Diana died.\n\nPaul said he needed therapy as soon as Diana died but no one was looking after him\n\n'I needed it 20 years ago, really. I mean no one said to me \"Do you need help?\". I had this huge burden of looking after this icon of our times in her death. I sat with her the night before she was buried all alone and talked to her, no one said \"Paul needs help, let's get him some help. Are you ok?\" Nobody said that but I needed it then,' he confessed.\n\n'Going into therapy for me with Mandy, she brought out things that I never realised. She brought out my sexuality and why I kept it a secret and she said to me \"This is why you had such a strong relationship with Diana. This is why because you've attached yourself to strong women all your life\" and I had and I never realised that.\n\n'Did it ruin my life? No I am blessed! What an incredible, unique, inspirational human being the princess was an I was her friend.'\n\nDiana wasn't homophobic because she never 'saw' people for their sexuality, according to Paul.\n\nHe explained: 'She never saw sexuality in anyone she never saw race in anyone, she never saw a colour in anyone. She saw people and she saw me as a person.\n\nHe believes Diana would have accepted his sexuality because she didn't 'see' sexuality\n\n'She said I've got the ability to look inside you and see who you are and she liked what she saw. That's why is stayed so long.'\n\nGood Morning Britain presenter Richard Madeley condemned recent documentaries about Diana's life, particularly Channel 4's Diana: In Her Own Words.\n\nHe said: 'I think it was disgusting actually for her co,comments about her sexual relationship with Charles and their sexual habits - it was utterly outrageous. That was crossing not one line but about ten.'\n\nPaul insisted that he wasn't exploiting Diana's death, saying: 'But to tell you how inspirational she was and how unique she was and how wonderful she was, I don't think that's crossing the line.'\n\nHow Paul Burrell he tried to save Princess Diana from her eating disorder\n\nFormer royal butler Paul Burrell has revealed how he would try to get Diana to eat 'gallons of custard' in a bid to cure her eating disorders.\n\nThe late princess battled both bulimia and anorexia brought on, she told her biographer Andrew Morton, by the unhappiness of her marriage.\n\nBurrell, who was criticised by William and Harry for writing a tell-all book about his life with Diana, speaks about her illnesses in a Channel 5 documentary, In Therapy: Paul Burrell, which airs on Monday.\n\nThe therapist says: 'I know Princess Diana had an eating disorder, it was very well reported.'\n\nBurrell replies: 'And I'd help her with that. I'd get the chef to prepare a gallon of custard and I'd buy yoghurts and lots of bananas. And I'd prepare the room for her to make sure she was comfortable.\n\n'Make sure there was a pile of towels... I was doing my duty.

Not these upper-class aristocrats who don't understand the people,\" said Borkowski.\n\nThe media strategy appears to have succeeded, with the queen continuing her record-breaking reign with the support of her subjects.\n\n\"I think the monarchy under the stewardship of Her Majesty the Queen has certainly learnt lessons throughout the time\".\n\nAnd as the monarch slowly steps back from some royal duties, her grandchildren Princes William and Harry are taking on more public roles -- helped by a well-oiled media machine that helped burnish their image in the public eye.\n\n\"The whole

It was a symbol of royalty, to set you apart.'\n\nThe Queen's rules for millinery were laid down long before Diana arrived, and still exist. Hats must never disappoint by having brims which obscure the face from onlookers -- that would be rude -- and can never fly off.\n\nDiana took the convention to heart, at least at first. And it worked. 'Hats give me confidence,' Diana once remarked, early in her career as Princess of Wales.\n\nThe designers who kept all her secrets\n\nA few months before the big wedding, 19-year-old Diana was taken by her mother, Frances Shand Kydd, to the West London showroom of Scottish-born milliner John Boyd.\n\nA veteran of the Chelsea design establishment, Boyd had been making hats for Princess Anne since she was 17, and Margaret Thatcher since she became Prime Minister in 1979. 'I knew Diana's grandmother,' he tells me now, aged 91. 'And I met her mother every day on the 173 bus.\n\n'That day, Diana came in wearing knickerbockers, looking like a principal boy on the stage. She was quite shy, but it quickly became clear she wasn't interested in plush showrooms; she wanted to see the workroom upstairs and meet the girls there.\n\nStriking: Diana wears a John Boyd hat and velvet Caroline Charles suit while visiting a London hospital in 1982\n\n'They got chatting and she told them she'd come because there was a marriage in view, though she didn't say it was hers.\n\n'Then she spotted a tricorne hat -- a new shape for us -- which was going to be in the latest collection, and she said: \"Oh, I do like that, I think I want that for my going away hat.\" And that was when we realised it was her wedding she was talking about.'\n\nThe hat was plucked from the collection, and the shape reserved for Diana. Boyd made another in the same peach-coloured silk as the Bellville Sassoon going away outfit, and topped it with ostrich feathers -- a reference to the Prince of Wales' three-feathered insignia -- which were dyed to match the fabric.\n\nEven for Boyd, it was a career-defining commission and the hat was a big public hit. Suddenly ostrich feathers were all the rage. Indeed, Boyd's South African supplier, whose business hitherto was built on providing huge feathers for dancing girls in Hollywood, was 'flabbergasted' by the boom in demand.\n\nFrom left, Diana is seen at Guildford Cathedral shortly before Christmas in 1981, during the 1983 Australia tour, at the naming of the P&0 vessel Royal Princess in 1984 and in New Zealand\n\nThe princess opts for a John Boyd hat during 1982, far left, is seen in Australia in 1985, second left and far right, and went for green in Madrid in 1987, second right\n\nDiana is seen at the wedding of Joanna Leshallas and Edward Berry in Kent during 1989, far left, and during a 1987 tour to Berlin, second left, and Australia in 1988, far right\n\nIn those early years the Princess was almost never seen without a hat, and Boyd became one of her most trusted designers. He understood the enormity of the task she was faced with, and developed a kindly, teasing relationship with her.\n\n'She was very tall, and I had to avoid making her look any taller,' he says. 'She liked hats that fitted quite close to her head, and she liked little nets and veils too, which also became very popular.'\n\nIn fact Boyd's pretty Diana designs -- tricornes, mini-bowlers, close-fitting cocktail hats with netting and feathers -- triggered a trend for small-brimmed hats. 'From 1981 to 1983, the style was copied at every possible price level,' wrote critic Colin McDowell.\n\nAt seven and a half, her hat size was a little bigger than average, and her hair was 'quite springy', so Boyd bought special wire combs from Thailand to keep the hats on her head.\n\n'She had a great sense of humour,' he says. 'I used to tease her, and say: \"You've got a big head -- let's hope there's a lot inside it because you've got a big job.\"\n\nThe princess teamed a veiled hat by John Boyd with a Jasper Conran suit, second left, when she visited Tasmania in 1983. She is also seen during an Italian state visit in 1990 and in a Caroline Charles suit with matching hat when she visited Hull in 1986\n\nDiana visits Wales in 1982, far left, and attends the 1993 wedding of Viscount Linley. She is also seen in creations by John Boyd during a trip to Sardinia, second right, and by Philip Somerville, far right, at a memorial dedication in Green Park\n\n'I remember once, early on, we went to the wee cafe across the road from the showroom and a woman there said to her: \"You look just like that new Princess.\" And she replied: \"That's funny, everybody says that . . .\" '\n\nIt's a telling anecdote from a time, hard to imagine now, when Diana's face was still relatively unknown -- glimpsed under a heavy veil on her wedding day, but by no means iconic yet. 'She did have a wonderful fashion sense,' says Boyd. 'She knew just how to wear hats and look chic. And the more people got to know her, the better an ambassador she was for British fashion.\n\n'In the end, she was just the best we've ever had. Wherever you went in the world, as soon as they heard you speak English, people would ask you all about \"Lady Di\". They couldn't get enough of her.'\n\nAs she grew into her Royal role, milliners Philip Somerville, Frederick Fox, and Graham Smith of Kangol, were drafted in, too.\n\nThe Australian hat-maker Fox was particularly influential in the mid-Eighties, when Diana began to experiment with wider brims and was seen wearing his flying saucer-shaped hats at Ascot.\n\nSomerville, meanwhile, often made hats to co-ordinate with outfits by Catherine Walker, and encouraged Diana to go for bold colours, often with distinct hat bands -- fuchsia and pillar box red; crimson and black. This was in marked contrast to John Boyd's more discreet affairs. He was also behind Diana's move into Jackie Kennedy-style pillboxes, which she wore perched on the back of her head.\n\nDiana opts for various shades of pink including during a 1982 visit to Liverpool, far left, and for the Variety Luncheon at the Guildhall in London, second right\n\nShe is seen here at the Order of the Garter ceremony at Windsor in 1993, far left, a Gulf War victory luncheon in 1991, at the Sydney Opera House and a visit to an Army regiment\n\nStephen Jones, much nearer to Diana's own age -- and best known for hats worn by Boy George and Madonna -- came up with a series of berets. These were some of the easiest and youngest-looking solutions during her hat-wearing years.\n\nHats didn't just arrive as an afterthought, of course. One of the strictest royal rules was that they had to be closely co-ordinated with clothes or coats in time-consuming fittings with designers. Diana spent so long in their studios that the couturiers and hat-makers surely came closest to understanding the pressures and anxieties she felt.\n\nAway from the Palace, designers' studios became places where she could play around and feel safe and semi-normal, among people she could trust and even treat as friends.\n\nHer milliners and dress-makers never leaked to the Press, never expected to be mentioned in Palace releases, and never gossiped out of turn. Under those circumstances, they could hardly fail to pick up on her problems.\n\nYouthful: Her berets were a more modern option for the twentysomething Princess\n\n'I think you could tell from the beginning that the girl wasn't going to have a very happy future,' says John Boyd, who saw how isolated and unsure she was. 'She absolutely adored her boys when they came along, but knowing how it would end, it was very sad.'\n\nEventually, Diana threw off her hats as she shed her royal duties. The sleek, grown-up style she embraced in the mid-Nineties didn't include hats or tiaras.\n\nBut to the end, and beyond, she kept the admiration of the professionals who worked with her and, in their discreet, careful and typically British way, looked out for her, too.\n\nHats off to Diana the diplomat\n\nDiplomacy via headgear was royal protocol. Coded compliments to foreign hosts and witty references for special appearances were part of the Queen's tradition, and Diana ran with it.\n\nFor a visit to Japan in May 1986, for example, she accessorised a now-famous red-spotted dress with a wide-brimmed scarlet hat, replicating the Japanese Rising Sun flag almost too obviously -- though her hosts fell in love with it, and the outfit made headlines around the world the next day.\n\nPlayful: Diana's hat and dress, worn in Japan in 1986, gives a nod to the Japanese Rising Sun flag\n\nNautical: Sailor style for a tour of Italy in 1985, left, while she hints at a jockey's silks at Ascot in 1986\n\nMilitary chic: In a Graham Smith hat at Sandhurst in 1987\n\nMeanwhile, a Philip Somerville blue-and-white turban hat was commissioned for a trip to Dubai in 1989; a stylish means of keeping her hair from view, in line with the country's more conservative attitude to female dress.\n\nSomerville also made her a sleek pagoda-shaped hat in purple silk -- with a wide brim and a pointed crown -- to match a Catherine Walker outfit worn on a visit to Hong Kong in 1989.\n\nMilliner Graham Smith provided the suitably military-style white hat for Walker's outfit for Diana when she attended a passing out parade at Sandhurst in 1987.\n\nClever style: The Princess in Dubai, left, and Hong Kong in 1989\n\nBut most daring, and either horribly mistaken or gloriously witty, depending on your taste, was the hat she wore to Ascot in 1986. Its black silk brim and crown of green and black polka dots matched her spotty dress. With an outfit so clearly referencing lurid jockey silks, onlookers might have been forgiven for expecting Diana to saddle up for the races herself.\n\n'She loved dressing up, because in a way, the clothes and hats could speak for her when she couldn't,' says Stephen Jones.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Clothing", "wgt": 100, "id": 177, "label":

The gold and silver coins are also issued as piedfort versions in very limited number. The reverse design depicts the hybrid tea rose, a delicate blend of cream and blush pink with darker pink at the very outer edge of each petal. The rose was named after the Princess, as she was often referred to as \"England's Rose.\" Above the rose is the inscription DIANA, PRINCESS OF WALES 1961 - 1997. Below is the coin's denomination, 1 CROWN -- or in the case of the gold coins, 1/2 CROWN.\n\nThe obverse features an effigy of HM Queen Elizabeth II which is an exclusive design to the Pobjoy Mint. The effigy is struck in high detail.\n\nThe mother-of-pearl inlay is achieved by striking an indentation into the coin and fixing an intricately carved piece of mother of pearl in the shape of the rose into the cavity. The colour of the mother of pearl is unique to each coin and features a mixture of different colours and patterns. The ordinary silver crown is struck as a piedfort coin with high-relief detail. The gold half crown is also struck as a piedfort example with high detail. The Diana Rose Fine Silver coins are shipped in an acrylic capsule for protection and housed in a custom red box with a certificate of authenticity. The virenium coins are dispatched in a plastic blister-pack held in a colour card. For more information on this and other coins issued by the government and treasury of Ascension Island, please visit the website of the Pobjoy Mint.\n\nEngland's Rose\n\nThe fairytale romance of Lady Diana Spencer and Prince Charles raised even more worldwide interest in the United Kingdom's royal family. Lady Diana Frances Spencer, daughter of Edward John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer (1924-1992), was the earl's youngest daughter and third child. Speculation had grown in the early months of 1980 that the Prince of Wales was getting serious with the beautiful young lady he had been seen with on several occasions. The paparazzi had intensely followed Lady Diana for weeks leading up to the official announcement that they had become engaged on the 14th February 1981. The date of their wedding was announced soon after and in just over three weeks after Diana's 20th birthday, on the 29th July 1981, millions crowded the London streets to catch a glimpse of the couple before they exchanged vows at St Paul's Cathedral. Internationally, the televised event was seen by more than two billion viewers.\n\nIn the early years of her marriage, Diana appeared a shy, private member of the British aristocracy. However, her grace, nobility, and natural warmth towards people won the hearts of the nation, and she soon blossomed into the people's princess. She quickly became an active member of the royal family by taking on an abundance of royal duties and appearances -- much to the delight of her adoring public, exhibiting an empathy and concern for all those causes she supported. Seen as one of the most stylish and fashionable young ladies in public life, Diana became the most photographed member of the royal family, eclipsing even the Queen herself in terms of media coverage. The couple became parents to two sons: Prince William, born 11 months after his parents' wedding, and Prince Henry, born in 1984.\n\nBy the late 1980s, it had come to the attention of the country, and ultimately the world, that the fairytale marriage of the royal couple had soured. This owed to the Prince of Wales's continuing adulterous relationship with his former love interest in addition to the princess's own infidelity (both of which were admitted to in later televised interviews). A separation was announced in 1992 and a divorce was granted to Charles and Diana in 1996. Suggesting further estrangement from the royal family, Diana's status as a Royal Highness was rescinded, but her title as Princess of Wales remained as she was the mother of a future king -- Prince William.\n\nThe world was stunned to learn that in the late evening of the 30th August 1997, the princess had been in Paris with her companion, Dodi Fayed, and ended up in a fatal car crash. Her death was announced in the early morning hours on the 31st August -- leading the country, as well as much of the world, to mourn her untimely death. Hundreds of thousands of flowers were laid at the gates of Buckingham Palace and at Kensington Palace, her home in London. A million mourners lined the route of her funeral procession from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey on the 6th September 1997. Most wept or watched in silence as the gun carriage passed carrying Diana's coffin. Many applauded their beloved Diana, and thousands threw flowers onto the carriage and hearse as it drove her coffin back to her ancestral home of Althorp, Northamptonshire, where she was laid to rest.", "date": "2017-08-16", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles", "wgt": 100, "id": 612, "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles"}, {"uri":

'Crowds were already amassing outside and we had to drive past the barricades, which made us feel terribly important.\n\n'When we got inside Clarence House, where Diana had been living since her engagement to Charles, all the bridal party were there.\n\n'Everyone was singing along to the adverts on TV, drinking orange juice and eating biscuits, and watching the festivities.\n\n'I remember Judith Chalmers, who was presenting the BBC coverage, wondering what the dress would look like -- and thinking: \"We know!\" '\n\nSpectacular: Princess Diana is seen leaving St Paul's Cathedral in her wedding dress designed by Elizabeth and David Emanuel. It was the commission of a lifetime to make the dress of the century\n\nFor designers Elizabeth and David Emanuel, in their late 20s and not long out of fashion school, it was a career-defining moment.\n\nMonths earlier, in March 1981, Buckingham Palace had announced, to widespread surprise, that the Emanuels had been asked to design the dress Lady Diana Spencer would wear to marry Prince Charles.\n\nIt was the commission of a lifetime to make the dress of the century. And now, here they were, just hours from seeing Diana become a Princess in their history-making creation.\n\nThe dress had been delivered to Clarence House from their London studio the day before. Now, while Diana had her make-up and hair done, Elizabeth and David shook out the frothy lace and metres of silk.\n\nProceedings ran to a tight schedule: the Emanuels were given clipboards with to-do lists and palace aides ran around issuing orders about when things were supposed to happen.\n\nWhen the time came, they were ushered into a bedroom to dress the bride. First, Diana put on her petticoat, then her shoes, and finally the dress. Just as she was gazing at herself in the mirror, Elizabeth panicked that she hadn't done up the fastening on the petticoat, and David had to crawl underneath the skirts to check.\n\n'It had a double hook to make sure it didn't fall off,' she explains. 'We wanted her to feel comfortable, but it also had to be secure.'\n\nJust at that moment, the Queen Mother popped in to say hello to the bride, leaving David very flustered indeed.\n\nPERFUME DISASTER SHE HID FROM WORLD\n\nDiana was a fan of strong, almost masculine, perfumes and she never left home without a spritz of Diorissimo by Dior. But for her big day she chose something different: Quelques Fleurs, a delicate blend of rose, jasmine and tuberose, created in 1912 by chic Parisian perfume house Houbigant.\n\nBut having applied the scent to her neck and wrists, a nervous Diana then proceeded to spill a few drops on the front of her pristine dress.\n\n'Liz and David Emanuel never found out about it,' explains make-up artist Barbara Daly. 'She said to me: \"They'll kill me.\" I said: \"They'll never know, there's so much fabric it will evaporate.\" She said: \"Do you think if I just tuck the front in they'll never notice?\"\n\nAnd I said: \"Yes, absolutely.\"' So, scrunching the damp fabric up in her hands, Diana made her way into the carriage and hoped for the best.\n\nBut the journey to St Paul's was shorter than she realised, and there was still a tell-tale patch on the dress.\n\nAs she emerged from the carriage, she kept the damp fabric tightly clasped in her hand. Thankfully, her huge, trailing bouquet covered all manner of sins -- and no one knew.\n\nMeanwhile, she had that train, the longest in royal history, to contend with. 'We wanted her to look like no princess had ever looked before,' says Elizabeth Emanuel. 'So we set out to discover the length of the longest royal wedding dress train there'd been, and discovered it was 23ft. We joked that we could go one better -- in fact, two feet better -- and make one that was 25ft. She loved the idea.'\n\nThe biggest problem was finding a space large enough for fitting it. The Brook Street studio was too cramped, so Diana drove the Emanuels to the Palace, where they were given Princess Anne's bedroom as a makeshift fitting room. They laid the calico mock-up of the train out in the corridor and all three marvelled at the sight. Diana practised walking up and down, gliding over the plush Palace carpet.\n\nHaving planned to make the train in the same silk as the dress, the Emanuels panicked that it was still too wide for the aisle at St Paul's. Armed with tape measures, they organised a secret visit to the cathedral to measure up -- and found it fitted exactly.\n\nOnce the bridesmaids were dressed, they helped escort the bridal party down the grand staircase and into the carriage, folding the enormous train, concertina-style -- 'like you would fold a bed sheet' -- to ensure it didn't get crushed. It was a manoeuvre they'd spent hours practising.\n\nElizabeth and David then rushed to St Paul's, accompanied by a police escort, so they could arrive before the bride. In her handbag, Elizabeth had packed a bottle of smelling salts and some sugar tablets, in case Diana felt faint, but in the end it was the designer who needed the sugar to calm her own nerves.\n\nStanding to one side of the cathedral entrance, they anxiously peered out until cheering crowds announced the arrival of the carriage. But as they watched Diana climb the steps, the Emanuels' hearts sank: the dress was noticeably crumpled.\n\n'I remember whispering to David: \"Oh my God, it's creased,\"' she says. 'I thought: \"We've got to straighten out that dress.\"\n\n'In the tiny carriage, it had crumpled far more than we'd anticipated. We'd done a rehearsal, but not with her father, Earl Spencer, in the car, too -- and he was quite a large man.\n\n'It was a hot day, there was so much volume in the net and she was nervous, so she kept grabbing hold of it in her hands. Fortunately, we knew the fabric would pull out -- that's why we were there.\n\n'When she came out of that carriage, it was the most wonderful vision I'd ever seen. She looked like a butterfly emerging from her chrysalis, unfurling her wings and about to fly. It was so romantic. Oddly, the imperfections seemed to make her even more beautiful.' While the world watched on television, Elizabeth and David, with the help of the bridesmaids, smoothed out Diana's dress, adjusted her veil and spread out that astonishing train.\n\nAs Lady Diana walked down the aisle to the strains of the Prince of Denmark's March, the Emanuels were ushered to their seats.\n\nSitting behind a pillar, they could see little and didn't witness the full splendour of their creation until they saw it on the evening news.\n\nHalfway through the ceremony, they got a tap on the shoulder: it was time to make their way to the Palace, where they would greet the new Princess of Wales and prepare her for the photographs.\n\nElizabeth and David, equipped with pins and an emergency sewing kit, checked the dress and helped arrange the veil for the official wedding portraits, which were taken by Lord Lichfield.\n\n'One of the most amazing things was watching the balcony scene from behind,' Elizabeth says.\n\n'It was a truly magical moment, being on the inside looking out as the crowds waved and cheered.' By the time the couple returned to their studio in Mayfair, it was late. 'It was eerily quiet,' Elizabeth recalls. 'We'd had this huge build-up and suddenly it was over.'\n\nAround 6.30pm, just as the Emanuels were leaving the studio, the phone rang. To their surprise, it was Diana, thanking them one last time for making her dress. 'It meant so much. There she was, exhausted on the evening of her wedding, taking the time to call us. But that was her all over.'\n\nIt wasn't until the following day that, to her horror, Elizabeth remembered she had left a safety pin -- temporarily fixing the petticoat in place -- in the dress. Thankfully, under all the layers of net, tulle and silk, it had gone unnoticed by the thousands of wedding guests and millions of viewers worldwide.\n\nThe Emanuels' relationship with Diana began on January 8, 1981, with a phone call to their tiny Brook Street showroom. Crouched on her hands and knees, Elizabeth was busy dressing a client, so she yelled to one of her assistants to take the call.\n\nOn the line was a new customer asking Elizabeth if she would make her a dress for a friend's upcoming 21st birthday party. 'Debra' -- as her name was mistakenly taken down -- made an appointment for 2.30pm that afternoon.\n\nOf course, 'Debra' was Diana, and when she arrived Elizabeth couldn't believe her eyes.\n\n'I recognised her immediately. She'd been in the papers since she and Charles had started dating the previous year -- but photographs didn't do her justice. I was immediately stuck by her height, her beautiful blue eyes and that flawless complexion.'\n\nDiana was just 19, and with that appointment began a lifelong love affair with fashion. Over the following months, Elizabeth and David (who are now divorced but continue to work separately as designers) made several outfits for her, as she found her feet in the spotlight and sought to transform herself from young, shy nursery teacher to the fiancee of Prince Charles -- and, at that time, the future Queen of England.\n\nAfter the birthday gown came a pale pink, high-necked chiffon blouse, borrowed by the fashion team at Vogue magazine for a romantic shoot with Diana by Lord Snowdon, the publication of which coincided with her engagement.\n\nWell-trained: Diana's dress designers, David and Elizabeth Emanuel, suddenly panicked that the 25ft train they envisaged for Diana's gown would be too wide for the aisle at St Paul's. They quietly visited the cathedral, armed with tape measures, to check there wouldn't be a hitch on the big day -- luckily, it fitted perfectly\n\nAnother outfit the Emanuels designed for Diana -- perhaps the most iconic before the wedding dress -- was a strapless, figure-hugging black taffeta ballgown which she wore to London's Goldsmiths' Hall to mark her first appearance as Prince Charles's bride-to-be.\n\nThe next day, March 10, amid mounting speculation about who would design the royal wedding dress, the Palace announced that the Emanuels -- whose taffeta creation had been splashed all over the papers -- had won the contract that every designer in the country had been dreaming of. 'We'd actually been asked by Diana herself the previous week, and she'd already been in for a chat,' recalls Elizabeth, now 63 and with a studio of her own in upmarket Maida Vale.\n\nThough the Emanuels' fledgling business was doing well -- clients included Bianca Jagger and the Duchess of Kent -- nothing could compare to designing a royal wedding dress.\n\nHOW DIANA FOLLOWED THE TRADITIONAL RHYME\n\nSomething old . . .\n\nAntique Carrickmacross lace, which had belonged to Queen Mary -- wife of George V -- was sewn into Diana's dress to mark her link with history. On her wedding day in 2011, the Duchess of Cambridge wore lace from the same piece of fabric.\n\nSomething new . . .\n\nHer beautiful bespoke gown was her 'something new'.\n\nSomething borrowed . . .\n\nDiana's two pieces of jewellery were both borrowed. On her head, she wore the sparkling Spencer tiara, a family heirloom dating from the 18th century and fashioned from hundreds of diamonds set in silver and mounted in gold.\n\nThe show-stopping leaf design featured stylised tulips, star shapes and scrolling foliage, swirling around a central heart. Feminine and romantic, it fitted perfectly with the fairytale theme of the wedding.\n\nShe wore it anchoring the main section of her veil, with her blusher veil attached separately to the front, to avoid it dragging over the top of her tiara.\n\nDiana kept the veil down throughout the wedding ceremony, before asking her make-up artist to remove it when she had to sign the register.\n\nDiana's other borrowed jewels were her dazzling diamond earrings, huge pear-shaped pendants on loan from her mother for her daughter's big day.\n\nSomething blue . . .\n\nElizabeth Emanuel sewed a tiny blue bow into Diana's waistband, invisible to all but those who knew to look for it.\n\nThere was another pale blue bow on her silk garter.\n\nThe Emanuels also decided to put a tiny horseshoe, made from 18-carat Welsh gold and studded with white diamonds, created by jeweller Douglas Buchanan, into the label of her dress.\n\n'Nobody could see our private gift when the dress was being worn,' says Elizabeth. 'It was just there as a little token, a second good luck charm, from us to Diana.'\n\n'From the minute she asked us, we knew nothing was going to be the same,' Elizabeth says.\n\nBut there was little time for celebration. Elizabeth's imagination went into overdrive. There was no direction from the Palace -- other than the overriding need for discretion -- and even less from Diana herself, then still so new to the world of fashion.\n\n'I tracked down every book I could find on royal weddings from history: Queen Victoria; her daughter, Princess Beatrice; Queen Mary,' she explains. 'And I watched all my favourite old films: The Leopard, Gone With The Wind, Barry Lyndon. Inspiration came from everywhere.'\n\nElizabeth stuck cuttings and photographs into a large scrapbook, filled with romantic frills, flounces and fairytale bridal wear, which she still leafs through with pride today.\n\nAt Diana's first wedding meeting, she tried on a series of sample dresses -- everything from slinky Twenties-style gowns to huge, bouffant petticoats with satin skirts and boned bodices -- to get an idea of what she liked.\n\nShe settled on a sample much like the finished look: a dress with a big skirt, tiny waist and soft frills round the sleeves and shoulders.\n\nNext time they met, the trio sat on the floor, cross-legged, poring over around 50 sketches Elizabeth had based on Diana's chosen silhouette. Diana had brought along her mother, Frances Shand Kydd, who rather sternly analysed the Emanuels' offerings.\n\n'The carpet was covered in pencil drawings,' says Elizabeth. 'Diana and her mother both sat stunned and speechless for the first few minutes before they began examining the sketches.\n\n'We held our breath for what seemed like for ever -- and finally they broke into smiles. It didn't take long to pick the final design.'\n\nThey also settled on a colour: vintage-style, creamy ivory.\n\n'This was so flattering to her English rose complexion,' Elizabeth explains. 'I find that white lace tends to look cheap. Ivory enhanced Diana's pale, natural beauty.'\n\nThe call went out to fabric producers, dressmakers and embroiderers nationwide that the Emanuels were looking for the raw materials for Diana's dress -- and phone calls and letters began flooding the studio with offers of British textiles, sequins, pearls and jewels.\n\nBut rather than getting to work straight away, their first task was more practical: security. Ever since the news had broken that the Emanuels would be responsible for the dress, their studio had been besieged by journalists, photographers and TV crews desperate for a scoop.\n\nElizabeth and David installed blinds on their windows and manoeuvred a heavy-duty safe in through the first-floor window of their little mews building so they could lock up sketches and fabric swatches overnight.\n\n'It sounds a bit over-the-top, but it really did seem like people would go to any lengths to find out what the dress looked like,' Elizabeth says.\n\nAnother tactic was to give Diana a pseudonym. Throughout this period, they dubbed her 'Debra', in memory of that first phone call, or 'Dorothy Cornwall', a moniker that now seems oddly prophetic given the title of Charles's second wife.\n\nWhile there was constant hubbub outside the Emanuels' studio, activity inside was even more frenzied. Having outsourced the making of the shoes and the bouquet, and commissioned silk weavers and lace manufacturers -- all home-grown, family-run companies -- the Emanuels were left to concentrate on fittings with Diana.\n\nThe process was relatively straightforward, in theory at least. Elizabeth's sketch was turned into a pattern, which was cut out in calico -- unbleached, unprocessed cotton -- to make a mock-up of the dress, called a 'toile'.\n\nDiana came to the studio, often with her mother in tow, and tried on the toile. Hovering around her with scissors, pins and fabric marker, the Emanuels would fit the pattern around her body as she twirled, laughed and chatted about the big day.\n\n'She was always very ready to come to fittings,' Elizabeth says. 'And she never complained when we kept her standing in one position for hours.'\n\nBut the regular fittings were complicated by Diana's persistent weight loss.\n\nDon't be nervous: Diana chats to five-year-old bridesmaid Clementine Hambro under the watchful eye of the Queen\n\nAt her first session with the Emanuels back in January 1981, her waist measured 29 in -- reasonably healthy for a slim, 5 ft 10 in girl. But between the announcement of her engagement in February and the wedding in July, her waistline seemed to shrink daily.\n\nBy the big day, it was a tiny 23.5 inches. 'Every time she turned up for a fitting, she had lost more weight,' reveals Elizabeth.\n\n'We put it down to nerves. But it did make it incredibly difficult for us to get on with making the dress. We had to keep taking the bodice in and changing the pattern. The last thing we wanted was to make it up in silk, then have to play around with that. Silk soon looks worn if you work it too much.'\n\nThere were five different versions of the bodice, each made to fit Diana's dwindling figure, before the silk version was cut just weeks before the big day. 'She was incredibly tiny by the end,' says Elizabeth. 'We literally sewed her into the dress. I suddenly got this fear of her train falling off as she was walking up the aisle. It would have been awful.'\n\nLittle did they -- or the world -- know that Diana's shrinking waist marked the start of a battle with eating disorders that would plague her for the rest of her life.\n\nIn the end, she came in for as many as 15 fittings -- Elizabeth lost count, there were so many -- to make sure every detail was just right. The bodice and skirt were made of lustrous ivory silk taffeta, and the trim on the bodice, sleeves and edges of the skirt was lace, overlaid with 10,000 pearls and 3mm mother-of-pearl sequins.\n\nA taffeta bow was placed where the halves of her collar met, mirrored by bows and frothy lace at the ends of her sleeves. Underneath, Diana wore a huge petticoat made from more than 90 metres of tulle, a lightweight starched netting, which had to be 'trimmed' into shape rather like a head of hair.\n\nRadiant: An excited Diana travels from Clarence House to St Paul's in the royal carriage, the Spencer tiara keeping her veil in place\n\nThere were another 140 metres of tulle in the veil, as well as a spare petticoat and an extra silk skirt which could be fitted over the original 'just in case she spilt something down herself on the day'. When they reached the final stages, it was all hands on deck.\n\nEven so, the Emanuels began to worry that the intricate sequin-sewing was taking too long, so they called in a few favours: Elizabeth's mother and the mother of their PA, Caroline Slocock, pitched in to help with the embroidery.\n\n'It was a real family affair. So much love went into that dress.'\n\nDiana came for her final fitting a fortnight before the wedding -- the first time she had laid eyes on the finished dress.\n\n'It was suddenly very real. She was just so excited -- you could see it in her eyes.'\n\nAfter a top-secret rehearsal at St Paul's (minus the dress) on July 27, it was time to transport the gown to Clarence House.\n\n'We were so paranoid about it all going wrong in the final hours,' says Elizabeth. 'We didn't trust anyone to drive us, so we hired a van. Even en route we were convinced we were being hijacked.\n\n'We drove into Albemarle Street and a big cart pulled across the road and blocked us in. We thought: \"That's it, it's a heist.\" But it was just the London traffic.'\n\nDress offloaded, the Emanuels returned to their studio, though they had to be back at Clarence House at 6am the next day. For the designer duo, the wedding represented an extraordinary achievement; a moment of high drama and excitement.\n\nOn August 6, they issued a bill for the dress to Diana's mother, for 1,000 guineas, \u00a31,050 at the time (\u00a34,140 today) -- a token sum, as Diana usually paid full price for her clothes. In fact, the dress was then valued at \u00a39,000 -- \u00a335,500 today.\n\nAs a result of their discretion and the close friendship forged at one of the most momentous times of Diana's life, the three remained close and the Emanuels continued to design dresses for royal tours.\n\n'The last time I saw her was at the auction of her dresses at Christie's, two months before she died,' says Elizabeth. 'She seemed so happy. She'd grown up a lot since we first met her -- that nervous, pretty young thing who had no idea about what suited her or what she liked to wear.\n\n'By the end, Diana understood she didn't even have to say anything: her clothes spoke for her.\n\n'She was an icon.'\n\nMystery of the back-up dress that vanished\n\nAs well as creating The Dress, the Emanuels were charged with making two more: one exact copy to go on display at Madame Tussauds, and another secret back-up wedding dress -- Diana's second choice design -- in case the real thing was discovered before the big day.\n\nThis second choice dress was very similar: a flattering, boned bodice, frilly sleeves and a full puffball skirt, but the design on the bodice was more of a V-shape, the sleeves were shorter and there was no lace edging on the skirt, making it altogether plainer.\n\n'It was only three-quarters finished -- we simply didn't have time to make it in its entirety, so none of the embroidery or finishing touches were done,' says Elizabeth.\n\nWedding party: Charles and Diana with Princes Andrew and Edward (back row); pageboys Lord Nicholas Windsor (far left) and Edward van Cutsem; and bridesmaids (l-r) Clementine Hambro, Catherine Cameron, India Hicks, Sarah-Jane Gaselee and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones\n\nAstonishingly, she admits she doesn't know what happened to the dress after the wedding.\n\n'It was hanging up in the studio for a long time, and then it disappeared. I don't know if we sold it or put it into storage. It was such a busy time. I'm sure it'll turn up in a bag one day!'\n\nMeanwhile, after the ceremony was over, the High Street was flooded with copies of the Emanuels' precious dress, the first of which appeared in Oxford Street shop windows at 3.30pm on the actual wedding day, just five hours after the press embargo on details of the gown and Elizabeth's sketches was lifted.\n\nOrdinary brides could get their hands on a Diana rip-off for as little as \u00a3439 at Debenhams. 'There was so much embroidery and lace and detail in the original that the copies just couldn't match up,' says Elizabeth. 'Of course, we knew they were going to do it, but they didn't come close.'\n\nTHE SEVEN SEAMSTRESSES\n\nKnown as the 'Emanuel ladies', the designers' team of seven seamstresses spent weeks on the dress. In particular, head seamstress Nina Missetzis and her second-in-command, Rose Hoey, dedicated themselves full-time to it.\n\n'Nina was Greek and couldn't speak very good English,' Elizabeth explains. 'Even when she started with us, she was already quite elderly and slightly stooped with really long, bony hands -- the result of the many years she had spent dressmaking. She was extremely meticulous and a real perfectionist, and would work long hours hunched up over the sewing machine.'\n\nNina, who has sadly now passed away, never forgot her first meeting with Princess Diana: 'She was so sweet, so shy. When she first came to see me, she didn't want to take off her clothes so I could take her measurements. I told her if she didn't, the dress would be too big, so she did.\n\n'As I was pinning the pattern to her, I could tell it was very new to her, to be fitted. When she tried on the gown for the first time, she got very emotional and cried.'\n\nRose Hoey, meanwhile, recalled an exchange during the train fitting at the Palace in April.\n\n'I remember saying to Diana that it was amazing to think I was on the inside, having stood outside as a tourist so many times. She laughed and said we should go out on to the balcony and wave at all the people -- and we did!'\n\nDiana never forgot the devoted seamstresses who toiled day and night to perfect her dress.\n\nOnce, Elizabeth returned to the studio to find the Princess had sneaked up the stairs and into the attic where they were working to thank them personally for all their hard work. She even invited them to the wedding -- 'suddenly everyone needed a new frock!' Elizabeth laughs.\n\nHOME-GROWN MATERIALS\n\nOne of the most important factors for Elizabeth was the provenance of the dress materials.\n\n'As soon as the news was announced, the phone started ringing off the hook with weavers, fabric specialists and embroiderers offering everything under the sun,' she explains. 'Our main focus was to make it as British as possible.'\n\nThey sourced the lace from Roger Watson, a family-run firm in Nottingham, which supplied \u00a31,000 worth of material for the waist, hem and train.\n\nThe detailing was inspired by Diana's family coat of arms -- featuring geometric shapes and scallop shells -- and incorporated a square of antique Carrickmacross lace, an heirloom dating from the time of Queen Mary, donated by the Royal School of Needlework.\n\nThe silk came from Stephen Walters & Sons, a Suffolk weaver dating back to the 1700s, which has been run by the same family for ten generations.\n\n'I heard that the Emanuels had got the job and wrote to them the next day,' explains David Walters, managing director at the time.\n\nVICTORIAN FLOWER GIRL WHO INSPIRED BRIDESMAIDS\n\nA Victorian postcard provided the inspiration for the bridesmaids' lace-trimmed dresses; the Emanuels' sketches; and five-year-old Clementine Hambro in the finished frock\n\nEager to stick to the British theme, they plundered all the raw silk they could from worms at Lullingstone silk farm in Kent. Sadly, there wasn't enough -- 11,000 strands of raw silk were used -- so they had to make up the difference with imported silk.\n\nA team of 150 at Stephen Walters, which had also done Princess Anne's wedding dress and the silk lining for the Queen's Coronation robe, got to work immediately.\n\n'It's a long-winded process,' David explains. 'You have to twist the threads, then dye it, then weave it on a loom. The weaving alone takes ten days; the whole thing took around eight weeks.'\n\nStaff were sworn to secrecy and each worked on a different part of the dress so that no one knew what the finished design looked like. They produced two 41-metre rolls.\n\n'The Emanuels thought it was a good idea to have a back-up in case someone spilt coffee on it.'\n\nThe fabric itself was an ivory-coloured, heavyweight taffeta.\n\nDavid recalls: 'It had that crisp feel; proper crunchy taffeta, deliberately chosen for the look they wanted. The next time we saw it was on TV on the wedding day. We were all gathered round and when she got out of the car there was a collective gasp at how crushed it looked.\n\n'But it wasn't a mistake -- the Emanuels had wanted that fabric -- and they soon straightened it out. The finished dress looked incredible. We felt very proud.' Though David and his staff never met Diana, they presented her with a pretty wooden box containing the silk worms used to make the material for her dress.\n\nUnfortunately, reveals Elizabeth, 'they hatched not long afterwards -- so we had to throw it away!'\n\nTHE BOISTEROUS BRIDESMAIDS\n\nOne of Elizabeth's most treasured memories from that time is a bridesmaids' fitting, when Lady Diana arrived at the studio accompanied by five boisterous girls on red roller-skates.\n\nSECRET MESSAGE IN HER SHOES\n\nThe day after the news of the wedding dress commission was announced, Elizabeth Emanuel phoned celebrity cobbler Clive Shilton -- the darling of fashion magazines in the Seventies for his handmade shoes and handbags -- and asked him to come and meet a 'special client'.\n\nBased in Covent Garden at the time, Clive made the short trip to Brook Street, where Diana was standing on a stool waiting to have her feet measured.\n\nThe bridal shoes with their handpainted soles\n\n'She was a very shy, sweet, smiley-eyed young girl,' he recalls. 'Her main concern was that she wouldn't appear taller than Prince Charles, and because she was very tall -- 5ft 10in -- the shoes would have to have a low heel.'\n\nClive remains incredibly discreet and refuses to reveal the Princess's shoe size (thought to be a 6.5). He began by making his own 'last' -- the wooden mould around which shoes are made -- as even this couldn't be outsourced in case word got out. Though he never saw the dress, the Emanuels sent him the silk they were using, hoping he might be able to make the shoes from the same fabric.\n\n'It was too fine -- it would have crumpled across the instep,' he says. 'Instead, the weavers came up with a heavier silk satin.\n\n'We then covered them in 542 sequins and 132 pearls.'\n\nClive devised various trims for the front of the shoes and presented them to Diana, who chose a heart-shaped design.\n\nThe shoes arches were painted with a secret romantic message: the letters 'C' and 'D'\n\nThe soles were soft suede so she wouldn't slip, and the arches were painted with a secret romantic message: the letters 'C' and 'D', entwined around a heart.\n\n'No one even saw the bottom of the shoes, but it was important to us that they looked fantastic,' says Clive. 'You would have seen much more of them if she'd tripped!'\n\nFrom start to finish, it took six months to make the shoes, and every single person in Clive's workshop, including the cleaner, helped put a tack or a spot of glue on the final pair.\n\nClive refuses to say how much Diana paid, but admits he charged 'a basic price'.\n\nPress reports from the time say there was a dispute over the bill, and her mother, Frances Shand Kydd, refused to pay.\n\nNo matter, however, as Clive sold one of the spare pairs at auction for \u00a336,000 in 2011.\n\nThey proceeded to whizz around the room in their toile dresses, making Diana, Elizabeth and the seamstresses fall about laughing.\n\nDiana's five bridesmaids were: Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones (now Chatto), the eldest at 17 and Princess Margaret's daughter; India Hicks, 13, Prince Charles's goddaughter; Sarah-Jane Gaselee, 11, whose father was Charles's horse trainer; Catherine Cameron, six, another goddaughter; and Clementine Hambro, a petite, blonde five-year-old and a pupil at the nursery where Diana worked. Inspired by a postcard she had been sent by a friend, depicting a Victorian flower girl with a ballerina-length dress, ribbon sash and pretty floral bouquet, Elizabeth had plenty of ideas for frocks.\n\n'Although we wanted to keep the style of the bridesmaids' dresses romantic, historical and very pretty, like Diana's own gown, we were also keen to make them a bit different from each other, as was appropriate for their different ages,' Elizabeth explains.\n\nAll were made from the same colour silk as Diana's dress, but of a slightly lighter weight, with fitted bodices, net petticoats and ruffled skirts trimmed with lace, tiny pearls and sequins.\n\nWhile the two youngest had ruffled, flouncy styles, the two middle girls had more sophisticated collars -- and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, the eldest, had a sleeker, straighter skirt.\n\nFlorist Edward Goodyear designed white and gold flower baskets for them to carry, with pretty floral circlets for the heads of the four youngest. Round their waists, each wore a gold silk sash, inspired by the Mountbatten roses in Diana's bouquet, and on their feet were matching gold shoes.\n\nIndia Hicks, now 49 and a former model with her own lifestyle brand, has said her first reaction on being asked to be a bridesmaid was one of 'horror'. She recalled: 'I was a tomboy from rural Oxfordshire, never out of jodhpurs. I was horrified -- I was going to have to wear a dress.'\n\nShe first met Diana at a fitting and says she was 'more like a head girl than a princess-in-waiting'.\n\n'Frill after frill, pin after pin, hour after hour, we stood silently . . . Although I found all those petticoats, puffed sleeves and bows hard to forgive, it was an intimate and informal time with Diana.'\n\nTogether with Sarah Armstrong-Jones, India was charged with the far-from-straightforward task of carrying Diana's train. 'Manipulating that much taffeta and antique lace in and out of the small state carriages posed considerable complications,' she said.\n\n'We practised first with a long dust cloth tied to Diana's waist. She stood patiently as we were shown how to fold and unfold the fabric.' Having arrived at Clarence House at 7.30 am on the wedding day, the bridesmaids recall a fun, girly morning: Diana rushing around in a pair of old jeans, the Spencer tiara balanced on her head, smiling as she watched footage of herself on TV.\n\n'During one commercial break, an advert for Cornetto ice cream came on, and she started singing,' India recalled. 'Soon we all joined in. \"Just one Cornnnneeetttoo\" could be heard from the top floor.'\n\nClementine Hambro, known as the 'sobbing bridesmaid', after a photograph of Diana helping her up when she fell over and banged her head at the Palace became famous, remembers little -- but she was only knee-high at the time.\n\n'Disappointingly,' she says, 'my recollections of the actual service are of achingly tired legs, of desperately wanting to sit down when we were not allowed to, and of doggedly staring at my little gold shoes . . . determined not to step on that magnificent train.'\n\nAfter the ceremony, the bridesmaids relished travelling in the royal carriage past crowds throwing confetti that landed in the laps of their dresses.\n\nBack at the Palace, the two eldest helped Diana change into her going-away outfit, and all five gathered to wave her off.\n\n'Though the Princess smiled all day, she was suffering from a crushing headache,' revealed Sarah-Jane Gaselee -- who admitted in 2015 that she 'bitterly regretted' selling her dress for \u00a311,000. 'As we stepped out on to the balcony, she complained her tiara was killing her, it was so heavy.'\n\nPARASOL THAT WAS NEVER USED\n\nThe weather forecast for the wedding day wasn't great -- grey with a risk of showers, warned the BBC -- and so Elizabeth felt it would be wise to have an umbrella to hand, just in case.\n\nA month or so before the wedding, she nipped into Phillips auction house -- a few doors down from the couple's studio on Brook Street -- and picked up a pair of antique silk parasols with wooden handles.\n\n'We covered them in white and ivory fabric -- two colours so no one would know which matched her dress,' explains Elizabeth.\n\n'They were then trimmed with the same lace as the dress and hand-embroidered with tiny pearls and sequins.'\n\nOn the morning of the royal wedding, the ivory parasol was tucked inside the carriage that would take the bride to St Paul's -- on Diana's father's side -- so he could keep his daughter dry if the skies opened.\n\nMercifully, they didn't; it turned out to be quite a dry, pleasant day and the parasol remained out of sight.\n\n'It was probably a good thing,' laughs Elizabeth. 'It was made of such light material that it certainly wasn't waterproof -- it wouldn't have done her much good!'\n\nThe umbrella ended up being exhibited at Madame Tussauds along with the replica of Diana's extraordinary dress.\n\nDiana's high fashion honeymoon looks\n\nDiana's transformation from shy young Sloane to resplendent Princess complete, her honeymoon wardrobe was a chance to show just how ready she was to embrace her new public role.\n\nPrince Charles had planned a sedate sojourn at Broadlands estate in Hampshire, followed by 14 days on a Mediterranean cruise, finishing at Balmoral Castle in Scotland.\n\nGoing away: Diana chose a cantaloupe-coloured Bellville Sassoon outfit teamed with Manolo Blahnik stilettos and a feathered John Boyd hat\n\nShorts and sweet: One memorable outfit by Japan's Kenzo Takada was caught while Diana was on Britannia, a pintucked, cotton, balloon-sleeved blouse with matching Bermuda shorts.\n\nThe itinerary may not have been exciting, but Diana was determined to wow the world with a showstopping wardrobe. She planned her honeymoon with the help of Felicity Clark, then beauty editor at Vogue and a friend of her sister.\n\nDiana chose a cantaloupe-coloured silk dress as her going-away outfit. Made by Bellville Sassoon, it was a classic 'new bride' look, teamed with Manolo Blahnik stilettos and a feathered John Boyd hat.\n\nShe flew to the Royal Yacht Britannia in a floral white silk dress by Donald Campbell and a cashmere coat from Courtenay House in Brook Street, Mayfair.\n\nThe young Princess looked relaxed and happy as she posed at the door of the plane at Southampton airport.\n\nFlower power: Diana wore a Donald Campbell silk dress and cashmere coat from Courtenay House in Mayfair for a flight to the Royal Yacht Britannia as part of her honeymoon\n\nCameras were banned on board Britannia, but one memorable outfit by Japan's Kenzo Takada was caught: a pintucked, cotton, balloon-sleeved blouse with matching Bermuda shorts.\n\n'At the time of her marriage, she was very young very natural and romantic,' Kenzo has said. 'The image that I have of her has always been one of tenderness, colour and joie de vivre.'", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories": [], "concepts": [{"location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng":

And when she gave birth to Prince William, Prince Charles gave her an engraved necklace with William's name she wore for years afterward.\n\nWhich is why we weren't surprised to find out that the reason Lady Diana Spencer was snapped at the Polo wearing two watches was a subtle nod to her fianc\u00e9 at the time, Prince Charles.\n\nMarie Claire UK reports that the gold watch in the picture above was in fact Princess Diana's, while the larger watch with the leather strap was Prince Charles'. According to the website, Diana wore the watch as a tribute to Charles and to wish him luck in the Polo match, which is really rather sweet, don't you think?\n\nIt seems as though the Duchess of Cambridge loves sentimental jewelry as much as her late mother-in-law.

As the U.K. honors the memory of Princess Diana's tragic death twenty years ago, public opinion has shifted against Charles' bid to become the next King of England. Will Prince William take the throne if Queen Elizabeth abdicates?\n\nThe Daily Beast reports that only twenty percent of the U.K. thinks Charles should be king after Elizabeth steps down. This is partly due to the anniversary of Diana's death and Camilla's involvement in the destruction of her and Charles' marriage. August, of course, is always tough on Charles and his wife, but this year is particularly damaging due to all the media coverage surrounding the anniversary, including the recently released Princess Diana tapes.\n\nThe tapes were released during a special documentary about Diana's life and tragic death in 1997. Diana recorded the tapes herself and claims that Charles told her, \"I refuse to be the only Prince of Wales never to have a mistress,\" after she confronted him about his affair. The revelations came after Prince William and Prince Harry failed to mention their father in a documentary but called Princess Diana the best mother in the entire world.\n\nTo make the situation worse, sources claim that Charles is planning on calling Camilla queen instead of princess consort once he takes the throne. The move would be frowned upon by the general public, who already view the couple in an unfavorable light. In fact, a recent survey revealed that a slight majority of the public in the U.K. would prefer that William become king over his father.\n\nWhat are the chances that William becomes king over Charles?\n\nAccording to Vogue, there are no legal barriers to William becoming king because he is a direct Protestant descendant of Queen Elizabeth. There is also precedent in an heir abdicating to a younger brother. King Edward VIII handed the reigns to George VI in 1936. The question, however, is whether or not Charles is willing to abdicate and make his son King over himself.\n\nThere's also the matter of when Elizabeth will step down from her duties as queen and officially retire.

Not these upper-class aristocrats who don't understand the people,\" said Borkowski.\n\nThe media strategy appears to have succeeded, with the queen continuing her record-breaking reign with the support of her subjects.\n\n\"I think the monarchy under the stewardship of Her Majesty the Queen has certainly learnt lessons throughout the time\".\n\nAnd as the monarch slowly steps back from some royal duties, her grandchildren Princes William and Harry are taking on more public roles -- helped by a well-oiled media machine that helped burnish their image in the public eye.\n\n\"The whole

She was in Scotland with Diana's two young sons, Princes William and Harry, at the time of the accident, and she chose to stay there with the boys rather than return to England immediately. This decision drew ire from many of Diana's supporters, who felt she should have returned immediately to England.\n\nGallery: 50 iconic pictures of Princess Diana [via Photo services] 50 iconic pictures of Princess Diana\n\nBut now, a newly discovered letter written by the queen to her close aide Lady Henriette Abel Smith just days after Diana died sheds more light on that time than ever before. It explains the queen's reasoning behind staying in Scotland and shows how deeply hurt she actually was by the tragedy even though she remained stoic in public.\n\n\"It was indeed dreadfully sad, and she is a huge loss to the country. But the public reaction to her death, and the service in the Abbey, seem to have united people round the world in a rather inspiring way. William and Harry have been so brave and I am very proud of them,\" the queen wrote.\n\nShe went on to say that she chose to stay in Scotland with Prince William and Prince Harry because she believed it was in their best interest at the time to have some distance from the media circus surrounding Buckingham Palace.\n\n\"I think your letter was one of the first I opened -- emotions are still so mixed up but we have all been through a very bad experience!\" she wrote.\n\nDespite how the public interpreted that event, Elizabeth's decision to do right by the boys above all else was not wrong.", "date": "2017-08-17", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "wgt": 100, "id": 449, "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice"}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "wgt": 100, "id": 1032, "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement"}], "concepts": [{"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "type": "loc", "id": "84296"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "type": "loc", "id": "113913"}, {"location": {"country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}, "type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "type": "loc", "id": "242110"}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_(band)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "id": "303150", "label": {"eng": "Queen (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckingham_Palace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "303766", "label": {"eng": "Buckingham Palace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images", "type": "org", "score": 4, "id": "305090", "label": {"eng": "Getty Images"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II", "type": "person", "score": 3, "id": "305814", "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "id": "306417", "label": {"eng": "Prince Harry of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Royal_Family", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "id": "329310", "label": {"eng": "British Royal Family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana,_Princess_of_Wales", "type": "person", "score": 5, "id": "330715", "label": {"eng": "Diana, Princess of Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_circus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "id": "334524", "label": {"eng": "Media circus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "id": "345411", "label": {"eng": "Stoicism"}}]}

Though she came from a family of British nobility with royal ancestry, her upbringing wasn't exactly an easy one. Diana's parents divorced when she was 7, and her mom left her and her three siblings with their father, who remarried without telling them. As a young girl, she lived at Park House on the royal family's Sandringham estate, and in 1975, she became Lady Diana Spencer after her father inherited the title of Lord Spencer and moved the family to Althorp, the Spencer estate in Northampton, England. From there, she was shipped off to boarding schools, where she became insecure, unstable, and withdrawn.\n\nLong before she met and married Prince Charles and became the Princess of Wales, Diana was a bright child who, despite not being that great of a student, excelled in the arts, including ballet and piano.

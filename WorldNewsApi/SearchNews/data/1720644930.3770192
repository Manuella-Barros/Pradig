The tech giant has updated its list of obsolete devices, which now includes several older iPhone models, as detailed in a document on its support page. When Apple declares an iPhone model obsolete, it essentially means the end of the road for support and repairs from the company. These iPhones will no longer receive iOS security updates, leaving them vulnerable to cyber threats. In the worst-case scenario, hackers could exploit unpatched flaws to hijack your device. Even if you dodge security issues, an obsolete iPhone will likely suffer from performance degradation, becoming slower and more prone to glitches. And with the current economic squeeze, the last thing you need is an unsupported iPhone.

Moore, global cybersecurity advisor at ESET told Forbes: \"Obsolete devices including iPhones will all at some point see their free updates come to a halt, putting them at risk to any vulnerabilities that are found after that date.\" For all the latest news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US Despite older iPhones not being the main target for cybercriminals, as most users have upgraded to newer models, Moore emphasises the importance of staying vigilant. \"Older iPhones still remain in circulation and once a vulnerability is located, it can rapidly be exploited by attackers and directed at anyone with devices left unpatched.\" Keeping your tech up-to-date is crucial, according to Moore. \"If people are using iPhones that are out of patch warranty-although it's frustrating-they should consider replacing them with a newer, more secure device.\" Echoing Moore's advice, it's wise to also check the iPhones of family members, particularly those used by children or the elderly who might have inherited older models. Don't wait until it's too late; if your iPhone has hit the obsolete mark, look into getting a replacement. Remember, it doesn't need to be the newest kid on the block even refurbished iPhones can offer a safer, discounted alternative.", "summary": "Apple has updated its list of obsolete devices, which now includes several older iPhone models, warning that if you have one of these models, you could be at risk from cyber criminals", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/tech-expert-issues-stark-warning-32988596", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32988672.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Launch-Of-Iphone-X-At-Apple-Store-Saint-Germain-In-Paris.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:10:18", "author": "Vassia Barba,Vassia-Barba", "authors": ["Vassia Barba", "Vassia-Barba"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.418}

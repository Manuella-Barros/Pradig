The Blues are reported to have made contact with the 24-year-old's representatives, having placed him high on their wishlist in the search for a forward. He is set to enter the final year of his contract at the end of the month, and the Ligue 1 side are reported to be open to moving him on if they receive a \"reasonable offer.\" Club president Oliver Letang previously stated that David would be allowed to leave this summer, with Premier League sides as well as AC Milan also linked with him.

PAPER GOSSIP - A new approach for Everton centre-back Jarrad Branthwaite is being prepared by Manchester United, reports the Daily Mail. The Red Devils are expected to improve on their previous offer of \u00a343 million, though it is unclear whether they will come close to meeting the Toffees' previous demands of \u00a370m. Manager Erik ten Hag is keen to reinforce his defence this summer, with Rapha\u00ebl Varane set to leave Old Trafford at the end of the month. - Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Xavi Simons has informed the club of his desire to leave this summer, reports Fabrizio Romano.

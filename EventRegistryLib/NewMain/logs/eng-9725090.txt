A win would extend his presidency to three decades.\n\nGiven the longstanding dominance of Kagame's party - the Rwandan Patriotic Front - and widely reported cases of his administration's stifling of criticism and open dissent, political analysts and civil society members fear that the elections will further tighten his iron-fist grip on the country of 13 million people.\n\nKagame first came into power in 1994 after he led the Rwandan Patriotic Front rebel group to defeat Hutu extremist forces and end the genocide that killed more than 800,000 people, mostly members of the Tutsi minority, in about 100 days. He then became vice-president and defence minister, before being elected president by parliament in 2000 after the resignation of Pasteur Bizimungu. Each time he has sought reelection - in 2003, 2010 and 2027 - he has won more than 90% of the vote.\n\nIn the Kagame administration's telling, Rwandan politics remains defined by the tragic legacy of the 1994 genocide and, therefore, it's not yet time for a politics that \"has a tendency to create divisions\", said David Kiwuwa, associate professor of international studies at the University of Nottingham. \"Kagame's stay in power will ensure a continuation of consensus politics and human rights a secondary priority,\" he said.\n\nKagame has stabilised and transformed the country since the events of 30 years ago. Access to electricity to households has widened. Corruption has gone down. The capital, Kigali, has transformed from a ghost town during the genocide, with clean streets lined with stylish new buildings that host hotels, conference centres and other local and international businesses. The country has also positioned itself as a sports, cultural and conferencing hub. The BK Arena in Kigali hosts concerts and sporting events such as the Basketball Africa League.\n\nBut while some view Kagame as a visionary leader, others see him as an oppressive despot. During his reign, many dissidents and critics have been jailed, others have died or disappeared suspiciously, instilling fear and suppressing freedom of speech, expression and association. Rwandan officials have long denied the claims.\n\nAt least five opposition members and four government critics and journalists have died or disappeared in suspicious circumstances since the 2017 presidential election, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\n\"It's concerning to see that the ruling party's been increasingly cracking down and its threshold for criticism getting increasingly lower as the years have progressed, to the point where there's very few today who are able to speak independently and not face very serious consequences,\" said Cl\u00e9mentine de Montjoye, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.

A win would extend his presidency to three decades.\n\nGiven the longstanding dominance of Kagame's party - the Rwandan Patriotic Front - and widely reported cases of his administration's stifling of criticism and open dissent, political analysts and civil society members fear that the elections will further tighten his iron-fist grip on the country of 13 million people.\n\nKagame first came into power in 1994 after he led the Rwandan Patriotic Front rebel group to defeat Hutu extremist forces and end the genocide that killed more than 800,000 people, mostly members of the Tutsi minority, in about 100 days. He then became vice-president and defence minister, before being elected president by parliament in 2000 after the resignation of Pasteur Bizimungu. Each time he has sought reelection - in 2003, 2010 and 2027 - he has won more than 90% of the vote.\n\nIn the Kagame administration's telling, Rwandan politics remains defined by the tragic legacy of the 1994 genocide and, therefore, it's not yet time for a politics that \"has a tendency to create divisions\", said David Kiwuwa, associate professor of international studies at the University of Nottingham. \"Kagame's stay in power will ensure a continuation of consensus politics and human rights a secondary priority,\" he said.\n\nKagame has stabilised and transformed the country since the events of 30 years ago. Access to electricity to households has widened. Corruption has gone down. The capital, Kigali, has transformed from a ghost town during the genocide, with clean streets lined with stylish new buildings that host hotels, conference centres and other local and international businesses. The country has also positioned itself as a sports, cultural and conferencing hub. The BK Arena in Kigali hosts concerts and sporting events such as the Basketball Africa League.\n\nBut while some view Kagame as a visionary leader, others see him as an oppressive despot. During his reign, many dissidents and critics have been jailed, others have died or disappeared suspiciously, instilling fear and suppressing freedom of speech, expression and association. Rwandan officials have long denied the claims.\n\nAt least five opposition members and four government critics and journalists have died or disappeared in suspicious circumstances since the 2017 presidential election, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\n\"It's concerning to see that the ruling party's been increasingly cracking down and its threshold for criticism getting increasingly lower as the years have progressed, to the point where there's very few today who are able to speak independently and not face very serious consequences,\" said Cl\u00e9mentine de Montjoye, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. She was prevented from entering Rwanda earlier this year.\n\nRwanda is rated \"Not Free\" in the latest Freedom in the World report, which tracks global trends in political rights and civil liberties, with a score of 23 out of 100.

The ruling party, the Rwanda Patriotic Front, nominated Kagame as its presidential candidate during a congress in March. He got 99.1% of the vote.\n\nKagame faces Frank Habineza, who leads the opposition Democratic Green Party, and Philippe Mpayimana, an independent candidate and former journalist. In the country's last election in 2017, Kagame garnered nearly 99% of the vote. This year, about 9.5 million Rwandans are registered to vote.\n\nSince he was first elected president in April 2000, Kagame has systematically repressed any opposition to his rule. Many critics of the regime have died, disappeared, been arrested or fled the country.\n\nThe Conversation Africa has published several articles that put Rwanda's political landscape into context - as well as Kagame's place in it.\n\nAs it stands, Rwanda has no political candidate strong enough to face off with Kagame, who is now 66. Susan Thomson, a professor of peace and conflict studies, explains the risks in this lack of a back-up plan. As she puts it, the government's failure to establish a succession plan could have catastrophic consequences for the country's future.\n\nRead more: Rwanda's Achilles' heel: there is no back-up plan to Kagame\n\nIn the face of the regime's repressive tactics, public opposition has been muted. This means only Kagame will decide when he exits the political stage. David E. Kiwuwa, who has researched Rwanda's political transformation, says five factors have created these conditions. These include the role of the Rwandan Patriotic Party - a political and economic powerhouse - in keeping Kagame in power. The president is also known to be a strict disciplinarian with a strong work ethic. He has dismissed cabinet members implicated in corruption and held poor performers to account. This has made Rwanda one of the least corrupt countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and the easiest to do business in. This has won Kagame many supporters.\n\nRead more: Paul Kagame could be president of Rwanda until 2035 - what's behind his staying power\n\nFurther justifying his rule is the fact that Kagame strongly believes in his vision for Rwanda. Maartje Weerdesteijn has studied the motivations of dictators - broadly defined as leaders who cannot be removed through elections, or where political opposition doesn't operate on a level playing field. Her research suggests Kagame feels duty-bound to stay in power. He aims to create a safe and secure society for the country's Tutsi minority following the 1994 genocide. He sees the end as justifying the means - even if this means sacrificing freedom for prosperity in post-genocide Rwanda.\n\nRead more: Rwanda: Paul Kagame is a dictator who clings to power but it's not just for his own gain\n\nIt's a risky play. While some see the value in Kagame's aspiration for the country to become Africa's Singapore, critics see disturbing characteristics in common with North Korea. The question is if Rwanda's distinctive approach to state-building can endure in the long term. In the view of comparative politics researcher Omar Shahabudin McDoom, Rwanda's preoccupation with security as a path to rebuilding the state is at odds with its desire for unity.\n\nRead more: Rwanda's post-genocide model prioritises security over freedom and equality - a risk to future stability\n\nStill, this strategy has not entirely alienated the country's Hutu majority. In a study of how a Tutsi ruling elite has found legitimacy in Rwanda for three decades, R\u00e9ginas Ndayiragije and Marijke Verpoorten found that the Kagame regime has focused on policies that improve state-citizen relations. The government has invested in public goods, such as universal healthcare, that include both the Hutu and Tutsi. As a result, Hutu citizens have over time reported feeling more represented in government despite its ethnic makeup.\n\nRead more: Rwanda's Tutsi minority has been in power for 30 years - but study finds ethnicity doesn't matter to people if their needs are met\n\nIn the face of its internal politics, Rwanda has worked hard to boost its international reputation. To curry favour abroad, Kagame has employed soft power tactics and military diplomacy. This has generated a mixture of concern and curiosity.\n\nRead more: Rwanda's military support to other countries is part of a strategy to boost its reputation", "source": {"uri": "theconversation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Conversation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Kagame", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Kagame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Rwanda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_and_conflict_studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Peace and conflict studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Habineza", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frank Habineza"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Conversation (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Green_Party_of_Rwanda", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Green Party of Rwanda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_Patriotic_Front", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rwandan Patriotic Front"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colgate_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colgate University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruling_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ruling party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutsi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tutsi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sub-Saharan Africa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corruption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnicity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethnicity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-building", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State-building"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rwandan genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comparative politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hutu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soft power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Universal health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Diplomacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "North Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative_Political_Systems", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Alternative Political Systems", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://images.theconversation.com/files/606305/original/file-20240711-21-bhv3xf.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=4%2C52%2C1017%2C508&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9725090", "eventUri": "eng-9725090", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2000-04-", "textStart": 683, "textEnd": 693}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

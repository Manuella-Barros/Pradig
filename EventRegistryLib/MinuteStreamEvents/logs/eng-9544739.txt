The Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra) recently said that its chairman and president-elect Prabowo Subianto's idea of forming a \"presidential club\" was not something that came out of the blue.\n\nAs the name suggests, this club will regularly gather former presidents --including the incumbent Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo -- to have talks on strategic state issues with Prabowo. According to Gerindra's deputy chairman Habiburokhman, Prabowo has been talking about forming a presidential club at the party's internal meetings for years.\n\n\"Presidential club is an idea that Mr. Prabowo has long discussed with Gerindra's cadres. To be honest, I have already heard of this since a long time ago,\" Habiburokhman told Beritasatu over the weekend.\n\nHabiburokhman said the presidential club aimed to maintain what the previous governments had achieved. He added: \"Former presidents are the best people one can consult with and ask about the previous policies.\"\n\nAside from outgoing President Jokowi, Indonesia today has two living former presidents Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) and Megawati Soekarnoputri.\n\n\"They all have made incredible achievements in their era. Mr. Prabowo of course would need some input from those three figures. ... Whatever form the presidential club takes, whether it is formal or informal, we really need to maximize these talks between the presidents. It is for all Indonesians and the country's sake,\" Habiburokhman said.\n\nPresident Jokowi last week commented on the establishment of the presidential club.\n\n\"That would be great. I don't mind having this [presidential club members gathering] once every two days,\" Jokowi said.\n\nTourism Minister and United Development Party (PPP) politician Sandiaga Uno also gave his take on the regular meetings with ex-leaders, saying that such talks would be pivotal amidst emerging global challenges.\n\n\"Mr. Prabowo wishes to embrace all strengths. We will face many international, geopolitical turbulences, including the global economic slowdown. I like Mr. Prabowo's idea of uniting [all these strengths] and gathering the inputs from Mr. SBY, Mrs. Mega, and also Mr. Jokowi,\" Sandiaga said in a recent Instagram post.\n\n\"I'm optimistic that [the three] are thinking about what is best for our country. Of course, they want to give some ideas to Mr. Prabowo on facing the future dynamics of Indonesia's developments,\" Sandiaga said.\n\nThe news of a presidential club first came to the surface following a statement by Prabowo's spokesman Dahnil Azhar Simanjuntak.\n\n\"Mr. Prabowo wants to regularly meet with the former presidents to discuss strategically important national issues. So they can foster a friendship that serves as an example to all,\" Dahnil told reporters last week.

The idea of establishing a presidential club by President-elect Prabowo Subianto is seen as a positive step in facilitating regular discussions among former Indonesian presidents on strategic national issues. The presidential club is deemed essential, especially given the complex relationship between two former presidents, Megawati Soekarnoputri and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY), over the past two decades.\n\n\"Prabowo wants to act as a bridge, a unifying force among former presidents who are not on close terms. This is part of Prabowo's respect for the former presidents,\" Ujang Komarudin, Executive of the Indonesia Political Review, told Beritasatu.com, the Jakarta Globe's sister publication, on Monday.\n\nSBY and Megawati have had a less harmonious relationship with ups and downs. Their political rivalry often peaked before elections, such as during the 2004 Presidential Election, which strained their relationship. Since then, they have competed politically through their respective parties.\n\nThe conflict between Megawati and SBY can be traced back to the incident known as the July 27th Riot (Kuda Tuli). At that time, the Indonesian Democratic Party - which was then still called PDI - became the target of riots instigated by opposing party elements. Even the PDI's Central Executive Board office was targeted by the rioting masses.\n\nSBY was accused of involvement in the incident, creating bitter memories for PDI cadres, who eventually transformed into the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P).\n\nNevertheless, Megawati, who served as president from 2001 to 2004, appointed SBY as the Chief Security Affairs Minister. This decision was questioned by some PDIP cadres.\n\nSBY was later recorded as the first democratically elected president by the people and served as the sixth President of Indonesia after being inaugurated on October 20, 2004, alongside Vice President Jusuf Kalla. He won against Megawati-Hasyim Muzadi in the 2004 election.\n\nThis conflict not only affected their political careers but also the relationship between the parties they led. Despite being involved in intense political competition, both SBY and Megawati did not bring the conflict into their personal lives. This was evident when Megawati expressed her support and condolences to SBY when his beloved wife, Ani Yudhoyono, passed away in 2019.\n\nPrabowo Subianto's spokesperson, Dahnil Anzar, revealed plans to establish a Presidential Club as a platform for Prabowo-Gibran to seek advice from former presidents. This initiative is aimed at preserving national unity and demonstrating to the public that leaders can come together and discuss issues despite political differences.\n\nBy the time Prabowo takes office on October 20, Indonesia will have three living former presidents, including Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo, SBY, and Megawati.\n\nHabiburokhman, deputy chairman of Prabowo's Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra), suggested that Prabowo Subianto could facilitate reconciliation between Jokowi and Megawati.\n\nJokowi has distanced himself from the PDI-P since his son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, joined Prabowo as a running mate in the February election. The PDI-P nominated a different candidate and initially expected full support from both Jokowi and Gibran, who had previously won elected public offices with the party's nomination.\n\nSeveral PDI-P elites have confirmed that Jokowi and Gibran are no longer affiliated with the party, suggesting a potential opposition role in Prabowo's future government.

The composition of Prabowo's cabinet is still under discussion with the team.\n\nPrabowo would like to form a sort of presidential club. It aims to be a venue for presidents and former presidents to discuss issues of state and government, among other things.\n\nPrabowo's spokesperson, Dahnil Simanjuntak, explained that the presidential club in question was just a term used and not the creation of a new institution. The president-elect, Dahnil said, wants to stay in regular contact with previous presidents to discuss issues related to state and government, among others.\n\nHe explained that this was because Prabowo had a main vision from the start, one of which was sustainability. Dahnil also added that sustainability is not just about leadership and sustainability. legacy Jokowi, but also former presidents, namely President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, Megawati Soekarno Putri, Abdurahman Wahid and BJ. Habibie.\n\nThis means that Pak Prabowo wants to maintain the communication that Pak Jokowi maintained with previous presidents. There is sharing\"There are regular meetings that bring direct benefits to Pak Prabowo's policies,\" he said.\n\nApart from that, Dahnil continued, it is also a symbol of community, the unity of presidents to have a positive effect on society, that is the main spirit.\n\nNo need to worry about the President's Club\n\nLili Romli, political observer of the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN), assessed that this presidential club was good as it was intended to discuss, formulate how to build a prosperous and democratic Indonesia and build friendship. And not to co-opt by justifying or legitimizing political decisions harmful to the people.\n\nAccording to Lili, the term presidential club cannot be formalized, and in its implementation it cannot use state money.\n\nDecision making between the president and the former president then becomes a means of legitimizing the issuance of policies, right? Because, anyway, the policy-making process must be approved through the DPR, not in the DPR. club president It's not. That it's a way to exchange ideas yeah, it's goodLili told VOA, Sunday (5/5).\n\nLili said intense or regular discussions and communications between the president and former presidents could defuse tensions that existed between former presidents such as Megawati Soekarno Putri and Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono as well as Megawati and Jokowi.\n\nHowever, Herdiansyah Hamzah, constitutional law observer at Mulawarman University, has a different opinion. According to him, the presidential club issue is an attempt to embrace Prabowo's political opponents, in this case Megawati Soekarno Putri.\n\nAccording to him, the presidential club in the United States will be different from that in Indonesia. The reason is that in Indonesia, former presidents also control political parties.\n\nAre you up for it or not? pure talk about real statesmanship, but also about efforts to reach out to political opponents, as former presidents Megawati and SBY, for example, also held positions in political parties. \"This is a kind of effort to subjugate political parties so that they come closer to the government coalition,\" he said.\n\nPDI-Perjuangan awaiting proposal?\n\nOne thing that has not yet been included in the government coalition, Herdiansyah said, is the PDI-P.\n\nSo, one way to embrace the PDI-P is to kiss its head, in this case Megawati, because that is the main reason. club president the speech is to adopt Megawati, which means it is a package to adopt the PDIP. So I don't think it's being proposed as a place for former presidents to gather to discuss the country, the future, Noemphasized Herdiansyah.\n\nIf all political parties joined a governing coalition, he added, it would paralyze the democratic process because it would eliminate the opposition. In fact, public opinion, he continued, hopes that there will be an opposition force capable of balancing and monitoring the president.

Announcing the results on March 20, the General Election Commission (Komisi Pemilihan Umum (KPU)) confirmed that Defense Minister Prabowo Subianto was elected president of the country. country and Gibran Rakabuming Raka, the eldest son of outgoing leader Joko Widodo- has been confirmed as the country's next vice president. KPU Chairman Hasyim Asy'ar said Subianto received about 58 percent of the total votes while his rivals Anies Baswedan, former governor of Jakarta, and Ganjar Pranowo, former governor of Central Java, received 24.9, respectively. % and 16% of the votes. According to the KPU chairman, the percentage of votes obtained by Prabowo was sufficient to ensure a majority in the first round and therefore there was no need for a second round.\n\nBaswedan and Pranowo then filed separate complaints with the Constitutional Court and appealed to overturn the results and hold new elections. Baswedan claimed that incumbent President Joko Widodo had allocated social assistance during the election period to tip the scales in favor of Prabowo. Baswedan said this could become a norm in the future, Pranowo asked the Court to disqualify Subianto and Raka. However, these challenges were rejected by the Constitutional Court in a 5-3 ruling that the losing candidates' legal teams had failed to prove allegations that Prabowo Subianto's victory was the result of a widespread fraud. The Court entirely rejects the petitioners' appeal, said Constitutional Court Chief Justice Suhartoyo. After the Court's verdict, the KPU officially declared Prabowo as the country's next president-elect in a ceremony in Jakarta. The race is over. The tough competition, with sometimes heated debates, is over. And now our people demand that political leaders work together and collaborate for the well-being of the people and to eliminate poverty and corruption in Indonesia, Prabowo said at the ceremony. Baswedan and Pranowo were also present at the ceremony.\n\nAccording to Indonesian media, Prabowo will be sworn in in October in what will then become the national capital of Nusantara. The government is also preparing to host the Independence Day celebration on August 17 in the new city currently under construction in East Kalimantan.\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Prabowo had said he would continue Joko Widodo's populist policies, such as developing downstream raw materials sectors, upgrading infrastructure and maintaining a disciplined macroeconomic governance agenda. Prabowo, during his election campaign, had also pledged to continue Jokowi's main policies, such as moving the capital from Jakarta to Nusantara, a new city being built on the island of Borneo, and the development of a domestic mineral processing industry rather than shipping lower-value raw materials. materials abroad. The Prabowo administration is aiming for an ambitious eight percent economic growth target and intends to improve Indonesia's energy self-sufficiency by promoting biodiesel derived from palm oil.\n\nA challenge for Prabowo will also be rebuilding his image. Prabowo has links to the years of Suharto's dictatorship. Prabowo was Suharto's son-in-law. His human rights record has also faced scrutiny in the past due to his alleged role in the kidnapping and torture of pro-democracy activists during the years of Suharto's dictatorship. During the election campaign, Prabowo used a social media campaign to project a favorable image.\n\nWhen it comes to foreign policy, Widodo had been doing a delicate balancing act when it came to Indonesia's policy toward the United States and China. While Indonesia received significant Chinese investment during Widodos' tenure, it also strengthened defense ties and intensified military exercises with the United States. Political observers say that in all likelihood Prabowo will continue on this path when it comes to foreign relations, as he maintains a stance of neutrality and has openly praised the United States and China.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Elections_Commission", "type":

In less than six months, Prabowo Subianto and Gibran Rakabuming Raka will be sworn in as the country's new president and vice president.\n\nPrabowo will carry on the torch from President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) who has led the country for the past decade. The General Election Commission (KPU) has appointed Prabowo and Gibran as the election winners after the Constitutional Court rejected the petition submitted by the rival teams Anies Baswedan-Muhaimin Iskandar and Ganjar Pranowo-Mahfud MD.\n\nPrabowo has secured approximately 96.2 million votes, about 58.59 percent of the total votes. Ahead of the inauguration ceremony, the public is hoping that the president-elect will truly implement what he has promised, including providing free school lunches and carrying on Jokowi's policies. Indonesia is also seeking to achieve a \"golden era\" by 2045 as envisioned by Jokowi. This calls for a solid Prabowo-Gibran cabinet.\n\nOn many occasions, Jokowi said that the next 10 years would be pivotal to determining whether the 2045 Golden Indonesia vision could come true. Jokowi said he would support his successor's prerogative to select his ministers. The outgoing president also vowed he would not meddle in its formation but would be open to providing inputs if asked by Prabowo-Gibran.\n\n\"Establishing the cabinet is entirely the president's prerogative. ... It is up to the president-elect [to form his cabinet]. There's nothing wrong if I'm asked to give some recommendations. But if they don't ask and we meddle in the [cabinet formation], that's not allowed,\" Jokowi said not long ago.\n\nChief Investment Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan told Prabowo that he should be careful not to pick \"toxic people\" as his ministers.\n\n\"To the president-elect, I said 'Don't bring toxic people to your administration' because it is going to hurt us very much. I'm a strong believer that the president-elect can do a lot of things for this country to be better in the future,\" Luhut said at the Jakarta Futures Forum last week.\n\nCoalition or Opposition\n\nAfter the Constitutional Court's ruling, political party elites from the rival teams began to maneuver into Prabowo's team. This includes Surya Paloh who chairs the National Democratic Party (Nasdem) -- the party nominating runner-up Anies.\n\nPrabowo -- who also chairs the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra) -- had reiterated that he would be open to working with the rival teams in the incoming government, even saying that having all forces join together would enable \"a powerful and effective government\" amid today's global dynamics.\n\n\"This election is over, now our task together is how to move forward to develop the country, while we cannot ignore the dynamics and challenges of the world to us,\" Surya Paloh told the press, shortly after meeting Prabowo.\n\nMuhaimin Iskandar, Anies's running mate and chairman of the National Awakening Party (PKB), also revealed his party's readiness to support the incoming government.\n\n\"Both PKB and Gerindra have worked together at the parliament and executive government. So we want to ramp up this productive partnership. Especially with President-Elect Prabowo Subianto who will face a challenging development agenda,\" Muhaimin said at the press conference after meeting Prabowo.\n\nThe Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) have not decided whether they would join the coalition or become an opposition to the future Prabowo government. On April 27, PDI-P's secretary-general Hasto Kristiyanto said it would be up to the party's chairwoman Megawati Soekarnoputri to pick the party's directions.PDI-P is set to determine its political directions later this month, including what sort of strategic steps it will undertake after the election.\n\nLikewise, PKS fraction chair Jazuli Suwaini said that its direction would depend on the result of its grand summit.\n\nPrior to the Constitutional Court's ruling, the political parties part of Prabowo's Advanced Indonesia Coalition had secured 280 out of 580 seats at the House of Representatives. As many as 102 seats go to Golkar. Followed by Gerindra (86), the National Mandate Party or PAN (48), and the Democratic Party (44). This means that Prabowo-Gibran still needs the support of at least one more party to get strong parliamentary support. The breakdown of the parliamentary seats for parties outside the coalition is as follows: PDI-P 110; Nasdem 69; PKB 68; and PKS 53.\n\nWith the right coalition, Prabowo-Gibran would not need to invite PDI-P and PKS to be part of their team, according to Arya Budi, the research director at Poltracking Indonesia.\n\nArya said that having PKB and Nasdem in the coalition would be enough, as the executive power or the president would only require half of the parliamentary support. He also warned that having too many parties in the coalition would complicate things.\n\n\"Prabowo and Gibran will be busy consolidating the government, especially in terms of dividing the ministerial seats,\" Arya said.\n\nA Cabinet of Technocrats\n\nBut a giant coalition would make it hard for the so-called \"zaken cabinet\", according to Siti Zuhro, a professor at the National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN). The \"zaken cabinet\" is an Indonesian term for a cabinet represented by technocrats and professionals. The appointment of ministers is not affected by political party representation.\n\nThis will enable the ministers to focus on their jobs without having to worry about their respective political parties' agendas. The law states that the government shall have no more than 34 ministries. If Prabowo wants to accommodate all coalition parties, that would require some changes to the existing law, Siti said.\n\nThe most sought-after strategic positions among political parties are typically the finance minister, home affairs minister, and foreign minister. With a large coalition, having to divide the ministerial posts among the political parties would be inevitable. Siti said that increasing the number of vice ministers would be a possible option if changes to the law could not be made.\n\nUjang Komarudin, the executive director of Indonesia Political Review, said that the larger the coalition, the fewer technocrats joining the cabinet. Ujang said: \"There is no free lunch in Indonesian politics. Joining the coalition will guarantee [the political party] a ministerial seat.\"\n\nA cabinet shall have half of the ministers coming from political party representatives, while the rest are professionals. \"Ideally, professionals should make up 60 percent of the ministerial composition, while 40 percent are political parties. But in the end, it is Prabowo's prerogative to decide who gets to be his minister.\"\n\nProportionally Divided\n\nAccording to Ujang, Prabowo is likely to \"proportionally\" prioritize political party representatives in his cabinet, depending on the party's respective contribution to his election win. Gerindra will possibly earn the largest share in the cabinet, followed by supporting parties who earn a large share at the House of Representatives: Golkar, PAN, and the Democratic Party. Former rivals PKB and Nasdem will likely get the least of ministerial posts.\n\nJokowi's relations with PDI-P have gone sour after the former is seen as the most influential figure behind Prabowo-Gibran's election win. Ujang said: \"PDI-P is likely to get a ministerial post offer, but I think PDI-P will insist on taking the opposition route.\"\n\nHanta Yuda, the executive director at Poltracking Indonesia, said that the foreign minister, home affairs minister, and defense minister would be the three \"strategic positions\". Prabowo will pay attention to who gets this seat, as the three will take over the responsibility of the president or vice president in case they cannot carry out their duties.\n\nHanta said that the current Home Affairs Minister Tito Karnavian would possibly maintain his position, considering his close ties with Prabowo and Jokowi. Prabowo will likely pick Sjafrie Sjamsoedin to be Indonesia's next defense minister. Sjafrie is currently a special advisor at the Defense Ministry.\n\n\"The next foreign minister can be anyone, but I doubt it would be political party representatives taking this post,\" Hanta said.\n\nIt is unlikely for Prabowo to appoint political party representatives to lead the ministries of the state-owned enterprises, minerals, finance, and the state secretariat. Hanta stated: \"These positions are directly related to the people's interest and are at the center of the president's power.\"\n\nNo Final Decision Yet\n\nAndi Mallarangeng, a senior official at the Democratic Party, last week said that Prabowo and Gibran had not made a final decision on the cabinet yet. This cabinet includes the formation of a state revenue agency separate from the Finance Ministry. There are also plans to separate the environment ministry from that of forestry.\n\nAs Indonesia waits for Prabowo's cabinets, different versions of the upcoming cabinet not long ago circulated on social media. Gerindra's deputy chairwoman Rahayu Saraswati Djojohadikusumo said that Prabowo had not made any final decision.\n\n\"There are talks [regarding the cabinet composition] at the leadership level. But once again, there are no official decisions yet regarding the ministers,\" Rahayu --who is also Prabowo's niece -- said while arguing the final list will likely come out sometime near the inauguration ceremony.\n\nVice-president-elect Gibran also told the public to be patient with the 2024-2029 cabinet announcement.\n\n\"Just wait for the final composition. We have agreed to minimize the learning and adaptation processes in this transition period. So once the inauguration ceremony takes place, we can immediately get to work,\" Gibran said last week.\n\n__", "source": {"uri": "jakartaglobe.id", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jakarta Globe"},

According to Gibran, the presidential club will unite former Indonesian leaders.\n\n\"I think it's a good (idea), to bring together former leaders, seniors, and elders,\" said Gibran when met by the media crew at the Solo DPRD Building, Central Java, after attending the Solo City DPRD plenary meeting, on Monday, May 6, 2024.\n\nHe said the existence of a Presidential Club could allow him and Prabowo, the president-elect, to at least get input from experienced former presidents. He also asked the general public to wait for the proper concept of the presidential club.\n\n\"What is clear is that this is a terrific proposal,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked about his plan to meet the former president and Chair of PDI-P, Megawati Soekarnoputri, however, Gibran did not answer. He only said that his side would ask all relevant seniors for their input. \"Yes, we will ask the seniors and experienced state leaders for their opinion. That is our consideration about the formation of a presidential club,\" he said.\n\nThe Mayor of Solo added that asking for input regarding the cabinet and evaluation could come from people within or outside the Onward Coalition. \"Input, evaluation, opinion, whatever it is, can come from people inside or outside the coalition, it's no big deal,\" he said.\n\nPrabowo's aim to form a presidential club was previously expressed by Prabowo's spokesman, Dahnil Anzar Simanjuntak. Going forward, the Presidential Club will become a platform for living former presidents of Indonesia to convene.

Announcing the results on March 20, the General Elections Commission (Komisi Pemilihan Umum (KPU)) confirmed that Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto has been elected President of the country and Gibran Rakabuming Raka - the eldest son of outgoing leader Joko Widodo- was confirmed as the next Vice President of the country. KPU Chairman Hasyim Asy'ar said that Subianto received approximately 58% of the total votes while his rivals Anies Baswedan, former Jakarta Governor and Ganjar Pranowo, former Central Java Governor received 24.9% and 16% votes respectively. According to the KPU Chairman, the percentage of votes received by Prabowo were enough to secure a first round majority and thus, there was no need for a runoff election.\n\nBaswedan and Pranowo then filed separate complaints in the Constitutional Court and appealed to overturn the results and hold fresh election. Baswedan alleged that outgoing President Joko Widodo allocated welfare assistance during the electoral period to sway the election in favour of Prabowo. Baswedan said that this could become a norm in future, Pranowo asked the Court to disqualify both Subianto and Raka. However, these challenges were rejected by the Constitutional Court in a 5-3 decision which said that the legal teams of the losing candidates had failed to prove allegations that Prabowo Subianto's victory was the result of widespread fraud. The Court \"rejects the petitioner's appeal entirely,\" Constitutional Court Chief Justice Suhartoyo said. After the verdict of the Court, the KPU formally declared Prabowo as the country's next President elect in a ceremony in Jakarta. \" The race has finished ... the tough contest, with sometimes heated debates, is over. \"And now our people demand that political leaders must work together and collaborate for the people's welfare and to eliminate poverty and corruption in Indonesia,\" Prabowo said in the ceremony. Notably the ceremony was also attended by both Baswedan and Pranowo.\n\nAccording to reports in Indonesian media, Prabowo will be sworn into office in October in what is to then be the national capital city of Nusantara. The government is also preparing to host the Independence Day event on August 17 in the new city currently under construction in East Kalimantan.\n\nDuring his Presidential campaign, Prabowo had stated that he would continue the populist policies of Joko Widodo such as developing downstream commodities sectors, modernizing infrastructure, and maintaining a disciplined macroeconomic governing agenda. Prabowo, in his election campaign, had also pledged to continue Jokowi's main policies such as relocating the capital from Jakarta to Nusantara, a new city being built on the island of Borneo, and developing a domestic mineral processing industry rather than shipping lower-value raw materials abroad. Prabowo administration aims for an ambitious economic growth target of eight percent and intends to enhance Indonesia's energy self-sufficiency by promoting biodiesel derived from palm oil.\n\nA challenge for Prabowo will also be to rebuilt his image. Prabowo has linkages with the dictatorship years of Suharto. Prabowo was the son in law of Suharto. His human rights records has also come into scrutiny in the past due to his alleged role in the kidnapping and torture of pro-democracy activists during the dictatorship years of Suharto. During the election campaign, Prabowo used a social media campaign to project a favourable image.\n\nAs regards the foreign policy Widodo had done a delicate balancing act with regards to the Indonesian policy towards US and China. While Indonesia received substantial Chinese investments during Widodo's tenure, it also boosted defence ties and intensified military exercises with the US. Political observers say that in all probability, Prabowo will continue such a course in foreign relations as he maintains a stance of neutrality and has openly commended both the United States and China.", "source": {"uri": "newdelhitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Delhi Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Elections_Commission",

As a symbol of national unity, he also wants to engage with all living former presidents, which is why he is aspiring to form a president's club.\n\nThat is a noble idea and deserves support from us all. It has been practiced in, among other democracies, the United States and seeks to contribute to the sustainability of democracy there. The country's former presidents put their political differences behind them to help the sitting president guide the nation through difficult times.\n\nNancy Gibbs, coauthor of the book The President's Club: Inside the World's Most Exclusive Fraternity, says the club was formed to help those who come next. The former presidents belong to the group out of a sense of responsibility to the country.\n\nAnother coauthor, Michael Duffy, adds that ex-presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama are men \"who still don't love each other but who knew they needed to be together that day and they needed to be seen together\".\n\nThe club must have impressed Prabowo and inspired him to form one here. If realized, Indonesia's club would consist of fifth president Megawati Soekarnoputri, sixth president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (SBY) and seventh president Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo, whom Prabowo will succeed in October.\n\nWhile Jokowi has shown enthusiasm for helping realize the initiative of his defense minister, not all former presidents have welcomed the idea. Megawati, according to her confidant and Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) secretary general Hasto Kristiyanto, will focus on her commitment to her party.\n\nThe strained ties between Megawati and Jokowi have become an open secret, as has her fraught relationship with SBY. Prabowo claims to have no grudge against Megawati and has reportedly been trying to arrange a meeting with her.\n\nMegawati and Jokowi parted ways politically after almost 20 years of cooperation when the latter opted to support Prabowo, rather than the PDI-P's choice of Ganjar Pranowo, in the February presidential race. Some PDI-P politicians even suggest that reconciliation between Megawati and Jokowi is next to impossible.\n\nAnd after two decades, Megawati cannot come to terms with SBY, who beat her twice, in the 2004 and 2009 presidential races. Talk of SBY's Democratic Party joining the Jokowi government surfaced several times over his tenure but never progressed, reportedly because of Megawati's objection.\n\nVice President Ma'aruf Amin was right when he predicted that Prabowo would need to make a herculean effort to bring all the living former presidents on board. Some observers have also asked Prabowo not to insist on having all the ex-presidents in the unprecedented club.\n\nMegawati may be the main holdout to the club, or even national reconciliation more generally, after a general election that many consider the least democratic and least credible since the start of the Reform era in 1998. In fact, nobody, not even Prabowo, could force Megawati to bury the hatchet if she did not wish to.\n\nThe biggest obstacle to the president's club is not the continuing personal feud among its would-be members but their penchant for power struggle even after leaving office. Megawati remains the controlling PDI-P chairwoman and SBY the powerful chief patron of the Democratic Party. Jokowi has cut ties with the PDI-P but he is reportedly looking for a party, such as the Golkar Party, to keep him in the spotlight after the transfer of power.\n\nThe former presidents, Jokowi to be included not too long from now, remain political bigwigs fighting for their own parties' survival, rather than statesmen or women who solely think about the well-being of the country's 280 million people. It's too far-fetched to expect them to dedicate themselves to the nation, as the founding goal of the club would have it, if they keep their vested interests intact.\n\nFor the time being, let's just hope all the former presidents, and former vice presidents, turn up for the state Independence Day ceremony on Aug. 17. Seeing them meet together in person is enough to send the message of unity and harmony.", "source": {"uri": "thejakartapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jakarta Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabowo_Subianto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prabowo Subianto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megawati_Sukarnoputri", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Megawati Sukarnoputri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susilo_Bambang_Yudhoyono", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joko_Widodo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joko Widodo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_Democratic_Party_of_Struggle", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Majapahit was used by Indonesia's founding fathers as the justification for the construction of what would become the modern nation-state of Indonesia.\n\nThe initiative to build a replica of the Majapahit palace in Cipayung, East Jakarta, came from former National Intelligence Agency (BIN) AM Hendro Priyono.\n\nIn his speech, Prabowo praised Hendro for devising the plan.\n\n\"This is an extraordinary idea from Pak Hendropriyono,\" said Prabowo. Hendro was one of the first former Indonesian Military (TNI) generals to back Prabowo's presidential candidacy in early 2023.\n\nIn backing Prabowo, Hendro parted ways with his own son-in-law and former TNI commander Andika Perkasa, who decided to endorse the presidential bid of Ganjar Pranowo, 55, who is the former governor of Central Java (2013-2023), and before that, a lawmaker (2004-2013) for the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P).\n\nHe has a postgraduate degree in political science from the University of Indonesia and is an alumnus of Gadjah Mada University's (UGM) Faculty of Law. -

Mr Prabowo and Mr Gibran won 59 percent of the votes and has been officially declared the winner of the election by Indonesia's General Elections Commission.\n\nBoth Mr Prabowo and Mr Gibran will take their oath of office as the new president and vice-president respectively on Oct 20.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabowo_Subianto", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prabowo Subianto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coalition government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerindra_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gerindra Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibran_Rakabuming_Raka", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gibran Rakabuming Raka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mandate_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Mandate Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_School_Lunch_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National School Lunch Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdem_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdem Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Awakening_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Awakening Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Party_(Egypt)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Party (Egypt)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golkar", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Golkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joko_Widodo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joko Widodo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Elections_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Elections Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kompas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oath of office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surakarta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surakarta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Surakarta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--bMCqCYfA--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2021-08:cna,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2024/04/24/DSC_0790-Enhanced-NR%20copy.jpg?itok=l9DaNdpq", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544739", "eventUri": "eng-9544739", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 1400, "textEnd": 1405}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-14", "textStart": 1997, "textEnd": 2003}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-20", "textStart": 2303, "textEnd": 2309}], "sentiment": 0.4039215686274509, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

But equally important is South Korea's support.\n\nOf course, Prabowo fully realizes that all international relations should be based on the principle of mutual benefit, and that all binding bilateral and multilateral agreements should be upheld.\n\nHe also knows very well that China, Japan and South Korea became ASEAN's dialogue partners in 1997, when the regional bloc launched the ASEAN Plus Three economic cooperation during the second informal summit in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nEast Asia has since become ASEAN's most important partner in terms of economic, political and security cooperation, and ministerial and leaders' meetings have been held under the ASEAN Plus Three banner.\n\nThe bloc also hosts regular meetings with the region's larger partners in the East Asia Summit (EAS), which involves all ASEAN 10 member states and Australia, India, New Zealand, Russia and the United States, as well as China, Japan and South Korea.\n\nThe regional forums are no stranger to Prabowo in his capacity as defense minister, a position he has held since the beginning of Jokowi's second term in 2019, and his recent East Asia tour suggests he is keen to maintain ASEAN as a priority in Indonesian diplomacy.\n\nDuring his visit to Beijing, Prabowo assured President Xi Jinping that he would maintain continuity in Indonesia's close bilateral relationship with the world's second-largest economy, which emerged during the Jokowi presidency as its leading economic, trade and investment partner.\n\nAnd as defense minister, Prabowo knows very well the rivalry between China and the United States over influence in the Asia-Pacific, specifically the increasingly worrying tensions in the Taiwan Strait the maritime disputes in the South China Sea.\n\nWith regard to the latter, China's persistent claim that the North Natuna Sea, part of Indonesia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), has been a traditional fishing ground for millennia is particularly irritating for Indonesia. The issue has the potential to irritate the good relations between the two neighbors in the unforeseeable future.\n\nWhen welcoming Prabowo, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida surely expected the Indonesian president-elect not to repeat the humiliating saga of the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed rail (HSR) project. In September 2015, President Jokowi awarded the HSR tender to China instead of Japan, though the latter had met all requirements, including a comprehensive feasibility study, a low interest rate and a long-term payment deal.\n\nWhile South Korea was not on Prabowo's April itinerary, he can still plan a trip to Seoul to meet with president Yoon. This would provide him with a perfect opportunity to settle the stalled cooperation between the two countries to build fighter jets.\n\nIn principle, the two countries' leaders have agreed to resume the collaboration, with Indonesia promising to fulfill its cost share in the joint project. It would be much more productive for Prabowo's incoming government if he could restart the project before October.\n\nIndonesia may ask to renegotiate but if so, this should be communicated transparently. Indonesia is very important for South Korea, and vice versa. Failure to reach a settlement that is acceptable for both sides will erode international confidence in Indonesia.\n\nAs reported by Korea's Yonhap News Agency, president Yoon called Prabowo on April 17 to congratulate him on his election victory and to suggest strengthening bilateral cooperation in various sectors, such as defense, electric vehicles and infrastructure.\n\nYoon also expressed his hope for further bilateral efforts in championing freedom, peace and prosperity with Indonesia, one of Seoul's key partners in the Korea-ASEAN Solidarity Initiative (KASI).\n\nJakarta and Seoul already have several defense cooperation initiatives, from procurement to the joint weapons development, but South Korean media have quoted officials expressing their frustration with Indonesia's very slow progress in realizing its obligations.\n\nIn February, when Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi met with her South Korean counterpart Cho Tae-yul, the two countries agreed to resume collaboration on developing next-generation KF-21 fighter jets.\n\nThe KF-21, which is being developed by Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) with the partial backing of Indonesia, is designed to be a cheaper, less stealthy alternative to the US-built F-35 on which South Korea relies.\n\nBut Indonesia has held off on its payments for nearly two years. South Korea estimates it has paid around 278 billion won (US$209. 5 million) so far, with almost 1 trillion won in arrears.\n\nIn 2018, Indonesia sought to renegotiate its side of the deal to take pressure off its foreign exchange reserves, and later offered to pay its share in the form of barter.\n\nWhen receiving South Korean Ambassador to Indonesia Lee Sang-deok in March, Prabowo reportedly assured the envoy that Jakarta would be settling its arrears soon.\n\n\"We are committed to exploring the opportunity to strengthen collaboration and are open to working together on stronger technology transfer,\" Prabowo said in a statement on the Defense Ministry website.\n\nPrabowo has achieved a major diplomatic scoop with China's Xi and Japan's Kishida, so it will be opportune for him to visit Yoon in Seoul to complete his East Asia tour before he becomes president.", "source": {"uri": "asianews.network", "dataType": "news", "title": "ANN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Allies of Prabowo Subianto are voicing their full support for the president-elect's proposal to expand the number of ministries in his future cabinet, citing the need to address upcoming challenges more effectively.\n\nKamhar Lakumani, an executive of the Democratic Party, went as far as to suggest that having up to 40 ministries would be reasonable to tackle the pressing issues confronting the incoming government.\n\n\"With the constantly shifting geopolitical landscape, the government must evolve into a more responsive and adaptable entity,\" Kamhar said in Jakarta on Thursday.\n\nHe noted that the existing law, which limits the number of ministries to 34, was enacted 16 years ago under vastly different national and global circumstances.\n\n\"The circumstances that prompted the enactment of that law differ significantly from the realities we face today, necessitating its revision,\" he argued.\n\nCritics, including defeated presidential candidate Ganjar Pranowo, have raised concerns that the planned cabinet expansion is merely a means for Prabowo to reward allies with cabinet positions for their support during the election.\n\nPrabowo's presidential bid received backing from four incumbent political parties, and following his official victory, three additional parties from rival coalitions declared their support for his future government, potentially securing a supermajority in the House of Representatives.\n\nAnalysts fear that the multitude of parties backing Prabowo could result in a cabinet dominated by politicians rather than professionals.\n\nSufmi Dasco Ahmad, the acting chairman of the Great Indonesia Movement Party (Gerindra), did not explicitly refute allegations of patronage in ministerial appointments.\n\n\"Let me pose this question to my colleagues: 'What's wrong with accommodating allies who have collaborated with us and pledged to work together for Indonesia's future?'\" Dasco said.\n\nHe claimed that \"the victor of the election is entitled to the prerogative\" to reshape the cabinet.\n\nDasco clarified that Prabowo has not publicly stated a plan to create new ministries.

Vice president-elect Gibran Rakabuming Raka said on Tuesday the free school lunch program needs a dedicated ministry because of its anticipated complex distribution and large government spending.\n\nThe free school lunch program was introduced by Prabowo Subianto and Gibran in their presidential campaign to help Indonesia combat stunting and supercharge its economy. Students starting from pre-school to high school across the archipelago will be eligible to get free meals. With Prabowo claiming a landslide victory in the election, the public now waits on how Prabowo and running mate Gibran would put the plan into action.\n\n\"If you ask why we should set up a dedicated ministry [to oversee the free school lunch], well, this program will take up huge government spending, and it will not be easy to distribute the meals. There are also challenges with the logistics and monitoring,\" Gibran told reporters in Solo.\n\n\"We also want this program to really work, and make a real impact that can be felt by the students,\" the Solo mayor added.\n\nHowever, Gibran did not go into details on the free school lunch ministry, only saying that he was still in discussions with Prabowo. They were also still discussing whether the government would need to add more ministers in the upcoming cabinet.\n\n\"We are still in discussions, ... so just wait. But we pay special attention to this free school lunch program,\" Gibran said.\n\nAccording to Prabowo-Gibran's manifesto, the pair is also seeking to distribute nutritional aid for pregnant women and toddlers.

This practice has caused Indonesia's political parties to increasingly disregard the interests of their constituents and rely more on incumbents to secure abundant political and economic resources with their collusive networks (Slater 2004).\n\nThe effective expansion of party cartels means that political competition is no longer fair and will only jeopardize the horizontal checks and balances of democracy given the lack of significant opposition.\n\nWe should be proud that Indonesia's democracy has reached a level of consolidation. However, following Indonesia's transition to democracy in 1998, the anticipated emergence of an effective opposition has never materialized. Rather, post-reform Indonesian presidents adopted a strategy of power-sharing, characterized by what Slater (2018) calls \"oversized coalitions\" among political parties, effectively coopting opposition forces.", "source": {"uri": "thejakartapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jakarta Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabowo_Subianto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prabowo Subianto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Awakening_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Awakening Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdem_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nasdem Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cartel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibran_Rakabuming_Raka", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gibran Rakabuming Raka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Paloh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surya Paloh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Court_of_Indonesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional Court of Indonesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anies_Baswedan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anies Baswedan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susilo_Bambang_Yudhoyono", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joko_Widodo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joko Widodo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consociationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consociationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collusion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collusion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Separation of powers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://img.jakpost.net/c/2024/04/26/2024_04_26_149803_1714098610._large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9544739", "eventUri": "eng-9544739", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-22", "textStart": 89, "textEnd": 97}, {"amb": false, "date": "-02-14", "textStart": 181, "textEnd": 188}], "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Former President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, commonly known as SBY, is prepared to meet his predecessor Megawati Soekarnoputri at a mutually convenient time and place, according to an aide on Tuesday.\n\nThese statements emerged amid reports suggesting that President-elect Prabowo Subianto intends to establish an exclusive club of living former presidents to discuss pressing national issues and challenges.\n\n\"For the benefit of the people and the nation, Mr. SBY has no reservations about sitting down with anyone, particularly Madame Megawati, who held the presidency before him,\" said Kamhar Lakumani, an executive of the Democratic Party founded by SBY.\n\nHe said the Democratic Party fully endorses Prabowo's proposal to form the presidential club, allowing former presidents to offer insights and experiences to the incumbent president on crucial matters.\n\n\"Prabowo has repeatedly proposed this concept with the belief that the nation's esteemed leaders, who have been entrusted with the presidency by the people, can continue contributing to the country and share their experiences with the sitting president, enabling the formulation of decisive and impactful policies,\" Kamhar explained.\n\n\"This would have a positive impact on the public, demonstrating that former leaders remain harmonious and united despite their political differences,\" he added.\n\nHowever, reconciling SBY and Megawati may prove challenging due to long-standing rivalries dating back more than two decades.\n\nSBY resigned abruptly from Megawati's cabinet to contest the country's first-ever direct presidential election in 2004, defeating his former boss. He was reelected five years later, with Megawati herself becoming one of the contenders.\n\nThroughout SBY's decade-long presidency, Megawati and her Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) served as an opposition to the government.\n\nFollowing the victory of PDI-P's presidential nominee Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo in the 2014 presidential election, the Democratic Party assumed the role of an opposition party. This dynamic shifted recently when SBY's son, Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono, was appointed as a cabinet minister by Jokowi.\n\nMoreover, the Democratic Party supported the presidential candidacy of Prabowo, who appointed President Jokowi's son, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, as his running mate last October.\n\nThese developments have widened the gap between Jokowi and Megawati, rendering Prabowo's presidential club concept even more elusive.

Certainly not Liberty or Big Ben, more like the tinkle from a pet's collar. No matter. This tale is Shakespearean -- a brave man of destiny or a finger puppet to flick aside.\n\nThe reserved, small-town Indonesian businessman and now Vice President-elect of the world's third largest democracy is just half the age of his fearsome boss with an alleged human rights record of worrying substance.\n\nCashiered former career soldier Prabowo Subianto, now honorarily reinstated as a four-star general, in October will become the eighth president of the fourth largest nation in the world -- and our neighbour.\n\nGibran has never been in the military so has no first-hand knowledge of a culture of following incompetents' orders without question.\n\nIndonesia elected former military officer with autocratic streak\n\nAustralia must navigate the hardline tendencies of its new president, Prabowo Subianto, a former military officer with a chequered human rights record, writes Duncan Graham.\n\nBut this is his swag; he volunteered (or was press-ganged) for a job that's been tagged as the \"most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived\".\n\nThe U.S. quote is centuries old but appropriate in Indonesia today with current Vice President Ma'ruf Amin, 81. The former senior cleric and head of an Islamic organisation is VP only because President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo thought his name on the 2019 election ticket would draw pious voters.\n\nIn the past five years, the VP has done little more than open religious festivals and oppose gays, once quoted saying:\n\n\"We want a stern prohibition of LGBT activities and other deviant sexual activities and legislation that categorises them as crime.\"\n\nJokowi rarely donned jubah gamis, the traditional shapeless long robes of conservative Muslim men to flaunt their godliness. Instead, he modelled the splendid designs of regional batik on his slender frame.\n\nBatik is not the right fit for Prabowo who uses safari suits to hide his plumpness. He's height-sensitive so compensates by strutting like Mussolini and heading parades on a stallion, hoping equine virility transfers.\n\nHe used to be married to second President Suharto's daughter, Titiek. The marriage collapsed in 1998 when Prabowo was kicked out of the military for disobeying orders and then fled to Jordan.\n\nConservatives are trying to get the couple together so the Republic can have a first lady. So far she's resisted.\n\nGetting younger generations involved in politics\n\nHow to get the young involved in current affairs? Politicians shy from the question fearing Gen Z's latent power could shrink their authority. Duncan Graham recommends Indonesia.\n\nThe union produced Didit, a European socialite and fashion designer -- widely rumoured to be gay. If so, it could be good news for the oppressed community as critics would fear offending Prabowo.\n\nIndonesian politics has been eaten rotten from the inside by the termites locals call KKN -- korupsi, kolusi, nepotisme. Now add D for dinasti: Independent research of 87 election candidates shows 50 came from political families.\n\nAlthough the State claims to be democratic, it's way down the international list and better labelled flawed.\n\nFor his third try at the summit, Prabowo wanted someone linked to Jokowi who'd done well building toll roads, rail lines and a universal health insurance scheme. Who better than his son?\n\nGibran is Jokowi's eldest, a successful food franchise flogger. The Constitution prevented his Dad from standing for a third five-year term, so why not a proxy?\n\nJust a wee glitch: the law says public office holders must be over 40. Gibran, 36, sped to court and got the rule flipped; having his uncle as the senior judge on the bench may have helped.\n\nDemocrats were horrified; the masses probably thought it a hoot. Nepotism? What's new?\n\nFed by a partisan media that makes The Australian look balanced, electors were led to a fix-it authoritarian former military man drawn as a cuddly gramps -- though in reality, an echidna.\n\nPrabowo won hands-down against two civilian thinkers, an academic and an administrator.\n\nIndonesia failing to inject energy into upcoming election\n\nIs it possible to overdose on politics? In Indonesia, yes. There's a month left before the 14 February deciding date -- and the signs are showing wear and tear.\n\nSo he's got what he's lusted for since being weaned largely because (so the psephologists reckon) Jokowi Mark 2 is close by.\n\nBut how close? This will be more than a test of political skills -- it'll also measure the lad's manhood. Has he got the right stuff, what it takes to eyeball his septuagenarian boss, hold the stare and say, \"You're wrong\"?\n\nIt's widely believed that Gibran's top task is to ensure his Dad's signature project, Nusantara, remains, however much the rupiah falls and the budget blows beyond the AU$50 billion allocated.\n\nNusantara is the new capital being built in East Kalimantan, 1,000 kilometres north of Jakarta. Overseas investors stay shy so billions will have to flow from State funds otherwise tagged for the guns and missiles Prabowo and his mates love.\n\nWhen Gibran graduated from a Singaporean campus in 2010 with a management diploma, it was expected he'd take over the family furniture business.\n\nInstead, he started his own show selling snacks and then catering for weddings. Trade would not have been hindered by couples bragging they'd hired the President's son to get the dishes right.\n\nHe was recently reported to be worth about AU$2.6 billion. Not a bad story, though he won't talk to Western journos.\n\nWhether he'd have done well with a name like Kampong Charlie is questionable. More than half of Indonesian startups fail within five years. The success-by-association trend continued when in 2020 he was elected Mayor of his Central Java hometown of Solo. It was a job Daddy used to have.\n\nBy then, Gibran had wed local bank accountant Selvi Ananda, a Catholic who converted to marry. Couples who respect each other's different beliefs get hitched overseas.\n\nShe rarely wears a jilbab (headscarf), so the two-kids couple come across as progressive, the look that tertiary-educated young Indonesians want the world to see.\n\nThat's not Prabowo's image -- but he runs the show. For him, Gibran's just the warm-up act soon to be yanked off stage. That's unless he dares to defy the oligarchy and pave his own path.\n\nAs this is Indonesian politics at its most iniquitous; he'd be well advised to go fishing for the next five years -- or employ a food taster.\n\nDuncan Graham is an Australian journalist living in East Java.\n\nRelated ArticlesIndonesia elected former military officer with autocratic streakIndonesia failing to inject energy

Vice President-elect Gibran Rakabuming Raka stated that he had no issue with rival presidential candidate Ganjar Pranowo's decision not to join the upcoming administration of President-elect Prabowo Subianto.\n\n\"It's okay, no problem. We still seek his guidance from the outside,\" he told reporters at Solo City Hall, Central Java, on Tuesday.\n\nThe eldest son of President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo also mentioned that Ganjar's decision to stay out of the Prabowo-Gibran government aligns with his party, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P). It's noteworthy that Gibran himself hails from PDI-P but was later chosen by Prabowo as his running mate.\n\nThe departure of the president's family from the PDI-P has caused some tension between Jokowi's family and Megawati Soekarno Putri, who endorsed Ganjar in the 2024 Presidential Election.\n\nGibran emphasized that even if Ganjar and the PDI-P do not join his administration, their input will still be valued.\n\n\"Oh yes, of course, it's usually like that (the party's stance aligns with the candidate it supports). It's okay, whoever it is, input from within the coalition, from the outside, or the opposition, will still be welcomed. No problem,\" he affirmed.\n\nGibran highlighted that he and Prabowo would continue to try to embrace all parties and figures. Therefore, Prabowo-Gibran would maintain communication with all parties, including the PDI-P.\n\n\"Once again, at the direction of the elected president, everyone will be embraced. Dialog and communication will still be maintained with all parties,\" said Gibran.\n\nHowever, when asked if this embracing meant including the PDI-P in the Prabowo-Gibran cabinet, Gibran said that it would depend on the future situation.\n\n\"We'll see later (if PDI-P joins the cabinet). He (Prabowo) immediately greeted guests from outside the coalition after he was declared the winner of the 2024 Presidential Election. The point is to maintain communication. Keep in touch with other parties. As for the composition of the cabinet and others, that's for later. There is still plenty of time, and the decision lies with the elected president,\" he said.\n\nPreviously, Ganjar Pranowo declared his intention to become part of the opposition at a PDI-P gathering event in Central Jakarta on Monday.\n\n\"I declare, I will not join the government, but I respect this government very much, and we will exercise control properly,\" said Ganjar.\n\nEchoing Ganjar, his vice presidential candidate, Mahfud MD, also stated that he would continue his struggle by returning to teach at the university.\n\nPoltracking Indonesia Research Director Arya Budi encouraged Prabowo and Gibran to form an effective coalition. According to Arya, with an effective coalition concept, Prabowo-Gibran no longer needs to attract the PDI-P and the Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) to join the government.\n\nAccording to Arya, Prabowo-Gibran only needs one more political party outside his coalition, the Koalisi Indonesia Maju (KIM), to form an effective coalition. The reason is that the number of seats from the four KIM parties, namely The Great Indonesia Movement (Gerindra), Golkar Party, Democratic Party, and the National Mandate Party, is close to 50 percent.\n\n\"The National Democratic Party has explicitly stated their intention to join the coalition, and the National Awakening Party is getting closer. So, Prabowo's need to embrace or add another party is actually unnecessary,\" Arya explained.\n\nFurthermore, Arya said, as a democratic country, there should ideally be an opposition bloc in the House of Representatives to criticize the programs and policies of the Prabowo-Gibran government. Regarding this matter, he said, the PDI-P and PKS should remain outside the government, even though the situation has not yet fully resolved.\n\n\"Both parties are not well consolidated, they are not 'listening to the same tune'. Ideologically, the PDI-P and PKS are very distant, they are opposed ideologically. So, if the PDI-P and PKS are outside (the government), both of them might work with their own reasoning,\" Arya concluded.

Debate over Indonesia's incoming leader Prabowo's idea to form 'presidential club' with predecessors", "body": "JAKARTA: An elite club comprising Indonesia's sitting and living former presidents could help incoming leader Prabowo Subianto consolidate power, but challenges lie in bridging new and old rifts, analysts say.\n\nMedia outlets were quick to pounce on the idea of a presidential club, first raised by Mr Prabowo's spokesperson in late-April.\n\n\"Mr Prabowo has repeatedly expressed his strong desire to convene and hold discussions with former presidents, thereby forming a presidential club,\" said Mr Dahnil Anzar Simanjuntak during an interview with Kompas TV.\n\nThe club would serve as a forum for exchanging views and ideas on strategic national issues, enabling Mr Prabowo to benefit from the experiences of his predecessors in governing the country, Mr Dahnil said.\n\nEarlier this week, he said the presidential club would not be a formal set-up and there are no plans to institutionalise it, unlike the Presidential Advisory Council (Wantimpres). Wantimpres is a government body that advises the Indonesian president on daily administration and is regulated by Article 16 of the Constitution of Indonesia.\n\nBy the time Mr Prabowo takes office on October 20, Indonesia will have three living former presidents: Mr Joko Widodo, Mr Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Ms Megawati Soekarnoputri.\n\nMr Widodo as well as Mr Yudhoyono's party have welcomed the idea of such a club, with incumbent Mr Widodo even joking that his successor could meet with the former presidents every other day.\n\nMr Yudhoyono's Democratic Party also welcomed the proposal warmly. Senior party official Andi Mallarangeng, a confidant of Mr Yudhoyono, said the country's sixth president would endorse the idea, news site Kompas.com reported.\n\nThe United States has such a club, Mr Andi noted.\n\nThe sitting US president, as well as living former presidents, have come together at state funerals and for various causes. Mr Joe Biden, Mr Barack Obama, and Mr George W Bush all tapped their predecessors when they were in office.\n\nFor instance, Mr George W Bush stood with two former presidents, his father George HW Bush and Mr Bill Clinton, in early 2005 when calling for donations for victims of the 2004 Aceh earthquake and tsunami. In 2010, Mr Obama, flanked by Mr Clinton and Mr George W Bush, sought aid for survivors of an earthquake in Haiti.\n\nBut Mr Prabowo could face challenges with Ms Megawati, analysts say.\n\nHer relationship with Mr Yudhoyono has been frosty for the past two decades, ever since the latter decided to contest against her in the 2004 presidential election.\n\nMr Yudhoyono, who eventually won the election, was serving as Ms Megawati's chief security minister at the time. It is widely believed that Ms Megawati viewed this as a betrayal.\n\nThere are also tensions between Ms Megawati and Mr Widodo, following his decision to break away from her Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) in the recent presidential election.", "source": {"uri": "channelnewsasia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prabowo_Subianto", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prabowo Subianto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joko_Widodo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joko Widodo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kompas_TV", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kompas TV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susilo_Bambang_Yudhoyono", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakarta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jakarta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megawati_Sukarnoputri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Megawati Sukarnoputri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Indonesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of Indonesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Indonesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "President of Indonesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

After winning his country's vote in February, he has fended off legal challenges to his election, with the top court rejecting appeals for a re-vote and allegations of fraud. President Biden and other foreign heads of state have sent their congratulations on his election.\n\nBut in a year of big elections worldwide, big questions remain about the aftermath of the vote in the world's third-largest democracy: Has Prabowo turned over a new leaf, or will he drag Indonesia back toward its authoritarian past? And what will relations be like between Prabowo and the United States, the country that first trained and backed him, then later imposed sanctions on him for alleged human rights abuses?\n\nOn April 22, Indonesia's Constitutional Court dismissed a petition by the two losing candidates in the election, in which they alleged widespread vote-buying and government interference. But to many observers, Prabowo's ascent to the presidency remains problematic.\n\n\"I think we can easily see, actually, that this national election was definitely the least free and the least fair of any election we've had in the post-Suharto period,\" argues Edward Aspinall, an expert on Indonesian politics at the Australian National University in Canberra.\n\nThe fall of former President Suharto in 1998, after three decades of authoritarian rule, led to a period of democratic reforms, during which elections have generally been seen as fair.\n\nHowever, outgoing President Joko Widodo cleared away restraints on presidential power. Critics allege that Widodo muzzled the nation's anti-corruption watchdog in 2019 by stripping it of its independence and making it a government body, and maneuvered his 37-year-old son into position as Prabowo's vice president. Experts suggest Prabowo may have no need to roll back democratic reforms further.\n\nBivitri Susanti, a lecturer at the Indonesia Jentera School of Law, says that given the Biden administration's focus on global democracy, the U.S. should speak out against \"dynastic politics.\"\n\n\"If the U.S. really wants to build an alliance on democracy and rejecting authoritarianism,\" she says, \"I believe this is a big step towards authoritarianism, and so it has to be criticized publicly.\"\n\nIt is far from clear what kind of president Prabowo will turn out to be, and even critics admit that he has a chance to show that he's changed from his military days, when he is alleged to have committed grave abuses against civilians.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Prabowo declared that \"power and sovereignty are in the hands of the Indonesian people\" and that the country's future would be decided by \"one person, one vote.\"\n\nBut in the past, Aspinall notes, Prabowo has disparaged elections as \"too expensive and too tiring,\" and argued that open opposition to the government \"was not compatible with Indonesia's national culture, which emphasized harmony.\"\n\nSimilarly, observers are looking for signs of whether Prabowo's early attachment to the U.S. -- or his later alienation from it -- will affect his dealings with Washington.\n\nPrabowo graduated from high school at the American School in London, where his family lived in exile. He received special forces training at Fort Bragg, N.C., (renamed Ft. Liberty in 2022) and officer training at what was then Fort Benning, Ga., now Ft. Moore, in the 1980s.\n\nBut Prabowo was discharged in 1998 as head of Kopassus, Indonesia's special forces command, for his role in alleged human rights abuses -- including killing of civilians during Indonesia's 1975 invasion and occupation until 1999 of East Timor, and the disappearance of student activists during protests against Suharto in 1998.\n\nPrabowo was never prosecuted for his actions, as part of what Aspinall calls a \"Faustian bargain\" between the incoming civilian government and Suharto's outgoing generals that gave the generals immunity in exchange for relinquishing their grip on politics.\n\nPrabowo denied the allegations against him. But \"there was abundant evidence that Kopassus and others were essentially functioning as a criminal enterprise. Death squads, so to speak,\" says Tim Rieser, a former foreign policy aide to former Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy.\n\nRieser helped craft the Leahy Law, which bars the U.S. government from assisting foreign military forces implicated in gross human rights violations. And Leahy himself argued, Rieser says, that \"if there ever was a case for the Leahy law to be applied,\" Indonesia was it.\n\nAs a result of the law, the U.S. cut ties with Kopassus in 1999 and banned Prabowo from entering the U.S. from 2000 until he became defense minister in 2020.\n\n(The U.S. has recently considered whether to apply the Leahy Law to Israel's military for human rights violations against Palestinian civilians, but has so far not imposed any sanctions.)\n\nRieser describes Prabowo as presenting the U.S. with a dilemma between its geopolitical interests and the values it proclaims.\n\n\"We need partners and Indonesia is a country that the United States wants to be a partner of,\" he says. \"On the other hand, I think that we make a mistake -- and we've made this mistake too often -- when we don't stand up for the basic values and principles that people look to us for.\"\n\nRieser notes that part of the problem is competing priorities between branches of government, such as the Pentagon and the State Department.\n\nCongress banned U.S. training of Indonesian armed forces from 1992 to 1995, but the Pentagon continued its training under its own separately funded program, in what former Rep. Nancy Pelosi called a clear \"circumvention of Congress.\"\n\nAnother is shifting historical priorities. The U.S. backed Suharto during the Cold War to fight communism. It called on him to step down after the Cold War was over, when the Clinton administration was trying to promote democracy, and riots erupted in Indonesia against authoritarianism, corruption and economic hardship in 1998.\n\nMany Indonesians are too young to remember this history.\n\nBut the U.S. government, argues Rieser, will hopefully learn from its Cold War-era experiences, and, he says, \"when someone like this [Prabowo] comes to power, we're still going to stand up for now what we believe in\" and publicly support Indonesians fighting for democracy.\n\nFor now, though, world leaders including President Biden have only sent the president-elect their congratulations.", "source": {"uri": "michiganpublic.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Michigan Public"}, "authors": [],

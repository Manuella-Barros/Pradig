Today we'll be comparing the new CPUs to various current and older models to see if you should upgrade your PC and just how fast they are.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000 specifications\n\nAt launch AMD is offering four new models and two we're reviewing today - the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X. All have the same core counts as the previous three generations, starting with six cores with the Ryzen 5 9600X, eight cores with the Ryzen 7 9700X, 12 cores with the Ryzen 9 9900X and 16 cores with the Ryzen 9 9950X.\n\nFrequencies are roughly the same as the Ryzen 7000 series, for example with the Ryzen 9 9950X featuring the same peak boost frequency as the Ryzen 9 7950X of 5.7GHz, while others see modest increases such as the 100MHz boost the Ryzen 5 9600X enjoys over the Ryzen 5 7600X. You can see my video review of the new CPUs below.\n\nAMD has officially released pricing for the Ryzen 5 9600X ($279) and Ryzen 7 9700X ($359) today, which appears to be identical to the leaked pricing last week at Newegg and BestBuy, which is great news because it pointed at reduced prices for all four CPUs. The pricing in the table above is official for the Ryzen 5 and Ryzen 7, but the two Ryzen 9 models use the leaked pricing that appears to be accurate, but for now treat it as unofficial.\n\nWith cores and frequencies being roughly the same as the Ryzen 7000 series, AMD is pinning its hopes on the new Zen 5 architecture for performance improvements. The obvious change, which has been a key feature of AMD launches since Ryzen landed in 2017, is a shrinking of the manufacturing process. Ryzen 7000 CPUs were built using a 5nm process - Zen 5 will transition to 4nm bringing with it lower power requirements that are a feature of a smaller process.\n\nIt's other refinements that contribute to a claimed 16 percent boost to the instructions per cycle (IPC), though, which is how fast a processor is clock for clock compared to previous generations. Frequency increases performance, but the amount of work a processor does during each clock cycle is just as important for performance and it's that which has increased by a claimed 16 percent with Zen 5.\n\nThis is thanks to tweaks such as improved data prefetching, doubling of the L1 cache bandwidth and a 16-way rather than 8-way associative L2 cache design. So, even though core counts and frequencies remain similar, the CPUs do more work per cycle and are more efficient.\n\nSocket AM4 coolers are compatible with the new Socket AM5, so long as they don't require the use of the custom backplate, which the vast majority don't, so the good news is you can probably reuse your old cooler if it's compatible with Socket AM4.\n\nAMD has improved the thermal interface between the CPU and heatspreader, which is claims results in a 7\u00b0C drop in temperatures with the same TDP (power rating). I saw a peak temperature of 55\u00b0C with a liquid cooling system but even modest air coolers should cope with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X, which have TDP's of only 65W. This is good news since Ryzen 7000 CPUs were known to run hot out out of the box, although could be made to run cooler by tweaking and undervolting.\n\nAMD decided not to support DDR4 memory on its new Socket AM5 platform. Initially prices of DDR5 memory were high resulting in high entry costs to the new platform as enthusiasts had to invest not just in new motherboards and CPUs, but expensive DDR5 memory too. Thankfully prices are now not much above the price of DDR4 memory.\n\nThe new CPUs will support higher memory speeds of up to DDR5 8000/ 8000MT/s. However, you'll see diminishing returns above DDR5 6400 as this is still the sweet spot for Zen 5 CPUs as it was for Zen 4. Memory prices are come down a lot since Socket AM5 launched and DDR6000 kits can be found for less than $100, while DDR6400 costs a little more at around $105 for the cheapest kits. It's also worth opting for an AMD EXPO-enabled kit too. This will ensure the memory is optimised for your AMD system.\n\nI used an Asus ROG Strix X670E-E Gaming WiFi, 32GB of Kingston DDR5 6000 memory and an Nvidia RTX4090 graphics card to test the AMD CPUs, with a fresh install of Windows 11 with the latest updates and drivers. My test system uses a liquid cooling loop and I used a be quiet! Dark Power 12 1000W power supply.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X performed brilliantly in Cyberpunk 2077, even managing to outstrip the Intel Core i9-14900K. However, the Ryzen X3D CPUs sat at the top of the graph a way out in front so it's clear they still offer the best gaming performance in certain titles. The Ryzen 5 9600X meanwhile performed well, but older CPUs and those with fewer than eight cores seem to struggle here, but it did manage to match the Core i7-14700K even if it wasn't much ahead of the Ryzen 5 7600X with a similar situation at 1440p. It should also be noted that we enabled ray tracing and DLSS in this game as it can be tough to get playable frame rates without it.\n\nAs a high pace twitch FPS game, every frame counts in Counter Strike 2, and while the Ryzen 7 9700X wasn't a big upgrade from the Ryzen 7 7700X, only AMD X3D models managed noticeably higher frame rates and even Intel's Core i9-14900K wasn't much faster. The Ryzen 5 9600X was well ahead of the Ryzen 5 7600X and a match for the Core i5-14600K too. Stepping up to 1440p generally sees less of a load on the CPU, but for some reason this favored the two new Ryzen 9000 CPUs which placed third and fourth - a fantastic result and likely due to their excellent lightly-threaded performance that we'll look at in a minute.\n\nAt both 1080p and 1440p both the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X offered small gains over their predecessors while leapfrogging several more powerful CPUs from previous generations. It's clear the CPU has reduced impact at 1440p but again the only CPU at 1080p that offered a significant advantage over the Ryzen 7 9700X was the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, while the Ryzen 5 9600X sat well above its price tag.\n\nAnother game that responded well to the Ryzen 9000 CPUs, Flight Simulator again saw the Ryzen 7 9700X only bettered by the Ryzen 7 7800X3D at both resolutions with a stunning third place in the graph, while the Ryzen 5 9600X actually had a slightly higher average frame rate at 1080p, although the test can be a little inconsistent. Still it was a great result for both CPUs.\n\nIn Photoshop, the Ryzen 9000 CPUs came top in an fantastic result, with this test often preferring AMD CPUs and the Zen 5 architecture capitalizing on this with the best results of any CPUs.\n\nIf you're a Davinci Resolve fan rather than Premiere Pro, then Ryzen 9000 doesn;t really offer much more than an incremental benefit compared to the Ryzen 7000 series and in this software more cores are king, meaning that Intel has an advantage.\n\nA similar result to Davinci, Premiere Pro saw incremental gains generation on generation and Intel again has an advantage in performance, but at significantly higher power levels as we'll see in a minute.\n\nA combined Lightroom and Photoshop test, once again we have the two Ryzen 9000 CPUs outperforming everything else, proving beyond doubt the Zen 5 architecture's prowess in photo editing applications.\n\nIt's raw multi-threaded performance that sees AMD struggling but that's to be expected when relying on architectural improvements to boost performance rather than core count increases. Still, there were resonable gains over the previous generation, but again Intel's extra cores help it to an advantage.\n\nHowever, below we can see the single-core test that reveals the reason behind the lightly-threaded prowess of the Zen architecture with the Ryzen 9000 CPUs sitting at the top of the graph.\n\nAnother multi-threaded test, HandBrake saw a similar result to the video editing tests with small gains and higher core count CPUs faring better.\n\nNow remembering the advantage Intel had thanks to higher core counts, the issue there is its CPUs' massive power consumption compared to Ryzen 9000. Both the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X are extremely power frugal and efficient, drawing a huge amount less power than the Ryzen 7000 series and a vast amount less than Intel's similarly priced CPUs. The Core i5-14600K for example drew nearly 150W more than the Ryzen 7 9700X, which outperformed it in most tests outside multi-threaded workloads. The Core i7-14700K added another 75W to that figure and was also matched or bettered by the Ryzen 7 9700X in some tests.\n\nIt's clear that the Zen 5 architecture is efficient, power frugal and sports decent IPC gains over the previous generation that manifest themselves most in lightly-threaded workloads and games. The Ryzen 5 9600X is a vastly more attractive offering than the Ryzen 5 7600X was at launch and that's before we factor in the lower launch price.\n\nRyzen 9000 doesn't have things all its own way, though, as Intel is still better in multi-threaded workloads for similar cost, albeit with much higher power consumption. It also has the issue that AMD's 3D V-Cache CPUs are generally faster in games despite using the older Zen 4 architecture, which will no doubt see potential buyers of the Ryzen 7 9700X either opt for a reduced price Ryzen 7 7800X3D or waiting for Ryzen 9000 to get some 3D V-Cache treatment later this year.\n\nOverall, though, combined with cheaper DDR5 memory and AMD motherboard pricing, Socket AM5 and Ryzen 9000's meagre cooling requirements and lower launch pricing mean it's a tempting upgrade, especially for owners of older AMD and Intel platforms.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR5_SDRAM", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DDR5 SDRAM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer cooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frequency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_AM5", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Socket AM5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1440p", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "1440p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_AM4", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Socket AM4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instructions per cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CPU cache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_nm_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "5 nm process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR4_SDRAM", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DDR4 SDRAM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_signal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clock signal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Best Buy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical_Evaluations_and_Product_Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical Evaluations and Product Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66b27c5de13ba0d19276f8d2/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3068,1725,x215,y145,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 196, "textEnd": 206}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 259, "textEnd": 270}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 232, "relevance": 1}

This generation, instead of leading with a power-hungry flagship, AMD has kicked things off with its Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X. (Two higher-end Ryzen 9 entries will launch a week after these, on Aug. 15.) These CPUs won't be the fastest in AMD's Ryzen 9000-series lineup, but they do a fine job of showing the improvements of the new Ryzen 9000 series over their last-generation Ryzen 7000-series counterparts. The subject of this review, the Ryzen 7 9700X, priced at $359, may not wow you on raw performance for the price, but it's a step up from its direct predecessor the Ryzen 7 7700X. We especially laud AMD's efficiency gains here, which will make this chip far better suited to cheap air cooling or use in compact desktops than Intel's fire-breathing equivalents.\n\nAMD's Ryzen 9000-series processors are based on the company's new \"Zen 5\" microarchitecture, and these processors are, in most ways, better than their predecessors. You might think, \"Of course they are! The Ryzen 9000 series was explicitly designed to replace the Ryzen 7000 series, so they should be better in every way.\" But it's not always the case.\n\nYou'll always see an emphasis on improving performance with each new processor generation. (Otherwise, you wouldn't have much incentive to upgrade.) That performance bump doesn't always come for free, though. Sometimes, we see prices or power consumption rise, too, or we may see little to no change in other parts of the processor.\n\nAMD has claimed that its new Zen 5 architecture has an average increase in performance per clock of 16% versus equivalent Zen 4 implementations, but this varies from one test scenario to another. According to AMD, you could see up to a 35% performance boost, but that only in scenarios leaning heavily on the floating point unit (FPU) inside the processor.\n\nThe overall core counts and clock speeds have changed little between the Ryzen 9000 and the Ryzen 7000 lines. The Ryzen 7 9700X and its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7700X, have eight simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) enabled CPU cores that support 16 total threads. They also both have 32MB of L3 cache, but the Ryzen 7 9700X has a higher amount of L1 and L2 cache and wider internal bandwidth. In terms of clock speeds, we see both processors top out at about the same place, with the Ryzen 7 7700X peaking at 5.4GHz and the Ryzen 7 9700X hitting 5.5GHz.\n\nThe similar core counts and clock speeds mean that the performance differences between these processors will mostly come down to differences in the underlying architecture. In truth, some aspects of the Ryzen 9000-series processors remain unchanged from the Ryzen 7000 series, but the processors are still better in almost every way. I'll dig more into performance later, and you can find more details about the architecture in articles we wrote earlier focused on Ryzen 9000 processors and AMD's Zen 5 architecture.\n\nFor now, let's cover the notable secondary characteristics of the processor. Like previous generations of AMD Ryzen processors, the Ryzen 9000 series uses components called core chiplet dies (CCDs) that contain the CPU cores, plus an I/O die containing the memory controller, PCIe controller, and other important components. The I/O die on the Ryzen 9000 series is entirely unchanged from the Ryzen 7000 series and is based on a 6nm process with an identical feature set.\n\nThis means that Ryzen 9000-series processors like the Ryzen 7 9700X have a built-in integrated graphics processor (IGP) based on AMD's RDNA 2 graphics architecture. This IGP contains two AMD compute units with 128 total shaders clocked at 2,200MHz. The memory controller in the I/O die is also unchanged, but it officially supports DDR5 clocked at 5,600MHz now, up from 5,200MHz on the Ryzen 7000 series.\n\nThe CCDs transitioned to a new 4nm TSMC manufacturing process, down from the 5nm used on most Ryzen 7000-series chips. This, along with architectural changes, has helped make the Ryzen 9000-series processors more energy efficient, arguably their most promising characteristic. The thermal design power (TDP) rating on the Ryzen 7 9700X is just 65 watts (W), which is a huge reduction from the 105W TDP rating on the Ryzen 7 7700X.\n\nIt's not a design change, but it's worth noting that the Ryzen 7 9700X is less expensive, too. (Or at least it is, going by the list price/MSRP at launch.) The Ryzen 7 9700X debuts at $359, roughly 10% cheaper than the Ryzen 7 7700X going by MSRP. Regarding street pricing, the Ryzen 7 7700X will cost less, as you can find it for as little as $259 today at Micro Center. Nonetheless, it's nice to see prices heading down for a change instead of up, especially in the era of high inflation we've all been living through.\n\nOne last note before moving on: The Ryzen 7 9700X does not come with a stock cooler. That's too bad, because AMD could have offered one with this processor; its Wraith Prism is adequate for cooling a processor with a 65-watt TDP. But AMD typically doesn't include boxed coolers with its processors that have an \"X\" suffix. The reason: These chips target enthusiasts who may overclock and want more extreme cooling, or at least want to select their own air cooler.\n\nOur test platform for the Ryzen 9000 series is unchanged from the one we used for the Ryzen 7000-series processors. (AMD is not launching new chipsets for the Ryzen 9000 series until September, earliest, but the new chips work with existing current chipsets and AM5 motherboards.) The Ryzen 7 9700X was tested on an ASRock X670E Taichi motherboard with a Cooler Master MasterLiquid PL240 Flux 240mm water cooler. The system was built into a Praxis WetBench open-air chassis for optimal cooling during testing, and a SilverStone DA850 power supply powered it.\n\nThe RAM used for the tests was a G.Skill DDR5 memory kit supplied to us by AMD that has two 16GB sticks of RAM. This RAM was used to test all processors with the memory set to the max officially supported memory speed for each processor. This speed is 4,800MHz for Intel's 12th Gen \"Alder Lake\" processors, 5,200MHz for AMD's Ryzen 7000-series processors, and 5,600MHz for all 13th and 14th Gen Intel \"Raptor Lake\" processors, as well as AMD's new Ryzen 9000-series processors.\n\nThe test system was also equipped with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition graphics card, which was used as a display adapter for all processor benchmarks and most game tests. This was removed only to test the IGP of the processors that feature an IGP.\n\nBefore diving into the test results, it's important to acknowledge the current turmoil in the desktop processor market. Intel's 13th Gen and 14th Gen desktop processors (dubbed \"Raptor Lake\" and \"Raptor Lake Refresh\") in-market as boxed CPUs and in prebuilt PCs have been experiencing issues with voltage delivery and stability, leading to potential chip degradation. (It's complicated; see the details in our explainer.) Intel is working on fixing this issue, but it may come at the cost of performance.\n\nIn light of this, at this writing, it's difficult to recommend any 13th and 14th Gen Intel desktop processors. It also makes it challenging to compare those processors against AMD's fairly, as we don't know what the performance impact of Intel's patch may be (or that of any underclocking you may perform to avoid damaging your own processor). We have retained the scores achieved by the affected Intel processors, unaltered, in our results here. Until Intel's patch comes out and we can test it, this is our fairest means for evaluating these processors.\n\nHowever, given Intel's current issues and the likelihood that a patch controlling the voltage in its affected chips will degrade performance at least a smidge, we will give AMD the benefit of the doubt here in the event of any near ties. We'll also expand our margin of error for what we consider to be a tie to 5% versus our usual 3%.\n\nAMD's increased performance per clock cycle helps to give it an edge over last-gen Ryzen 7000-series processors, though by a smaller margin than expected. Instead of AMD's touted potential up-to-16% increase in performance over the Ryzen 7 7700X, the Ryzen 7 9700X was just 3% faster in Cinebench R23's multi-threaded test. This is inside the margin of error and not statistically significant, but we saw a more notable 9% increase in single-threaded performance. The reason for this performance difference between single-threaded and multi-threaded tests is likely due to the reduced TDP. Simply put, to maintain the 65-watt TDP the processor is restricted from using too much power and generating too much heat. When just one core is active this isn't an issue, but you run into this limit with all cores active; this causes the cores to throttle so as not to exceed the TDP limit. From this, we get the sharp difference between single-threaded gains and multi-threaded gains.\n\nThings look less promising against the Intel competition in Cinebench. The Intel Core i5-14600K was 24% faster than the Ryzen 7 9700X in the multi-threaded tests, and the Intel Core i7-14700K was even faster. You aren't going to remove that performance gain even if you have to downclock the Intel chips to ensure they don't get damaged. The Core i5-14600K's performance advantage comes from its higher core count, with its 14 cores (some of them low-power E-Cores) and support for 20 concurrent threads enabling it to outpace the Ryzen 7 9700X by such a large amount. Dialing back the clock speed would reduce this advantage, but the clocks would need to be reduced a lot for the Ryzen 7 9700X to gain the lead.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X had the upper hand in single-threaded performance, where it was 6% faster than the Core i5-14600K and nearly identical to the Core i7-14700K. While we consider this a win for the Ryzen 7 9700X, it's diluted by the devastating loss in the multi-threaded test.\n\nThe following Adobe test showed stiff competition between the Ryzen 7 9700X and its main competitors. The Core i7-14700K was 6% faster in the Photoshop test, giving it a narrow lead, while the Core i5-14600K and Ryzen 7 9700X were in a close tie, for which we again will give the point to the Ryzen 7 9700X. In Premiere Pro, the Core i7-14700K's advantage grew to 17%, while the Core i5-14600K and Ryzen 7 9700X remained in a tie.\n\nMore than any test so far, HandBrake showed the Ryzen 7 9700X far behind its competitors. The Ryzen 7 9700X completed the test 14% slower than the Core i5-14600K and 26% slower than the Core i7-14700K. This advantage is predominantly due to the higher core counts on those processors, giving them an unmatchable advantage. Things were, if anything, even worse in Blender, with the Ryzen 7 9700X even further behind.\n\nUnsurprisingly, at this point, the Ryzen 7 9700X was obliterated by the Core i5-14600K and Core i7-14700K in the multi-threaded POV-Ray 3.7 test. Its single-threaded performance was more of a tie between the Ryzen 7 9700X and its competitors.\n\nWithout going into too much depth, the Ryzen 7 9700X, on average, did show itself to be faster than (or tied with) the Ryzen 7 7700X in all of these tests. Even when it was faster, however, it wasn't usually by a wide margin.\n\nTesting the Ryzen 7 9700X with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card showed the Ryzen 7 9700X was amply fast enough for modern games. It was significantly behind the Intel competition in 3DMark, but it tied or had slight gains in other tests.\n\nIn Guardians of the Galaxy, the Ryzen 7 9700X was faster than the Core i7-14700K by about 5% at 1080p resolution. It was also about 5% faster while rendering Total War: Three Kingdoms at 1440p and closer to 9% while rendering the game at 1080p. However, we didn't see any other statistically significant differences between the Ryzen 7 9700X and the Core i7-14700K.\n\nThe Radeon RDNA 2 IGP in the Ryzen 7 9700X is unchanged from the one in the Ryzen 7000 series, but it gained a slight advantage from the Ryzen 7 9700X's slightly higher max memory speed. This edge likely resulted in marginally faster Total War: Three Kingdoms performance.\n\nWe observed a performance drop in F1 22. This is a little odd as the IGP tested is the same in all the AMD processors in the list, but it could be down to a driver issue for the new chip. Performance was otherwise consistent on the other game tests, with Intel's IGPs notably faster in most games.\n\nTo measure each processor's power consumption, we use a Kill-A-Watt wall meter to measure the power consumption of the test system at various points. This is one of the few areas where the Ryzen 7 9700X showed a significant change from its predecessor.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X's idle power consumption was higher than expected, but its power draw under load was quite low compared with most competing chips. The Core i5-14600K used even less power in the Adobe Premiere test, but it used far more in Cinebench. As the Adobe test also uses the graphics card, the Cinebench power numbers are likely more representative of the Intel chip's true power draw.\n\nThe lower power consumption translated nicely to reduced operating temperatures, too. All of these processors were tested with the same cooler, making the Ryzen 7 9700X one of the coolest-operating processors we've tested to date. Due to this processor's lower 65-watt TDP and lower operating temperature, you could likely cool it sufficiently well with an air cooler instead of the 240mm liquid cooler we used. Many air coolers support processors with TDPs of 65 watts, and these tend to cost a fair bit less than water coolers that are borderline required for most Intel CPUs above Core i5 these days.\n\nOverall, you can see clear signs that AMD's Ryzen 7 9700X is better than its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7700X. It's slightly faster in many tests, even if only just so. Its best feature is that it draws less power and runs considerably cooler, but those aren't usually key selling points for desktop processors. It makes the Ryzen 7 9700X more attractive for compact PCs than the Ryzen 7 7700X, but that's about it.\n\nIt's exciting that we've seen some improvement, but we need to look at the Ryzen 7 9700X in terms of real-world pricing and performance. For starters, the Ryzen 7 7700X is almost as fast and costs much less now. Don't have a Micro Center nearby? Amazon or Newegg will be more than happy to sell you one for $300 or less. We just don't see enough performance gain to make the $359 Ryzen 7 9700X a must-buy unless you are excited about the reduced power consumption and heat numbers, or you want to air-cool and avoid buying an AIO liquid cooler for an Intel Core i7 or better chip.\n\nWhat's more concerning is that Intel's 14th Gen Raptor Lake refresh processors drive much more performance. To be sure: We are fully aware some of these chips have, for all intents and purposes, blown up at current settings. But we're also keeping in mind how this problem could be resolved on newly purchased chips this very month, and are mindful of Intel's now-extended five-year warranty on those same processors. Even if you have to slow down or undervolt the processor to avoid damage, the performance differences between this new Ryzen, and Intel's Core i5-14600K and Core i7-14700K, are so large that you'd still have a faster PC by going with Intel.\n\nThat's not even to mention that the Core i5-14600K costs around $299 from multiple online retailers, which makes it less expensive, or that the Core i7-14700K is available for around $397 from Amazon -- not much more than AMD's chip.\n\nWe cannot say that the Ryzen 7 9700X is a disappointing CPU, as it truly is not. It performs well, and it delivers excellent power-draw and heat-generation numbers that AMD should rightly be proud of. The problem: It simply doesn't outperform its predecessor by much, and it's slower overall than the Intel competition. In truth, its reduced TDP is likely a major factor holding it back, as we noted in the Cinebench R23 results. That's why we see larger performance gains on single-threaded tests but not much on multi-threaded tests, as the processor holds its power and temps down more to avoid going past its TDP limit.\n\nAs noted, a silver lining to that lower TDP is that it can help these processors work well in compact PCs, and it may enable you to buy a cheaper cooler. Liquid coolers tend to cost multiple times more than air coolers, and being able to get by with an air cooler on 65-watt TDP processors like the Ryzen 7 9700X goes a long way toward helping it compete on pricing with Intel's more power-hungry Core i7 and i9 processors, which levy a $100-to-$150 minimum \"tax\" for a 240mm or larger liquid cooler if you don't own one already. If Intel's current issues make you nervous, then this might be the right option to consider. But you'd likely do well to wait at least a few weeks to see how Intel's patch for its 13th and 14th Gen Core problem works out, or for what Intel releases next, in its \"Arrow Lake\" 15th Gen desktop-CPU replacements, reportedly coming later this year.", "source": {"uri": "au.pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PCMag Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "can_remember@au.pcmag.com", "name": "Can Remember", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "relatives_when@au.pcmag.com", "name": "Relatives When", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "in_part@au.pcmag.com", "name": "In Part", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "pc_cases@au.pcmag.com", "name": "Pc Cases", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "i_ve_reviewed_desktops@au.pcmag.com", "name": "I've Reviewed Desktops", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CPU cache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clock rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Raptor Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR5_SDRAM", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DDR5 SDRAM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_controller", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Memory controller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Floating-point unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDNA_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RDNA 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASRock", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ASRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Center", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micro Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newegg", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Newegg"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Distributed_Projects", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Distributed Projects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_au/review/a/amd-ryzen-/amd-ryzen-7-9700x_154s.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 739, "textEnd": 746}], "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 230, "relevance": 1}

After all, it's no good having the greatest chips on the market if your buyers can't afford them. Clearly keen to see Ryzen powering more PCs, AMD has made the 9000 series its most affordable lineup in five years.\n\nIn a post on X, AMD revealed Ryzen 9000X processors will start from $279. For context, that's the cheapest a launch lineup has been since Ryzen 5 3600X, which retailed for $249. Better still, the flagship Ryzen 9 model has never been cheaper at $649. As a whole, the series is $160 cheaper than the prior two, and just $10 more expensive than Ryzen 3000.\n\nIn terms of value, you'll need to wait for our Ryzen 7 9700X & Ryzen 5 9600X review to drop to get that assessment. Wait a bit longer, and we'll have more observations in our Ryzen 9 9950X & Ryzen 9 9900X review for you.\n\nWhatever our assessment, though, it's pleasing to see AMD take steps to make its processors more affordable. Here's hoping the company follows suit with Ryzen 9000X3D processors in the coming months.", "source": {"uri": "club386.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Club386"}, "authors": [{"uri": "samuel_willetts@club386.com", "name": "Samuel Willetts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling_and_Consumables", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling and Consumables", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical_Evaluations_and_Product_Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical Evaluations and Product Reviews", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.club386.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/amd-finally-reveals-ryzen-9000-pricing-just-before-launch.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Chips from both Intel and AMD have faced severe overheating problems, but this CPU is part of the answer to the problem. It doesn't feature quite as much of a performance improvement over the Ryzen 5 7600X as in past generations, but it makes up for it by being much cooler and more power efficient.\n\nAnd given that the Ryzen 5 has always been more geared towards beginner PC builders that are perhaps not familiar with underclocking their processors, coming out of the box with lower temperatures and power consumption makes it a much more approachable CPU. That alone makes it one of the best processors on the market right now, especially for beginners.\n\nWhen the Ryzen 5 7600X launched, Team Red tuned it to reach for maximum performance by having the CPU sit around the temperature limit whenever it was under load. When it comes to processors, more power means higher core clocks and better performance. The Ryzen 5 7600X had an essentially uncapped power limit, so as long as it wasn't at the maximum temperature, or 98\u00b0C, it would pull in more power to boost performance. This resulted in a faster processor, but it meant that whenever the CPU was under load, it was constantly hot.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X does things differently. Power is capped at 88W, and once it reaches that point, the performance curve evens out, no matter what the temperature is. This means you get less of a performance boost when the CPU is under heavy load, but you also have much more manageable temperatures, which means the chip will last much longer.\n\nBoth strategies can make for a great processor, but for a midrange chip, the Ryzen 5 9600X makes more sense. Because while performance is limited by default, the temperatures are much less scary at a glance. Plus, if you want that extra performance, the 9600X is an unlocked processor, so you can overclock it.\n\nLike the Ryzen 7 9700X, the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X is built on the Zen 5 architecture, which brings improved efficiency and better IPC (instructions per clock) performance. So, even though the Ryzen 5 9600X consumes much less power than the Ryzen 5 7600X, it can still meet or exceed it in actual performance.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X is still a 6-core, 12-thread CPU, like its predecessor, but the max turbo speed goes up to 5.4GHz, rather than the 7600X's 5.3GHz. It's a minor improvement, but thanks to the improved IPC of Zen 5, you get a bit more performance out of that clock speed. Even with the slightly higher clock speed, the default TDP (Thermal Design Power) is down to 65W, from its predecessor's 105W. The default power limit is also much more conservative, with the Ryzen 5 9600X limited to 88W, while the 7600X could go all the way up to 142W, which is almost as much as some graphics cards consume.\n\nThe lower power limit means much lower temperatures too. In my testing suite, the Ryzen 5 9600X peaked at just 76.1\u00b0C, compared to 93\u00b0C on the 7600X. So if you were waiting on a more reasonable processor that you could upgrade to without also upgrading your cooler, the 9600X is it.\n\nLuckily, the 9600X is using the same AM5 platform as its predecessor, which means all existing 600-series AMD motherboards are compatible. AMD has assured me that it plans to stay on the AM5 platform until at least 2027, which just means it'll be easy to upgrade from the 9600X in the future when new processors come out.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 5 9600X is an extremely solid mid-range processor, even if it doesn't mark a colossal improvement over the Ryzen 5 7600X. Despite its more conservative approach to power and temperatures, the Ryzen 5 9600X is easily able to meet or exceed the 7600X's performance, but without the high temp baggage.\n\nFor instance, in Cinebench R23, which measures multi-threaded performance in a 3D rendering workload, the Ryzen 5 9600X scores 15,781 points, compared to the 14,761 points of the Ryzen 5 7600X. However, it still lags far behind the Intel Core i5-14600K, which manages a whopping 24,587 points. Team Red makes up for that in single-core performance, however, with the 9600X managing 2,167 points to the 14600K's 2,074.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X is also great for creative workloads. In the Pugetbench Adobe Premiere test, the Ryzen 5 9600X scores 11,990 points compared to 11,561 for the Ryzen 7600X and 13,254 points. However, in the less threaded Photoshop test, the 9600X scores 10,850 points to the Intel Core i5-14600K's 9,849. Keep in mind, too, that the $299 Intel Core i5-14600K consumes nearly double the power, and peaks at 92\u00b0C.\n\nIn gaming, the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X is extremely powerful, thanks to its strong single-core performance. In the heavily CPU-bound Total War: Warhammer 3, at 1080p with the Ultra quality preset, the Ryzen 5 9600X manages 264 fps, beating even the Core i9-14900K. However, in Cyberpunk 2077, the Ryzen 5 9600X falters a bit, managing 163 fps, compared to 177 fps with the Intel Core i5-14600K.\n\nOf course it would have been awesome to see the AMD Ryzen 5 9600K wipe the floor with all existing processors, and in some ways it absolutely does. It might not be the fastest processor in its class, but it manages extremely solid performance, while also cutting power consumption and thus temperatures. Especially if you're the type to use a traditional air CPU cooler, the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X is a much more reliable part than its predecessor. The CPU arms race seems to have calmed down, which is great news for anyone that wants their processor to last more than a few years.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instructions per cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underclocking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Underclocking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clock rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_energy_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric energy consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel Core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overclocking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2077", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cyberpunk 2077"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_4D", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema 4D"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_rendering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "3D rendering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motherboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling_and_Consumables", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling and Consumables", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Distributed_Projects", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Distributed Projects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/06/ryzen-5-2-1722985376442.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Whether that matters to you would vary depending on a few value-centric factors.\n\nHowever, despite dropping the power draw and price tag, the all-new AMD Ryzen 7 9700X has made some incredible performance breakthroughs in single-core benchmarks and even beats out my previous recommendation of the best gaming CPU on the market. Here's how it performed in my testing and where it ranks against its top rivals.\n\nAMD will sell the Ryzen 7 9700X through mainstream third-party storefronts, like Best Buy and Newegg, for a $359 MSRP from Thursday, August 8, 2024. It's an impressive increase in performance-per-dollar value, with about a 10% discount from the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7700X price tag.\n\nThe 9700X's base TDP has also significantly dropped to 65W, down from 105W on the 7700X and returning to match its older equivalents. The max turbo clock continues to creep up with each new Ryzen -700X chip, but the core/thread count remains steady alongside the L3 cache. Improvements delivered through AMD's Zen 5 architecture will be the key to how much performance has improved this year.\n\nUnlike the Ryzen 8000G Series, the Ryzen 9000 chips don't include AMD's XDNA 2 NPU (Neural Processing Unit) for any dedicated AI processing. However, the CPU chiplet still processes AI workloads with an 'enhanced' Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (AVX-512) datapath. AMD recently launched the Ryzen AI 300 Series mobile chips, focusing on generative AI with laptops instead.\n\nA dual-core integrated Radeon graphics chiplet is included in the Ryzen 7 9700X, clocked at 2.2GHz, supporting video output for those without a dedicated graphics card. Expansion depends on your motherboard choice, though PCIe 5.0 support for modern GPUs and mandatory DDR5 RAM are standard.\n\nAMD recommends a traditional air cooler for the Ryzen 7 9700X and the upcoming 800 Series of AM5 motherboards, including X870 and X870E chipsets. While 870 Series motherboards will be able to push overclocked DDR5 memory speeds to 8000MT/s and beyond, AMD previously provided a sample of G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6400 RAM and still encourages an AUTO:1:1 DDR5-6000 EXPO profile where possible to stay in the performance \"sweet spot.\"\n\nDepending on how you arrange the performance benchmark results, ranking AMD's octa-core Ryzen 7 9700X splits into two directions. For multi-core performance, this 65W processor is either outshone by four of Intel's 125W offerings over two modern generations in extended stress tests with Cinebench 2024: the 13th Gen Core i5-13600K and Core i7-13700K, plus the 14th Gen Core i5-14600K and Core i7-14700K, or it creeps slightly ahead with burst CPU performance tests in Geekbench 6.\n\nThe previous-generation Ryzen 7 7700X pulls ahead in one multi-core benchmark, compressing and decompressing synthetic 7-Zip archives. It also came close in the CPU-Z benchmark test but never outperformed the Ryzen 7 9700X in single-core performance. Intel's 14th Gen i7-14700K multi-core results are leagues ahead with twice the wattage and the explicit increase to 20 cores and 28 threads over the 8c/16t count on the Ryzen 7 9700X, as well as a $50 increase on its MSRP.\n\nAMD's efforts to achieve this multi-core performance at half the power of Intel's competing chips shouldn't be understated. A 40W base TDP drop from the previous-gen 105W Ryzen 7 7700X hasn't stopped the Ryzen 7 9700X from delivering a decent generational performance uplift, though it's certainly far from the significant leap AMD made from the 65W 5700X. Still, it's an impressive metric as AMD moves from Zen 4's 5nm manufacturing process to TSMC's 4nm and is part of an overall showcase in performance-per-watt improvements for the Ryzen 9000 Series.\n\nThese benchmarks reflect the Ryzen 7 9700X's 3.8GHz base frequency, another drop from the 105W Ryzen 7 7700X, which starts at 4.5GHz. Overclocking enthusiasts shouldn't worry, though, as the 9700X still boosts as high as 5.5GHz, slightly faster than the 7700X's 5.4GHz, despite the lower base power and maximum socket limits. Essentially, AMD can offer at least a minor bump to multi-core performance with the same 65W power draw that it used to, as it sticks with the AM5 socket until 2027 for potential upgrades to the top-end Ryzen 9 9950X following price drops.\n\nYes, absolutely. While it doesn't include AMD's 3D V-Cache aimed at gamers, the Ryzen 7 9700X still beats the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D, a powerhouse processor that has been all too easy to recommend as the best gaming CPU since its release. However, that shouldn't signal to gaming enthusiasts who adopted the Zen 4 -X3D chip that it's already time to upgrade. The performance improvements are marginal, so this serves as more of a temptation to those looking to upgrade from a Ryzen 5000 Series chip.\n\nI still recommend the Ryzen 5 5600X to anyone building a budget gaming PC, and I run the Ryzen 7 5800X in my gaming desktop since it eventually dropped from its high MSRP. However, while it would mean a total motherboard upgrade from my AM4 range to a new AM5 equivalent compatible with the Ryzen 7 9700X, I can heartily recommend it as a perfect modern in-between for anyone in a similar situation as mine.\n\nAMD mostly annihilates its competition in single-core performance, as the Ryzen 7 9700X shoots to the top of the pile with some of the best scores we've seen to date, save only for a CPU-Z result against Intel's 14th Gen i7-14700K. Given the lower physical core count of 8 on the 9700X compared to 20 on the 14700K, it's logical that each core can receive a higher share of wattage and offer stronger performance.\n\nIf all cores were theoretically handling separate tasks equally, AMD would have the edge with a few more watts per core. It's another metric that will appeal to gamers, as single-core performance is usually a priority for many titles, though modern game engines can scale to multi-threaded options more effectively. Still, this bump to single-core performance is phenomenal, especially considering the Ryzen 7 9700X's mid-range position in the 9000 Series. If your suite of apps and games perform better with single-core optimizations, you'll love the 9700X.\n\nAMD is launching the Ryzen 7 9700X and its entry-level sibling, the Ryzen 5 9600X, at the exact moment that Intel is experiencing an instability crisis with its 13th and 14th Gen Core desktop chips. While a microcode (firmware) patch is rolling out to compatible motherboards, there is still a risk that chips like the i7-13700K could be affected by an oxidization issue if manufactured in early 2023 before Intel had addressed it.\n\nRyzen 9000 chips weren't immune to launch problems, as AMD delayed the 9600X and 9700X to fix a production issue, which seemed to be little more than a model typo on the chips. Still, enthusiast PC builders who are comfortable updating their motherboard BIOS shouldn't be too wary of comparing the 9700X against its primary rivals, especially as Intel offers extended warranties and RMA assistance.\n\nEven if the recent microcode bug controversy hadn't happened and Intel was on a level playing field with AMD, there is still the matter of performance-per-watt and the surrounding costs of adopting each processor. Internally, AMD pits the Ryzen 7 9700X against Intel's 14th Gen Core i7-14700K -- that's a $359 65W AMD chip with 8 cores and 16 threads against a $409 125W Intel variant with 20 cores and 28 threads.\n\nBased on performance benchmarking results, the Ryzen 7 9700X is more comparable to a mid-range Intel 13th Gen Core i5-13600K, which launched at $329 but can be found for as low as $249.99 at Best Buy. However, even with a saving of around $100, I can't comfortably recommend Intel's 13th or 14th Gen chips to anyone who isn't extremely comfortable with system tweaks and regular BIOS updates to avoid issues.\n\nHardcore gamers should wait for the inevitable -X3D variants of the Ryzen 9000 Series unless you're updating from a much older machine. Anyone with an AM5 socket board likely wouldn't see significant boosts in the 9700X from their Ryzen 7000 or even 8000G chips, but those on older AM4 socket boards can target the 9700X for a mid-range upgrade. Intel users on equivalent 12th Gen chips and earlier would need to upgrade their motherboards no matter what, but they should be happy with the 9700X.\n\n\u2705 Your apps need strong single-core performance\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X exhibits some of the best performance in single-core testing that I've ever seen, so it's great for many games and creative apps.\n\n\u2705 You're building a mid-range gaming PC\n\nAlongside a generous price drop from last gen, the 9700X offers better performance-per-watt over the Ryzen 7000 Series and is a new hot pick over the 5600X.\n\n\u274c You're a hardcore gamer targeting the best specs\n\nAMD will, presumably and inevitably, release -X3D variants of the Ryzen 9000 Series chips, which would make more sense than the 9700X for a high-end gaming rig utilizing AMD's 3D V-Cache.\n\n\u274c You already have an equivalent Ryzen 7000 Series chip\n\nWhile the 9700X has made a generational improvement on multi-core performance (and especially single-core), there isn't enough of a leap over the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7700X.\n\nAMD delivers phenomenal single-core performance in what is otherwise a mid-range processor in its latest Ryzen 9000 Series of desktop chips, with a 'good enough' generational multi-core improvement. Still, a generous price drop from the previous Ryzen 7000 -X chips alongside a return to a 65W base TDP make this an extremely hot pick for mid-tier custom desktop builders looking for the best performance-per-watt, taking over from the Ryzen 5 5600X/7 5800X as my ultimate value-for-money picks.\n\nIntel might be having a rough time with its 13th and 14th Gen chips exhibiting microcode issues, but that doesn't entirely put them out of the race. On the contrary, most comparable Intel Core desktop processors are unaffected or remedied with a simple BIOS update. However, these power-hungry 125W chips are finally knocked off their top spot for single-core scores and can't beat AMD's pricing for this gen. It's an outstanding display from Team Red and scores one of the easiest recommendations I've ever made.", "source": {"uri": "windowscentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Windows Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_wilson@windowscentral.com", "name": "Ben Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motherboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_AM5", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Socket AM5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR5_SDRAM", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DDR5 SDRAM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overclocking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zen 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AVX-512"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Best Buy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling_and_Consumables", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling and Consumables", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical_Evaluations_and_Product_Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical Evaluations and Product Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BGffoVfvcF3mTXKRwbHFhQ-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

AMD pulled an unprecedented move by delaying the launch of these new Zen 5 chips, and Intel's widely reported instability issue still doesn't have a solution. AMD's new Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X are among the best processors you can buy right now, but they're also entering the market at a time when good-faith comparisons are tough to make.\n\nContents AMD Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X specsTest configurationsProductivity performanceGaming performanceShould you buy the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X?\n\nIt doesn't help that the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X aren't exactly easy CPUs to evaluate. They're not built for gamers, with AMD's 3D V-Cache CPUs dominating the list of the best gaming processors, and the performance improvements range anywhere from mind-blowing to middling. AMD's latest chips are fast, there's no doubt about that, and they easily earn a recommendation. Given how strange the CPU landscape between AMD and Intel is right now, however, it might be worth taking stock of where everything lands in a few weeks before picking up a new chip.\n\nGet your weekly teardown of the tech behind PC gaming ReSpec Subscribe Check your inbox! Privacy Policy AMD Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X specs\n\nArchitecture is the name of the game for the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X, and that's immediately apparent when looking at the specs. Very little has changed compared to the last-gen Ryzen 7000 chips, with these parts boasting the same core counts, similar clock speeds, and identical cache. The improvements are all under the hood with the new Zen 5 architecture.\n\nThere are a lot of nerdy architectural details here for Zen 5 compared to Zen 4 -- there's an 8-wide dispatch unit now, up from 6-wide in Zen 4, as well as six Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs), up from four previously. It's the high-level objectives of the architecture that make a difference, though. AMD had a clear focus on single-threaded performance, and it built a true 512-bit data path for AVX-512 instructions. This, according to AMD, is a new foundation for CPUs going forward.\n\nRyzen 7 9700X Ryzen 7 7700X Ryzen 5 9600X Ryzen 5 7600X Cores/Threads 8/16 8/16 6/12 6/12 L3/L2 Cache 32MB / 8MB 32MB / 8MB 32MB / 6MB 32MB / 6MB Max turbo frequency 5.5GHz 5.4GHz 5.4GHz 5.3GHz TDP 65W 105W 65W 65W Recommended price $360 $400 $280 $300\n\nAs I dig into my performance results, you'll see that AMD achieved its design goals. This is a new foundation, however, and not the final form of where AMD will end up in a couple of generations. Performance overall feels lopsided, with some workloads showing middling performance and others showing earth-shattering gains.\n\nOutside of architecture, there's one important spec change particularly for the Ryzen 7 9700X. The last-gen Ryzen 7 7700X had a power draw of 105 watts, but AMD shrunk that to 65W this time around. That power is a little optimistic, with the chip commonly registering over 65W, but it's still nice to see AMD push toward the efficient end of the spectrum for Zen 5. We saw how big of a difference that could make with the Ryzen 5 7600 (non-X) in the previous generation.\n\nTest configurations\n\nAs with all of our CPU reviews, I put together two test configurations that were as close as possible. I used a high-end motherboard for both AMD and Intel tests, as well as a 360mm all-in-one (AIO) liquid cooler, 32GB of DDR5-6000 memory, a 1200W PSU, and an RTX 4080 Founder's Edition graphics card. All BIOS settings were returned to their default settings, though I ensured XMP/EXPO and Resizable BAR were enabled for both platforms.\n\nAMD Intel GPU Nvidia RTX 4080 Founders Edition Nvidia RTX 4080 Founders Edition RAM 32GB Gigabyte Aorus DDR5-6000 32GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5-6000 Motherboard Gigabyte X670E Aorus Master MSI MPG Z790 MAG Tomahawk CPU cooler Corsair H150i Elite Capellix Corsair H150i Elite Capellix Power supply Gigabyte Aorus P1200W MSI MPG A850GF Storage Corsair MP400 1TB MSI M450 1TB\n\nThere's a lot of talk about BIOS settings right now, with Intel's CPUs featuring a major wave of instability due to improper BIOS adjustments. At the time of this review, those issues are still a work-in-progress. Performance may change once Intel's CPUs are brought into a more stable spot. The goal with the performance here is to show what you should expect to see out of the box with any of the CPUs we feature.\n\nProductivity performance\n\nThere's no better place to start a CPU review than Cinebench R23, which immediately shows AMD's improvements in action. Short of the Core i9-13900K and Core i9-14900K, AMD's new chips are topping the single-core charts, and not by an insignificant margin. It's a massive jump, and one that's all the more impressive considering these are the weakest two of AMD's current Zen 5 lineup. Keep in mind that the Core i9-14900K is rated to boost to 6GHz -- the Ryzen 7 9700X is getting most of the way there at 5.5GHz.\n\nMulti-core performance is, unsurprisingly, not as impressive. Intel's mix of cores allows it to achieve much higher core counts, which show up more aggressively in a test like Cinebench. Still, we can clearly see some improvements. The Ryzen 5 9600X, for example, is able to match the Core i5-12600K with four fewer cores. That's a sign of what the architecture is doing within the cores.\n\nPutting that multi-core performance into context, take a look at Handbrake. The Ryzen 5 9600X with six cores can now match the 16-core Ryzen 9 5950X from two generations back, and the Ryzen 7 9700X is at the heels of the Core i5-14600K despite its massive core deficit.\n\nPerformance in Photoshop is even more impressive. AMD already performed well in Photoshop, but it's managing to outpace itself here. The Ryzen 7 9700X matches the Ryzen 9 7950X from last generation, and the Ryzen 5 9600X isn't far behind. Photoshop isn't the most demanding workload, but it's still a clear showcase that the performance improvements are here.\n\nThese CPUs are doing exactly what they should, but there are also some lopsided numbers -- for better and worse. You can see the worse in action in Blender and 7-Zip. The Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X are barely moving the needle in these tests, and in the case of 7-Zip, the Ryzen 5 9600X was actually a bit slower than the last-gen Ryzen 5 7600X (though not by enough for it to make a difference).\n\nThe better half is a lot better -- so much so that I really didn't believe the numbers at first. In the browser benchmark JetStream 2, the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X provided the best results I've ever recorded. And in Y-Cruncher, calculating 500 million digits of pi, the single-core performance of these two chips absolutely destroys everything else on the market -- and that includes the latest flagships. These are both fairly specific tests, but they show AMD's Zen 5 improvements in the best light.\n\nIn tasks like photo editing in Photoshop or transcoding in Handbrake, these two CPUs are fantastic. Depending on what you're doing, however, you may not see all of the performance gains. It's clear that Zen 5 is a new foundation for AMD, and I suspect it will balance the scales of performance in some of the more specific workloads as time goes on.\n\nGaming performance\n\nIt's difficult to talk about gaming performance with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X. The performance is decent to disappointing, but it doesn't matter much anyway. AMD has already proven time and again that its 3D V-Cache tech is the key to the highest frame rates, and these chips don't come with the extra cache. If you're concerned with gaming, you shouldn't buy the Ryzen 5 9600X or Ryzen 7 9700X -- you should wait until 3D V-Cache versions of these chips come out.\n\nIf you take a 10,000-foot view of these chips, AMD is providing better performance in games. You can see that in the CPU score of 3DMark Time Spy. The Ryzen 7 9700X manages to outpace the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, while the Ryzen 5 9600X provides a disappointing but understandable uplift of 5% over the previous generation. As usual, real games tell a slightly different story.\n\nTake Hitman 3 as an example. AMD was able to outpace the Ryzen 7 5800X3D with the Ryzen 7 9700X, but both of these chips are a far cry from what the Ryzen 7 7800X3D can offer right now. Frankly, it's not even in the same conversation.\n\nSimilarly, in Far Cry 6, AMD is not only offer a solid generational uplift, the Ryzen 5 9600X even managed to beat last-gen's 16-core Ryzen 9 7950X. That's impressive, at least until you realize how much faster the Ryzen 7 7800X3D is once again.\n\nIf you ignore the 3D V-Cache parts, AMD's new Zen 5 chips are great. The problem is that PC gamers really can't afford to ignore 3D V-Cache. I wouldn't want to be caught with a Ryzen 7 9700X knowing that a Ryzen 7 9700X3D could launch in a matter of months. AMD has already confirmed they're coming, and even the Ryzen 7 7800X3D continues to dominate gaming charts.\n\nSome of the lopsided performance I saw with productivity benchmarks showed up here, too. Take Red Dead Redemption 2 as a prime example. This game is in my CPU test suite to ground some of the conversation around gaming CPUs. It's a graphically-intensive game, taking some of the focus off the processor. Oddly, AMD was able to break through this wall of performance that every other CPU I've tested has run up against, including the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. From my view, that says more about what we could see with 3D V-Cache versions of these CPUs and less about these two particular chips, however.\n\nFinally, there's LeelaChessZero, and the chart really speaks for itself here. If there was any doubt that a dedicated 512-bit data path for AVX-512 instructions didn't matter, this chart puts that to rest. It's a massive improvement, and I can't wait to see how the more powerful Ryzen 9 9900X and Ryzen 9 9950X fair in this benchmark.\n\nShould you buy the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X?\n\nComing in at $280 for the Ryzen 5 9600X and $360 for the Ryzen 7 9700X, these are two compelling CPUs. AMD is offering a generational uplift, and it's coming in at a lower price. That pricing cut wasn't made out of goodwill, though. There are still some oddities with these chips and the strange results they can produce, leading to unbelievable performance increases in some workloads and barely any improvement in others.\n\nIf you already have a Zen 4 CPU, there isn't enough meat on the bone to justify an upgrade here. That may change once we see the flagships in action, but lower down the stack, the changes aren't as drastic. The only exception are workloads like AVX-512, where the new Zen 5 architecture absolutely crushes everything else.\n\nGamers don't need to worry, either -- the Ryzen 7 5800X3D is still putting up impressive results years after its release, and the Ryzen 7 7800X3D remains the undisputed champ of gaming performance. Zen 5 brings gaming improvements, there's no doubt about that. But the 3D V-Cache versions of these chips will let those improvements sing.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X are great if you haven't upgraded to the AM5 platform yet, however. They're faster and cheaper than Ryzen 7000 options, and even moreso now considering the drop in DDR5 memory prices. If you've already taken the plunge to AM5, however, you can probably take this generation off -- AMD says we'll be getting more generations on this socket, after all.", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_roach@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Jacob Roach", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_RTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia RTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CPU cache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zen 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AVX-512"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BIOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-Star_International", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Micro-Star International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CPU socket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_4D", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cinema 4D"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_logic_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arithmetic logic unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clock rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical_Evaluations_and_Product_Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical Evaluations and Product Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ryzen-7-9700x-ryzen-5-9600x-review-1.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Ryzen chips have always been a go-to pick for custom builders on a budget, and the -X range targets enthusiast gamers, with the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X opening as the entry-level chip in the new Ryzen 9000 Series.\n\nCan it stand as the new hot pick for budding PC gamers looking to enter the modern age of AM5 motherboards with everything AMD's Zen 5 architecture can offer, or is it outshined by its slightly beefier Ryzen 7 9700X sibling and even AMD's previous-gen chips? Here's what I found in my testing.\n\nAMD will offer the Ryzen 5 9600X through major third-party storefronts, like Newegg and Best Buy, for a $279 MSRP from Thursday, August 8, 2024 -- $20 cheaper than the previous-gen Ryzen 5 7600X and the 5600X before it.\n\nThe entry-level 9600X also sees AMD returning to a 65W base TDP, just like the Ryzen 5 5600X, after which it temporarily climbed to 105W for the 7600X. The base clock is 3.9GHz, higher than its mid-range sibling, the Ryzen 7 9700X, while the max turbo clock raises slightly this generation to 5.4GHz.\n\nCore/thread count and L3 cache count remain the same at 6c/12t, meaning AMD has another chance to showcase performance-per-watt improvements with its 4nm manufacturing process and Zen 5 architecture within the new Ryzen 9000 Series.\n\nAMD doesn't include a dedicated NPU (Neural Processing Unit) for local AI processing on the Ryzen 9000 chips but has improved LLM performance overall with an 'enhanced' Advanced Vector Extensions 512 (AVX-512) datapath. Otherwise, AMD's recently launched Ryzen AI 300 Series mobile chips focus on generative AI in laptops, like the ASUS Zenbook S 16 (UM5606) that \"challenges Snapdragon X and stomps Intel Meteor Lake.\"\n\nFor those looking into AI-specific workloads or entry-level builds, AMD's Ryzen 8000G Series will be more appropriate, including the previously reviewed Ryzen 7 8700G, which features stronger integrated graphics than the dual-core Radeon chiplet included in the Ryzen 5 9600X, clocked at 2.2GHz. Whichever way you go, DDR5 RAM remains mandatory with AM5 sockets, but the Ryzen 9000 Series supports PCIe 5.0 expansion slots.\n\nAMD recommends a tower air cooler for the Ryzen 5 9600X and the upcoming 800 Series of AM5 socket motherboards, including X870 and X870E chipsets. While the former supports overclocked DDR5 memory with speeds up to 8000MT/s and above, AMD had previously provided a sample of G.SKILL Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5-6400 RAM and still encouraged an AUTO:1:1 DDR5-6000 EXPO profile to stay in the Ryzen performance \"sweet spot.\"\n\nMuch like the mid-range Ryzen 7 9700X, benchmarking the Ryzen 5 9600X delivers contrasting results, depending on whether you focus on multi-core or single-core performance. For burst processing tests in Geekbench 6, the 9600X pulls slightly ahead of a previous-generation Intel rival, the 13th Gen Core i5-13600K, and creeps reasonably close to the modern 14th Gen Core i5-14600K. Again, this is a 65W 8-core, 16-thread chip edging past a 125W 14c/20t Intel offering, which speaks volumes to AMD's leaps in power efficiency with Zen 5.\n\nHowever, in sustained stress tests, the Ryzen 5 9600X falls further away from Intel and below AMD's last-gen chip, the Ryzen 7 7700X. It's not too unusual, given the higher 105W TDP on the Zen 4 7700X, but you can grab a 7700X for as low as $288 at Amazon, so it's tough to argue in favor of the 9600X with results like this. Generational multi-core improvements also range from slim numbers to negatives, with 7-Zip's simulated compression benchmark performing better on the 7000 Series chip.\n\nStill, it's mostly good news for Zen 5, as the 9600X exhibits improvements in multi-core burst performance over the previous-gen 7600X, albeit much less than the jump from the Ryzen 5 5600X to the 7600X. The focus is entirely on power efficiency for the Ryzen 9000 Series chips, and the 65W 9600X is primarily a decent successor to the Ryzen 7000 Series entry-level offering, the power-hungry 105W Ryzen 5 7600X.\n\nWith results like these, it's clear to those who have already adopted AMD's Ryzen 7000 Series processors that the Ryzen 5 9600X isn't worth the hassle of an upgrade. However, if you're still rocking a Ryzen 5 3600X, 5600X, or an equivalent Intel 11th or 12th Gen Core i5, then you'd be overhauling your system with an AM5 socket motherboard anyway, and the affordable Ryzen 5 9600X makes more sense.\n\nYes, if you're on a strict budget. It even scores hot on the heels of my previous top gaming CPU recommendation: the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. While it doesn't sport the same gamer-centric 3D V-Cache as AMD's -X3D Series chips, and I expect a Ryzen 9000X3D Series will be released later this year, there's no denying that the entry-level 9600X is capable enough to handle modern PC gaming. If you want to build an affordable but modern gaming rig, the Ryzen 5 9600X is a cheaper entry-level CPU with excellent power efficiency.\n\nAMD comes out on top with single-core testing, with the Ryzen 5 9600X and Ryzen 7 9700X scoring among the highest benchmark results I've ever seen for 65W chips. In every test, the 9600X beats its intended rival, Intel's 14th Gen Core i5-14600K, bested only by the Core i7-14700K in CPU-Z's benchmark. Again, these Ryzen 9000 Series processors are going up against 125W Core i5 and i7 chips with much higher physical core counts, theoretically dividing a higher even wattage to a per-core amount than Intel.\n\nThe real-world benefits of single-core performance are tricky to quantify for the average PC user, but many modern game engines still thrive on single-thread processing. Since the 9600X is so close to the 7800X3D in multi-core performance and actually better in single-core tests, it becomes a tempting new option as an entry-level Zen 5 gaming CPU. While I start to sound like a broken record, this is another testament to AMD's triumphs in higher performance at a much lower wattage than the competition and sets a new standard for single-core scores.\n\nIt's practically impossible to ignore Intel's instability crisis with its 13th and 14th Gen Core desktop chips, triggered by a microcode (firmware) bug that is permanently degrading affected processors. While the 13th Gen Core i5-13600K sells for around $234, it's currently impossible for me to recommend to anyone who isn't extremely comfortable with applying manual BIOS tweaks and firmware updates to prevent issues.\n\nIf you're unlucky enough to buy a 13th Gen Intel Core variant manufactured in early 2023, you might experience degradation caused by an oxidization problem discovered around this time. Intel is at least offering extended warranties and RMA assistance to those affected, but it hardly seems worth the risk to the majority of (presumably novice) PC builders looking at entry-level chips.\n\nInstead, the call for competitors comes from inside AMD's house. If you're a creator looking to maximize multi-core performance on an AM5 system, the Ryzen 7 7700X is only $288 at the time of writing, barely a few dollars more than the 9600X's MSRP. Otherwise, gaming enthusiasts might want to wait for the inevitable -X3D variants of AMD's Ryzen 9000 Series to take advantage of an updated version of 3D V-Cache.\n\nThe generational multi-core performance leaps are so minor if you're already running a Ryzen 7000 Series chip. Still, those on older processors with AM4 sockets will appreciate this affordable and versatile entry-level AM5 option.\n\n\u2705 You'll benefit from single-core performance gains\n\nAMD offers incredible single-core instructions-per-cycle (IPC) improvements for those reliant on software and games that better utilize single cores or generally lack multi-core optimizations.\n\n\u274c You're an all-out hardcore PC gamer\n\nWhile it's tempting and more affordable than the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D, a 9000X3D variant will undoubtedly be released later this year, which will better suit high-end gaming (if you can afford the extra cost.)\n\n\u274c You're already on the AM5 socket\n\nIt's unlikely that you'll see any significant performance benefits from the 9600X if you're already running a Ryzen 7000 Series (or even 8000G Series) processor -- this is mostly a minor entry-level bump, not a major step-up.\n\nThe entry-level chip of any processor generation is never expected to blow the previous range out of the water. However, AMD still delivers incredible single-core performance with the Ryzen 5 9600X. It pulls ahead of, or at least matches, every comparable Intel Core i5 and Core i7 processor and does it all with a lower TDP and more affordable MSRP. Still, it's not going to tempt those who already adopted the Ryzen 7000 Series or Intel's 12th, 13th, or 14th Gen Core desktop chips.\n\nInstead, the 9600X stands as the perfect entry point into AM5 socket motherboards and AMD's Zen 5 architecture, with prospects to upgrade to either a top-end Ryzen 9 9950X for creators or wait for the inevitable 9000X3D gaming chips. If you're running older AM4 or LGA1200 hardware, the 9600X offers some of the best performance-per-watt value on a budget, especially if your favorite software suite and games are better optimized for single-core processing.", "source": {"uri": "windowscentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Windows Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_wilson@windowscentral.com", "name": "Ben Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_AM5", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Socket AM5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motherboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR5_SDRAM", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DDR5 SDRAM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_accelerator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AI accelerator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AVX-512"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CPU socket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CPU cache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Advanced Vector Extensions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Buy", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Best Buy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Distributed_Projects", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Distributed Projects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical_Evaluations_and_Product_Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical Evaluations and Product Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HWtUS6f2e6fiQvFEqvhiNH-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

AMD has priced up its new Zen 5-based Ryzen 9000 CPUs. And would you believe it, they're actually cheaper than the outgoing Ryzen 7000-series family.\n\nTo be more precise, they're cheaper than the launch prices for Ryzen 7000 from two years ago. Most Ryzen 7000 models are now available for quite a bit less than those 2022 launch prices.\n\nIn other words, model for model, you're going to pay more for a given new Ryzen 9000 CPU than what it's Ryzen 7000 predecessor is available for today. But in a world where GPU prices seem to go up exponentially for each new generation, this has got to be good news.\n\nThat means the new chips are launching at pricing between $20 and $50 lower than the original prices for the Ryzen 7000 series. Inevitably, it's the higher end chips that get the bigger discounts.\n\nOf course, as we mentioned, current pricing for various Ryzen 7000 models has fallen since launch. Right now, you're looking at about $200 for a Ryzen 5 7600X, $295 for a Ryzen 7 7700X, $360 for a Ryzen 9 7900X and $525 for a Ryzen 9 7950X.\n\nSo, the new chips are quite a bit pricier than current pricing for the 7000 series. But Ryzen 9000 pricing will likely fall over time and so the trend line is in the right direction.\n\nStill, we shouldn't have to wait long to find out just what you'll be getting for your money from AMD's latest CPU designs. Look out for our full reviews of the new chips very soon.\n\nHighlights include the aforementioned Zen 5 architecture with a 16% average uplift in IPC or instructions processed per clock cycle. Core counts remain the same, but clock speeds are very slightly up for some models.\n\nWe're not expecting a performance revolution with these new chips, but they should be tangibly faster. AMD is claiming performance gains up to 23% by some metrics. But we'll be the judge of that in our upcoming reviews.

AMD's new CPU microarchitecture anchors the company's quartet of new Ryzen 9000 processors. Zen 5 highlights include a notable 16% AMD-claimed increase in performance, and an extra-large drop in power consumption, which combine to boost overall energy efficiency. At launch, the most affordable of these new four new 9000-series processors, first detailed at Computex earlier this summer, is the $279 Ryzen 5 9600X. (Two Ryzen 9 9000-series chips will roll out on Aug. 15, and we have also reviewed alongside this CPU the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X.) While these improvements help the 9600X overshadow its direct predecessor, it struggles to beat out some older competing chips, even Intel's aged Core i5-12600K, which predates the company's current unpleasantness with voltage issues in its 13th and 14th Gen chips. A $50 slice off its list price would work the 9600X wonders.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 5 9600X is based on AMD's Zen 5 microarchitecture. According to AMD, this design has several improvements to boost performance by an average amount of 16%. It also transitions the CPU cores of the chiplet to a 4nm TSMC manufacturing process, and this, along with other changes in the design, enabled AMD to set the thermal design power (TDP) rating lower without reducing the clock speed.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X has an identical core configuration to its predecessor, the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X. Both chips ship with six CPU cores that work with simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) technology to support up to 12 concurrent processing threads. They both have 32MB of L3 cache and a similar max clock speed, with the Ryzen 5 7600X topping out at 5.3GHz and the Ryzen 5 9600X slightly faster at 5.4GHz. Base clock speeds differ more significantly, with the Ryzen 5 7600X hitting 4.7GHz and the Ryzen 5 9600X resting at 3.9GHz. This delta shouldn't matter too much, though, as processors today tend to operate closer to their turbo frequency while under load.\n\nBesides the underlying architectural changes we've covered in separate articles, the biggest difference between the Ryzen 5 9600X and its predecessor is in the TDP ratings. The Ryzen 5 9600X has a TDP of 65 watts (W), while the Ryzen 5 7600X TDP is 105W. The lower TDP should help the Ryzen 5 9600X consume less power than the Ryzen 5 7600X, but due to the power and heat limitations, it could also hamper performance somewhat in multi-threaded tests.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X also officially supports slightly higher-clocked memory than with the 7000 series. It can work comfortably with memory clocked at 5,600MHz, whereas the Ryzen 5 7600X topped out at 5,200MHz. This is interesting as the I/O die is unchanged between the Ryzen 7000 series and the Ryzen 9000 series, using the same I/O die built on a 6nm TSMC manufacturing process.\n\nThis shared I/O die also means the Ryzen 5 9600X has an integrated graphics processor (IGP) based on AMD's RDNA 2 architecture. The IGP is clocked at 2,200MHz, has 128 shaders, and has fixed-function hardware for multimedia features.\n\nOur testing sample of the Ryzen 5 9600X was installed on an ASRock X670E Taichi motherboard with two 16GB sticks of G.Skill DDR5 memory. For testing purposes, the RAM was set at the max officially supported memory clock of 5,600MHz, while other CPUs were configured with RAM that matches their respective max officially supported memory speeds. That would be 4,800MHz for Intel's 12th Gen \"Alder Lake\" processors, 5,200MHz for AMD's Ryzen 7000-series processors, and 5,600MHz for all 13th and 14th Gen Intel \"Raptor Lake\" processors, as well as AMD's other new Ryzen 9000-series processor, the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X.\n\nThe processor was cooled by a Cooler Master PL240 Flux all-in-one liquid cooler, and a SilverStone DA850 850 power supply provided juice to the system. All components were installed on a Praxis Wetbench open-air chassis for testing, and all tests were performed inside Windows 11 Pro with the latest updates installed.\n\nFor most tests, the system was also equipped with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Founders Edition graphics card. This was used as a display adapter and performance component for most game tests and the Adobe benchmarks. The graphics card was removed only to test the integrated graphics processor on the Ryzen 5 9600X.\n\nBefore diving into the test results, the current turmoil in the desktop processor market must be addressed. Intel's 13th Gen (\"Raptor Lake\") and 14th Gen (\"Raptor Lake Refresh\") desktop processors have been experiencing voltage delivery and stability issues, leading to potential chip degradation. (It's complicated; see the details in our explainer.) Intel is working on fixing this issue, but it may come at the cost of performance.\n\nIn light of this, at this writing, it's difficult to recommend any 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors until a fix is in the clear. It also makes it challenging to compare those processors with AMD's fairly, as we don't know what the performance impact of Intel's patch (or any underclocking you may perform to avoid damaging your own processor) may be. We have retained the scores achieved by the affected Intel processors unaltered in our results here. Until Intel's patch comes out and we can test it, this is our fairest means for evaluating these processors.\n\nHowever, given Intel's current issues, we will give AMD the benefit of the doubt here in the event of a near tie and expand our margin of error for what we consider to be a tie to 5% versus our usual 3%.\n\nAs this is AMD's newest Ryzen 5 entry, its natural competitors are Intel's most recent Core i5 processors. This includes the Intel Core i5-14600K and the Intel Core i5-13600K, which are affected by the above-mentioned issue, and the Intel Core i5-12600K, which is unaffected by this issue but still competitive in performance.\n\nTesting just a single CPU core with Cinebench R23 initially showed impressive results for the Ryzen 5 9600X. Its score was roughly 12% higher than the single-threaded score for the Ryzen 5 7600X and the Core i5-12600K. That dropped to a 7% increase over the Core i5-13600K and a 4% advantage over the Core i5-14600K. It wasn't too bad of a start, but things went mostly downhill from there.\n\nIn the multi-threaded Cinebench R23 test, the Ryzen 5 9600X maintained a healthy lead of 10% over the Ryzen 5 7600X, but all three competing Core i5 processors outpaced it. The Core i5-12600K was 9% faster than the Ryzen 5 9600X, the 13600K was 46% faster, and the Core i5-14600K was an even heftier 52% faster. Being outpaced by your competitor is always less than ideal, but when that competitor is three years old, like the Core i5-12600K is, that's deeply disappointing.\n\nThe results in the rest of our tests followed a similar trajectory as the Cinebench results. Take our Photoshop test: We saw less improvement here from the 9600X, as it was in a tie with the Ryzen 5 7600X and a near tie with the Core i5-12600K. In this case, we won't grant AMD a win in that comparison, as the 12600K is unaffected by Intel's current voltage dilemma. The Core i5-13600K was 8% faster in Photoshop and 17% faster in Premiere Pro than the Ryzen 5 9600X, and the Core i5-14600K returned similar results.\n\nHandBrake showed the Ryzen 5 9600X 7% faster than the Ryzen 5 7600X but also 5% slower than the 12600K, and 25% slower than both the Core i5-13600K and Core i5-14600K. Blender displayed a similar 10% bump for the Ryzen 5 9600X over its predecessor, followed again by the 9600X falling behind the Core i5-12600K, here by 5%. However, the Core i5-13600K was 31% faster this time, and the Core i5 14600K was even faster, with a 34% advantage. The extra E-Cores in the 13th and 14th Gen Intel chips make it an unfair fight for this six-core Ryzen.\n\nThings changed in POV-Ray 3.7, but only slightly. This test is another one that includes a single-threaded test that enabled the 9600X to outpace the Ryzen 5 7600X (here, by 8%) and the Core i5-12600K (by 11%). The Ryzen 5 9600X, the Core i5-13600K, and the Core i5 14600K were all within 5% of each other in the single-threaded test, and as mentioned earlier, we will give the edge to AMD in this case due to issues those Intel CPUs are facing.\n\nThat minor win in single-threaded performance, however, could not paper over the loss in multi-threaded performance. Even in POV-Ray, the 12600K was 6% faster than the Ryzen 5 9600X, with the 13600K completing the test a third faster than the 9600X, and the 14600K completing it in just half the time. Multi-threaded performance is realistically far more important in modern workloads, as many applications are multi-threaded, and single-threaded applications that you run simultaneously with other programs are effectively operated in a multi-threaded environment.\n\nWhen playing games, the Ryzen 5 9600X was far behind all the Intel competition in 3DMark. Gaming with our Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 card showed the Ryzen 5 9600X was faster than the Core i5-12600K in F1 22 and Bioshock: Infinite, but not much else.\n\nTest results were quite mixed overall. The 9600X arguably performed best in Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy, where it was 7% faster than the Core i5-14600K with the resolution set to 1440p. We saw the 9600X outperformed in some other tests, like in Tomb Raider, where the Ryzen 5 7600X and Core i5 processors had a small lead. These results were inside the error of margin and aren't statistically relevant, but it is curious to see.\n\nAll of the AMD Ryzen processors we tested contained the same RDNA 2-based IGP with 128 shaders clocked identically at 2,200MHz. The only notable difference between them was the processor performance they were connected to and the slightly higher-clocked memory on the newer Ryzen 5 9600X and the Ryzen 7 9700X.\n\nOverall, the Ryzen 5 9600X's IGP performance didn't stand out in any test. It was a bit slower than its AMD counterparts in Bioshock: Infinite and F1 22, but only by a small amount -- this could be due to driver issues on the newly released processors. The IGPs are potent enough for a little light gaming, but not much more, and they were notably behind the Intel competition in most tests.\n\nThe power consumption of each processor was measured using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter to check the total power consumption of the test system as a whole. This means the numbers reported include power draw for the entire PC and all of its components and not just the host processor, but this does give us a relative idea of how each processor compares in terms of power consumption.\n\nOverall, the Ryzen 5 9600X was among the least power-hungry processors we've tested in recent years. Though it consumed more power during the Adobe Premiere test, which also brings the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 graphics card into heavier play, it consumed significantly less in Cinebench, which stresses mostly the CPU. Power consumption dropped less than expected compared with the Ryzen 5 7600X, but this could be due to the power draw of the other components.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X's heat output was notably down, producing significantly less than its 7000-series predecessor and the Intel competition. Only the Core i5-12600K and the less powerful Core i5-13400F came close to matching it in Intel's camp.\n\nWith AMD's claimed 16% increase in performance per clock and drastically reduced power numbers, we expected more from the Ryzen 5 9600X. Sure, it's a small step up from the Ryzen 5 7600X and runs a lot cooler, but the Intel competition totally outclassed it on raw performance. The chip's single-threaded performance might not be bad, but it was decisively thumped in multi-threaded workloads, which is almost everything these days.\n\nIt's also hard to make a just argument for the Ryzen 5 9600X in terms of price for performance. The Ryzen 5 9600X costs $279, which makes it slightly lower priced than the Ryzen 5 7600X at $289. Meanwhile, the Core i5-13600K and Core i5-14600k are set at $319. That's only looking at MSRP, though; the real-world price of these processors is lower, with the Ryzen 5 7600X costing around $200, the Core i5-14600K going for $299, the Core i5-13600K demanding $249, and the three-year-old (but still relevant) Core i5-12600K costing just $175 to $200.\n\nThis turns the Ryzen 5 9600X from the least-expensive option to one of the priciest in this comparison set. The only one that costs more is the Core i5-14600K, which, as a reminder, outperformed it in one test by about 50% less time taken. The Core i5-14600K and the Core i5-13600K may have some issues at present, but assuming Intel's fixes come through, and even if you underclocked them now to avoid damaging them, they would still be far, far faster. And if you want to avoid them entirely, given the dark cloud over Raptor Lake at the moment, you could get the unaffected Core i5-12600K and still have a slightly faster CPU in most tasks.\n\nOr...you could buy the now-last-generation Ryzen 5 7600X that sells for far less. It may be around 10% slower in many tests, but you still get a lot better performance relative to what you spend. Unless you are building a compact PC and really need something that consumes less power, it's hard to recommend the Ryzen 5 9600X at its starting price. The Ryzen 5 9600X's difficulty competing with Intel once again leaves the feeling that AMD needs to adopt a hybrid processor architecture of its own to compete with Intel's big.LITTLE design, as the higher core counts on Intel's recent comparable CPUs give them an almost unassailable advantage. As is, the 9600X needs a haircut of at least $50 to be price-competitive.", "source": {"uri": "au.pcmag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PCMag Australia"}, "authors": [{"uri": "can_remember@au.pcmag.com", "name": "Can Remember", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "relatives_when@au.pcmag.com", "name": "Relatives When", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "in_part@au.pcmag.com", "name": "In Part", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "pc_cases@au.pcmag.com", "name": "Pc Cases", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "i_ve_reviewed_desktops@au.pcmag.com", "name": "I've Reviewed Desktops", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microarchitecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Clock rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel Core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Voltage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raptor_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Raptor Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_4D", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cinema 4D"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDNA_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "RDNA 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_RTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia RTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASRock", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ASRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Distributed_Projects", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Distributed Projects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sm.pcmag.com/t/pcmag_au/review/a/amd-ryzen-/amd-ryzen-5-9600x_9gyb.1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 831, "textEnd": 838}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

This week, we're reviewing the Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X, with this article focusing on the Ryzen 5 9600X. These new processors use the ZEN 5 architecture but are compatible with current motherboards such as the X670 and B650. They only require a simple System BIOS update to function. Additionally, AMD plans to release a new series of 800 motherboards soon, likely around September. These updates bring the latest technology to users who can continue using their existing hardware with minimal budget spent. Yes, AMD has officially announced the launch date for its new Ryzen 9000 series desktop CPUs which include four SKUs: the 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X, 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X, 8-core Ryzen 7 9700X, and 6-core Ryzen 5 9600X. The Ryzen 7 9700X will be a key model in the lineup and has been a topic of extensive discussion, particularly concerning its performance relative to previous models. AMD has addressed rumors regarding potential changes to its Thermal Design Power (TDP), confirming that it will launch with an incredibly low 65W TDP. The higher-end Ryzen 9 9950X will feature a 170W TDP, while the Ryzen 9 9900X will maintain a 120W TDP. Both the Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X are set at 65W, highlighting AMD's effort to balance performance and power efficiency.\n\nHowever, it is also believed that the Ryzen 7 9000 will not match the gaming performance of the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, based on statements from AMD's Don Waligroski. For that, you'll have to wait for X3D processors which we expect in announcements August during Gamescom time. AMD's launch presentation included a series-to-series comparison, demonstrating an 11% to 22% performance improvement from the previous generation while simultaneously lowering the TDP for three of the four new SKUs. That is something we're going to validate in our reviews. The Zen 5 architecture marks a meaningful advancement in AMD's Ryzen 9000 series processors for desktops. The structural aspects such as the socket and the internal layout remain consistent, featuring an unchanged I/O die and one or two new Zen 5 based CPU core dies, compatible with the current series 500/600motherboards.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000 Series Overview\n\nProcessorArchitectureCores/ThreadsBoost ClockCache (L2+L3)TDPRyzen 9 9950XZen 5 (TSMC 4nm)16C/32TUp to 5.7GHz80MB170WRyzen 9 9900XZen 5 (TSMC 4nm)12C/24TUp to 5.6GHz76MB120WRyzen 7 9700XZen 5 (TSMC 4nm)8C/16TUp to 5.5GHz40MB65WRyzen 5 9600XZen 5 (TSMC 4nm)6C/12TUp to 5.4GHz38MB65W\n\nThis review will entail the Ryzen 5 9600X processor. The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X is a mid-range desktop CPU within the Granite Ridge product family, featuring 6 Zen 5 cores (12 threads) operating at a base frequency of 3.9 GHz, with a boost frequency up to 5.4 GHz. It includes PCIe 5.0 support and a basic integrated GPU. The Granite Ridge processors, including the Ryzen 5 9600X, utilize the new Zen 5 microarchitecture, similar to the Strix Point APUs. However, unlike the Strix Point series, which combines performance and efficient cores, the 9600X consists solely of performance-focused Zen 5 cores. The multi-die design of the Granite Ridge series incorporates CPU cores manufactured using a 4 nm TSMC process, whereas the Strix Point processors are based on a single-die design.Zen 5 microarchitecture offers a ~16% improvement in Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) compared to Zen 4, attributed to enhanced branch prediction and various other refinements. The Ryzen 5 9600X includes 32 MB of L3 cache and supports 24 direct PCIe 5.0 lanes, each providing a throughput of 3.93 GB/s, with up to 12 additional PCIe 4.0 lanes available depending on the motherboard configuration. The processor is compatible with DDR5 memory, supporting speeds up to 5600 MT/s and ECC memory, contingent on motherboard support. Integrated graphics are simple, based on 2 Compute Unit (CU) Radeon Graphics features 128 unified shaders clocked up to 2,200 MHz. Based on the RDNA 3+ architecture, this iGPU supports DirectX 12 Ultimate, including ray tracing and other modern graphics technologies. However, with only 128 shaders, its gaming performance is expected to be minimal as of mid-2024. It also provides hardware encoding and decoding support for popular video codecs, including AVC, HEVC, VP9, and AV1, although VVC support is absent, which is available in Intel's Lunar Lake series. The CPU cores of the Ryzen 5 9600X are fabricated using TSMC's 4 nm process, offering competitive power efficiency in mid-2024 standards. The Ryzen 5 9600X has a long-term Thermal Design Power (TDP) of 65W. Under heavy, short-term loads, power consumption is expected to rise to at least 100W. Overclocking the processor will further increase power consumption.", "source": {"uri": "guru3d.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guru3D.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hilbert_hagedoorn@guru3d.com", "name": "Hilbert Hagedoorn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motherboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CPU cache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BIOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CPU socket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microarchitecture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microarchitecture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PCI Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_APU", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD APU"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zen 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_nm_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "5 nm process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDNA_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RDNA (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advanced Video Coding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR5_SDRAM", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DDR5 SDRAM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical_Evaluations_and_Product_Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical Evaluations and Product Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.guru3d.com/data/publish/223/b0ed50a6d2a0c80e79844f22633ae07a688f0c/guru3d_award_16.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

While previous prices came from retailers, this time, AMD itself is confirming the prices which are pretty much the same as disclosed earlier besides the top SKUs.\n\nThe Ryzen 9000 \"Zen 5\" CPUs were originally planned to launch on 31st July but AMD had to push back the launch of these chips to August citing testing and quality issues encountered on the first batches. The new dates are the 8th of August for the Ryzen 7 9700X & Ryzen 5 9600X CPUs while the high-end chips, the Ryzen 9 9950X & the Ryzen 9 9900X, will hit retail shelves on the 15th of August.\n\nFollowing are the prices disclosed for the next-gen Ryzen CPUs:\n\nAt $649, the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X will be aiming for the high-end Intel Core i9-14900K and Core i9-14900KS chips which end up around a similar price range. The 14900K can be found for around a $550-$560 US price point so it's around $100 cheaper but AMD has promised some superb multi-threading performance with the 9950X and the gaming performance should also be very strong if official benchmarks are to go by.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9 9900X will be priced at $499 US which is once again $100 US more than the Intel Core i7-14700K but once again, AMD did highlight faster multi-threaded and gaming performance at a much lower TDP of just 120W. AMD positions the Ryzen 9 9900X chip as a 14900K CPU competitor which is $50 US more expensive. Following are the TDP comparisons between the four chips of this generation with the prior one:\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X at $359 US seems to be a good deal since it was recently revealed that the chip would end up slightly faster than the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, the best gaming chip at the moment while running at just 65W.\n\nLastly, the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X at $279 US makes it look much better than the previously expected $299 US pricing. The 6-core chip will be a decent mainstream solution for the AM5 segment while offering better value than the official prices of the last-gen parts.\n\nOverall, it looks like AMD is going to attract many new PC builders to its AM5 platform with these price points, and with all the troubles that Intel is currently facing with its Desktop lineup, AMD might just take away a big chunk of that desktop market share.", "source": {"uri": "wccftech.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wccftech"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hassan_mujtaba@wccftech.com", "name": "Hassan Mujtaba", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zen 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intel Core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling_and_Consumables", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Tooling and Consumables", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical_Evaluations_and_Product_Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical Evaluations and Product Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/AMD-Ryzen-9000-Zen-5-Desktop-CPUs-Ryzen-9-9950X-Ryzen-9-9900X-Ryzen-7-9700X-Ryzen-5-9600X-Prices.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-31", "textStart": 497, "textEnd": 506}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 658, "textEnd": 671}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-15", "textStart": 811, "textEnd": 825}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

That's particularly the case when it comes to the battle for the best gaming CPU title, as none of the first Zen 5 CPUs out the door will be X3D chips with AMD's 3D V-cache. Some of the prices are exactly the same as the ones we saw in the Best Buy AMD price leak, but a couple of them are a bit higher.\n\nLet's start at the bottom, with AMD's six-core offering. The AMD Ryzen 5 9600X price is $279, which is $20 cheaper than the price of the Ryzen 5 7600X when it first came out, and is identical to the price seen in the Best Buy leak. However, the 7600X was seriously overpriced at launch, and it has since dropped to just $197 on Amazon. That's a difference of over $80, which is significant at this price level, and it's going to make life tough for the new 9600X unless it's seriously fast.\n\nNext up is the eight-core chip. The AMD Ryzen 7 9700X price is $359, which is a good $40 cheaper than the Ryzen 7 7700X when it first came out, and is the same as the price listed in the Best Buy leak. Right now, the 7700X goes for $290 on Amazon, meaning you'll pay a $69 premium for the new chip. That's not a bad price for the 9700X, which AMD says will outperform its Ryzen 7 5800X3D, but it's unlikely to outpace the Ryzen 7 7800X3D in games.\n\nThe top two chips are both a bit more expensive than the Best Buy leak suggested. The AMD Ryzen 9 9900X price is $499, which is $50 more than the price listed in the Best Buy leak, but still a good $50 cheaper than the equivalent 12-core Ryzen 9 7900X when it first came out. The 7900X currently goes for just $359, though, meaning you have to pay an extra $140 for the new chip. That's going to be hard to justify unless the 9900X is massively quicker.\n\nFinally, the AMD Ryzen 9 9950X price is $649, which is again $50 more than the Best Buy leak price, but $50 cheaper than the Ryzen 9 7950X MSRP at launch. The 7950X now costs just $523, however, so you'll need to hand over an extra $126 for the Zen 5 chip. If your top priority is getting the fastest multi-threaded performance possible, that may well end up being a price worth paying, however, as long as the CPU is significantly quicker.\n\nOut of all the new prices, the Ryzen 7 9700X looks like it could be a solid option for $279, but otherwise, it looks as though AMD could have a struggle to shift these chips, with the biggest threat coming from its last-gen offerings. That's not necessarily a bad situation for AMD, though. It means the company can shift its older inventory while charging a premium for its new CPUs, and then hopefully drop the prices of the new Zen 5 CPUs at a later date.\n\nThe AMD Ryzen 9000 release date is nearly upon us, and we'll see the first proper performance results when the review embargo lifts.

Therefore, we don't have the usual array of CPUs to compare against. We thank you for your understanding.\n\nAMD's Ryzen 9000 Series of desktop processors are finally here, and even though a last-minute delay means that we've only got two out of the four CPUs to review (so far) - the Ryzen 5 9600X and the Ryzen 7 9700X - they paint a pretty clear picture of what the Zen 5 generation is all about. More performance than the previous generation? Sure, but with a complete architectural overhaul, we're also looking at more efficiency and significant single-core performance gains, which means the 8 Core Ryzen 7 9700X can deliver better overall gaming performance than the previous generation's flagship 16 Core Ryzen 9 7950X.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X, priced at $359 USD, arrives at a particularly strange time for desktop CPUs, mainly due to issues surrounding Intel's offerings. Granted, AMD and its team of engineers have been developing Zen 5 for years, and the desktop Ryzen 9000 Series represents only a part of a more expansive CPU line-up that includes mobile APUs with integrated AI and graphics hardware and server chips designed to handle complex AI workloads for powerful supercomputers.\n\nHowever, the focus on efficiency feels like a massive win for AMD - more performance with lower power, lower temps, and increased stability. Faster productivity performance and gaming performance compared to the Ryzen 7000 Series is lovely to see and part of what every new CPU generation is 'supposed' to bring to the table. However, the Ryzen 7 9700X is rated at 65W compared to the Ryzen 7 7700X's 105W, a massive 38% reduction in power usage that, in our tests, directly results in a chip that runs cooler and quieter.\n\nThrowing more cores, higher frequencies, and more power isn't the only way - in fact, it seems antiquated when you dive a little deeper into the Zen 5 architecture. There's a lot to the new Ryzen 7 9700X, a CPU that AMD describes as an excellent option for PC gamers and a CPU that benefits from the company's one-click overclocking it provides via its Ryzen Master software.\n\nAs a mid-range offering, it's certainly more of an all-rounder than a CPU that excels across all workloads, but then again, the Ryzen 9 900X and 9950X are enthusiast products aimed at power users. Let's dig into what could be the best option for gamers and regular PC users regarding the Ryzen 9000 Series launch lineup.\n\nAMD's next-generation Zen 5 architecture is here, debuting with the new Granite Ridge desktop processor line-up, otherwise known as the Ryzen 9000 Series - kicking off with the latest flagship Ryzen 9 9950X, the Ryzen 9 9900X, the Ryzen 7 9700X, and the Ryzen 5 9600X. Make no mistake: all four are what you'd call 'high-performance' CPUs, with the Ryzen 7 again serving as the mid-range option. If you want the quick elevator pitch on what the new Zen 5 architecture brings to the table compared to the previous-gen Zen 4 (as seen in the Ryzen 7000 Series), the short answer is performance and efficiency. Translation: Zen 5 can do a lot more with less.\n\nZen 5 and the new Ryzen 9000 Series have been designed to deliver an impressive 16% improvement in Instruction Per Clock (IPC) performance, a double-digit gain that is impressive in itself. However, Zen 5 isn't merely an incremental update on a more robust and efficient node; AMD describes it as a substantial leap forward for Ryzen, with several fundamental changes and improvements to the underlying architecture. In fact, AMD has gone so far as to call Zen 5 a \"ground-up redesign of the Zen architecture.\"\n\nAt a glance, the Ryzen 9000 Series specs look similar to the Ryzen 7000 Series in core and thread counts and frequencies. One way to improve performance is to add more cores and threads, boost frequencies, and put more power into each CPU core. So, with less power (outside of the flagship Ryzen 9 9950X, which features the same 170W power rating as the previous-gen's 7950X) and seemingly the same specs, you might be wondering how AMD has managed to increase performance by a 'significant' amount. Well, once you take a microscope to the new Ryzen 9000 Series, you'll discover that the new Zen 5 Core differs from what has come before.\n\nOne key change that improves latency and performance comes from optimizing branch prediction accuracy, a critical component in CPU and microprocessor design. Zen 5 features a more advanced branch prediction system that supports dual decode pipes with less latency, improved accuracy, and throughput. As the name suggests, branch prediction is all about guessing or predicting the outcome of an operation. Modern CPUs are all about parallel processing and ensuring that no cycles are wasted by having the CPU sit there doing nothing.\n\nBranch prediction helps a CPU accurately guess where to fetch the next instruction while the current instruction is still being processed. Of course, this can lead to two outcomes - a correct prediction or an incorrect one. With increased throughput in the L1 instruction cache and op-cache, the new Ryzen 9000 Series can perform more work during each clock cycle - including its predictions. This leads to better performance and power efficiency, with more accurate and overall predictions - a win-win.\n\nWith improved predictions and increased bandwidth, AMD has improved the Zen 5 scheduler compared to Zen 4. The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) count has been increased and is more unified and larger. Regarding bandwidth specifically, the new 12-way L1 Cache is now 48Kb in size, a 50% increase over Zen 4's 8-way 32Kb. L2 bandwidth has also doubled, with AMD pulling this off without increasing latency.\n\nThe final major overhaul comes in the math department - the land of floating points - with Zen 5 supporting the native AVX-512 instruction set with a full 512-bit data path. This is complex stuff, and it is another impressive improvement compared to Zen 4, which supported AVX-512 in a more cumbersome fashion. This will be handy for AI and more complex workloads, where the upgrades here should lead to sizeable performance gains compared to Zen 4.\n\nHowever, with all that has changed, some aspects remain the same - literally. Zen 5 and the Ryzen 9000 Series use the same AM5 socket as the Ryzen 700 Series, so AMD's new chips are compatible with existing AM5 motherboards. Even though the CCDs, or Core Complex Dies, are built using the newer TSMC 4nm node, all Ryzen 9000 Series CPUs feature the same I/O die used with Zen 4 - including the same integrated RDNA 2 graphics with two Compute Units (CUs) for basic display functionality.\n\nHowever, later this year, AMD will release an updated AM5 chipset in the form of X870 and X870E. So then, what will motherboards using this new chipset bring to the table? USB 4.0 will be included as standard on all these boards, alongside PCIe Gen5 for graphics and storage. Secondly, AMD's expanded EXPO memory overclocking will allow faster DDR5 speeds, and kits like DDR5-8000 will become the go-to for PC enthusiasts putting together high-end Ryzen 9000 Series builds.\n\nHere, we can see how the specs and hardware stack up for the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X compared to the previous generation AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, alongside the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X that is also launching this week.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X and the Ryzen 7 7700X are very similar on paper. They have the same Ryzen 7 configuration - 8 Cores and 16 Threads - alongside similar clock speeds and overall L2 and L3 cache sizes. In fact, as an AM5-compatible CPU, the overall die and package size remain the same, with RDNA 2 graphics for basic display functionality. However, a lot is happening underneath the hood to improve latency, bandwidth, and performance.\n\nThe move to a more efficient TSMC 4nm node isn't the reason why the Ryzen 7 9700X is rated at 65W. In conjunction with the new process technology, the architectural changes have led to a situation where AMD has decided that the Ryzen 7 9700X at 65W delivers the best performance relative to power usage instead of sticking with its predecessor's 105W rating. Performance and power are never linear, so choosing 65W for the 9700X was probably the right choice.\n\nThe Ryzen 9000 Series supports AMD's one-click Curve Optimizer overclocking, as found in its Ryzen Master app - which can be applied per Core, per CCD, or CPU. Increasing voltages and frequencies to boost performance is a part of the Zen 5 desktop line-up, so the option is there for those looking to scale back some efficiency for additional performance. The Ryzen 9000 Series also supports AMD's brand-new Curve Shaper, a more advanced overclocking tool with deeper control over temperatures, frequencies, and voltage curves. Currently, this is only available at the motherboard BIOS level, with Ryzen Master support coming sometime soon.\n\nThe CPU sits at the heart of the modern desktop computer and is involved in everything from controlling various devices to multitasking to and from documents to browsers and even networking compression and encoding. By that same token, synthetic and carefully constructed productivity benchmarks sit at the heart of a CPU like this. Here's a breakdown of the benchmarks used and what they're all about.\n\nRendering tasks and workloads benefit from a higher core and thread count, so, unsurprisingly, the Ryzen 7 9700X delivers results and performance up to 24% faster than the entry-level Zen 5 CPU, the Ryzen 5 9600X. The Ryzen 7 9700X features more cores and threads, so this result is as expected. With the previous-gen flagship sporting 16 Cores and 32 Threads and a design explicitly optimized for intensive workloads like the three scenes featured in the Blender benchmark, the Ryzen 7 9700X is around 50% slower.\n\nCinebench R23 is a widely used benchmark because it takes full advantage of CPU cores and offers single-core and multi-core tests. Here, we see the Zen 5 architectural improvements in full force, with the Ryzen 7 9700X delivering a single-core Cinebench R23 score 9.4% higher than the Ryzen 9 7950X. An impressive result, and with the lower overall power draw of the Ryzen 7 9700X, it paints the picture of a worthwhile generational leap forward for the Ryzen 9000 Series.\n\nAs expected, multi-core performance suffers, with the Ryzen 9700X limited by its core and thread count. Cinebench R23's multi-core test takes each core and unleashes its full potential. The score here isn't terrible, and when you look at average figures for Intel CPUs and other mid-range offerings, the Ryzen 7 9700X begins to look like a decent mid-range option for those who would use rendering applications or highly intensive graphics workloads related to content creation.\n\nCompressing and uncompressing files is still a part of everyday PC usage, whether you're using the built-in compression tools that come with Windows 11 or a dedicated app like WinRAR or 7-Zip. The latter's integrated benchmark tool is a great way to test multi-core CPU compression and decompression. Here, the Ryzen 7 9700X is up to 25% faster than the Ryzen 5 9600X thanks to it featuring more cores and threads for parallel processing. Compression is one of those tasks that will always depend on the number of CPU cores available, so we can expect the performance to increase substantially again as we move to the Ryzen 9 9900X and 9950X combo.\n\nGeekbench 6 is a broader CPU benchmark suite that tests various aspects of day-to-day PC and device usage, including general browsing, productivity, and video editing. Like Cinebench R23, it tests both Single Core and Multi-Core performance with two scores handed out. Here, we see the remarkable single-core performance surpass that of the Ryzen 9 7950X using less than half the power. The Multi-Core Score is lower, but not by as much as you'd expect - with the Ryzen 7 9700X delivering a result that is only 17% lower than the Ryzen 9 7950X.\n\nCorona 10 is the final rendering benchmark. It is all about ray tracing, with the test measuring how many rays it can trace within a minute. Another heavy creator workload that benefits from more cores and threads, the Ryzen 7 9700X is around 21% faster than the Ryzen 5 9600X in this benchmark but significantly slower than the high-power Ryzen 9 7950X.\n\nThe final productivity benchmark is one of the most detailed, PCMark 10 Extended - a lengthy complete system test that not only puts your CPU to the test but also memory, storage, and graphics. PCMark 10 Extended covers everything from playing games, jumping into a conference call, browsing the web, and firing up a spreadsheet. The Ryzen 7 9700X delivers a slightly higher score than the same build with a Ryzen 9 7950X. What does this mean? Well, if you use a PC for gaming, emails, writing documents, doing some work, chatting with friends and family, and other tasks - the Ryzen 7 9700X is the AMD CPU to get.\n\nThe GPU is arguably the most critical component for measuring overall PC gaming performance. However, as the CPU handles all scheduling and low-level tasks, it can also play a role, which is more visible when gaming at lower resolutions.\n\nCPU latency, cache, and bandwidth can often factor into gaming performance, which is one of the reasons AMD's X3D range of processors is widely viewed as 'for gaming.' CPUs also render and handle physics, AI, and other elements. For this review, we benchmarked the following titles at 1080p.\n\nAcross the six-game benchmark, which covers a wide range of genres played at 1080p, the Ryzen 7 9700X edges out the previous-gen flagship, the Ryzen 9 7950X. This is true regarding the average frame rate and the important 1% low category. This means games not only run faster, but performance is more stable across the board. Even more remarkable is that the Ryzen 7 9700X pulls this off while using less than half the power of the 7950X. Zen 5 is the real deal, a worthy architectural upgrade - and we can't wait to see what this means for the next generation of X3D products.\n\nWith only a few frames separating the Ryzen 5 9600X and the Ryzen 7 9700X, gaming performance is essentially the same, and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the two. Still, outperforming the Ryzen 9 7950X is no small feat - and with its 65W power rating, the Ryzen 7 9700X is easily one of the best gaming CPUs currently available, especially in 2024, the era of smaller and more compact builds.\n\nHere's a closer look at the individual gaming benchmark results.\n\nWith CPU architectures covering desktop, mobile, and enterprise, it's no wonder that efficiency was right up there with performance when AMD was designing Zen 5 and the Ryzen 9000 Series. Although Zen 5's development for the mid-2024 release was probably locked in over a year ago, having this launch happen alongside the Intel CPU debacle is worth digging into. With its 13th and 14th Gen Core processors, Intel has used power to hit higher performance levels - more or less. The Ryzen 7 9700X's direct competition is the Intel Core i7 14700K, a CPU that draws 125W using its default profile, which can be boosted to a whopping 253W in turbo mode.\n\nWith all cylinders firing, using AIDA64Exteme's Stability Test and HWiNFO to monitor overall system stability, temperatures, and power usage, the Ryzen 7 9700X reached a maximum of 88W and 73 Degrees. Stressing a system for an hour and benchmarking for a few days (while also using the Ryzen 9700X to play some Diablo 4 with), it's impossible to gauge how the long-term performance and stability of the CPU will play out. But without experiencing any issues and witnessing a quiet, cool, and efficient CPU do its thing, the Ryzen 7 9700X is nothing short of an impressive achievement for mid-range CPUs.\n\nLet's say Intel wasn't dealing with a pair of problematic CPU generations and that the Intel Core i7 14700K was a viable option and, for argument's sake, slightly faster than the Ryzen 7 9700X. A more expensive CPU that draws substantially more power to achieve the same goal as a quieter, cooler, and far more efficient Ryzen offering. The choice, as they say, is easy.\n\nEnthusiasts who edit 4K video, develop games, or render and animate complex 3D scenes will want to consider the Ryzen 9 9900X and 9950X CPUs: high-performance, high-end products with the price tag to match. The Ryzen 7 9700X, at $359 USD, is an impressively efficient and performant mid-range CPU. Looking specifically at gaming benchmarks and the broad PCMark 10 Extended test in this review, it's a chip that manages to edge out the Ryzen 9 7950X while using less than half the power.\n\nYes, that's a phrase mentioned once or twice in this review (and a few more in our review of the Ryzen 5 9600X), but these efficiency gains are like technology unicorns - super rare. As one of the most powerful and efficient CPUs for gaming and everyday PC use, the choice is easy if the Ryzen 7 9700X is within your budget.

The CPU will be analyzed, tested, and benchmarked. Given its excellent performance combined with an architecture that supports PCIe Gen 5, DDR5, and a CPU that easily exceeds 5.5 GHz, this product might become a sweet spot processor for many. AMD recently announced its first ZEN5-based Ryzen 9000 processors. While some updated graphics cards have been released this year, not much else has been released in the component hardware arena. Yes, AMD has officially announced the launch date for its new Ryzen 9000 series desktop CPUs which include four SKUs: the 16-core Ryzen 9 9950X, 12-core Ryzen 9 9900X, 8-core Ryzen 7 9700X, and 6-core Ryzen 5 9600X. The Ryzen 7 9700X will be a key model in the lineup and has been a topic of extensive discussion, particularly concerning its performance relative to previous models. AMD has addressed rumours regarding potential changes to its Thermal Design Power (TDP), confirming that it will launch with an incredibly low 65W TDP. The higher-end Ryzen 9 9950X will feature a 170W TDP, while the Ryzen 9 9900X will maintain a 120W TDP. Both the Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X are set at 65W, highlighting AMD's effort to balance performance and power efficiency.\n\nHowever, it is also believed that the Ryzen 7 9000 will not match the gaming performance of the Ryzen 7 7800X3D, based on statements from AMD's Don Waligroski. For that, you'll have to wait for X3D processors. AMD's launch presentation included a series-to-series comparison, demonstrating an 11% to 22% performance improvement from the previous generation while simultaneously lowering the TDP for three of the four new SKUs. That is something we're going to validate in our reviews. The Zen 5 architecture marks a meaningful advancement in AMD's Ryzen 9000 series processors for desktops. The structural aspects such as the socket and the internal layout remain consistent, featuring an unchanged I/O die and one or two new Zen 5-based CPU core dies, compatible with the current series 500/600motherboards.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000 Series Overview\n\nProcessorArchitectureCores/ThreadsBoost ClockCache (L2+L3)TDPRyzen 9 9950XZen 5 (TSMC 4nm)16C/32TUp to 5.7GHz80MB170WRyzen 9 9900XZen 5 (TSMC 4nm)12C/24TUp to 5.6GHz76MB120WRyzen 7 9700XZen 5 (TSMC 4nm)8C/16TUp to 5.5GHz40MB65WRyzen 5 9600XZen 5 (TSMC 4nm)6C/12TUp to 5.4GHz38MB65W\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X is a high-end performing desktop processor deriving from the AMD Granite Ridge series. This processor stands out with its 8 Zen 5 cores and 16 threads, offering speeds from 3.8 GHz up to 5.5 GHz. The 9700X utilizes AMD's latest Zen 5 microarchitecture, similar to the Strix Point APUs, but differs by featuring only high-performance cores without any efficient core variants. Unlike the Strix Point, which is built as a single-die processor, the 9700X adopts a multi-die approach, with its cores manufactured using a 4 nm process by TSMC. AMD has highlighted a 16% increase in instructions per cycle (IPC) with Zen 5, attributed to enhancements in branch prediction among other upgrades. The processor is equipped with 32 MB of L3 cache and offers robust support for the latest PCIe 5.0 interface, providing 24 direct lanes that can deliver speeds up to 3.93 GB/s each. Additionally, it supports up to 12 PCIe 4.0 lanes, depending on the motherboard. The Ryzen 7 9700X supports DDR5 RAM, capable of reaching 5600 MT/s with a 6000 MT/s sweet spot, it can also handle ECC (Error-Correcting Code) memory, which enhances system stability by correcting data corruption. The chip is unlocked, allowing for overclocking to boost performance further. It is compatible with the AM5 socket and supports modern operating systems including Windows 11, 64-bit Windows 10, and various Linux distributions.\n\nIn terms of graphics, the Ryzen 7 9700X includes an integrated GPU (iGPU) with 2 compute units (CUs) based on the RDNA 3+ architecture. This iGPU has 128 unified shaders and can operate up to 2,200 MHz. Despite being capable of supporting DirectX 12 Ultimate, including ray tracing, the modest number of shaders suggests that its performance in gaming will be limited as of mid-2024. However, it can still manage to drive up to four ultra-high-definition monitors at 4320p resolution and supports both hardware encoding and decoding for popular video codecs like AVC, HEVC, VP9, and AV1, although it does not support VVC like some other contemporary chips. Power efficiency, the 9700X's 4 nm process technology aims to minimize power consumption. The processor's long-term thermal design power (TDP) is rated at 65 watts. Under intense or prolonged workloads, it could consume at least 100 watts.", "source": {"uri": "guru3d.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guru3D.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hilbert_hagedoorn@guru3d.com", "name": "Hilbert Hagedoorn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR5_SDRAM", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DDR5 SDRAM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CPU cache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PCI Express"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instructions per cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CPU socket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_APU", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AMD APU"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_11", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Windows 11"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_nm_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "5 nm process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDNA_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "RDNA (microarchitecture)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical_Evaluations_and_Product_Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical Evaluations and Product Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.guru3d.com/data/publish/223/4ce1dd808043dfa4919512e0e2f5471dd88e63/guru3d_award_16.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

It has 16 cores and 32 threads, a boost clock speed of up to 5.7GHz, and a 170W base TDP.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9950X works with many modern motherboard chipsets, including X670E, which I've focused on here. Next-gen 800 series motherboards using the X870 and X870E chipsets are still expected to launch later this year, so for now, the best motherboard options for the 9950X remain within the hardware that launched with Ryzen 7000.\n\nThis curated list of motherboards for the Ryzen 9 9950X includes options we've tested ourselves and boards that AMD used to test its new chips, ensuring that you're looking at only the best hardware for different types of users and price ranges.\n\nThe best motherboards for the Ryzen 9 9950X allow it to realize its full potential, which includes overclocking. Boards with strong overclocking support and high-end features understandably don't come cheap, with the ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero coming in at around $630. My runner-up pick, the ASRock X670E Taichi, is a better bargain at about $410. AMD used both boards to test their Ryzen 9000 chips, so you can be sure that they're up to the task.\n\nThe ASUS TUF Gaming X670E-Plus WiFi is another solid pick with a mid-range price. Former Windows Central Senior Editor Rich Edmonds called it \"one of the better-value mid-tier AM5 motherboards\" in his TUF Gaming X670E-Plus review, and it remains so for Ryzen 9000.\n\nIf you'd like to spend less and still get a board using the X670E chipset, the ASRock X670E PG Lightning only costs about $210. Its set of features will not blow you away like the $400+ boards, but it can be a solid foundation for a great Ryzen 9000 build.\n\nBuilding or upgrading a PC with a newly released processor usually comes with some motherboard compatibility hiccups.\n\nWhile brand new boards out of the factory will eventually come with the right BIOS revision for the new Ryzen 9000 CPUs, buying a motherboard so close to the chip launch means your board might not be compatible. Not to fret, though, as the required BIOS update is no longer nearly as difficult as it once was.\n\nIn the past, you needed to have a CPU installed in the board to update the BIOS. And since the latest chips wouldn't work without the update, you needed an older CPU. If you weren't upgrading from something compatible, you were usually left calling some friends or local enthusiasts to help out.\n\nHowever, with new motherboards, a BIOS flashback function has solved the problem. Instead of requiring an older CPU to update the BIOS, you can now download the update, move it onto a USB flash drive, and plug it into the board. Hit the button on the board, and it performs the update from there on its own.\n\nAll X670E motherboards I've included here have a BIOS flashback function, so even if your board doesn't arrive with the right BIOS revision for Ryzen 9000, the fix will be easy.\n\nAMD's Ryzen 9 9950X is the top-tier chip announced in the first run of 9000-series processors. It boasts 16 cores, 32 threads, a 5.7GHz boost clock, and a 170W TDP.\n\nIt will absolutely crush gaming to the point that it will probably be overkill for most PC gamers. AMD is targeting creators with extra heavy workloads with its Ryzen 9 9950X, and those who are focusing only on gaming should check out the Ryzen 7 9700X or Ryzen 5 9600X to save some money.", "source": {"uri": "windowscentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Windows Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cale_hunt@windowscentral.com", "name": "Cale Hunt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motherboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "BIOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overclocking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASRock", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ASRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clock rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USB flash drive"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Commodore", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Commodore", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nsWBbyrUXJ7rasaV5NUT2V-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5686274509803921, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

Because while the last generation of AMD processors really pushed performance to a new level, it did so while pushing out-of-the-box temperatures sky high - a problem Intel has also been facing since its 12th-generation Alder Lake processors. This time around, AMD has dialed in the performance a bit more, so that the chip is going to be power-limited more than it'll ever be thermal-limited.\n\nThat does mean less of an increase in raw performance, but because the Ryzen 7 9700X doesn't get super hot under its stock settings, it leaves plenty of room for overclocking if you want raw performance above anything else. If you want a CPU you can toss in your motherboard and forget about, though, this is one of the most efficient desktop processors I've tested in a while.\n\nModern processors are a lot less susceptible to high heat than they have been in the past, and have sensors in place to keep chips running right below their thermal limits. Over the last few years, AMD and Intel have taken this new reality as permission to pump as much power as possible into their CPUs, to maximize performance, with core temperatures constantly being pushed upwards. This is fine in theory: after all, it allows you to get the maximum amount of performance out of your CPU without having to go through the headache of overclocking. However, the reality ended up being different.\n\nAMD recently found itself in hot water when the Ryzen 7 7800X3D was literally cooking itself in some motherboards, as found in a Gamers Nexus investigation. This happened in large part because motherboard manufacturers were pumping too much power into the CPU socket. Even while doing my background testing for this review, I found that the Ryzen 7 7700X would draw up to 136.7W of power, because the default power limit is an astronomical 142W.\n\nThis was because instead of having a reasonable power limit, AMD raised the power limit, so that the CPU would be limited by its temperature. With a power limit that high, the CPU will suck up more power until it hits around 95\u00b0C, then it'll back off a bit. This approach rewards high-end CPU coolers, as the better your cooler is at dissipating heat, the more performance you're going to get. As long as there is thermal headroom, the motherboard will channel more power into the socket.\n\nMy CPU didn't cook itself, and neither will the majority of Ryzen 7000 CPUs, but the fact that it was even possible means the philosophy of channeling virtually unlimited power into the CPU as long as there's thermal overhead is flawed - at least out of the box, overclockers are going to overclock, after all.\n\nBuilt on the new Zen 5 architecture, the Ryzen 7 9700X is a much more efficient processor than the 7700X, even if it doesn't drive quite as much performance right out of the box. Zen 5 does deliver a sizable IPC (instructions per clock) improvement, along with way more cache, which helps it beat its predecessor in gaming workloads.\n\nThe Ryzen 7 9700X is an 8-core, 16-thread processor with 40MB of cache, up from 32MB on the 7700X, which should deliver a decent improvement in gaming workloads. Its max turbo boost doesn't see as dramatic an increase, now peaking at 5.5GHz, rather than 5.4. However, thanks to the IPC improvements, you get more performance out of that clock speed than you would have with the 7700X.\n\nEven with the higher cache and slightly better clock speed, though, the 9700X is a much less power-hungry CPU. Without tweaking with the BIOS, this is a 65W processor, with a hard limit at 88W. (You can change this, whether through AMD's Ryzen Master software or the BIOS.) With the limit in place, though, temperatures are reasonable, peaking at around 75.5W in my testing. Considering the previous generation would absolutely run away with temperatures - the Ryzen 7 7700X peaked at 96\u00b0C in the same round of tests and with the same cooler - this is an improvement, especially for first-time PC builders who aren't comfortable with tweaking their settings.\n\nThe lower TDP also means the Ryzen 7 9700X is much less demanding on CPU coolers and power supplies than its predecessor. As long as you're not planning on pairing the Ryzen 7 9700X with something like the RTX 4090, you should be fine with a 650W-750W power supply and an air cooler.\n\nEven with a much lower TDP, the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X manages to be faster than its predecessor in almost every test, especially in single-core workloads. This is thanks to architectural improvements that basically allow the 9700X to perform on a higher level, without just adding more power (and heat) to the equation. The raw performance increase is a bit lower than I'd usually expect, around 2-3% better in multi-core and 11% better in single-core, but because it's accompanied by much lower temperatures, it's much easier to swallow.\n\nIn Cinebench R23, which simulates a 3D rendering workload, the Ryzen 7 9700X scores 19,493 points in the multi-core test and 2,204 points in its single-core test. Compared to the Ryzen 7 7700X, which scores 19,181 and 1,977 points, respectively, you're looking at a 1% improvement in raw multi-core performance, but an 11% improvement in single-core performance. This is largely due to the performance profiles of the two processors, as a test like the Cinebench multi-core benchmark will push the processor to its absolute limits, and the Ryzen 7 9700X has a hard limit on power, where the 7700X will just suck up as much electricity as possible.\n\n3DMark tells a similar story, with the Ryzen 7 9700X actually falling a little behind - but still in the margin of error - the Ryzen 7 7700X in the max threads CPU Profile test, but pulling a 15% lead in the single thread test. Power continues to be a limiting factor in the 9700X's performance.\n\nIn gaming, performance is a complete wash, at least out of the box, where the 9700X actually sees lower performance in Cyberpunk 2077 than its predecessor, averaging 163 fps at 1080p on the Ultra preset without DLSS, compared to the 7700X's 174 fps. Again, this is a heavily multithreaded game, and power is a limiting factor.\n\nIn terms of raw performance, then, the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X delivers the smallest generational improvement in recent memory. But, the real story is a bit more complicated than that. Because the Ryzen 7 9700X is able to deliver this level of performance, while consuming way less power and producing much lower temperatures, it ends up being a much more economical processor. Just putting this in your PC and forgetting about it will end up saving you a ton of money on your power bill over time, and you're not going to have to spend as much on a CPU cooler.\n\nPlus, because the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X is an unlocked processor, you can easily overclock it to get the huge generational improvement that this processor is clearly capable of. Because if the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X is able to beat the 7700X while consuming 60% of its power, imagine what this new chip can do if you turn the knobs a little bit.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motherboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overclocking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CPU socket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CPU cache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alder_Lake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alder Lake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter-process communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clock rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cooling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer cooling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instructions per cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BIOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power supply"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Distributed_Projects", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Distributed Projects", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical_Evaluations_and_Product_Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical Evaluations and Product Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/06/ryzen-7-2-1722985314035.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

Despite a short delay due to a misbranding issue, they're still expected to launch in mid-August. That includes the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X with 8 cores, 16 threads, a 5.5GHz boost clock, and a 65W TDP.\n\nWhether you're eagerly anticipating the launch or you're planning a future upgrade path, landing the right motherboard for the Ryzen 7 9700X is key to your PC build's success. Next-gen 800-series motherboards aren't expected to launch until later this year, but the X670 and B650 boards and their variants using the AM5 socket remain stellar options for the new Ryzen hardware.\n\nI've collected here a mix of top motherboards for the Ryzen 7 9700X we've reviewed and motherboards that AMD used to test its new processors. I've been sure to include hardware to suit different users and budgets.\n\nThe two top motherboard picks I recommend for the Ryzen 7 9700X are boards that AMD used to test its new processor. These X670E boards from ASUS and ASRock proved themselves with Ryzen 7000 desktop chips, and thanks to BIOS flash (more on that below) and the compatible AM5 socket, they'll easily transition to Ryzen 9000.\n\nThe ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero, at about $630, is reserved for enthusiasts and power users who plan on steep overclocking and heavy performance. The MSI MEG X670E Ace might even be better for those purposes, though at about $725, it's an even tougher sell for many average users. That puts the high-performance ASRock X670E Taichi in a great spot, with its price around $410.\n\nDon't want to spend nearly as much? I use the ASUS TUF Gaming brand for plenty of hardware, thanks to its generally positive reliability and competitive pricing. In our ASUS TUF Gaming X670E-Plus WiFi review, former Windows Central Senior Editor Rich Edmonds remarked, \"For the average Joe, this is one excellent mid-range AM5 motherboard from ASUS.\" You can usually find it for about $280.\n\nUpgrading your PC or building a new system with processors fresh out of the foundry can come with some extra steps. The biggest hurdle is often updating the motherboard's BIOS to support the new processors.\n\nWhile board manufacturers are usually keen on shipping hardware with the latest BIOS updates, you never know how long the board you buy has been sitting around in a warehouse with an older revision. If the motherboard you buy has been collecting dust for the last few months, you can almost guarantee that it won't have the right BIOS for Ryzen 9000 chips.\n\nWhile just a few years ago, it was common to require an older CPU installed in the board to update the BIOS, the prevalence of BIOS flashback -- which allows you to update without having a CPU in the socket -- has made the process much easier. All the motherboards I've recommended here for the Ryzen 7 9700X have some BIOS flashback feature.\n\nInstead of requiring a CPU in the socket, BIOS flashing only requires a separate USB drive with the BIOS. You download the BIOS from the manufacturer support page, plug the drive into the motherboard, hit the flash button on the board, and let it update. It will receive the right BIOS for Ryzen 9000 chips, and you can go ahead and install the CPU without issue.\n\nConsidering even the Ryzen 7 5800X from a couple of generations past remains an excellent option for gaming (and beyond), the Ryzen 7 9700X should prove to be an extremely popular chip to pair with a quality graphics card from AMD or NVIDIA.\n\nAlthough the Ryzen 7 9700X only has 8 cores and 16 threads, we expect it to challenge the 14th-generation Intel Core i7-14700K and its 20 cores in terms of raw power for gaming and other workloads.\n\nConsidering the Core i7 runs at a 125W TDP, the Ryzen 7 9700X getting anywhere close to its 65W TDP should be a massive achievement for AMD. We're currently testing AMD's Ryzen 9000 desktop CPUs and will have more to share following the review embargo date.", "source": {"uri": "windowscentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Windows Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cale_hunt@windowscentral.com", "name": "Cale Hunt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BIOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motherboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CPU socket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASRock", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ASRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wi-Fi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro-Star_International", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Micro-Star International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclocking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overclocking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intel Core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_flash_drive", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USB flash drive"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical_Evaluations_and_Product_Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Technical Evaluations and Product Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o9oQrwHFEmJH9uVxpninUV-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.\n\nIt's taken a while to get here -- and it's honestly been a pretty bumpy road, too -- but I'm pleased to present our review of the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X, the lowest-tier CPU currently on offer in AMD's Ryzen 9000 series family of Zen 5 processors. I'm not talking about the rocky situation where AMD recalled all stocks of the new Ryzen chips weeks before they were due to be sold, either -- no, this is all about jumping around motherboards, updating firmware, and endlessly fiddling about with settings. All for what is actually a somewhat underwhelming new six-core CPU.\n\nAnyway, let's just get down to specs business. The Ryzen 5 9600X is essentially a refreshed Ryzen 5 7600X, as it doesn't have any more cores or threads, there's no extra L3 cache, and even the boost clocks are barely any different. The only specs that are notably disparate are the base clocks (3.9 vs 4.7 GHz) and the TDPs (65 vs 105 W).\n\nDeep down in the single CCD (Core Complex Die) chiplet, it's a very different story, as AMD has comprehensively changed all kinds of aspects of the architecture, with more L1 data cache, more L2 cache bandwidth, and much better vector and branch prediction units just being a few of them.\n\nAs we've already gone through the AMD Zen 5 architecture in detail, I won't reiterate it all for this review. It suffices to say that AMD has changed a lot, though time will tell if all those changes were really worth doing.\n\nOne important change that is worth mentioning is the fact that the CCDs, packed with 8.6 billion transistors, are now manufactured on TSMC's N4 process node -- previously AMD used N5 and the newer fabrication method has much better transistor density and power demand.\n\nAnd it's the latter that's the biggest improvement in the Ryzen 5 9600X, in my opinion. No matter what you throw at the little chip -- sorry, chiplets -- the entire package will rarely consume more than 88 W and routinely uses much less than this in games.\n\nKeeping it cool is a doddle and while admittedly I was using an Asus ROG Strix LC III 360 mm AIO cooler for my main test rig, I briefly tried a smaller AIO and a cheap twin 120 mm air cooler.\n\nGiving it as serious a heat test as possible (multiple AVX-512 runs), the 9600X never exceeded 75\u00b0C with any of the coolers. In the heat of my office, it was a blessed relief not to have a CPU belch out hundreds of watts.\n\nOf course, all of this would be for nought if the Ryzen 5 9600X didn't perform especially well. The good news is that it's really good for a little six-core processor, albeit with one important caveat. I initially tested the new Zen 5 chips on an Asus ROG Strix B650-A Gaming motherboard, using its latest 3014 BIOS, which has full support for all Ryzen 9000 series CPUs.\n\nAMD, however, recommended all reviews should be conducted on X670E boards and provided an updated, beta BIOS for a couple of models. Asus stepped in with a rapid rescue in the form of a ROG Crosshair X670E Hero and I was back in business. Except I wasn't because it wouldn't boot with 9600X installed. The handy BIOS flashback feature (where you can update the firmware without needing to fire up your PC) solved that problem.\n\nIt took a while longer to get everything else updated, settled, and running smoothly, but at the end of it all, I can confirm three things: (1) The Ryzen 5 9600X performs just as well in a B650 motherboard as it does in an X670E one, (2) the idle temperature was surprisingly high (around the 50 \u00b0C mark), regardless of cooler, and (3) the outright multithreaded performance was a little lower than expected.\n\nAfter discussing this with AMD and checking figures with and without EXPO enabled (i.e. using the RAM at 4800 MT/s instead of 6000 MT/s), it seems that my specific configuration of hardware, BIOS, and Windows is giving the chip a little bit too much power, hence the idle figures -- instead of dropping all the way down to 20 W, my setup only went down to around 27 W.\n\nIt's also the most likely cause of the heavy multithreaded application performance, with the CPU not quite getting the right share of the total power budget. If the latter is super important to you, then you might want to hold off getting a Zen 5 chip until all the niggles are sorted out.\n\nWe've updated our CPU benchmarking suite for 2024, changing some of the older games for newer, more CPU-heavy ones, as well as including more productivity tests. In the case of Cyberpunk 2077, we're using DLSS Balanced with the RT Ultra preset, to ensure that the test isn't GPU-limited but the CPU still has the full ray tracing workload (mostly building the BVH acceleration structures). We've also switched from using a GeForce RTX 3080, as the supporting GPU, to an RTX 4070 to show the relative CPU performance in a more real-world light.\n\nFor testing, we ran the Ryzen 5 5600X and Ryzen 5 7600X through the new suite, along with a Ryzen 7 5700X3D, to show what difference the extra L3 cache makes, and a 65 W Ryzen 7 7900, to emphasise how total core count matters in some applications.\n\nAs for Intel chips, there are really only two that matter, and that's the Core i5 14600K and Core i5 13400F. The former has a lower MSRP than the Ryzen 5 9600X but way more cores and was our top recommendation for the best all-round CPU before the whole Raptor Lake instability issue came to light. The 13400F is an Alder Lake chip and we still rate it as the best budget gaming CPU because it's super cheap, yet still really good in games.\n\nIn Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldur's Gate 3, the Ryzen 5 9600X is beaten by the Ryzen 7 5700X3D and Core i7 14700K, but as we move through Homeworld 3 and Metro Exodus, the new Zen 5 closes the gap to practically nothing. Warhammer III looks like it's GPU-limited but it's not really -- it's essentially a game engine that puts the bulk of the processing workload into one, heavy thread and it's here where you can see the 9600X's single-thread performance uplift help out a touch.\n\nCompared to the 5600X and 7600X, the Ryzen 5 9600X is a decent step up in gaming performance, though you won't necessarily see the same gap in every game and PC configuration. it naturally depends on the game. In some cases, there will be little to differentiate between them all, just as one can see in Warhammer III, whereas in others it will be like it is in our Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldur's Gate 3 tests.\n\nFor me, though, the biggest showcase for Zen 5's strength is Factorio -- this is a game that loves 3D V-cache and it's no surprise to see the 5700X3D handily beat everything else, but the 9600X easily took second place and by no close margin.\n\nOutside of gaming, the Ryzen 5 9600X behaves just as you would expect a 12-thread processor to when compared to others supporting 16 or more. But that single core result in Cinebench and the overall result in the photo editing test prove that the baby of the Zen 5 family is surprisingly good for certain productivity tasks -- AMD certainly wasn't fibbing about the IPC uplift.\n\nSo, what to make of the Ryzen 5 9600X? The architectural changes implemented in Zen 5 are very welcome but they're not going to universally improve how fast every game, application, and task runs. AMD hasn't increased the L3 cache, core count, or greatly boosted clock speeds in the 9600X compared to the 7600X, so the performance difference between the two is always going to be very application-specific.\n\nIn games, the current babe of the Zen 5 family is no slouch and provides ample evidence that six-core chips are still perfectly fine for PC gaming. Even the productivity benchmarks are encouraging, provided one accepts that 12 threads are never really enough for rendering, video editing, etc.\n\nAnd yet, despite all this, I feel a little unenthusiastic about the 9600X, which surprises me, as I have a real soft spot for the 5600X. I did have higher expectations of the Ryzen 5 9600X, coming into this review, even though I knew the test results weren't going to be a gargantuan leap forward in CPU performance metrics.\n\nGiven Zen 5's capabilities, I do feel AMD has missed a golden opportunity to really lift the Ryzen 5 segment -- not through core count but via clock speeds -- but then it would perhaps encroach too much on the Ryzen 7 segment, and it gets harder to really push the clock speeds of higher-tier chips, once you're laden with the cores and chiplets.\n\nWhat really matters, though, is whether it's worth buying or not. If you're currently using an AM4 gaming PC and you've been holding off upgrading, you'll be better off sticking with a Ryzen 7000 series chip as opposed to a new Zen 5 one if you're on a tight budget.\n\nThe Ryzen 5 9600X's launch price of $279/\u00a3269.99 is very decent but you can buy the Zen 4-powered Ryzen 7 7600X for $199 right now and it's not massively slower compared to its successor. On the other hand, if you find a prebuilt PC with a 9600X, then by all means consider buying it -- you won't regret it for one moment once you start playing games.\n\nOverall, then, the Ryzen 5 9600X isn't a fantastic entry point for the Ryzen 9000 series but it's not a bad one either.

When we originally reviewed this CPU, we stated that \"it was the only affordable gaming CPU you should buy.\" And that still holds true today, especially at its newly discounted price. So get this deal while you can because it won't last long.\n\nWhat's great about AMD's Ryzen 5 8600G?\n\nClose\n\nWhat makes the Ryzen 5 8600G such a great choice is not only its price, but also its performance as well. It comes with integrated graphics, which means, if you're on a budget, you won't need to purchase a dedicated graphics card to play games. As far as what you're getting, this AM5 processor has 6 cores with 12 threads, and features a base clock speed of 4.3Ghz that can top out at 5Ghz.\n\nIf all of that wasn't enough, as stated before, you're also going to get integrated graphics here as well, which is on par with a Radeon 760M with 8 GPU cores. This processor also comes with a bundled cooler, which isn't the best, but it will still get the job done. In our testing, we saw popular games like Elden Ring hit close to 60 frames per second, while oldies like GTA V peaked at 90fps.\n\nSo long as you're looking to game at 1080p, this APU is really going to blow you away with its performance and fantastic price.

Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware.\n\nZen 5 is finally here for desktop PCs and having already tasted what it is like with six cores, in the AMD Ryzen 5 9600X review, it's time to see what difference two more cores, four more threads, and a tiny bit more clock speed all makes -- that's right, it's our review of the Ryzen 7 9700X.\n\nAMD has stuck to the same fundamental floorplan for the 9700X as it has with the last generation 7700X and the Zen 3-powered 5700X. Underneath the heatspreader, you've got two chiplets: one CCD (Core Complex Die), which houses all the processing cores and cache, and one IOD (Input/Output Die) that's home to a tiny integrated GPU, PCIe and USB hubs, and the RAM controllers.\n\nWhere the CCD in the 9600X has two cores disabled, the 9700X comes with a fully enabled eight-core chiplet and a marginally higher boost clock (5.5 vs 5.4 GHz).\n\nThat 8.3 billion transistor CCD sports the latest AMD Zen 5 architecture, of course, with more L1 cache, more internal bandwidth, superior floating point support, a fancier branch prediction unit, and so on. The changes are pretty comprehensive and AMD claims that Zen 5 has an average IPC (instruction per clock) uplift of 16% over Zen 4, though not every application is going to see such an increase.\n\nI won't reiterate all the motherboard swapping and BIOS shenanigans I experienced testing the 9600X in this review, but it's worth noting they impacted the Ryzen 7 9700X just as much. Basically, the AM5 motherboard I used (a ROG Crosshair X670E Hero) was supplying the chip with a little bit too much power when idle, resulting in slightly elevated temperature -- this isn't something exclusive to Asus boards but not every configuration will experience the issue.\n\nThat said, the 9700X did idle a little cooler than the 9600X I tested, resting around the 45 \u00b0C mark, although it does have a marginally lower base clock (3.7 vs 3.8 GHz).\n\nThe power niggles also meant that the chip wasn't able to quite hit its full stride when running heavily multithreaded applications, such as Cinebench and Blender. I have no doubt that these will be fixed in time, and quite possibly very soon, but if you were looking to be a Zen 5 chip for demanding content creation work, you might want to hold off until the issues are all resolved.\n\nSomething else that the Ryzen 7 9700X has in common with the six-core sibling is a 65 W TDP (88 W maximum power limit). That's much better than the 105 W TDP of the Zen 4 7700X -- it's also half that of Intel's Core i5 14600K and Core i7 14700K -- and just as with the 9600X, I couldn't get it to go over 75 \u00b0C no matter what task I threw at the processor. With an Asus ROG Strix LC III 360 AIO liquid cooler, it happily ran at 65 \u00b0C in game testing in a hot office.\n\nNot that you need such a huge cooler. I tried a cheap twin 120 mm air system and the 9700X ran at around 72 \u00b0C, with little in the way of heat being pushed out of the test bench. For anyone used to a modern Intel gaming PC, it's a very pleasant surprise, I can assure you.\n\nBut this is a review and you're here to see benchmarks, so let's get on with them.\n\nWe've updated our CPU test suite to modernise various aspects of it, and you've got a great range of tests to look at and muse over the results. We've also switched from using a GeForce RTX 3080 to an RTX 4070 graphics card, to make the results have more meaning in the real world.\n\nSince most games don't make full use of eight or more cores, when it comes to the CPU workload in an engine, it's not surprising to see the Ryzen 7 9700X only being a little faster than the 9600X in some of our gaming tests. It runs very close to the Core i7 14700K in Cyberpunk 2077 and Baldur's Gate 3 -- close enough to not really matter -- and it's on par or ahead in the others.\n\nThe fractionally higher boost clock means it's only slightly faster at processing updates in Factorio than its six-core sibling but the 3D V-cache in the Ryzen 7 5700X3D means it will always come second place to that kind of chip.\n\nIf one considers all of the results together, I'd say it's fair to declare the Ryzen 7 9700X the overall winner in our gaming tests.\n\nIn the productivity and content creation benchmarks, it's by far the fastest 16-thread chip we've tested. We had hoped to have some Ryzen 7 7700X results for this review but that processor refused to play nicely and only a full SSD wipe and fresh OS installation made it behave -- unfortunately, a little too late to include complete numbers for today! However, based on the Ryzen 7 7900 and Ryzen 5 7600X results, it's clear that it would lag behind the 9700X.\n\nThe biggest eye-opener was the photo editing benchmark. If this is the kind of task you're going to be throwing regularly at your CPU, it's self-evident which one you'd choose and it's the Ryzen 7 9700X. And just like the 9600X, it does all this with a maximum power budget of 88 W.\n\nThat means it's not only easier to keep cool, but it's also cheaper to run and won't deluge your office space with copious amounts of heat. Compared to the Intel chips, it's an absolute win.\n\nWhere I was somewhat underwhelmed by the Ryzen 5 9600X, I have to say I'm more impressed with the Ryzen 7 9700X. It's not just that it's very good in gaming -- it's clearly the best one overall, out of all the tested CPUs in this review -- but it's the fact those two extra cores, with four more threads, make the 9700X a much better all-round processor.\n\nZen 5 also has lots of potential and it's perhaps too early to tell just how good it can be, but what's there already is certainly worth paying attention to.\n\nIf you've been holding off upgrading your PC, waiting to see what Zen 5 is like, then I'd say it's worth considering the Ryzen 7 9700X and a solid B650 motherboard (I also tested it in an Asus ROG Strix B650-A Gaming and it performed just as well as in the X670E). Pair them with a decent DDR5-6000 dual-channel RAM kit and you'll have an excellent, multi-purpose PC.\n\nWhat you won't have, though, is outstanding value for money. The $359 MSRP of the 9700X is spot-on for this kind of overall performance and it's pleasingly lower than the last-gen 7700X's launch price of $399. However, it doesn't sell for that price anymore and you can pick one up for $287 on Amazon. In fact, you can get a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, the best gaming CPU at the moment, for $374 although it won't be as good in productivity and content creation applications, it absolutely flies in terms of frame rates.\n\nAnd this is the problem for AMD when it comes to PC gaming. All such enthusiasts now only care about the X3D models and for good reason, so if you want a new Zen 5 chip just for gaming, then you're better off skipping the 9700X and waiting for the inevitable 9800X3D. But if you want a really solid, all-round processor, then the Ryzen 7 9700X will fit the bill -- once all the power stuff has been sorted out.", "source": {"uri": "pcgamer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pcgamer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_evanson@pcgamer.com", "name": "Nick Evanson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charge-coupled device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_4", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zen 4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CPU cache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Thread (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Motherboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Intel Core"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Branch predictor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instructions per cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Floating-point arithmetic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Gamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "PC Gamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BIOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clock rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bandwidth (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transistor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FeMqKmi3vJAwste8dj2QKg-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

In both cases, that's $50 more than a recent leak indicated (with the caveat that one source, Newegg, did pin the correct price on the flagship, to be fair - but all retailers were wrong about the 9900X). However, both MSRPs are still $50 under the launch price of the 7950X and 7900X.\n\nThe retailers were correct in the accidentally aired pricing for the Ryzen 7 9700X at $359, and the Ryzen 5 9600X at $279 (a drop of $40 and $20 respectively, gen-on-gen).\n\nAll of these are US prices, and we don't have confirmation for other regions yet. In theory, if we see proportional reductions, we can expect around 7% to 10% knocked off MSRPs in other countries. However, when factoring in sales and import duties, it's likely that regions outside the US may not see quite the same level of downward movement.\n\nOkay, so the good news outweighs the negative in this case, certainly. After all, AMD is making a new generation of Zen 5-toting desktop silicon the best part of 10% cheaper than the current-gen all down the range (at least with these initial product launches) - you can't look unfavorably on that.\n\nIn some respects, we're surprised that Team Red has lowered pricing at all. After all, Intel's next-gen Arrow Lake CPUs are still a good way off, perhaps, so Ryzen 9000 chips are effectively entering into battle with an old, and not too convincing, refresh of Raptor Lake silicon. (And Raptor Lake is almost two years old now). Plus, Intel is currently knee-deep in a mire of stability issues that are, at least going by some online chatter, putting off some folks from picking Team Blue for their CPUs.\n\nIn some ways, we bet AMD could have gone without reducing pricing at all - except maybe for the fact that some Ryzen 7000 models have sunk quite some way below their MSRPs now, and Ryzen 9000 must make some sort of sense when viewed from that perspective, too.\n\nOne particularly telling comparison for PC gamers will be how the new 9700X workhorse of the Zen 5 range stands up to the 7800X3D, in terms of price/performance ratio, as the latter is only about 5% more expensive with current pricing.

These CPUs have a dramatic effect on game performance thanks to some extra 3D V-cache, a sort of \"special sauce\" design that boosts the pushing of polygons.\n\nYou'll see them on sale from time to time, and right now you can take off a whopping $200 on the AMD Ryzen 9 7900X3D, bringing its retail price down to just $397.77 at Amazon.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 7900X3D is the second-fastest CPU of its generation, with 12 cores maxing out at 5.6GHz. More importantly, it uses double the L3 cache (compared to its non-X3D variant) to boost game performance by a noticeable amount, even without touching the GPU.\n\nAnd speaking of GPUs, AMD motherboards are compatible with all of them -- you can combine a Ryzen processor on an AM5-socket motherboard with an Nvidia graphics card, no problem.\n\nThat AM5 socket is a big deal, too. The Ryzen 7000 series is the first to use the new motherboard socket design, and if it's anything like the AM4, it'll get years of upgrades yet to come. So, if you're looking to build a PC with plenty of longevity for future upgrades (including the brand-new Ryzen 9000 series coming out), then this is a great starting point.\n\nI wish this deal had been around when I last upgraded my gaming PC, when I bought a 7800X3D for around the same price.

Today we're looking at the first two processors, the six-core 9600X at \u00a3269/$279 and eight-core 9700X at \u00a3339/$359. These mainstream offerings are due to go on sale on August 8th, with the 12-core and 16-core Ryzen 9 models scheduled to arrive one week later.\n\nWith faster-in-games X3D variants rumoured for later this year and heavily discounted Ryzen 7000 parts already on the market, are the new Ryzen 9000 models worth picking up in the meantime? And how do these processors compare to the high-flying Ryzen 7 7800X3D, which we've been recommending as the best high-end gaming CPU?\n\nTo find out, we've tested these processors and some of their closest AMD and Intel rivals in a gauntlet of demanding games from 1080p to 4K, plus taken a look at synthetic and content creation benchmarks to get an idea of whether these new Ryzen 9000 processors offer a noticeable improvement over their predecessors.\n\nWe expect to see a fair uptick in most workloads, with AMD's figures showing an average 16 percent increase to IPC (instructions per clock, an indicator of single-core grunt) at similar clockspeeds to the outgoing Ryzen 7000X CPUs and on the same AM5 socket and 700-series motherboards. (AMD has also announced X870 and X870E motherboards with USB 4 as standard and faster memory support, but we haven't received these for testing just yet.)\n\nThe speed gains here are achieved through a combination of architectural improvements (such as an improved branch predictor, better AVX-512 support and doubled data bandwidth between L2 to L1 caches) and the switch to a more efficient 4nm CCD. That means we should expect better power efficiency from the new cores, and indeed the parts are all rated at lower TDPs than their Ryzen 7000 predecessors (65W vs 105W for Ryzen 5/7).\n\nFinally, improved thermal resistance means that temperatures at the same TDP ought to be lower too - AMD claims a 7\u00b0C reduction at matched TDPs, which is impressive stuff.\n\nWe're using a similar physical setup to our previous Ryzen 7000 testing, including the ASRock X670E Taichi motherboard, G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo DDR5-6000 CL30 RAM and an Eisbaer Aurora 240mm AiO. The big difference is that our RTX 3090 has been swapped out for an RTX 4090 Founders Edition, providing a surfeit of extra graphics performance that should push modern CPUs even harder.\n\nWhile Ryzen 9000 is the star of the show, we also tested a selection of earlier Ryzen 3000 and 5000 processors and Intel's more mainstream 14th-gen processors. Our Intel CPU testing was performed on the Gigabyte Aorus Z790 Master using the same DDR5-6000 CL30 RAM, while AM4 CPUs were tested on the classic Asus ROG Crosshair 8 Hero with a Trident Z Royal DDR4-3600 CL16 kit.\n\nFor storage, we're using a 4TB Lexar NM790 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD and 4TB Kingston KC3000. Our rig is completed with a 1000W Corsair RM1000x power supply. Testing was performed with the latest Windows updates (23H2), chipset drivers and BIOS revisions (3.06 for the ASRock AM5 board) installed.\n\nContent creation benchmarks serve two purposes here. First, they serve as synthetic benchmarks with useful differentiation between single-core and multi-core results, allowing us to see where new CPUs lie versus their rivals and where they seek to gain their advantages. Secondly, they're of course useful to show real-world performance in similar workloads, with Cinebench simulating the 3D modelling and animation program Cinema 4D, while Handbrake is literally just transcoding an early DF Patreon video - a common task for anyone that works with video.\n\nLet's look at the Cinebench 2024 results first. This is the first time we've used this test, which loops for at least ten minutes to ensure processors aren't able to quickly knock in a good score before thermal or power limits kick in. This makes for a long total run time, especially with the task given over to a single CPU core, but it is a reasonable upgrade given the power of modern CPUs.\n\nHere, the 9600X and 9700X do give a good account of themselves, showing a 16 percent and 18 percent improvement over their last-gen predecessors in single-core scores - very close to the 16 percent average in IPC AMD measured in their own benchmarks. Multi-core returns are a little more modest, with improvements of 11 percent and just four percent for the 9600X and 9700X respectively.\n\nI did notice that the CPU was only maxing out at 62\u00b0C in these tests, so I tested at a higher 105W TDP using PBO in the BIOS - and did extract more performance at the cost of temperature.\n\nCinebench R20 is a legacy test for us, having run in a huge number of previous CPU reviews, and so we thought it was worth running as well in case you wanted to go back and compare results. We saw similar margins here gen-on-gen (+14 percent single-core for both Ryzen 9000 CPUs), but it's worth noticing the Intel threat too.\n\nThe 14600K delivers a 9420 point multi-core score, which the 14700K ups to 13614 - and Intel's best in the Ryzen 7 category hits only 7851 at the stock 65W TDP, or 8908 after the TDP limits are raised to 105W. This is down to a few factors, most notably higher core counts for the Intel CPUs, including 14 cores for the 14600K (6P+8E) and 20 for the 14700K (8P+12E) versus the six-core and eight-core 9600X and 9700X. Intel motherboards are also typically more aggressive when it comes to power delivery at stock settings, which is particularly helpful for these sorts of all-core workloads but does result in higher energy consumption and more heat to dissipate.\n\nOur final test is the Handbrake transcode test, where we convert an 822MB 4K video file using the H264 and H265 codecs using the Production Standard preset set to CRF 18. We're using the most recent version of Handbrake here, 1.8.1.\n\nThese transcode results show the first slightly worrying signs of underperformance, with the H264 benchmark running just three percent faster on the 9600X versus the 7600X, though the H265 benchmark speeds up by around eight percent - perhaps due to those AVX architectural improvements. The 9700X is even weirder, actually dropping nearly three percentage points versus the 7700X in the H264 test - something that persisted through multiple retests. Normalcy is restored in the HEVC test, albeit by just one percent.\n\nIncreasing the 9700X's TDP to 105W in the BIOS allows for more meaningful improvement, to the tune of 14 percent over the stock 7600X - but it comes with higher temperatures, in the 80s and low 90s versus the low 60s we saw at stock power limits.\n\nWith our content creation benchmarks completed, let's move onto the main event: our game benchmarks.", "source": {"uri": "eurogamer.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurogamer.net"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instructions_per_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instructions per cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Motherboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CPU cache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_4D", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cinema 4D"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_AM5", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Socket AM5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USB4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AVX-512"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_(microarchitecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zen (microarchitecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Branch predictor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_socket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CPU socket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASRock", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ASRock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_design_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thermal design power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_30_series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GeForce 30 series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigabyte_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gigabyte Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Buses", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Components", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Test_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Test Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year_2000", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Year 2000", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Performance_and_Capacity/Benchmarking", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Performance and Capacity/Benchmarking", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/9700X.jpg?width=1200&height=600&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9796694", "eventUri": "eng-9796694", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-08", "textStart": 373, "textEnd": 383}], "sentiment": 0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The Ryzen 9 5900XT features 16 cores and 32 threads, a notable increase from the Ryzen 9 5900X's 12 cores. Compared to the Ryzen 9 5950X, which also has 16 cores but was released in October 2020, the 5900XT operates at a slightly lower clock speed.

Typically, with AMD Ryzen launches, we usually see the desktop parts come first, with the flagship model and then the mobile coming after. This time around, AMD has changed the dynamic of their release schedule with Zen 5 by launching the mobile chips first, which includes the Ryen AI 9 HX 370, which we reviewed last month. Today, Zen 5 on desktop has its turn, as AMD has launched two mid-range desktop processors, the Ryzen 7 9700X and the Ryzen 5 9600X.\n\nAMD has launched two of the four announced Ryzen 9000 series processors today. The entry-level model is the Ryzen 5 9600X, a 6C/12T part with full-sized Zen 5 cores that can boost up to 5.4 GHz out of the box. The other model launched today is the Ryzen 7 9700X, which also features 8C/16T of Zen 5 and a boost clock speed of up to 5.5 GHz.\n\nAs part of AMD's push on platform longevity, the Ryzen 9000 series shares the same AM5 socket as its predecessor, meaning users can use X670E/X670 and B650E/B650 motherboards with a firmware update. We expected to see the newer X870X motherboards come with the Ryzen 9000 release, but unfortunately, these have been delayed.\n\nSo now we have Zen 5 in the form of the Ryzen 9000 series finally hitting the desktop, sans the top two SKUs, the Ryzen 9 9950X and Ryzen 9 9900X, which are coming later, it's time to see how much of an improvement Zen 5 is over Zen 4, not just in single-threaded but also multi-threaded workloads as AMD has promised up to an uplift of 16% IPC on average. The Ryzen 7 9700X and Ryzen 5 9600X have a TDP of 65 W, which we see as more aligned with the non-X SKUs, so it will be interesting to see how Zen 5 performs in both performance and efficiency.\n\nOver the last couple of months, since AMD unveiled Zen 5 at Computex 2024, we've penned quite several column inches around the latest Zen 5 microarchitecture. AMD has made some interesting upgrades to their Ryzen processors for Zen 5 when combined with Zen 4, at least in the design of the cores. Interestingly, AMD is using the same IOD that we saw in Zen 4, with the only part of the Ryzen 9000 series getting an upgrade via the cores themselves, with up to two core complexes (Ryzen 9) featuring the new Zen 5 cores. The I/O die itself is manufactured by TSMC on their 6 nm node.\n\nThe Zen 5 microarchitecture improves upon multiple areas over Zen 4, especially in things such as caching and instruction-fetch capabilities. The Zen 5 architecture doubles the L2 cache size to 1 MB per core over Zen 4, upgrading the I-Cache to 32 KB and the D-Cache to 48 KB. Dual I-Fetch/decode pipes allow the cores to handle more instructions per cycle than the single fetch/decode pipe featured on Zen 4. The Execution Units on Zen 5 also get a bit of a buff, as Zen 5 comes with 6 Integer ALUs and 6 FP operations per cycle versus the more minor execution capabilities of Zen 4. This way, the throughput and general efficiency of the chip are improved.\n\nZen 5 is also optimized for stronger data flow in general and power efficiency compared to Zen 4. It gets upgraded to 4 load pipes for 512b AVX-512 workloads, as well as wider L2 cache paths that should be able to handle data better. AMD has also taken a bit of a different approach with AVX-512 instructions for Zen 4, including a single full AVX-512 data path; however, two 256-bit paths come with Zen 4 and opt to \"double pump\" the data, which isn't as efficient. There is also the continued inclusion of Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT), which means Zen 5 has two threads per core for improving multi-threaded performance.\n\nAnother thing to note is that Zen 5 processors are manufactured using TSMC's N4P node. TSMC states that this offers significant improvements over the 5nm node used in Zen 4. Although TSMC's base 4nm node (N4) is not much better than 5nm, the N4P node reportedly shows plenty of gains in comparison. TSMC states that the N4P node delivers an 11% increase in performance, a 22% gain in power efficiency, and a 6% boost in transistor density compared to the N5 (5 nm) node. Thanks to more EUV layers, the N4P process also cuts production costs by using around 6%, with fewer masks used in the production stage.\n\nAMD's Zen 5 die can support up to 16 cores, including 1 MB L2 cache per core, with up to 8C/16T of compute cores and 32 MB L3 cache per CCD. The integrated GPU uses 1 WGP and 2 CUs based on the RDNA 2 architecture, which remains unchanged over Zen 4. It also has two 32B/cycle ports for effective data management that offer basic integrated graphics support for users without a discrete graphics card. Other implementations on the Granite Ridge SoC include specific accelerators and micro-controllers for video encoding/decoding, audio co-processors, and display controllers with support for up to 4 concurrent displays.\n\nThe IO side supports 128-bit DDR5 memory at 5600 MT/s (DDR5-5600) and 28 x PCIe Gen 5 lanes, meaning it can support one full-length PCIe 5.0 slot at x16 or two full-length slots at x8/x8. It also gives additional PCIe headroom for PCIe 5.0 x4 M.2 SSDs. The SoC also supports multiple USB ports, including up to three USB 3.3 Type-C, one USB 3.2 Gen2 Type-A, and one USB2. We are starting to see a more holistic shift from the older USB standards, such as USB 2, although these are backward compatible throughout the different standards.\n\nLooking at the Ryzen 9000 stack as it currently stands, AMD has announced four SKUs in total so far. The flagship SKU, the Ryzen 9 9950X, has 16 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.7 GHz, and 80 MB of cache, which is split between 64 MB for the L3 and 16 MB for the L2 (1 MB per core of L2). It also has a 170 W TDP, which mirrors the previous Ryzen 9 7950X. This is where the rest of the stack differs from the Ryzen 7000 SKUs, and each of the new Zen 5 chips replaced differs.\n\nThe Ryzen 9 9900X is a 12C/24T part, which boosts up to 5.6 GHz, which coincidentally is the same boost frequency the Ryzen 9 7900X it replaces comes with, too. Aside from the change in architecture to Zen 5 from Zen 4, the biggest difference in paper specifications is that the new Ryzen 9 9900X has a TDP of just 120 W, down from the 170 W from the previous SKU.\n\nAMD Ryzen 9000 series die shot with 2 x CCXs (Ryzen 9)\n\nMoving down the stack and onto the two processors we're reviewing today, the Ryzen 7 9700X, which comes with 8 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.5 GHz, 32 MB of L3 cache, and a 65W TDP. In contrast, the Ryzen 5 9600X has just 6 cores, a max boost clock of up to 5.4 GHz, and 32 MB of L3 cache. Also, it has a 65 W TDP. Still, both their predecessors, the Ryzen 7 7700X (8C/16T Zen 4) and the Ryzen 5 7600X (6C/12T Zen 4), have a higher 105 W TDP.\n\nThis is a testament to AMD's focus and commitment to delivering power efficiency. With close to the same boost clocks as their Zen 4 counterparts, Zen 5 and Ryzen 9000 do things with a lower voltage/frequency (V/F) curve. This shows that Zen 5 is seemingly more efficient than Zen 4, but AMD has also bumped memory support up to DDR5-5600, up from DDR5-5200 on Ryzen 7000.\n\nAlthough the Ryzen 9000 uses the same AM5 socket as the previous Ryzen 7000 series, motherboard vendors have been readying new motherboards based on the X870E and X870 chipsets. All of the AM5 socket motherboards that are either currently on the market or due to be released with the X870E/X870 chipsets use the same ASMedia Promontory 21 chipset at their heart. The only real difference is in the feature sets, and newer boards utilize new controllers that previously weren't available at the time.\n\nNotable additions with X870E/X870 include USB 4.0 support, which will be ubiquitous on all X870(E) boards, where it was previously only optional for X670(E) series boards. X870(E) boards will also herald in Wi-Fi 7 support, although that's leaping from 6E with the 600 series with at least one PCIe 5.0 NVMe slot continuing to be a mandatory inclusion. AMD also notes that motherboards based on both platforms \"feature 44 total PCIe lanes,\" which would break down to 24 lanes from the CPU and another 20 lanes from the chipset.\n\nThat being said, if users already have an existing AM5 motherboard, there's no need to upgrade unless the temptation of features like Wi-Fi 7 is pretty much the biggest difference on most of the newer motherboards. The other caveat with X870E and X870 is that there's no official date for these models to hit the shelves. We know these should be expected sometime in September, which we got from a reliable source from a big motherboard manufacturer.\n\nRegarding pricing, the AMD Ryzen 7 9700X has an MSRP of $359, which is actually $40 cheaper than its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7700X, which launched in September 2022 for $399. The same can be said about the Ryzen 5 7600X, which debuts at $279, which is $20 cheaper than the Ryzen 5 7600X did around this time 2 years ago at launch. AMD is coming in aggressive with its pricing on Zen 5. While both these chips are aimed firmly at the more affordable end of the market, it's time to see how they compete with their Ryzen 7000 (Zen 4) counterparts, as well as Intel's Raptor Lake (14th Gen) chips such as the Core i5-14600K, among others we've tested.\n\nHow does Zen 5 for desktop compare to Zen 4 and Intel's offerings?

In Japan, the promotion is limited to specific higher-end models of Ryzen processors and Radeon RX graphics cards.\n\nAMD's aims to enhance the value proposition of its hardware products by offering popular gaming titles. \"Unknown9 Awakening\" and \"Warhammer 40000: Space Marine II\" are both anticipated releases, likely to appeal to a broad spectrum of gamers. By bundling these games with its latest hardware, AMD is positioning itself to attract more customers looking for a comprehensive gaming package. Notebooks featuring Ryzen 7000S and 7000HS series mobile processors also benefit from this promotion. These mobile processors are designed to balance performance and power efficiency, making them ideal for gaming laptops that require both high performance and extended battery life. This aspect of the bundle caters to the growing market of mobile gamers who prefer the flexibility and portability of gaming laptops.\n\nThe geographical limitations of the bundle, excluding China and certain other regions, suggest logistical and regulatory challenges that AMD has opted to navigate selectively.

You can now get these games free with GPUs as cheap as the RX 7600 XT and CPUs as lowly as the Ryzen 7 7700. If your system is in need of an upgrade, and you've get less than $300 to spend, a free $55 game offers some great extra value.\n\nEven buyers of new laptops can get in on the fun, with AMD-equipped laptops using both a Ryzen 7000-series CPU and GPU eligible for the offer. Notably, no current-gen CPUs are included in the offer, though, such as AMD's new 8000-series desktop APUs or Ryzen AI 300 laptop CPUs, which is a bit of a shame.\n\nThe full list of eligible products is shown below:\n\nAn interesting quirk of this offer - the full details of which can be found here - is that while it offers great value on paper, currently both games aren't yet available, with the Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 release date being September 9, 2024, and the Unknown 9: Awakening release date having not even been announced yet, though it's penciled in for 2024.\n\nMoreover, the games will have to be claimed by November 2, 2024, so there's potentially only a small window for you to claim Unknown 9: Awakening.

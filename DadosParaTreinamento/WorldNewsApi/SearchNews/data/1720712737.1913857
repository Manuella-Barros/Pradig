This comes amid fears that right-wing populists like Orb\u00e1n are likely to make significant gains which could undermine the ability of the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc to make decisions as war rages in Ukraine and anti-migrant sentiment mounts. Orban had expressed hopes that parties across Europe that oppose providing military support to Ukraine would gain a majority in the EU legislature. Hungary is set to take over the EU\u2019s rotating six-month presidency in July. The five-time prime minister cast his ballot around 9 a.m. local time in the capital, Budapest, telling reporters the results of the elections would decide whether Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine would engulf Europe. \u201cToday we must win this election in Europe. It is the first European election in my life where I see there is a theme that runs through almost all the member states,\u201d he said, in reference to the role EU countries have been playing since Russia started its military operation against Ukraine in 2022. PHOTOS: Hungarians elect EU representatives in an election seen as a referendum on Orb\u00e1n's popularity \u201cWe will interpret the election results tonight as the people of Europe expressing an opinion about war and peace.\u201d Orb\u00e1n\u2019s governing Fidesz party is expected to win a large number of votes after campaigning heavily on fears that the war in neighboring Ukraine could escalate to involve Hungary directly. He has blamed \u201cpro-war\u201d politicians in Washington and Brussels for increasing tensions with Russia and portrayed his refusal to supply Kyiv with military aid and other support as a \u201cpro-peace\u201d position unique in Europe. Antal Z\u00e1mb\u00f3, a 75-year-old retiree in Budapest who cast his vote Sunday morning, said he supported Orb\u00e1n and Fidesz as he believed they would deliver \u201ca more peaceful life.\u201d \u201cEveryone benefits if there is peace in their surroundings as well as on the global stage,\u201d he said. While Fidesz has dominated Hungarian politics since 2010, many are deeply dissatisfied with what\u2019s happening in the country, following economic hardship and a scandal that rocked the party which prides itself on upholding family values and Christian conservatism. Some believe this may prompt voters to support one of the most formidable challengers Orb\u00e1n has ever faced, P\u00e9ter Magyar. Magyar broke ranks with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party in February and in a matter of months has built up Hungary\u2019s strongest opposition party. He hopes to use a good showing in Sunday\u2019s elections to propel himself and his movement to challenge and defeat the prime minister in the next national ballot scheduled for 2026. The 43-year-old lawyer\u2019s message that widespread corruption in Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government and its policies that incited deep social divisions has resonated with many Hungarians who desire change. On Saturday, he mobilized tens of thousands of demonstrators in Budapest in a final appeal for support for his Respect and Freedom (TISZA) party. As he cast his vote in Budapest on Sunday, Magyar said Hungarian voters \u201cwill send a strong message to Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\u201d \u201cThey are fed up with the corruption, with the lies and with the propaganda,\u201d Magyar said. One TISZA supporter, Gyula N\u00e9met, 71, said after casting his vote that Orb\u00e1n\u2019s rule in the last 14 years has \u201cnot only proved that they are incompetent, but they totally divided this country.\u201d \u201cHungary has been pushed to the sidelines in Europe. We became totally segregated,\u201d he said. \u201cThis cannot go on. We definitely need a positive change, integration with Europe and among the Hungarian people.\u201d", "summary": "Voters began casting their ballots in Hungary early Sunday to choose their representatives for the European Parliament in an election many see as a referendum on Prime Minister Viktor Orban's popularity.", "url": "https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/jun/9/voters-in-hungary-elect-eu-representatives-in-elec/", "image": "https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2024/06/09/European_Election_Hungary_36556.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:54:36", "author": "Justin Spike", "authors": ["Justin Spike"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.297}

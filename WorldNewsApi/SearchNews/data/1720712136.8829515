MacIntyre\u2019s emotional victory in the RBC Canadian Open, with his dad Dougie called up to caddie at the last minute, secured his place in next year\u2019s Masters and the upcoming US Open. And that means the Ryder Cup winner will be hoping for an early tee-time in Friday\u2019s second round at Pinehurst so he can watch Scotland\u2019s opening fixture against hosts Germany. \u201cI\u2019ll take what I\u2019m given, but I\u2019m sure the people walking around will keep me updated with what\u2019s going on if I\u2019m on the golf course,\u201d MacIntyre said. \u201cHopefully the boys can pull one off and and get a win over them.\u201d MacIntyre revealed he spent part of a long day waiting for his final round in Canada by watching his Oban team-mates playing shinty on his phone, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s good to have a distraction. \u201cIt\u2019s good to have something to take your mind completely off what you\u2019re trying to do and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be watching every game of the Euros. I\u2019m just gutted I can\u2019t get over to it.\u201d MacIntyre has played 13 major championships so far in his career and missed just one cut, with his share of eighth place in the recent US PGA Championship a third top 10. The left-hander went into the final round in Valhalla three shots off the lead but was unable to find the birdies required to stay in contention in a Sunday shootout. However, MacIntyre ended the week in style as he came close to making an albatross on the par-five 18th before holing from 10 feet for eagle and a closing 70. \u201cGoing into Sunday a lot of things had to happen for me to win that tournament,\u201d MacIntyre added. \u201cI would have needed a 61 so the odds were stacked against me. \u201cBut I learnt so much on the Sunday especially. I stayed in the fight. I was getting annoyed, but I didn\u2019t change the process of what I was doing, didn\u2019t change the game plan and then I got my reward on the 18th. It was massive. \u201cThe US Open is a major, a massive event, but I need to try to treat it as another golf tournament. I\u2019ve been working hard on the mental side of the game and let the outcome be the outcome. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be golf tournaments in the future that I\u2019m going to go mental at because we\u2019re humans and we\u2019re not perfect all the time, but it\u2019s about recognising that you\u2019re falling off the path of staying calm and get yourself back on there as quick as you can. \u201cMy job is to go out there, play golf and try and get into a position coming into the Sunday and who knows how the cards fall? \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to win golf tournaments. It\u2019s even harder to win majors, but you\u2019ve got to be in it to win it and this [win in Canada] was a big step in in my career. \u201cI want to win majors but if I do, great, if I don\u2019t, well I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve given it my best shot. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve had a decent a decent record in majors and it would be incredible to get across the line in one of them but there\u2019s a lot that goes on to win a major.\u201d", "summary": "Victory in the Canadian Open earned the Scot a place in the US Open at Pinehurst, during which his country\u2019s footballers take on Germany in Munich.", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/robert-macintyre-germany-munich-pga-tour-canada-b2559416.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/06/09/13/33ae5553de1ec8233b6941c9fa303b4dY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzE3NzU5ODkw-2.74025786.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:24:33", "author": "Phil Casey", "authors": ["Phil Casey"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.112}

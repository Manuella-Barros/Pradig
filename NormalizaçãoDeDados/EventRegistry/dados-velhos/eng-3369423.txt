It marks the strengthening of the BRICS formation and also underlines the BRICS commitment to the development of the African continent and emerging markets.\n\n\"This is a critical milestone not only for South Africa, but for the African continent as a whole. We are thus celebrating it as a shared achievement,\" said the President.\n\nThe idea of establishing a new bank with a new mission and orientation was first discussed in Durban in 2013, when South Africa hosted the BRICS forum, after which it was agreed to establish a centre in Africa to take care of developmental needs of the continent.\n\nPresident Zuma said he is pleased with the progress the bank has made in two years of existence. These include the signing of the founding agreement of the New Development Bank, which paved the way for the opening of the bank's head office in Shanghai, China. The issuance of the first set of loans - amounting to US $1. 5 billion dollars (approximately R20 billion) in total - to fund renewable energy projects in member countries is also a significant step forward.\n\nPresident Zuma said government is confident that the NDB will build on these achievements and grow from strength to strength.\n\nThe NDB is a multilateral development bank to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects. The bank will start the process of considering new members and finalise the project pipeline for the second batch of loans to be offered in the 2017/2018 financial year.\n\nIn his comments at the launch, NDB President Kundapur Kamath said the ARC will be the face of the NDB in Africa. The bank's headquarters are located in Shanghai, China.\n\nIn 2017, the bank expects to approve loans aggregating between 2.5 billion and three billion US dollars for about 10 projects.\n\n\"In 2018, we expect to present total lending of about US $4 billion. The target is to end 2018 with a loan book of about $8 billion for projects,\" Kamath said.\n\nUnlocking Africa's growth potential\n\nPresident Zuma said African countries generally have inadequate infrastructure interconnections.\n\n\"As a result, we cannot maximise the benefits of regional trade. Worse still, the continent does not have adequate social infrastructure for the provision of basic services such as health and education, and we therefore are not able to significantly improve the living standards of our people.\"\n\nHe said the continent has been unable to unlock its growth potential.\n\n\"Given the challenges, the African continent has great expectations for the New Development Bank. We expect that the bank, through the Africa Regional Centre, will contribute to accelerating infrastructure investment in energy, transport, water and other productive sectors,\" said President Zuma.\n\nThe African continent, he said, continues to be plagued by poverty and human suffering. \"We therefore call on the New Development Bank and like-minded institutions to test new boundaries, explore new possibilities and deliver sustainable solutions that will better serve humanity.\"\n\nThe launch of the ARC is a turning point for the continent and its development, said President Zuma.\n\nMeanwhile, Kamath said the NDB is appreciative of the strong support it has received from South Africa and that the bank believes South Africa offers attractive opportunities for fundraising.\n\n\"We [hope] to lend about $1.5 billion to South Africa for the next 18 months. We believe the South African market offers attractive opportunities for fundraising,\" said Kamath. - SAnews.gov.za", "id": "9730072", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "New Development Bank a milestone for Africa", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "233", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 5, "id": "247", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Durban"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "45903", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durban", "label": {"eng": "Durban"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Shi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "64265", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Shi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}, "id": "302736", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Human"}, "id": "302854", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human"}, {"label": {"eng": "Transport"}, "id": "303009", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bank"}, "id": "303134", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank"}, {"label": {"eng": "Poverty"}, "id": "303176", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty"}, {"label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}, "id": "303212", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "303539", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Continent"}, "id": "303783", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continent"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infrastructure"}, "id": "303871", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"}, {"label": {"eng": "Education"}, "id": "304279", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jacob Zuma"}, "id": "304313", "score": 5, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma"}, {"label": {"eng": "Loan"}, "id": "304611", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Finance"}, "id": "307019", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emerging markets"}, "id": "308701", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_markets"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}, "id": "309796", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"}, {"label": {"eng": "International development"}, "id": "319216", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_development"}, {"label": {"eng": "BRICS"}, "id": "323264", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS"}, {"label": {"eng": "Non-directional beacon"}, "id": "390332", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-directional_beacon"}, {"label": {"eng": "International financial institutions"}, "id": "391202", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_financial_institutions"}, {"label": {"eng": "New Development Bank"}, "id": "1215302", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Development_Bank"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services"}], "time": "16:11:00"}

The creation of a NDB was the main theme of the meeting.\n\n\"This is a turning point for Africa and its development,\" Zuma said as he opened Africa Regional Centre (ARC) and commented on how the idea of establishing a new bank with a new mission and orientation was first discussed at a BRICS forum in Durban in 2013.\n\n\"Our challenge is that Africa is largely under- industrialised, with the result that our economies are over- exposed to the winds of commodities markets,\" he said.\n\nHe said African countries generally did not have adequate infrastructure and interconnections which prevents them to maximise the benefits of regional trade.\n\n\"This new bank will enable continued fruitful cooperation with our global partners, which will help us promote sustainable development through integration, industrialisation and infrastructure development on the continent,\" Zuma said.\n\nVeteran Indian banker Kamath said since the bank started its operations two years ago, it had approved 17 projects to the value of about USD 1.5 billion.\n\n\"In 2017, we expect to approve loans aggregating between USD 2.5 and USD 3 billion for about ten projects, and in 2018 we expect to present about 15 to 20 projects involving a total lending of about USD 4 billion for the board's consideration.\n\n\"Our target is to end 2018 with a total loan book of about USD 8 billion dollars for approximately 35 projects,\" he said.\n\n\"In 2018, we also plan to begin our private sector operations and explore investments in public-private partnership projects. We are working closely with the authorities in South Africa to identify a strong pipeline of projects that we can support,\" he said.\n\nKamath said he had told his teams at the Shanghai headquarters as well as the new ARC that South Africa should be prioritised for lending of USD 1.5 billion over the next 18 months.\n\n\"NDB thus far has received total capital contributions of about USD 2.6 billion, including advance payments from some of our member countries, in this instance China and Russia. We expect to receive another USD 900 million by January 2018,\" he said.\n\nHe said the timely and even advance receipt of contributions from all the members was a strong vote of confidence in the institution and sends a positive signal to the international community about the bank's founders.\n\n\"Because it is currently limited by its mandate to operate in its member countries only,\" Kamath said, adding that expanding its operations to other countries would mean admitting more members to the bank.\n\n\"In April 2017, the members of the bank took the first step towards this objective when they approved the terms, conditions and procedures for admission of new members to the bank,\" he said.\n\nKamath said the bank was also looking at lending in local currencies in member countries to avoid the ravages of exchange fluctuations.\n\n(This article has not been edited by DNA's editorial team and is auto-generated from an agency feed.)", "id": "9727401", "details": {}, "date":

Strife-riven Brazil, Russia, India and China are more risky allies than Zuma reckoned when in 2010 he accepted Beijing's invitation to join the club.\n\n\"I was poisoned and almost died just because South Africa joined BRICS under my leadership,\" Zuma told rural supporters at a Phongolo African National Congress (ANC) Cadres' Forum in his native KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday. He offered no proof for the startling claim, which dates to his illness during a mid-2014 US trip. But his wife Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma was initially blamed, then banished from his notorious Nkandla palace by Zuma's security minister David Mahlobo in early 2015, and subsequently charged with attempted murder.\n\nIs this new narrative plausible, given the celebratory role BRICS have played in world capitalism? Recall the bloc's initial 2001 rationale offered by Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O'Neill: \"It seems quite clear that the current G7 needs to be upgraded and room made for the BRICs in order to allow more effective global policymaking.\" Last year, just after Goldman Sachs had closed its main BRIC investment fund due to poor performance, O'Neill asked, \"How on earth can South Africa be economically in the same class?\" However, he conceded, \"Politically, it is very important that South Africa is part of BRICS.\"\n\nTalk left\n\nThat's the opposite impression that Zuma is communicating about the views of Western multinational corporations and governments. According to Zuma's complaint to another ANC Cadres' Forum audience last November, Westerners \"want to dismantle this BRICS. We have had seven votes of no confidence in South Africa. In Brazil, the president was removed.\"\n\nSuch paranoia is regularly expressed in ANC circuits, including during an SAfm radio debate last week with National Union of Mineworkers deputy president Joseph Montisetsi. He remarked quite justifiably on multinational corporate mining houses' exploitation of workers, their illicit financial flows (capital flight) and their lack of reinvestment. But then Montisetsi claimed these firms aim \"to stop the South African community because of their choice of politics. These things are done everywhere, especially in BRICS countries - those countries that want an alternative kind of government which will have a kind of a bank which is contrary to World Bank and International Monetary Fund\" (IMF).\n\nIn reality, the NDB has a strong relationship with the World Bank, cemented by last September's Memo of Understanding. The NDB's 2017-21 Strategy document commits \"to undertake joint projects and knowledge exchanges with the World Bank... to make the most of their decades of experience.\"\n\nLikewise, the BRICS' $100 billion Contingent Reserve Arrangement strengthens the IMF by insisting that once a borrower takes 30% of its quota (e.g. $3 billion for South Africa), then before it can access the next 70% it must first get an IMF structural adjustment programme. South Africa's foreign debt exceeds $143 billion - nearly 50% of GDP, a modern local record - and has left various commentators either advocating or opposing IMF lending and advice in recent days.\n\nWalk right\n\nBut aren't the BRICS making the IMF fairer? Four gained voting power increases in a December 2015 restructuring - China (up 37%), Brazil (23%), India (11%) and Russia (8%) - but only as a result of eight African countries (including South Africa and Nigeria) losing between 21-41% of their IMF votes. When last December IMF managing director Christine Lagarde was convicted of criminal negligence for gifting a party supporter $430 million when she was French Finance Minister, BRICS directors joined a unanimous 'full confidence' IMF endorsement.\n\nIn spite of occasional case-specific denials, especially about Greece (where Lagarde clashed with anti-austerity finance minister Yanis Varoufakis in 2015), the IMF maintains its murderous neoliberal orientation. Last month's fib by Lagarde, that the IMF has 'typically protected' health and education spending in poor countries (from 1988-2014) was quickly rebutted by Thomas Stubbs of Cambridge and Alexander Kentikelenis of Oxford: \"the IMF's assessment is methodologically flawed, and the organisation remains disconnected from the global political zeitgeist on universal social protection.\" Their May 2017 study of 2.8 billion IMF victims in 67 countries published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences confirmed that IMF austerity regimes substantially \"reduce the protective effect of parental education on child health, especially in rural areas.\"\n\nA well-publicised 2016 confession of how the IMF 'oversold' neoliberal medicine offered by three of its economists faced a quick internal backlash, according to Oxfam's Max Lawson: \"Any chance of the IMF sponsoring a sensible debate of the pros and cons of neoliberalism now seems extremely unlikely.\" In all of this, BRICS' directors are Lagarde's sub-imperialist allies.\n\nA neoliberal NDB\n\nPart of the problem lies in the orientation of local personnel who occupy these posts. The NDB African Regional Centre's new director general was not yet announced at the time of writing, but the job is a hot potato. It was the fig-leaf excuse Zuma gave in December 2015 for firing pro-business Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene, who then spurned the supposed offer. In his final budget, Nene made cuts to the real value of already-tokenistic social grants to poor South Africans, while generously increasing the amount rich South Africans (mostly white) could take offshore (from $300 000 to $750 000) during yet another exchange control deregulation.\n\nThe South African chosen as NDB Vice President, Leslie Maasdorp, previously worked at Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Bank of America - as well as leading Pretoria's internal privatisation office. Until last week, the main local director serving the NDB was Tito Mboweni of Goldman Sachs, a former Reserve Bank governor best remembered for maintaining extremely high interest rates. But then, in his own words, he was \"Fired, you might say!!\"\n\nInstead of a customary roll-over, Mboweni was replaced by the South African Treasury director general, Dondo Mogajane. He had served as a World Bank board member during the institution's controversy over a corrupt $3.75 billion loan - its largest ever - to South Africa for the world's largest new new coal-fired power plant, one hotly opposed by everyone from community and climate activists to Business Day newspaper and the centre-right opposition party.\n\nToday in South Africa, the NDB has had one customer: the corruption-riddled parastatal energy firm Eskom. Funding was allocated for renewable energy transmission connections to privatised solar and wind projects. Yet neither of the former Eskom leaders who negotiated the loans - Brian Molefe and Matshela Koko - desired renewable energy, favouring nuclear instead.\n\n\"Energy experts in South Africa believe the NDB is not happy with Eskom because it has earmarked a large chunk of the $180 million loan for projects not related to renewable energy,\" reported Peter Fabricius of the Institute for Security Studies recently. \"The highly controversial Molefe's indifference to renewable energy suggested to many that he had already signed up to Zuma's dubious nuclear project\" - whose cost is estimated at $100 billion - leaving \"great suspicion that Zuma has already promised the construction contract to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nThe day before the opening of the Johannesburg branch, NDB chief executive KV Kamath revealed that his loan to Eskom was actually \"in abeyance\" at Pretoria's request. However, he mandated his staff to generate another $1.5 billion in South African loans by 2019. (In its first year of operation, the NDB built a $1.4 billion loan portfolio from the other four countries.)\n\nCan South Africa afford NDB credit? The real interest rate on the dollar-denominated loans depends upon currency devaluation: South Africa's crashed from R6.3/$ in 2011 to R13.4/$ today. As Kamath admitted to Russia Today last month, \"The effective costs of borrowing in hard currencies, for any of us developing countries, appears low. It appears to be 2 to 2.5%. But when you add the exchange loss, the weakening of the currency over time, you end up paying 12, 13, 14%. So that's your true cost.\" (South Africa pays an 8.6% interest rate on international 10-year state bonds, one of the highest amongst 50 major countries tracked by The Economist, this week lower only than Venezuela, Turkey and Brazil.)\n\nKamath has committed to future lending in Chinese renminbi, Indian rupees, Brazilian reals, and Russian rubles, and while now including South African rands as a potential currency, the NDB's Eskom lending would have financed locally-sourced materials such as steel and cables (and local labour) for the electricity grid extension. Any such further NDB dollar loan offers make no sense.\n\nWatchdogging from below\n\nThe characteristics of these loans are difficult to track because the NDB is a relatively opaque institution, critics in civil society complain. The Delhi-based People's Forum on BRICS considered the NDB's role less than five months ago, concluding it is 'no different' from the World Bank or Asian Development Bank: \"it is promoting a business as usual model, rather than striking a dramatically new path for people-centered development.\"\n\nAccording to the Forum, \"Dam building is also being promoted under the [NDB's] renewable sector, though it is speciously claimed that what is supported is merely small dams. As is widely evident from the brutal experience of the people of Uttarkhand due to flash flooding of Bhaghirathi river in 2013, so-called 'run of the river' 'small hydro' projects can have devastating impacts equivalent to those of large dams.\n\nIn terms of process, \"The prevailing policies to review the due-diligence of projects from their economic, ecological and social impacts viewpoints is weak... Nothing in the Bank's approach thus far provides any comfort of believing that the NDB is out to support the needs of pastoral and agrarian communities, of working classes, and the poor... NDB is aggressively promoting privatisation of public services, which has been globally experienced as the most effective way to attack the poor and the working classes.\"\n\nAs the Peoples Forum also reminded, \"democracy is under threat in BRICS countries and beyond; state repression is rising in every BRICS nation; and ecological destruction is widespread in every BRICS country. In the context of a world economy teetering on the brink of a financial meltdown, and new generation of Bilateral Trade and Investment Treaties which are designed to adversely impacts on lives and livelihoods of ordinary peoples across the BRICS countries, the Forum felt that there absolutely does not seem to be the necessary deep concern in the NDB to revise its strategies... Promoting finance for such a divisive and inhuman world order is a crime against humanity and nature.\"\n\nMeanwhile in subsequent months, most of the BRICS countries have witnessed sustained protests, many against corruption, environmental destruction and labour abuse. For example, last week during a hunger strike against further mega-dam construction on the Narmada River, Peoples Forum on BRICS co-founder Medha Patkar was arrested on a framed kidnapping charge and denied bail.\n\nBRICS breaking?\n\nEarly next month, the BRICS heads of state will gather in Xiamen, China for their annual summit. Several important developments since the 2016 summit in Goa - when Narendra Modi notoriously failed to have China and Russia declare Pakistan a \"terrorist state\" - leave the BRICS more fragile than ever:\n\n* India-China border disputes - potentially war - are unfolding in Bhutan and Pakistani-held Kashmir, leading Modi to boycott Xi's huge Belt & Road summit held in May;\n\n* chaos reigns in BRICS-US relations, especially given the creepy warmth between Modi and US President Donald Trump, Putin's alleged interference in the last US election (mimicking what Washington has done countless times), and Trump's erratic 'diplomacy' with Xi Jinping based on trying to halt North Korean nuclear weapons one day and preparing to impose trade restrictions the next;\n\n* at a time of rising US protectionism, Xi has become the most enthusiastic promoter of world capitalism, to the applause of neoliberals (like London School of Economics researcher Andrew Hammond) who appreciate how \"China has championed the benefits of market liberalization\" - but at a time South African steel production is collapsing due mainly to ultra-cheap Chinese imports, in spite of last month's 'too little too late' 12% tariff protection from Pretoria (and likewise South Africa's chicken industry remains in crisis due partly to Brazilian dumping), while India last month also imposed anti-dumping tariffs against Chinese and South African stainless steel;\n\n* Brazil's ongoing corruption scandal features repeated revelations of Michel Temer's misdeeds; and\n\n* South Africa's chaotic leadership (Zuma barely survived a parliamentary 'No Confidence' vote last week), recent series junk credit ratings and the ongoing recession and worsening unemployment crisis together leave its influence much reduced.\n\nAfter the bumpy ride across the broken BRICS in 2017, South Africa will host the bloc in 2018 - unless perhaps Zuma decides health is more important than wealth.", "id": "9856518",

To the extent that may also assist in the environment of a ratings downgrade we would appreciate but we are not looking at the Regional Centre as a way of evading a ratings downgrade,\" said Minister Gigaba in response to a question from media.\n\nMinister Gigaba said the process of establishing the ARC has been in the making for many years.\n\n\"We did not rush this process, what we have done now is to expedite the process since April 2017 so that we are on par with other founding members of BRICS,\" said the Minister.\n\nMinister Gigaba also welcomed NDB President Kundapur Kamath's comment earlier in the day that the bank -- which is a multilateral development bank -- will issue rand denominated loans.\n\n\"We quite appreciate the commitment by the bank to issue rand denominated loans because it will assist a great deal in terms of the structure and quality of our debt and our ability to meet our debt requirements. We need to address structural weaknesses in the economy,\" said Minister Gigaba.\n\nIn his comments to the official launch of the ARC earlier in the day, Kamath said the ARC will be the face of the NDB in Africa. The objective of the New Development Bank is to finance infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other emerging economies.\n\nProject identification and loan book\n\nThe bank, which started operations in July 2015, had by the end of 2016 approved seven projects in area of sustainable infrastructure totalling US dollars 1.5 billion to all member countries.\n\nIn 2017, the bank said Kamath expects to approve loans aggregating US dollars between 2.5 billion and 3 billion for about ten projects.\n\n\"In 2018 we expect to present with total lending of about 4 billion. The target is to end 2018 with a loan book of about 8 billion for projects,\" said Kamath, adding that the bank wants to identify a strong project pipeline it can support.\n\nKamath further added that the bank expects the ARC to play a major role in project identification.\n\nWorking with the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission (PICC) South Africa is in the process of finalising its project pipeline.\n\n\"We are hoping that we should by the time we go to the BRICS Summit [to be held in China in September] have developed a semblance of the project pipeline that we will finalise and start accepting funding, loans from the bank. The 1.5 billion dollars more or less that has been promised by the bank as the President of the NDB was saying will go a long way towards assisting us to strengthen the balance sheets of state owned companies in order to implement critical infrastructure in the areas we agreed to,\" said Minister Gigaba.\n\nMinister Gigaba said government is working closely with the bank in terms of ensuring that the projects are bankable.\n\n\"They are critical projects in terms of our priorities. In so doing we would also assist the South African economy because at the present moment an environment of slow growth and high unemployment we do need infrastructure investments in order to reignite growth in the economy to get employment,\" said the Minister.\n\nMembership\n\nMeanwhile, the NDB's founding documents makes provision that the bank would be open to new members other than the current BRICS members.\n\nNDB Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Leslie Maasdorp said that it was part of the bank's vision that it grows beyond the five BRICS countries.\n\n\"The articles of the bank make provision that the new membership of the bank will be comprised of three categories - firstly the BRICS countries will dilute the shareholding to a minimum of 55% at some moment in the future. A further 25% will be set aside to developing countries in that way 50% of the bank will always in the future be controlled by emerging markets. That underscores the narrative stated by President Zuma and President Kamath that this bank is the voice of emerging markets within the multilateral space. The final 20% will be set aside for advanced industrialised countries,\" said Maasdorp.\n\nHowever, the bank is not yet able to admit new members.\n\n\"There's no application process where a member can apply to join tomorrow. The detailed process is still being defined, the essential key point is that it will be dominated by emerging markets, African countries,\" said the CFO.\n\nRating of the bank\n\nOne of the key aspects of multilateral banks that makes them unique is that they are very highly rated. The NDB -- of which its headquarters are in Shanghai, China -- has a AAA rating in Chinese capital markets.\n\n\"The bank is in the process to obtain an international rating, that is an ongoing process. We have started our engagements. The rating is important in that it allows the bank to raise funding in the debt market at a cheaper rate that allows us to lend. The bank is rated now but only in China and we are in the process of obtaining an international rating,\" said Maasdorp.\n\nEarlier in the day President Zuma preceded over the launch of the ARC. - SAnews.gov.za", "id": "9728031", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Regional Centre to help SA's infrastructure objectives", "image": null, "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 855, "date": "2017-04-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 865}, {"textStart": 1780, "date": "2015-07-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1789}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "247", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Sandton"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 4, "id": "45587", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandton", "label": {"eng": "Sandton"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Shi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 1, "id": "64265", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Shi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}, "id": "302736", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar"}, {"label": {"eng": "Economy"}, "id": "303018", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bank"}, "id": "303134", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank"}, {"label": {"eng": "Developed country"}, "id": "303178", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "303539", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infrastructure"}, "id": "303871", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jacob Zuma"}, "id": "304313", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma"}, {"label": {"eng": "Loan"}, "id": "304611", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan"}, {"label": {"eng": "Debt"}, "id": "304719", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt"}, {"label": {"eng": "Finance"}, "id": "307019", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emerging markets"}, "id": "308701", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_markets"}, {"label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "id": "308702", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sustainable development"}, "id": "308718", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}, "id": "309796", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"}, {"label": {"eng": "South African rand"}, "id": "317455", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_rand"}, {"label": {"eng": "BRICS"}, "id": "323264", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malusi Gigaba"}, "id": "345788", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malusi_Gigaba"}, {"label": {"eng": "Non-directional beacon"}, "id": "390332", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-directional_beacon"}, {"label": {"eng": "International financial institutions"}, "id": "391202", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_financial_institutions"}, {"label": {"eng": "Economy of South Africa"}, "id": "445173", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_South_Africa"}, {"label": {"eng": "New Development Bank"}, "id": "1215302", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Development_Bank"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 489, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies"}], "time": "16:02:00"}

He offered no proof for the startling claim, which dates to his illness during a mid-2014 US trip. But his wife Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma was initially blamed, then banished from his notorious Nkandla palace by Zuma's security minister David Mahlobo in early 2015, and subsequently charged with attempted murder.\n\nIs this new narrative plausible, given the celebratory role BRICS have played in world capitalism? Recall the bloc's initial 2001 rationale offered by Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O'Neill: \"It seems quite clear that the current G7 needs to be upgraded and room made for the BRICs in order to allow more effective global policymaking.\" Last year, just after Goldman Sachs had closed its main BRIC investment fund due to poor performance, O'Neill asked, \"How on earth can South Africa be economically in the same class?\" However, he conceded, \"Politically, it is very important that South Africa is part of BRICS.\"\n\nTalk left\n\nThat's the opposite impression that Zuma is communicating about the views of Western multinational corporations and governments. According to Zuma's complaint to another ANC Cadres' Forum audience last November, Westerners \"want to dismantle this BRICS. We have had seven votes of no confidence in South Africa. In Brazil, the president was removed.\"\n\nSuch paranoia is regularly expressed in ANC circuits, including during an SAfm radio debate last week with National Union of Mineworkers deputy president Joseph Montisetsi. He remarked quite justifiably on multinational corporate mining houses' exploitation of workers, their illicit financial flows (capital flight) and their lack of reinvestment. But then Montisetsi claimed these firms aim \"to stop the South African community because of their choice of politics. These things are done everywhere, especially in BRICS countries - those countries that want an alternative kind of government which will have a kind of a bank which is contrary to World Bank and International Monetary Fund\" (IMF).\n\nIn reality, the NDB has a strong relationship with the World Bank, cemented by last September's Memo of Understanding. The NDB's 2017-21 Strategy document commits \"to undertake joint projects and knowledge exchanges with the World Bank... to make the most of their decades of experience.\"\n\nLikewise, the BRICS' $100 billion Contingent Reserve Arrangement strengthens the IMF by insisting that once a borrower takes 30% of its quota (e.g. $3 billion for South Africa), then before it can access the next 70% it must first get an IMF structural adjustment programme. South Africa's foreign debt exceeds $143 billion - nearly 50% of GDP, a modern local record - and has left various commentators either advocating or opposing IMF lending and advice in recent days.\n\nWalk right\n\nBut aren't the BRICS making the IMF fairer? Four gained voting power increases in a December 2015 restructuring - China (up 37%), Brazil (23%), India (11%) and Russia (8%) - but only as a result of eight African countries (including South Africa and Nigeria) losing between 21-41% of their IMF votes. When last December IMF managing director Christine Lagarde was convicted of criminal negligence for gifting a party supporter $430 million when she was French Finance Minister, BRICS directors joined a unanimous 'full confidence' IMF endorsement.\n\nIn spite of occasional case-specific denials, especially about Greece (where Lagarde clashed with anti-austerity finance minister Yanis Varoufakis in 2015), the IMF maintains its murderous neoliberal orientation. Last month's fib by Lagarde, that the IMF has 'typically protected' health and education spending in poor countries (from 1988-2014) was quickly rebutted by Thomas Stubbs of Cambridge and Alexander Kentikelenis of Oxford: \"the IMF's assessment is methodologically flawed, and the organisation remains disconnected from the global political zeitgeist on universal social protection.\" Their May 2017 study of 2.8 billion IMF victims in 67 countries published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences confirmed that IMF austerity regimes substantially \"reduce the protective effect of parental education on child health, especially in rural areas.\"\n\nA well-publicised 2016 confession of how the IMF 'oversold' neoliberal medicine offered by three of its economists faced a quick internal backlash, according to Oxfam's Max Lawson: \"Any chance of the IMF sponsoring a sensible debate of the pros and cons of neoliberalism now seems extremely unlikely.\" In all of this, BRICS' directors are Lagarde's sub-imperialist allies.\n\nA neoliberal NDB\n\nPart of the problem lies in the orientation of local personnel who occupy these posts. The NDB African Regional Centre's new director general was not yet announced at the time of writing, but the job is a hot potato. It was the fig-leaf excuse Zuma gave in December 2015 for firing pro-business Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene, who then spurned the supposed offer. In his final budget, Nene made cuts to the real value of already-tokenistic social grants to poor South Africans, while generously increasing the amount rich South Africans (mostly white) could take offshore (from $300 000 to $750 000) during yet another exchange control deregulation.\n\nThe South African chosen as NDB Vice President, Leslie Maasdorp, previously worked at Goldman Sachs, Barclays and Bank of America - as well as leading Pretoria's internal privatisation office. Until last week, the main local director serving the NDB was Tito Mboweni of Goldman Sachs, a former Reserve Bank governor best remembered for maintaining extremely high interest rates. But then, in his own words, he was \"Fired, you might say!!\"\n\nInstead of a customary roll-over, Mboweni was replaced by the South African Treasury director general, Dondo Mogajane. He had served as a World Bank board member during the institution's controversy over a corrupt $3.75 billion loan - its largest ever - to South Africa for the world's largest new new coal-fired power plant, one hotly opposed by everyone from community and climate activists to Business Day newspaper and the centre-right opposition party.\n\nToday in South Africa, the NDB has had one customer: the corruption-riddled parastatal energy firm Eskom. Funding was allocated for renewable energy transmission connections to privatised solar and wind projects. Yet neither of the former Eskom leaders who negotiated the loans - Brian Molefe and Matshela Koko - desired renewable energy, favouring nuclear instead.\n\n\"Energy experts in South Africa believe the NDB is not happy with Eskom because it has earmarked a large chunk of the $180 million loan for projects not related to renewable energy,\" reported Peter Fabricius of the Institute for Security Studies recently. \"The highly controversial Molefe's indifference to renewable energy suggested to many that he had already signed up to Zuma's dubious nuclear project\" - whose cost is estimated at $100 billion - leaving \"great suspicion that Zuma has already promised the construction contract to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nThe day before the opening of the Johannesburg branch, NDB chief executive KV Kamath revealed that his loan to Eskom was actually \"in abeyance\" at Pretoria's request. However, he mandated his staff to generate another $1.5 billion in South African loans by 2019. (In its first year of operation, the NDB built a $1.4 billion loan portfolio from the other four countries.)\n\nCan South Africa afford NDB credit? The real interest rate on the dollar-denominated loans depends upon currency devaluation: South Africa's crashed from R6.3/$ in 2011 to R13.4/$ today. As Kamath admitted to Russia Today last month, \"The effective costs of borrowing in hard currencies, for any of us developing countries, appears low. It appears to be 2 to 2.5%. But when you add the exchange loss, the weakening of the currency over time, you end up paying 12, 13, 14%. So that's your true cost.\" (South Africa pays an 8.6% interest rate on international 10-year state bonds, one of the highest amongst 50 major countries tracked by The Economist, this week lower only than Venezuela, Turkey and Brazil.)\n\nKamath has committed to future lending in Chinese renminbi, Indian rupees, Brazilian reals, and Russian rubles, and while now including South African rands as a potential currency, the NDB's Eskom lending would have financed locally-sourced materials such as steel and cables (and local labour) for the electricity grid extension. Any such further NDB dollar loan offers make no sense.\n\nWatchdogging from below\n\nThe characteristics of these loans are difficult to track because the NDB is a relatively opaque institution, critics in civil society complain. The Delhi-based People's Forum on BRICS considered the NDB's role less than five months ago, concluding it is 'no different' from the World Bank or Asian Development Bank: \"it is promoting a business as usual model, rather than striking a dramatically new path for people-centered development.\"\n\nAccording to the Forum, \"Dam building is also being promoted under the [NDB's] renewable sector, though it is speciously claimed that what is supported is merely small dams. As is widely evident from the brutal experience of the people of Uttarkhand due to flash flooding of Bhaghirathi river in 2013, so-called 'run of the river' 'small hydro' projects can have devastating impacts equivalent to those of large dams.\n\nIn terms of process, \"The prevailing policies to review the due-diligence of projects from their economic, ecological and social impacts viewpoints is weak... Nothing in the Bank's approach thus far provides any comfort of believing that the NDB is out to support the needs of pastoral and agrarian communities, of working classes, and the poor... NDB is aggressively promoting privatisation of public services, which has been globally experienced as the most effective way to attack the poor and the working classes.\"\n\nAs the Peoples Forum also reminded, \"democracy is under threat in BRICS countries and beyond; state repression is rising in every BRICS nation; and ecological destruction is widespread in every BRICS country. In the context of a world economy teetering on the brink of a financial meltdown, and new generation of Bilateral Trade and Investment Treaties which are designed to adversely impacts on lives and livelihoods of ordinary peoples across the BRICS countries, the Forum felt that there absolutely does not seem to be the necessary deep concern in the NDB to revise its strategies... Promoting finance for such a divisive and inhuman world order is a crime against humanity and nature.\"\n\nMeanwhile in subsequent months, most of the BRICS countries have witnessed sustained protests, many against corruption, environmental destruction and labour abuse. For example, last week during a hunger strike against further mega-dam construction on the Narmada River, Peoples Forum on BRICS co-founder Medha Patkar was arrested on a framed kidnapping charge and denied bail.\n\nBRICS breaking?\n\nEarly next month, the BRICS heads of state will gather in Xiamen, China for their annual summit. Several important developments since the 2016 summit in Goa - when Narendra Modi notoriously failed to have China and Russia declare Pakistan a \"terrorist state\" - leave the BRICS more fragile than ever:\n\n* South Africa's chaotic leadership (Zuma barely survived a parliamentary 'No Confidence' vote last week), recent series junk credit ratings and the ongoing recession and worsening unemployment crisis together leave its influence much reduced.\n\nAfter the bumpy ride across the broken BRICS in 2017, South Africa will host the bloc in 2018 - unless perhaps Zuma decides health is more important than wealth.", "id": "9760953", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Falling BRICS endanger their citizens' health, starting with South Africa's Jacob Zuma", "image":

The bank aims to address these challenges by accelerating infrastructure investment in energy, transport and other productive sectors.\n\nThe President was joined by other Cabinet ministers and NDB executives including NDB President Kundapur Vaman Kamath.\n\nThe Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) countries signed an agreement which established the NDB at the sixth Brics Summit in July 2014. The NDB headquarters is in Shanghai, China and was opened in February 2016.\n\nThe bank will focus on funding sustainable development and infrastructure in member nations as well as other emerging and other developing countries.\n\nDuring his address, Zuma highlighted the challenges African countries were facing due to their under-industrialisation. He said that Africa was not sleeping when this happened but this was imposed on the continent.\n\nHe lauded the bank's approach of making loans available to member countries in their local currency. Kamath explained that loans will be extended to member countries in local currency to avoid exchange rate risk.\n\n\"Reducing the exchange rate risk can enable infrastructure projects to be financed more sustainably.\" This will also reduce the cost of borrowing.\n\n\"We have an appetite to do $1.5bn lending to South Africa in the next 18 months,\" said Kamath.\n\nIn 2016 the bank approved seven projects in the area of sustainable infrastructure, worth $1.5bn. In 2017 loans are expected to be approved for 10 projects worth between $2.5bn and $3bn and in 2018, the bank expects to approve loans for 15 to 20 projects worth $4bn. The target for the end of 2018 is to have a total loan book of $8bn. The ARC will play a major role in identifying and preparing projects, explained Kamath.\n\nThe bank also intends to begin private sector operations in 2018 and will explore investment through public-private partnership programmes. So far the bank has recruited 100 staff from member countries, and 150 staff are expected to be appointed by the end of the year and 220 in 2018, said Kamath.\n\nCapital contributions\n\nThe bank has received total capital contributions of $2.6bn from its member countries. A further $900m is expected in January 2018.\n\nThe bank expects to raise additional funding of between $2bn and $2.5bn through bonds between now and 2018. So far $450m has been raised through China's financial markets. Kamath said South Africa's market also offers attractive opportunities in raising funds.\n\nVice President and Chief Financial Officer Leslie Maasdorp explained that the bank would explore the option of local currency funding. According to the bank's five-year strategy document it has a prescribed capital base of $50bn. Of this, $10bn is paid-in capital contributed by founding members, every seven years. The remaining $40bn is comprised of callable capital.\n\nWith the capital raised in bond markets, interest rates are charged on loans made for the bank to earn a return. \"Most of the loans made in the past have been in US dollars... It was a challenge many borrowers faced because when your currency depreciates the loan becomes more expensive,\" said Maasdorp.\n\nAs was done in China, the ARC will consider raising funds in South African bonds and then lend this in South African rand for development projects in the country.\n\nInternational rating\n\nThe bank is currently in a process to obtain an international rating. The NDB has an AAA rating in the domestic Chinese markets, said Maasdorp.\n\n\"In 2016, less than a year of opening offices it obtained a rating from two of the largest ratings agencies in China which allowed the bank to issue a bond which was AAA rated in China's local markets,\" he said.\n\n\"The rating is important. It allows the bank to raise funding at a cheaper rate and allows them to lend at comparative rates,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking to journalists ahead of the event, Finance Minister Malusi Gigaga said the bank would support development across the African continent. \"We are quite excited about this development, it means that after the opening today we are ready to start operating.\n\n\"And in the near future, as the NDB accepts new members it will be in a position to provide loans for infrastructure funding to other African countries that will join as members,\" he said.\n\nNational Treasury Director General Dondo Mogajane was recently appointed to the board after former Reserve Bank Governor Tito Mboweni's term came to an end.\n\nSUBSCRIBE FOR FREE UPDATE: Get Fin24's top morning

We are thus celebrating it as a shared achievement.\n\nThe idea of establishing a new Bank with a new mission and orientation was first discussed in Durban in 2013, when we had the honour of hosting the BRICS forum.\n\nWe later agreed to establish a centre in Africa to take care of the important developmental needs of this continent.\n\nThe launch of the Africa Regional Centre is testament to our commitment that BRICS and the New Development Bank should benefit not only BRICS countries, but should also benefit the whole of Africa and the developing world as a whole.\n\nThis is therefore truly a proud moment which points to a brighter future for the people of our continent and the developing world in general.\n\nProgramme Director,\n\nIn the two years of the Bank's existence, I have been most pleased at the progress made.\n\nNotable achievement in this regard includes the signing the founding agreement of the New Development Bank, which paved the way for the opening of the Bank's head office in Shanghai, China. The issuance of the first set of loans - amounting to 1,5 billion dollars (approximately 20 billion rands) in total - to fund renewable energy projects in member countries is a significant step forward.\n\nThe Bank's very first green bond issuance in the Chinese capital market, mobilising about 450 million dollars in the process is also noteworthy.\n\nAnd most recently, the approval of a general strategy that will guide the Bank's operations in the next five years demonstrates that we are on the right path.\n\nToday we gather to celebrate yet another milestone, the launch of the Africa Regional Centre. I wish to thank The New Development Bank President, Mr Kamath and his team for the excellent work over the years, which has brought us to this momentous occasion.\n\nWe are confident that the Bank will build on these achievements and grow from strength to strength.\n\nNext, the Bank will start the process to consider new members and finalise the project pipeline for the second batch of loans to be offered in the 2017/2018 financial year. We wish the Bank well in these endeavors.\n\nThe biggest challenge is that Africa remains largely un-industrialized with the result that our economies are over exposed to the whims of commodities' markets.\n\nAfrican countries generally do not have adequate infrastructure interconnections. As a result, we cannot maximize the benefits of regional trade. Worse still, the continent does not have adequate social infrastructure for the provision of basic services such as health and education, and we therefore are not able to significantly improve the living standards of our people.\n\nIndeed, due to this infrastructure gap, Africa has been unable to unlock its growth potential, and bring prosperity to her people.\n\nGiven these challenges, the African continent has great expectations for the New Development Bank.\n\nWe expect that the Bank, through the Africa Regional Centre, will contribute to accelerating infrastructure investment in energy, transport, water and other productive sectors.\n\nSouth Africa, since its joining of BRICS in 2011, has advocated for inclusivity of the Global South, especially the African continent.\n\nWe are therefore happy to know that the Bank is working on expanding its membership to other countries beyond BRICS. We certainly trust that African countries will be among the first to take up membership at the New Development Bank.\n\nLadies and gentlemen,\n\nSeventy years after the end of the Second World War, the world continues to be plagued by the endemic problems of poverty and human suffering, more so in the African continent. The recent bout of violence and military confrontation in some countries in the Middle East and Africa has notably exacerbated this problem.\n\nThese tragic realities highlight the need for new and sustainable solutions. We therefore call on the New Development Bank and like-minded institutions to test new boundaries, explore new possibilities and deliver sustainable solutions that will better serve humanity.\n\nI am encouraged by the recent announcement made at the Second Annual Meeting of the New Development Bank Board of Governors in New Delhi to increase the Bank's lending to 2,5 billion dollars in the 2017/2018 financial year. This announcement has come at an opportune time for South Africa as we need more projects.\n\nWe have great expectations for this regional office.\n\nWe would like to see an office that is geared towards fulfilling the New Development Bank's founding objectives. These are to foster the development of member countries, support economic growth, promote and facilitate job creation and to build a knowledge sharing platform among developing countries.\n\nThe regional office will have to extend its core focus beyond project identification and preparation if it wants to truly realise these objectives. The office should in time be given the autonomy to extend loans to qualifying countries in the continent, whilst also serving as a node for capacity building and knowledge sharing.\n\nHowever, the Bank is still in its infancy stage and understandably, such an expansion would be carried out in phases.\n\nDistinguished guests,\n\nIt is fitting that we celebrate this launch in the same year that we celebrate the centenary of one of our founding fathers, Isithalandwe Oliver Reginald Tambo.\n\nThis giant of our liberation struggle envisioned an Africa that was at peace with itself and the world. He also envisaged one in which all its citizens enjoyed unlimited economic prosperity through cooperation and shared ideas.\n\nThe launch of the New Development Bank's first regional office is a major step towards the realisation of OR Tambo's vision for our country and indeed our continent.\n\nIndeed, this is a turning point for Africa and its development.\n\nThis new Bank will enable continued fruitful cooperation with our global partners which will help us promote sustainable development through integration, industrialisation and infrastructure development on the continent.\n\nThe launch takes place during the week in which we are hosting the 37th Southern African Development Community Heads of State and Government Summit in our country.\n\nThe Summit takes place under the theme: \"Partnering with the Private Sector in Developing Industry and Regional Value Chains\".\n\nSADC celebrates 25 years of existence this year and membership has grown to 15 countries. The combined population is about 300 million people.\n\nSouth Africa will assume the chair of SADC this week and projects such as the New Development Bank will be supported and promoted in earnest as part of advancing Africa's development agenda.\n\nMr Kamath, Ministers, distinguished guests,\n\nIt is my pleasure and honour to declare the Africa Regional Centre of the New Development Bank officially open for business!\n\nI thank you.", "id": "9675511", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "President Jacob Zuma: New Development Bank Africa Regional Centre lau...", "image": null, "extractedDates": null, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 4, "id": "247", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Durban"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "45903", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durban", "label": {"eng": "Durban"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Shi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "64265", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Shi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Renewable energy"}, "id": "303212", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy"}, {"location": null, "score": 5, "id": "303539", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "World War II"}, "id": "303819", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infrastructure"}, "id": "303871", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emerging markets"}, "id": "308701", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_markets"}, {"label": {"eng": "Developing country"}, "id": "308702", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"}, {"label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}, "id": "309796", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability"}, {"label": {"eng": "BRICS"}, "id": "323264", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS"}, {"label": {"eng": "Oliver Tambo"}, "id": "407366", "score": 2, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Tambo"}, {"label": {"eng": "New Development Bank"}, "id": "1215302", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Development_Bank"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services"}], "time": "11:32:00"}

Mboweni was replaced by National Treasury director-general, Dondo Mogajane.\n\nDeputy finance minister, Sfiso Buthelezi, also serves as the alternate governor of the bank for South Africa while deputy director-general for economic policy at the National Treasury, Monale Ratsoma, serves as alternate director of the National Development Bank for South Africa.", "id": "9761143", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Gigaba sidesteps questions about Nene's non-appointment to BRICS Bank", "image": "http://citizen.co.za/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2017/07/854fba79-2732-4189-bc41-d434d90e9812-389x259.jpg", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 1128, "date": "2015-12-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 1141}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "247", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "45798", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg", "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "India"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "52726", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Shi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "64265", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Shi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bank"}, "id": "303134", "score": 4, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank"}, {"location": null, "score": 3, "id": "303539", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infrastructure"}, "id": "303871", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "304311", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jacob Zuma"}, "id": "304313", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emerging markets"}, "id": "308701", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_markets"}, {"label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}, "id": "313554", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund"}, {"label": {"eng": "South African rand"}, "id": "317455", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_rand"}, {"label": {"eng": "BRICS"}, "id": "323264", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Bank Group"}, "id": "337572", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malusi Gigaba"}, "id": "345788", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malusi_Gigaba"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nhlanhla Nene"}, "id": "353313", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nhlanhla_Nene"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tito Mboweni"}, "id": "604274", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Mboweni"}, {"label": {"eng": "New Development Bank"}, "id": "1215302", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Development_Bank"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 489, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies"}], "time": "19:19:00"}

countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and SA) celebrated the launch of the African regional centre of the New Development Bank (NDB), South African taxpayers can expect to contribute $10bn over a seven-year period.The bank, which lends funds to its member countries exclusively for now, aims to contribute to the acceleration of infrastructure investment in energy, transport, water and other productive sectors.\n\nSA has already requested and received a R2.4bn loan from the bank for Eskom's renewable energy projects.\n\nHowever, the loan has since been temporarily halted over fears it would use the loan for activities not agreed to with the bank in its borrowing terms.\n\nThe loan made to Eskom in April 2016 was based on the assumption that the power utility would use the funding for transmission lines to connect 500MW of renewable energy from independent power producers to the national grid.\n\nEskom subsequently refused to sign new offtake agreements with renewable-energy projects in terms of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme, arguing they were not cost-effective.\n\nFinance Minister Malusi Gigaba said that SA was working on a \"project pipeline\" that would help to reinforce the balance sheet of state-owned companies in order to implement critical infrastructure in the areas that were agreed to with the NDB.\n\nState-owned enterprises such as South African Airways and Petro SA have been struggling with maladministration and wasteful expenditure, which have led to the financial instability of the institutions.\n\nGigaba hailed the NDB's presence in the region as a \"milestone\", saying it would ignite growth in the economy and lead to job creation in the process, focusing mainly on tackling youth unemployment.\n\n\"The $1.5bn that has been promised by the bank will go a long way towards assisting us to reinforce and in balancing the balance sheets of state-owned companies in order to be able to implement critical infrastructure in the areas that we agreed to,\" he said.\n\nThe bank's president, KV Kamath, said at the opening of the regional office in Johannesburg on Thursday that SA offered attractive opportunities for fundraising.\n\nHe said that the bank planned to raise more additional funding of $2.5bn between now and 2018, while also exploring the viability of currency bonds in member states.\n\n\"We believe that the SA market offers attractive opportunities for fundraising and in the appropriate time, we will work with authorities in SA to explore these opportunities in the country to ensure that we raise rand funds,\" said Kamath.\n\nThe NDB plans to have an authorised capital of $100bn,of which $50bn will be subscribed capital.\n\nSpeaking at the launch, President Jacob Zuma said the continent had \"great expectations\" for the NDB, listing Africa's challenges of integration, industrialisation and overexposed economies as some of the areas that could help unlock growth.\n\nLeslie Maasdorp, the vicepresident of the regional bank, agreed that one of the focus areas would be regional integration and connectivity.\n\nHe emphasised that the bank would also team up with other organisations such as the Development Bank of Southern Africa, which has similar mandates of infrastructure development.\n\n\"The challenges that Africa faces is that it is one continent with 53 countries and there is huge potential to connect these economies in a more dynamic way, he said.\n\n\"We will place emphasis on projects that enhance regional connectivity, strengthen the rail links, road and transport links and strengthen the power links between SA and the region,\" Maasdorp said.", "id": "9897664", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-18", "title": "Brics

Mboweni was replaced by National Treasury director-general Dondo Mogajane.\n\nDeputy Finance Minister Sfiso Buthelezi also serves as the alternate governor of the bank for South Africa.\n\nAfrican News Agency", "id": "9795776", "details": {}, "date": "2017-08-17", "title": "Gigaba silent on Nene controversy | IOL Cape Times", "image": "https://image.iol.co.za/image/1/process/620x349?source=https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/image/97249278.JPG", "extractedDates": [{"textStart": 744, "date": "2015-12-", "amb": false, "textEnd": 757}], "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "concepts": [{"location": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "47", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "country"}, "score": 2, "id": "247", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "Republic of South Africa"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 2, "id": "45798", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannesburg", "label": {"eng": "Johannesburg"}, "type": "loc"}, {"location": {"country": {"label": {"eng": "People's Republic of China"}, "type": "country"}, "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Shi"}, "type": "place"}, "score": 3, "id": "64265", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai", "label": {"eng": "Shanghai Shi"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Bank"}, "id": "303134", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank"}, {"label": {"eng": "Infrastructure"}, "id": "303871", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure"}, {"location": null, "score": 2, "id": "304311", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress", "label": {"eng": "African National Congress"}, "type": "loc"}, {"label": {"eng": "Jacob Zuma"}, "id": "304313", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Zuma"}, {"label": {"eng": "Emerging markets"}, "id": "308701", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_markets"}, {"label": {"eng": "International Monetary Fund"}, "id": "313554", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund"}, {"label": {"eng": "South African rand"}, "id": "317455", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African_rand"}, {"label": {"eng": "BRICS"}, "id": "323264", "score": 2, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS"}, {"label": {"eng": "Public\u2013private partnership"}, "id": "337554", "score": 3, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public\u2013private_partnership"}, {"label": {"eng": "World Bank Group"}, "id": "337572", "score": 2, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group"}, {"label": {"eng": "Malusi Gigaba"}, "id": "345788", "score": 4, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malusi_Gigaba"}, {"label": {"eng": "Nhlanhla Nene"}, "id": "353313", "score": 3, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nhlanhla_Nene"}, {"label": {"eng": "National Treasury (South Africa)"}, "id": "589155", "score": 4, "type": "org", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasury_(South_Africa)"}, {"label": {"eng": "Tito Mboweni"}, "id": "604274", "score": 1, "type": "person", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tito_Mboweni"}, {"label": {"eng": "New Development Bank"}, "id": "1215302", "score": 5, "type": "wiki", "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Development_Bank"}], "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "id": 324, "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 325, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services"}, {"wgt": 100, "id": 489, "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies"}], "time": "23:42:00"}

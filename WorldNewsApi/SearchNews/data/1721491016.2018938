According to new research* from Censuswide for Dobbies, 45% of Brits enjoy gardening because it gets them outdoors. This in-store experience at Dobbies\u2019 Glasgow store encourages people to take inspiration from holidays in tropical climates bringing sunny vibes to their garden planting. Customers can now book the 90-minute event for Tuesday 16 or Saturday 20 July, at 3pm, which will combine the joy of hands-on creativity with the indulgence of a delicious Dobbies\u2019 Afternoon Tea. Attendees in Glasgow will get to participate in an interactive workshop led by one of Dobbies' horti experts with a Q&A and demo on the filler, thriller, and spiller planting technique, using a selection of tropical plants selected by RHS Chelsea Flower Show Chair of Assessors and Dobbies\u2019 Senior Buyer, Claire Bishop. With this knowledge, customers will then get the chance to create their own tropical planter (worth \u00a330) to take home, using a pot specially selected to showcase the seasonal display. Attendees will also get the chance to sit back, relax and enjoy a Traditional or Luxury Afternoon Tea at the Glasgow store. Guests can delve into three tiers of sweet and savoury treats, complemented by unlimited tea and coffee refills, with an option to upgrade the hot drink.

Sue\u00f1os was set to open its doors at noon. Lee Carlaw, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said rain and thunderstorms are expected throughout the western suburbs and Chicago until the early afternoon. \u201cWe are not expecting any severe weather out of this activity, maybe some small hail and gusty winds,\u201d Carlaw said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a little bit damp for any early morning Memorial Day Weekend festivities.\u201d Carlaw said that Chicagoans should expect to see a break in storm activity from 1 p.m. to around 4 p.m. He said the Weather Service is monitoring the potential for additional showers in the evening, but the rain will not be as widespread. Carlaw added the Weather Service will be in touch with Sue\u00f1os management and is supporting the festival from a weather standpoint. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly been a soggy start to the morning here, but it seems favorable we\u2019ll have a few hours this afternoon where things will dry out,\u201d Carlaw said.", "summary": "Sue\u00f1os, a two-day Latin music festival advised attendees not to head to the festival until further notice.", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/05/26/music-festival-delayed/", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/chicago-tribune-logo-basic.jpeg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:03:10", "author": "Avani Kalra", "authors": ["Avani Kalra"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.121}

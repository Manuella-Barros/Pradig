She was found April 23.\n\nMidland, best known as the global home of Dow Inc., is 130 miles (209 kilometers) north of Detroit.\n\nThe Family Fare store is in a retail strip with a triangle-shaped sign at the top of the building. The sign structure, probably 5 feet (1.5 meter) wide and 8 feet (2.4 meters) high, has a door and is accessible from the roof, Warren said.\n\n\"There was some flooring that was laid down. A mini desk,\" he said. \"Her clothing. A Keurig coffee maker. A printer and a computer -- things you'd have in your home.\"\n\nThe woman was able to get electricity through a power cord plugged into an outlet on the roof, Warren said.\n\nThere was no sign of a ladder. Warren said it's possible the woman made her way to the roof by climbing up elsewhere behind the store or other retail businesses.\n\n\"I honestly don't know how she was getting up there.

the Family Fare Supermarket in Midland, MI, were shocked to find an extension cord leading to the secret living space on April 23.\n\nWhen they made their way into the space, the workers were met with a fully decked-out living area furnished with a mini desk, flooring, a pantry of food and a houseplant.\n\n\"They were like 'OMG, someone is living in that sign,'\" Midland Police Department Public Relations Officer Brennon Warren told Midland Daily News.\n\nPolice officers were eventually called in to remove the woman, 34, telling her she needed to find somewhere else to live.\n\nIt wasn't clear how the woman got to the rooftop dwelling in the first place, nor how she eluded being caught for the supposed year she lived there.\n\nThe officers offered the unconventional squatter several resources including housing assistance, which she denied all help.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this before in my career,\" Warren added. \"She made it home\"\n\nShe did not work for the supermarket but did have a job, according to the newspaper.\n\nPolice also believe she had access to a car.\n\nShe was trespassed from the store, but management agreed to remove the furniture from the roof and return it to the woman.\n\nFamily Fare operates nearly 100 stores in seven states in the Midwest as the majority is located in Michigan, but also ranges from North and South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Minnesota and Wisconsin.\n\nNo criminal charges have been filed.\n\nLast month one of Gordon Ramsay's London $16.1 million restaurants was taken over by \"professional squatters\" as the celebrity chef was finalizing a deal with new owners.\n\nMembers of the Camden Art Cafe, a self-described \"autonomous cafe in the heart of Camden,\" had occupied the York & Albany gastropub in a form of protest for the \"victims of gentrification\" and the country's high-speed railway, H2S.\n\nA court eventually ordered the group to leave while the remaining squatters stood their ground until locksmiths and bailiffs rushed the building on April 22, according to The Standard.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

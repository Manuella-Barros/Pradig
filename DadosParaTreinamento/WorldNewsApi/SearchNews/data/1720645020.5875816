He&#8217;s 100, she&#8217;s 96", "text": "CARENTAN-LES-MARAIS, France \u2014 Together, the collective age of the bride and groom was nearly 200. But World War II veteran Harold Terens and his sweetheart Jeanne Swerlin proved that love is eternal as they tied the knot Saturday inland of the D-Day beaches in Normandy, France. Their respective ages \u2013 he\u2019s 100, she\u2019s a youngster of just 96 \u2013 made their nuptials an almost double-century celebration. Terens called it \"the best day of my life.\" On her way into the nuptials, the bubbly bride-to-be said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just for young people, love, you know? We get butterflies. And we get a little action, also.\" The location was the elegant stone-worked town hall of Carentan, a key initial D-Day objective that saw ferocious fighting after the June 6, 1944, Allied landings that helped rid Europe of Adolf Hitler\u2019s tyranny. Like other towns and villages across the Normandy coast where nearly 160,000 Allied troops came ashore under fire on five code-named beaches, it\u2019s an effervescent hub of remembrance and celebration on the 80th anniversary of the deeds and sacrifices of young men and women that day, festooned with flags and bunting and with veterans feted like rockstars. As the swing of Glenn Miller and other period tunes rang out on the streets, well-wishers \u2013 some in WWII-period clothes \u2013 were already lined up a good hour before the wedding, behind barriers outside the town hall, with a rousing pipe and drum band also on hand to serenade the happy couple. After both declaring \u201coui\u201d to vows read by Carentan\u2019s mayor in English, the couple exchanged rings. \u201cWith this ring, I thee wed,\u201d Terens said. She giggled and gasped, \u201cReally?\u201d With Champagne flutes in hand, they waved through an open window to the adoring crowds outside. \u201cTo everybody\u2019s good health. And to peace in the world and the preservation of democracy all over the world and the end of the war in Ukraine and Gaza,\u201d Terens said as he and his bride then clinked glasses and drank. The crowd yelled \u201cla mari\u00e9e!\u201d \u2013 the bride! \u2013 to Swerlin, who wore a long flowing dress of vibrant pink. Terens looked dapper in a light blue suit and matching pink kerchief in his breast pocket. And they\u2019re promised a very special wedding-night party: They were invited to the state dinner at the Elysee Palace on Saturday night with President Emmanuel Macron and President Biden, the mayor said. The wedding was symbolic, not binding in law. Mayor Jean-Pierre Lhonneur\u2019s office said he wasn\u2019t empowered to wed foreigners who aren\u2019t residents of Carentan, and that the couple, who are both American, hadn\u2019t requested legally binding vows. However, they could always complete those formalities back in Florida if they wished. Lhonneur likes to say that Normandy is practically the 51st state of the USA, given its reverence and gratitude for Allied soldiers and the sacrifices of tens of thousands who never made it home from the Battle of Normandy. \u201cLove is eternal, yes, maybe,\u201d the mayor said, referring to the newlyweds, although his comments also fittingly describe the feelings of many Normans for veterans. \u201cI hope for them the best happiness together.\u201d Dressed in a 1940s dress that belonged to her mother, Louise, and a red beret, 73-year-old Jane Ollier was among spectators who waited for a glimpse of the lovebirds. The couple, both widowed, grew up in New York City: she in Brooklyn, he in the Bronx. \u201cIt\u2019s so touching to get married at that age,\u201d Ollier said. \u201cIf it can bring them happiness in the last years of their lives, that\u2019s fantastic.\u201d The WWII veteran first visited France as a 20-year-old U.S. Army Air Forces corporal shortly after D-Day. Terens enlisted in 1942 and, after shipping to Britain, was attached to a four-pilot P-47 Thunderbolt fighter unit as their radio repair technician. On D-Day, Terens helped repair planes returning from France so they could rejoin the battle. He said half his company\u2019s pilots died that day. Terens himself went to France 12 days later, helping transport freshly captured Germans and just-freed American POWs to England. Following the Nazi surrender in May 1945, Terens again helped transport freed Allied prisoners to England before he shipped back to the U.S. a month later. Swerlin made it abundantly clear that her new centenarian husband doesn\u2019t lack for rizz. \u201cHe\u2019s the greatest kisser ever, you know?\u201d she proudly declared before they embraced enthusiastically for TV cameras. \u201cAll right ! That\u2019s it for now !\u201d Terens said as he came up for air. To which she quickly quipped: \u201cYou mean there\u2019s more later?\u201d Associated Press journalist Terry Spencer in Fort Lauderdale contributed to this report. \u00ab Previous", "summary": "The location was the elegant stone-worked town hall of Carentan, a key initial D-Day objective that saw ferocious fighting after the June 6, 1944,", "url": "https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/06/08/world-war-ii-veteran-just-married-his-bride-near-normandys-d-day-beaches-hes-100-shes-96/", "image": "https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/D-Day_80th_Anniversary_Wedding_56951_b4dea1-1717862512.jpg?w=1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:03:14", "author": "John Leicester,JOHN LEICESTER - Associated Press", "authors": ["John Leicester", "JOHN LEICESTER - Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.739}

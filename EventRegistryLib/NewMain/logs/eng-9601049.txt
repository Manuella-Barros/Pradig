LOUIS -- Paul Goldschmidt homered twice and Sonny Gray tossed five scoreless innings Sunday night to help the St. Louis Cardinals beat the Chicago Cubs 4-3 in game delayed more than 2\u00bd hours at the start by rain.\n\nSt. Louis has won five in a row for the first time since winning six straight from July 15-20, 2023, and has won 10 of its past 12.\n\n\"It was a good team effort,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"The bottom line, guys are stepping up and contributing. Different guys are coming in and doing their jobs. It's coming together very well from all sides of the game. Baserunning, defense, pitching and hitting, it's coming together, and it's led to some wins.\"\n\nAfter the game started at 8:43 p.m. following a 2-hour, 33-minute rain delay, Gray (7-2) had another solid outing for the Cardinals. He allowed one hit and struck out eight before being removed after throwing just 74 pitches.\n\n\"With the delay, it was a long day,\" Marmol said. \"Sonny's got a pretty extensive routine and throughout the day just couldn't get his lower half and loose during that game once it started. I didn't want to push through it, so I called it for him. He did his job.\"\n\nChicago mounted a late rally against Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley in the ninth. Ian Happ led off with his second homer of the game to make it a one-run game. Nick Madrigal and Mike Tauchmann each hit two-out singles before Seiya Suzuki hit a flyout to deep right-center field to give Helsley his 17th save to tie Cleveland's Emmanuel Clase for the major league lead.\n\n\"We had great at-bats in the eight and the ninth,\" Cubs manager Craig Counsell said. \"Essentially five of the six outs are well-hit baseballs. Unfortunately, we couldn't find holes on five of those balls. That's a little frustrating, but it's good to get Ian, hopefully, swinging it well and that's a big plus for the offense going forward.\"\n\nJavier Assad (4-1) allowed four runs and five hits and struck out a career-best eight batters in five innings after not allowing more than two earned runs in any of his previous 10 starts this season. Chicago has lost four in a row and six of its past eight.\n\n\"I thought Javy pitched good,\" Counsell said. \"He gave up two two-run homers and, unfortunately, it's the home runs with men on base that hurt you a little bit more. You're going to make a pitch to guys like that, and they're going to get you once in a while.\"\n\nHapp hit a two-run homer off Andrew Kittredge in the seventh to cut Chicago's deficit to 4-2.\n\nGoldschmidt hit a two-run shot into the third deck in left field in the third, and homered again in the fifth for his sixth of the season. It was Goldschmidt's 27th career multihomer game and his first since May 23, 2023, in Cincinnati.\n\n\"Just keeping it simple,\" Goldschmidt said about his approach to facing Assad. \"His command has been so good, I think the two hits I got were mistakes. That first one especially, he kind of left that one up.\"\n\nCardinals rookie Masyn Winn singled in the fifth inning to extend his hitting streak to 15 games. Alec Burleson singled in the first to extend his streak to 10 games, matching the longest of his career.\n\nNotes: Cardinals OF Lars Nootbaar was scratched as a precaution due to hamstring tightness after originally being listed in the starting lineup as the designated hitter. ...

The 26-year-old lefty allowed five hits, struck out three and did not issue a walk.\n\n\"He liked his fastball today,\" Cincinnati manager David Bell said. \"He got ahead, got to two strikes, kind of stayed with the fastball.

Sam Moll fanned two more Cardinals in the eighth, and Lucas Sims retired the side in order in the ninth -- striking out Alec Burleson and Goldschmidt and getting Nolan Arenado to pop out -- for his first save.\n\nSims got the call in the ninth to give the Alexis Diaz, the regular closer, a break after he pitched in four games in the last week.\n\nSims said he didn't feel any additional pressure in the save situation with some heavy St. Louis hitters coming to the plate.\n\n\"You know, we're in an important part of our schedule right now, where we are at in the standings, (playing) a divisional foe, riding a three-game win streak,\" Sims said. \"Being able to slam the door and kind of keep this good thing that we got going, I think that's more where it came from. Less about the game situation and more about where we are right now as a team.\"\n\nThe Cards got solid pitching from starter Lance Lynn, who allowed three runs (one earned) and five hits in six innings. He struck out five and walked three.\n\nCandelario homered to right in the first inning. Cincinnati got a run on Will Benson's RBI single in the second inning, and another came home on an error by Goldschmidt.\n\n\"Lance did a really nice job, especially pitching through those errors,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said. \"He kept his composure. Overall, he got after it. He gave us six and definitely gave us a shot.\"\n\nThe Reds pulled out of a downward spiral to sweep a three-game series from the Los Angeles Dodgers last weekend after losing their previous eight series in a row, going back to April 26. Cincinnati last won four straight games in July 2023.\n\nCardinals rookie shortstop Masyn Winn singled in the third to extend his hit streak to 16 games, while left fielder Burleson pushed his streak to 11 games with a single in the sixth.\n\nNotes: Cardinals OF Lars Nootbaar is day-to-day.

The loss snapped a five-game win streak for the Cardinals, who entered the day within a game of reaching .500.\n\nPaul Goldschmidt's first-inning home run accounted for all the scoring for the Cardinals, who fell to 25-27 at the start of their longest road trip of the season, a nine-game, 10-day trek that will feature stops in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\nGoldschmidt went 1 for 4 with his seventh home run of the season.\n\nCardinals rookie shortstop Masyn Winn went 1 for 4, and his third inning single to center field extended his hitting streak to 16 consecutive games. That's the longest by a Cardinals rookie since Jordan Walker hit in 17 straight games last season.\n\nAlec Burleson (1 for 4) and Dylan Carlson (1 for 3) had the other hits for the Cardinals.\n\nThe Cardinals, who played on Sunday night after a 2-hour and 33-minute rain delay, left four men on base and had just one at-bat with a runner in scoring position (0 for 1).\n\nCardinals starting pitcher Lance Lynn allowed three runs, just one earned, on five hits in six innings. He struck out five and walked three. The lone earned run he allowed came on a solo home run.\n\nThe Cardinals have now committed at least one error in 12 consecutive games, the firs time they club had such a streak since they committed errors in 12 straight games from Sept. 27, 1976-April 14, 1977.\n\nFirst-inning fireworks\n\nGoldschmidt's third home run in a span of less than 24 hours gave the Cardinals a brief one-run advantage when he blasted a first-pitch fastball over the inner third of the plate for a solo home run with two outs in the first inning.\n\nGoldschmidt hit home runs in back-to-back at-bats on Sunday night against the Chicago Cubs, and his home run on Monday marked the first time this season he 'd homered in consecutive games. He's now collected a hit in 13 of his last 14 games. His 15 home runs against the Reds since he joined the Cardinals are tied for the second-most in the majors during that span.\n\nGoldschmidt also clubbed his 20th career homer at Great American Ball Park, including his time with the Arizona Diamondbacks.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe Cardinals' lead lasted less than one inning thanks to a solo home run by Reds third baseman Jeimer Candelario that traveled an estimated 356 feet down the right field line. Candelario jumped on a 1-0 fastball in h the middle of the plate from Lynn.\n\nLynn gets cornered in the second\n\nThe Reds took a 3-1 lead thanks to a pair of unearned runs in the second inning due to errors by the corner infielders.\n\nThe first batter of the inning, Nick Martini, reached on a fielding error by 10-time Gold Glove winning third baseman Nolan Arenado, and Jonathan India followed Martini with a single to left field. Will Benson singled to drive in Martini and give the Reds a lead.\n\nIndia came around to score from third on a fielding error by Goldschmidt, a four-time Gold Glove winner at first base, on a ball hit by Jacob Hurtubise with one out.\n\nThe Cardinals defense did help Lynn out in the inning. Catcher Pedro Pages threw out Benson in his attempt to steal second base with India on third. Second baseman Nolan Gorman and shortstop Winn turned an inning-ending double play in that frame.\n\nA relief outing for Liberatore\n\nLeft-hander Matthew Liberatore, who had filled Steven Matz's spot in the starting rotation, pitched in relief for the first time since May 10. He'd began the season in the bullpen, and his first 12 appearances came in relief.\n\nLiberatore hadn't pitched since May 19, when he started against the Boston Red Sox and went three innings.\n\nOn Monday, Liberatore entered the game with the Cardinals trailing 3-1. He faced four batters and threw 13 pitches in the seventh inning. He recorded two outs and walked two batters in the frame before right-hander Kyle Leahy took over with two men on base and the switch-hitting Candelario due up.\n\nLeahy walked Candelario, but he got Spencer Steer to hit a fly ball to center field to end the inning and strand the bases loaded.\n\n\u00a92024 STLtoday.com.

The loss snapped a five-game win streak for the Cardinals, who entered the day within a game of reaching .500.\n\nPaul Goldschmidt's first-inning home run accounted for all the scoring for the Cardinals, who fell to 25-27 at the start of their longest road trip of the season, a nine-game, 10-day trek that will feature stops in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas.\n\nGoldschmidt went 1 for 4 with his seventh home run of the season.\n\nCardinals rookie shortstop Masyn Winn went 1 for 4, and his third inning single to center field extended his hitting streak to 16 consecutive games. That's the longest by a Cardinals rookie since Jordan Walker hit in 17 straight games last season.\n\nAlec Burleson (1 for 4) and Dylan Carlson (1 for 3) had the other hits for the Cardinals.\n\nThe Cardinals, who played on Sunday night after a 2-hour and 33-minute rain delay, left four men on base and had just one at-bat with a runner in scoring position (0 for 1).\n\nCardinals starting pitcher Lance Lynn allowed three runs, just one earned, on five hits in six innings. He struck out five and walked three. The lone earned run he allowed came on a solo home run.\n\nThe Cardinals have now committed at least one error in 12 consecutive games, the firs time they club had such a streak since they committed errors in 12 straight games from Sept. 27, 1976-April 14, 1977.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Ball_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great American Ball Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Goldschmidt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Goldschmidt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_streak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hitting streak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Burleson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alec Burleson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Walker_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Walker (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Carlson_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Carlson (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Lynn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lance Lynn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/291/29110/2911099.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601049", "eventUri": "eng-9601049", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-04-", "textStart": 1765, "textEnd": 1773}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

They also had won 10 of their previous 12.\n\nThey made two errors in the second inning that led to two unearned runs, all the Reds needed to tuck this one away.\n\nEven with sleep, the Cardinals have played defense as if they owned asbestos hands. With Monday's errors, they have made at least one in 12 straight games.\n\nIt started good for the Cardinals -- a two-out home run by Paul Goldschmidt in the first off Reds starter Nick Lodolo.\n\nGoldschmidt hit two home runs Sunday in a 4-3 win over the Cubs. And Monday's blast into the left-field stands with his 20th career homer in GABP and 26th overall against the Reds.\n\nThat 1-0 lead last only until Jeimer Candelario came to bat for the Reds in the bottom of the first. Candelario crushed a two-out home run off Lance Lynn to tie it, 1-1.\n\nIt came apart for the Cardinals in the second and it began with an error by third baseman Nolan Arenado, considered this era's equivalent to former defensive wizard Brooks Robinson of the Baltimore Orioles.\n\nNick Martinez grounded one to Arenado and he fumbled it. E-5.\n\nJonathan India singled and Will Benson singled to score Martini. Jacob Hurtubise ripped one off the glove of first baseman Goldschmidt, scoring India. E-3.\n\nThat made it 3-1 and that's where it stayed thanks to Reds pitchers Lodolo, Fernando Cruz, Sam Moll and Lucas Sims.\n\nLodolo did not own his strikeout stuff, but kept the Cardinals deathly quiet -- 5 1/3 innings, one run, five hits, no walks and only three strikeouts.\n\nThen came the Cincinnati bullpen and it turned the Cardinals to a gang of Rip Van Winkles.\n\nCruz, Moll and Sims struck out eight of the last 10 Cardinals.\n\nCruz replaced Lodolo with one out in the fifth and struck out all five batters he faced with his unhittable disappearing split finger.\n\nMoll took over in the eighth and went 1-2-3 with two strikeouts.\n\nBecause closer Alexis Diaz appeared in three of the last four games, Sims was handed the baseball for the save opportunity.\n\nHe went 1-2-3 with two strikeouts for his second save this season.\n\nThe game's stars, Lodolo and Candelario, both were coming back from absences. Lodolo was on the 15-day injured list and missed two starts with a groin strain.\n\nCandelario missed the last two games of the Dodgers series with a stiff neck and is making a strong offensive push after a slow start.\n\nAfter his home run and the two unearned runs in the second, the Reds had only one hit over their final six innings, a single by Jake Fraley in the sixth.\n\nThey did draw three walks in the seventh inning, but Spencer Steer stranded all three on a line drive to center.\n\n\"You have to be able to contribute to the team and I was ready ... ready and aggressive in the strike zone,\" said Candelario, talking about his game-tying home run in a post-game interview with Bally Sports Ohio. \"If I'm aggressive in the strike zone, man, I can make stuff happen.\"\n\nOf his resurgence from a slow start, Candelario said, \"It's close, it's close. We have to get some more reps, keep going, be consistent. That's what we need right now.\n\n\"Man, the guys are playing the right way, playing it our way. It is going to continue and it's going to click for everybody,\" he added.\n\nHis home run was big, but Candelario knows this one belongs to the pitchers.\n\n\"Those starters and those relievers ... they're setting the tone,\" he said. \"They're serious, man. They're warriors, working really hard and they're making stuff happen.\"\n\nAfter a good night's sleep, the Cardinals return to GABP Tuesday night, hoping to be wide awake against a Cincinnati team

In total, Cincinnati relievers fanned nine of their 11 batters.\n\nLucas Sims came on in the ninth to earn his first save of the season, as closer Alexis Diaz was unavailable after pitching in back-to-back games and three of the previous four.\n\n\"I believe in all the other seven guys that are down there,\" Sims said. \"Honestly, I believe that anybody can get it done. That's why they're here. Everyone's here to help us win ballgames. However we've got to do it, try to keep this thing rolling.\"\n\nCruz has played a pivotal role in the Reds' bullpen, relieving Lodolo on Monday with a runner on first and one out in the sixth. Cruz fanned Ivan Herrera and Nolan Arenado before striking out the side in the seventh.\n\nThe Cardinals are hoping Arenado can rediscover his offensive punch. Arenado went hitless in four at-bats Monday with a strikeout, dropping his average to .258.\n\nArenado belted at least 30 home runs and drove in 100 runs for seven straight full seasons from 2015-22.\n\n\"It's bad. The swing is not good. My swing is not good,\" Arenado said. \"I've been working on it and trying to figure this thing out, but my swing is not good.\n\n\"I'm a guy that pulls the ball in the air, and I haven't done that all year. I don't know what the answers are. I've got to continue to try to find it. I can see the difference of when I was good and when I'm not, but trying to apply it in games right now is really hard for me.\"\n\nWhile Arenado is not hitting well, two Cardinals have extended hitting streaks. Rookie Masyn Winn singled to center Monday in the third inning, running his streak to 16 games. Alec Burleson singled in the sixth to extend his hitting streak to a career-high 11 games.\n\nThe Reds send lefty Andrew Abbott (3-4, 2.68 ERA) to the mound on Tuesday. Abbott is coming off his best outing of the season, blanking San Diego over seven innings on May 21. He allowed just four hits and a walk. Abbott has gone seven innings in each of his past two starts, allowing just eight hits and one run over the 14 innings.\n\nAbbott is 1-1 with a 5.59 ERA in two starts against St. Louis.\n\nThe Cardinals counter with veteran right-hander Kyle Gibson (3-2, 3.81), who will make his 11th start this season. Gibson allowed three unearned runs on five hits over four innings on Wednesday against the Baltimore Orioles, as the Cardinals rallied for a 5-4 win.

This little outburst has led to calls that Goldschmidt is back, but we want to see the K rate drop some before we buy into that.

So, Sims was asked, is there a difference between the ninth inning and other innings?\n\n\"It's a little later in the game,\" Sims said. \"Nothing really changes. The goal is to go out there and give us a chance to win.\"\n\nThe day after four relievers pitchers combined to give the Reds a sweep over the Dodgers on a bullpen day, the three Reds relievers came in and retired all 11 Cardinals they faced, including nine by strikeout.\n\n\"It goes for all of our guys, (the role) can change depending on different factors and availability in our bullpen,\" Bell said. \"It's a little bit interchangeable, which the guys in the bullpen make it that way.\"\n\nSix of the Reds' eight relievers pitched either Sunday or Monday, combining to go 12 2/3 innings while allowing just one run on five hits, with no walks and eight strikeouts.\n\nAfter the bullpen game on Sunday, the Reds turned to lefty Nick Lodolo to return to the rotation. Lodolo looked sharp, allowing just a first-inning solo homer to the Cardinals' Paul Goldschmidt in his 5 1/3 innings. While Lodolo had just three strikeouts, he didn't walk any, and in his first start off the IL used just 81 pitches to navigate his way through the Cardinals' lineup.\n\nLodolo gave up a single to Alec Burleson to lead off the sixth inning, but got Goldschmidt to fly out before giving way to Fernando Cruz.\n\nA reliever's ERA isn't a great way to judge their performance. Cruz's 4.07 ERA doesn't exactly tell the tale of his season. At this point, Cruz is one of the nastiest pitchers in the game. This season he's faced 100 batters and struck out 48 of them, including all five he faced Monday.\n\n\"To me, it's must-see TV,\" Sims said of Cruz at this point. \"What he's doing, he's been such a valuable piece for us. It's been pretty damn fun to watch.\"\n\nCruz was followed Monday by lefty Sam Moll, who struck out both left-handed batters he faced and got the one right-handed batter he faced to ground out. Then came Sims for the save. Sims struck out the first two batters before getting Nolan Arenado to pop up to Reds first baseman Jeimer Candelario to end the game.\n\nIn the Reds' four-game winning streak, Reds relievers have allowed just two runs, both in the ninth with four-run leads. The Reds' bullpen has a 3.74 ERA for the season. But over the past two weeks, Reds relievers have a 2.50 ERA and the third-best strikeout-to-walk ratio in baseball.\n\n\"I've been doing the same thing in the same way, it just happened to be going my way now,\" Cruz said. \"I mean, it's just a game, you cannot forget that, we're not machines. I've not changed anything.\"\n\nSince losing to the Dodgers in Los Angeles on May 17, Cruz has allowed just one hit and one walk while striking out 13 of the 18 batters he's faced.\n\n\"We're enjoying the streak and we're playing really good baseball,\" Cruz said. \"I was really close before to being like a rocket taking off.

Jonathan India and Nick Martini each drove in two runs in the win.\n\n\"It shows what we're capable of doing when we play well,\" Reds manager David Bell said. \"We know that about ourselves. We believe that we absolutely have to go out and show it. It's nice to see for our team and our players, just fighting to shift the energy around.\"\n\nCincinnati is expected to activate left-hander Nick Lodolo (3-2, 3.34 ERA) from the injured list to start the series opener. Lodolo would be making his first start since May 11, when he allowed four runs over six innings in a 5-1 loss to the San Francisco Giants.\n\nThe 26-year-old Lodolo was placed on the 15-day injured list four days later with a left groin strain.\n\nPaul Goldschmidt is 3-for-5 with a home run against Lodolo, who is 1-1 with a 7.04 ERA in two career starts vs. St. Louis.\n\nGoldschmidt homered twice and drove in four runs in the Cardinals' 4-3 win over the Chicago Cubs on Sunday. Center fielder Michael Siani helped secure the victory with a diving catch in the eighth inning.\n\n\"I'm not sure if people realize how good he's been in center field,\" St. Louis manager Oliver Marmol said of Siani. \"This kid is really good out there, and he's taking some good at-bats for us, too.\"\n\nRight-hander Lance Lynn (2-2, 3.68) will take the mound for the Cardinals. He allowed one unearned run over six innings in a 3-1 win over the Baltimore Orioles last Tuesday.\n\nLynn, 37, bounced back with a strong outing after going 0-2 with a 7.36 ERA in his previous three May starts.\n\nIn 22 career appearances (19 starts) against Cincinnati, Lynn is 12-4 with a 3.29 ERA.\n\nReds third baseman Jeimer Candelario should be available for the series opener after missing the past two games because of a stiff neck.\n\nThe Reds are in last place in the National League Central, but they are hoping to climb the standings over the next few weeks with 23 of their next 31 games against division foes.\n\n\"When you're playing in the division, these games are obviously a little more intense, a little bit more personal,\" Cincinnati outfielder Will Benson said. \"I think we're going to match that level of intensity. I hope we do.\"\n\nSt. Louis shortstop Masyn Winn brings a 15-game hitting streak into the series opener, while outfielder Alec Burleson has a hit in 10 straight games.\n\nThe Cardinals are monitoring the status of right fielder Lars Nootbaar, who was scratched from the lineup prior to Sunday's game due to a hamstring injury. Marmol said the move was precautionary.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "sanluisobispo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

They leave for their longest road-trip of the season one game under .500, one game behind second place in the National League Central, and two wins away from their first winning record since early April 2023. What put them there was a 7-1 homestand despite facing three teams over 10 days with winning records.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Some flaws buffed.\n\nTheir pitching stretched but not strained.\n\nTheir vibe made over.\n\nThey've got a fresh look, and not just because of \"The Lou\" jerseys.\n\n\"About the exact opposite of how we did in the first month or six weeks or so,\" Goldschmidt said. \"Found a way to keep scoring runs and get big hits and you know the pitching was pretty much how they've been all year -- which is really, really good. That was the message of the team when we weren't getting those wins. 'Hey, we're doing a lot of things well. But we're not hitting. When that comes we can start winning some games.' \"\n\n\"I think it's definitely good to see that we have it in us,\" Gray said.\n\nDue in part to Sunday's delayed start, Gray (7-2) had difficulty getting his legs and lower torso loose throughout the game. The Cardinals moved cautiously into the middle innings, and when the right-hander completed the fifth inning with his seventh and eighth strikeout of the evening, the manager offered to make the call for Gray. The Cubs' lineup offered a favorable spot for lefty John King and the Cardinals took it despite Gray throwing five scoreless innings of one-hit ball on less than 80 pitches.\n\nThe timing of Goldschmidt's two two-run homers meant Gray left with a four-run lead and the chance to win. The bullpen allowed three runs, but the Cubs did not capitalize and capsize the lead, leaving the tying run on third for the second time in as many nights against Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley.\n\n\"Man, good team effort,\" manager Oliver Marmol said late Sunday night. \"Bottom line: Guys are stepping up and contributing, and different guys are coming in and doing their jobs. It's coming together really well from all sides of the game. Baserunning. Defense. Pitching. Hitting. It's coming together, and it's led to some wins. Guys are playing with a lot of confidence and playing for each other. I love watching it.\"\n\nJudging by the tone of the crowds this weekend, he's not alone.\n\n\"We're just playing good baseball,\" third baseman Nolan Arenado said.\n\nHere are some elements of the Cardinals' game that led to seven wins on the homestand that may have saved the Cardinals' season:\n\n1. You up with OBP?\n\nSince leaving Milwaukee for Disneyland with the fifth-best record in a five-team division, the Cardinals have animated their lineup around the most basic principle of offense: fewer outs.\n\nIn the past dozen days, the Cardinals lead the majors with a .364 on-base percentage. They, quite literally, made fewer outs per opportunity than any other team. That has helped stocked the bases and churned out the runs without the Cardinals always slugging their way to rallies. Only the New York Yankees in the past 12 days have been better at generating runs -- and going into Sunday's games they had hit 15 more homers in that span.\n\nLars Nootbaar had three hits Saturday against the Cubs, and when he sat to rest a sore left hamstring Sunday, his replacement at No. 2 in the lineup, Alec Burleson, had two hits by the end of the third inning. Nootbaar and Burleson have two of the top 11 on-base percentages in the majors over the past week.Combined with Goldschmidt and leadoff hitter Brendan Donovan, the Cardinals have four of the top 44. That has given them plenty of traffic on the bases, and they've taken advantage. Entering Sunday's game, the Cardinals were 23 for 61 with runners in scoring position on the homestand.\n\nThat's a .377 batting average.\n\nThey went 0 for 5 on Sunday, but when Goldschmidt is planting a home run 424 feet away in Big Mac Land and drilling one 399 feet into the seats crooked numbers follow.\n\n\"It's coming together,\" Marmol said. \"In different ways, too. It's not just slug. We've done that. But we've taken our base hits. We've stolen some bases. We've advanced with balls in the dirt. We've done other things well. And you put it all together and it leads to some wins.\"\n\n2. The Big 3\n\nGray came an inning shy of a quality start Sunday, though his five shutout innings continued what was a homestand flex by the Cardinals' rotation additions. Gray did not allow more than an earned run in either of his two starts, and his outings weren't the most impressive of the starts by the trio of newcomers.\n\nLance Lynn had his best start of the season interrupted by rain, and Kyle Gibson, the third of the free agent starters signed by the Cardinals this past November, got through four strong innings before a storm abbreviated his game.\n\nCombined in the series, the trio of starters signed to bring stability to the rotation went 4-0 with one no decision and had a 2.02 ERA in 26 2/3 innings. As a group, they allowed one earned run in their final 20 2/3 innings pitched of the homestand.\n\nThey started all three games of the Baltimore series.\n\nThe Cardinals won all three games of the Baltimore series.\n\n\"It feels like the Cardinals are the team that people are coming after or whatever,\" said Gray, who won both of his starts. \"So, I love being on this side of it.\" 0\n\nLove 0

In total, Cincinnati relievers fanned nine of their 11 batters.\n\nLucas Sims came on in the ninth to earn his first save of the season, as closer Alexis Diaz was unavailable after pitching in back-to-back games and three of the previous four.\n\nReds Cardinals home run celebration The Reds pay tribute to the retired Viking home run celebration\n\nReds Cardinals Nick Lodolo Nick Lodolo's return from the injured list is just in time as the Reds beat the Cardinals\n\nReds Cardinals Nick Martinez Nick Martinez outduels old rival Yoshinobu Yamamoto as the Reds sweep the Dodgers\n\n\"I believe in all the other seven guys that are down there,\" Sims said. \"Honestly, I believe that anybody can get it done. That's why they're here. Everyone's here to help us win ballgames. However we've got to do it, try to keep this thing rolling.\"\n\nCruz has played a pivotal role in the Reds' bullpen, relieving Lodolo on Monday with a runner on first and one out in the sixth. Cruz fanned Ivan Herrera and Nolan Arenado before striking out the side in the seventh.\n\nThe Cardinals are hoping Arenado can rediscover his offensive punch. Arenado went hitless in four at-bats Monday with a strikeout, dropping his average to .258.\n\nArenado belted at least 30 home runs and drove in 100 runs for seven straight full seasons from 2015-22.\n\n\"It's bad. The swing is not good. My swing is not good,\" Arenado said. \"I've been working on it and trying to figure this thing out, but my swing is not good.\n\n\"I'm a guy that pulls the ball in the air, and I haven't done that all year. I don't know what the answers are. I've got to continue to try to find it. I can see the difference of when I was good and when I'm not, but trying to apply it in games right now is really hard for me.\"\n\nWhile Arenado is not hitting well, two Cardinals have extended hitting streaks. Rookie Masyn Winn singled to center Monday in the third inning, running his streak to 16 games. Alec Burleson singled in the sixth to extend his hitting streak to a career-high 11 games.\n\nThe Reds send lefty Andrew Abbott (3-4, 2.68 ERA) to the mound on Tuesday. Abbott is coming off his best outing of the season, blanking San Diego over seven innings on May 21. He allowed just four hits and a walk. Abbott has gone seven innings in each of his past two starts, allowing just eight hits and one run over the 14 innings.\n\nAbbott is 1-1 with a 5.59 ERA in two starts against St. Louis.\n\nThe Cardinals counter with veteran right-hander Kyle Gibson (3-2, 3.81), who will make his 11th start this season. Gibson allowed three unearned runs on five hits over four innings on Wednesday against the Baltimore Orioles, as the Cardinals rallied for a 5-4 win. Gibson is 1-0 with a 7.59 ERA in two career starts against the Reds.", "source": {"uri": "cincinnati.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Cincinnati"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@cincinnati.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Lodolo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nick Lodolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Arenado", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nolan Arenado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Reds", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Reds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Martinez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nick Martinez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshinobu_Yamamoto", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoshinobu Yamamoto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin_Herrera", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kelvin Herrera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Gibson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Gibson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_streak", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hitting streak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Louis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/22/PCIN/73795198007-052124-reds-0477.jpg?auto=webp&crop=6830,3842,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9601049", "eventUri": "eng-9601049", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-21", "textStart": 2740, "textEnd": 2746}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 454622721, "relevance": 2}

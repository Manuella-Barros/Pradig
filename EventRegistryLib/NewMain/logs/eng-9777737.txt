Our MLB odds series has our Pirates Astros prediction, odds and pick for Tuesday.\n\nIt's time to continue our MLB odds series with a Pirates-Astros prediction and pick. Find out how to watch Pirates Astros.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates are hanging in there. They are staying in the National League wild card race with a tough, resilient team which is not crumbling under the weight of pressure. We know the Pirates aren't a good hitting team, but their frontline starting pitching is keeping them competitive. Throughout their rotation -- not just from superstar Paul Skenes and veteran stalwart Mitch Keller, but also from Jose Ortiz and other members of their staff -- the Bucs are getting clutch pitching to stay in games and cobble together just enough offense to win. The Pirates lost two games to wild card contender Arizona over the weekend but then battled back and won a 10-inning game on Sunday. Then, on Monday in Houston, the Pirates fought back from a 2-0 deficit to beat the Astros 5-3. One wonders if the Pirates will make a high-impact trade just before Tuesday afternoon's deadline in the attempt to make a push at October. The Pirates have set themselves up to be contenders in the near future with all their starting pitching. Can they bring enough offense to the table to change the equation and make Pittsburgh a baseball playoff city again?\n\nBailey Falter (4-7) has a 4.08 ERA. The Pirates have elite starters at the top of their rotation, but it should not be forgotten that their back-end starters are decent. That's hugely important in fielding a roster which can make the postseason or can at least be competitive in the push for a playoff spot. Falter is not spectacular, but a back-end rotation starter doesn't have to be. He has been unavailable for the past few weeks, which is why you have seen Jose Ortiz get some starts (and do a good job) for the Bucs, and this is his return to the rotation after three and a half weeks of recuperation. Falter fundamentally fits the bill in terms of what teams need from a back-end starter: He will throw five to six innings, avoid the big inning, and will keep his team in a game. If you look at his road starts this year, that's exactly what Falter has done. If he can go five innings and give up two runs, the Pirates will definitely take that against the talented Astros in Houston, which has a hitter-friendly park.\n\nLast Start: July 6 versus the New York Mets: 2 IP, 5 H, 3 R, 0 HR, 2 BB, 2 K\n\n2024 Road Splits: 9 starts, 45 2/3 IP, 39 H, 23 R, 4 HR, 14 BB, 33 K\n\nHunter Brown (9-6) has a 4.00 ERA. In a year when the Astros have been crushed by injuries to their starters, Brown has really helped out. He struggled earlier in the year but has found his groove in recent weeks. He was solid in his most recent outing versus the Oakland A's and has really steadied the Astros' rotation with Justin Verlander, Lance McCullers, Jose Urquidy, and Cristian Javier all unavailable for long periods of time.\n\nLast Start: Wednesday, July 24 versus the Oakland Athletics: 6 IP, 8 H, 1 R, 0 HR, 1 BB, 8 K\n\nTV: SportsNet Pittsburgh (Pirates) / SpaceCity Home Network (Astros) / MLB Extra Innings\n\nThe Pirates are playing well and are full of confidence. They don't crumble when things go against them. They battle back. It's a great reason to pick them on the run line. They're getting a run and a half and should keep this close.\n\nWhy The Astros Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Astros are coming off two home losses. They won't make it three. Hunter Brown is pitching really well. This game sets up well for Houston.\n\nFinal Pirates-Astros Prediction & Pick\n\nThis game does line up in favor of Houston. Take the Astros on the run line.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_zemek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Matthew Zemek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Falter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Falter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Keller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Keller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristian_Javier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristian Javier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Urquidy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Urquidy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_McCullers_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lance McCullers Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Hunter_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Hunter (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_Extra_Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLB Extra Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Verlander", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Verlander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oakland Athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Academic Departments", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Research_Groups_and_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Research Groups and Centers", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Pirates-vs.-Astros-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777737", "eventUri": "eng-9777737", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 2426, "textEnd": 2432}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 3023, "textEnd": 3030}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Taylor homered for the second consecutive game and left-hander Bailey Falter excelled in his return from the injured list as the visiting Pittsburgh Pirates defeated the Houston Astros 6-2 on Tuesday.\n\nTaylor, whose three-run home run in the ninth inning lifted the Pirates to victory in the series opener, chased Astros starter Hunter Brown (9-7) with a two-run, two-out blast in the sixth. Taylor launched a 2-1 sinker 403 feet for his fourth homer of the season and extended Pittsburgh's lead to 5-1.\n\nFalter (5-7) made his first start since left triceps tendonitis sent him to the 15-day IL on July 7. He retired the side in order in the first, worked around two singles in the second, and sidestepped a one-out single from Jose Altuve to conclude three scoreless innings with relative ease.\n\nFalter lost his shutout bid when Astros catcher Yainer Diaz drilled his 10th home run of the season leading off the fourth. Falter responded by striking out Jeremy Pena and Jake Meyers. In the fifth, Falter induced Altuve to hit into an inning-ending double play.\n\nYordan Alvarez chased Falter with a one-out single in the sixth, and Alvarez later scored on Pena's fielder's choice grounder against reliever Dennis Santana. Falter allowed two runs, one earned, on six hits with three strikeouts. He threw just 66 pitches over 5 1/3 innings.\n\nBrown had his streak of 12 consecutive starts of six-plus innings snapped after allowing five runs (four earned) on nine hits and two walks with eight strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings.

Taylor hammers another homer, as Pirates beat Astros to clinch series win", "body": "The Pirates' Jared Triolo drops his bat as he watches his RBI double, scoring Connor Joe, against the Astros during the fourth inning Tuesday.\n\nBen Cherington wouldn't say whether the Pittsburgh Pirates deciding not to acquire a center fielder at the trade deadline was a vote of confidence for Michael A. Taylor.\n\nBut a day after Taylor delivered a three-run home run in the ninth inning of a comeback win against the Houston Astros, the Pirates general manager didn't hesitate to express faith in him.\n\nTaylor rewarded it by blasting another homer, this one a two-run shot in the sixth inning that boosted the Pirates to a 6-2 win Tuesday night at Minute Maid Park to clinch a series win.\n\n\"We believe in Michael,\" Cherington said of Taylor, the 2021 AL Gold Glove winner. \"It's why we signed him. We know the defense is there. Obviously, there were stretches during this year where it's been a struggle offensively and he's been grinding. ... We know what he's capable of; this is a guy who hit 21 home runs last year with premium defense, so I think there's every opportunity for him to make a big impact on this team in the next two months.\"\n\nTaylor's homer was one of 11 hits by the Pirates (55-52), who took advantage of three Astros errors and got a solid start from lefty Bailey Falter to pull even with the St. Louis Cardinals for second place in the NL Central and 1 \u00bd games back in wild card standings. They have a chance to sweep the three-game series Wednesday against the Astros (55-52).\n\nActivated from the injured list, Falter was very efficient in his first start since July 6 by throwing strikes on 47 of his 66 pitches in allowing two runs (one earned) on six hits without a walk and three strikeouts in 5 1/3 innings.\n\nThe Pirates took a 1-0 lead in the second inning, after Ke'Bryan Hayes got a leadoff single to left, advanced to third on Connor Joe's grounder to right and scored when Jared Triolo grounded into a 6-4-3 double play.\n\nThey extended it in the fourth, thanks to an error. Joey Bart singled to center, then scored for a 2-0 lead when Connor Joe hit a two-out dribbler that pitcher Hunter Brown backhanded but made a low throw that skipped past first baseman Jon Singleton for a two-base error. Triolo doubled to the left field corner to score Joe for a 3-0 lead.\n\nYainer Diaz started the bottom of the fourth by driving Falter's first-pitch curveball 351 feet to left field for his 10th home run to cut it to 3-1. Falter, however, responded with a pair of strikeouts and a fly out, then got Jose Altuve to ground into an inning-ending double play in the fifth.\n\nAfter Triolo worked an eight-pitch at-bat for a two-out walk in the sixth, Taylor crushed a 2-1 sinker at the top of the strike zone for a 403-foot home run to left field to make it 5-1.\n\nIt was the second consecutive game with a towering homer for Taylor, whose three-run shot in the ninth lifted the Pirates to a 5-3 win over the Astros on Monday night.\n\nWhen Yordan Alvarez singled in the sixth, the Pirates replaced Falter with righty Dennis Santana. Diaz singled to short, and Oneil Cruz's errant throw allowed Alvarez to reach third. Alvarez scored when Jeremy Pena grounded into a forceout to cut it to 5-2, but Bryan Reynolds stretched out for a diving catch in left to rob Jake Meyers.\n\nAndrew McCutchen drew a bases-loaded, full-count walk off Seth Martinez to drive in Joey Bart to stretch the lead to 6-2 in the eighth.

Could Taylor be a sneaky prop target tonight?\n\nHouston Astros\n\nHunter Brown: It's been an up-and-down season for Hunter Brown (4.00 ERA), but he's been really solid since the start of June. Outside a seven-run blow up on July 6, Brown has turned in nine starts since June 1 with three or fewer earned runs allowed, posting a 2.07 ERA in his last 10 outings.\n\nPirates vs. Astros Prediction and Pick\n\nI absolutely love the Astros in this game with how well Brown has pitched as of late.\n\nIn his last 10 starts, the Astros are 8-2 straight up, a big flip from earlier this season when they started 2-9 in his first 11 outings.\n\nPittsburgh is one of the worst offenses in baseball, ranking 28th in the league in OPS, and I don't see it turning things around on the road against Brown. While Taylor's homer saved the day on Monday, it's hard to bank on some late-game heroics - especially when Paul Skenes isn't on the mound.\n\nFalter is making his first start since July 6 after landing on the injured list earlier this month. He had struggled before then, posting a 6.23 ERA in six outings since June 1.\n\nAfter a brutal loss on Monday, Houston should bounce back behind Brown on Tuesday.\n\nPick: Astros Moneyline (-192)\n\nOdds refresh periodically and are subject to change.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_dewey@si.com", "name": "Peter Dewey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Taylor_(baseball,_born_1985)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Taylor (baseball, born 1985)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Academic_Departments", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Academic Departments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Research_Groups_and_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Research Groups and Centers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2738,h_1540,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/si/01j426d4bewwdgemm8pv.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9777737", "eventUri": "eng-9777737", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 1113, "textEnd": 1119, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 1159, "textEnd": 1165, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Pitching in the second of a three-game set on the road, his club wasn't scheduled to leave town until the following night. But based on his performance, the left-hander certainly looked to be in a hurry.\n\nIn his first start back from the injured list, Falter cruised through the Astros' lineup, throwing 5 1/3 efficient innings en route to leading his team to a 6-2 win and series victory at Minute Maid Park.\n\nFalter needed just 53 pitches to complete his first five frames in the evening. His lone big mistake came in the bottom of the fourth, when Yainer Diaz tagged him for a leadoff home run. But after that, Falter returned to his dominant self, striking out the next two batters he faced to keep his club in control.\n\nAn early lead helped Falter pitch with confidence until his day came to an end. He was the game's winning pitcher, improving his record to 5-7 on the season.\n\nHouston scattered six hits off Falter, with Diaz's long ball being the only one for extra-bases. He exited the game in the sixth inning, after surrendering a one-out single to Yordan \u00c1lvarez, who would later come around to score. Falter struck out three batters Tuesday evening and issued no walks. He finished the game with 66 pitches to his credit, 47 for strikes.\n\nOn the mound\n\nDennis Santana replaced Falter on the mound, allowing Alvarez to score but preventing any further damage. The 28-year-old right-hander then returned to throw a perfect seventh inning, recording a pair of strikeouts in the process.\n\nSantana has collected seven total strikeouts in his last two outings, which span over 3 1/3 innings. He finished the month with just one earned run allowed over 12 innings (0.75 ERA), striking out 20 batters and issuing only three walks in that stretch.\n\nKyle Nicolas followed Santana, coming on to throw a scoreless eighth inning. Hunter Stratton then finished the job in the ninth, posting a zero in his first big league outing since June 13.\n\nAt the plate\n\nJared Triolo plated the Pirates' first run by hitting into a double play in the top of the second inning. His ground ball scored Ke'Bryan Hayes, who led off the frame with a single.\n\nJoey Bart scored the Pirates' second run thanks to a throwing error from Astros starter Hunter Brown, the game's losing pitcher. With the Pirates catcher on first base thanks to a one-out single, Connor Joe sent a weak ground ball to the left side of the infield that forced Brown to make an athletic play off the mound.\n\nBrown fielded the ball clean but sent a throw wide of the bag, allowing Bart to score with ease and Joe to advance all the way to third. Triolo doubled home Joe the following at-bat, making the score 3-0.\n\nThe Pirates added two more runs in the sixth on a towering home run to left field by Michael A. Taylor, his second long ball in as many nights and fourth of the season. Taylor's blast traveled 403 feet with an exit velocity of 104.3 mph. Andrew McCutchen drew a walk with the bases loaded in the eighth to plate Bart for the Pirates' sixth and final run of the evening.\n\n\u00a92024 PG Publishing Co. Visit at post-gazette.com.

Here are five things that Taylor Swift has said about Scotland during her Edinburgh weekend with the Eras Tour. At Friday\u2019s show, Taylor Swift spoke about the world of Folklore, a world which she created that is explored in her album of the same name. She said that she imagined walking around in a beautiful wilderness, which she described in detail. She said: \u201cThis foresty, mossy, beautiful, natural world which I now realise is probably just based on videos I\u2019ve seen online of Scotland.\u201d On the Saturday night concert, she lamented that she didn\u2019t come to perform in Scotland enough, which delighted the crowds at Murrayfield, who whooped and cheered in response. She said: \u201cMy one regret in terms of the tours that we\u2019ve done is that I really, really should have come to play in Scotland more. That\u2019s very clear.\u201d Again, on Saturday\u2019s show, Taylor thanked the fans for their welcome and their enthusiasm, but she went on to say that it wasn\u2019t just in the stadium that she felt welcome and happy in the country. She explained: \u201cYou\u2019ve been so just beautifully generous to us, even before we got here. Just the way that you have shown love and passion then we get here and you guys are like this. Taylor delighted the already hyped up fans by saying that Scotland was one of her favourite places to perform on the tour. During her Red Era performance, she took some time to praise and thank the crowd, adding: \"You have made us feel so at home in Scotland!\u201d She then confirmed that Scotland was \u201cone of my favourite places to be on tour!\" During the song We Are Never Getting Back Together, it\u2019s typical for Taylor to pass the mic to one of her dancers Kameron Saunders after saying \u201cWe are never getting back together\u201d and he says something in the language of the country they\u2019re in, or in the dialect, or local slang, which has constant appeal to the crowds. On the first night, Kam shouted \u201cNae Chance\u201d to a screaming audience, and Saturday night he laughed \u201cYa Wee Radge\u201d, again, to truly delighted fans.", "summary": "<p>The Eras Tour has come to Edinburgh - here\u2019s what Taylor Swift has said about Scotland while she\u2019s here. </p>", "url": "https://www.scotsman.com/arts-and-culture/art/taylor-swift-edinburgh-scotland-murrayfield-eras-tour-4658742", "image": "https://www.scotsman.com/jpim-static/image/2024/06/09/14/28/onecms_0c84b933-cbee-417d-a74c-db047aa75c23.JPG.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:48:35", "author": "Rachel Mackie", "authors": ["Rachel Mackie"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.302}

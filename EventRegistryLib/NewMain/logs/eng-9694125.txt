You may have had a rough time earlier in the tournament, but last night you proved why you're truly one of the greats of the gentleman's game.\n\n\"Competing in six World Cups and clinching victory in the last one is an experience I know well. I hope to see you continue winning matches for India in the longer formats of the game,\" wrote Tendulkar on 'X'.\n\nLater on, Rohit said in the post-match press conference that he's joining Virat in ending his T20I career. Rohit, who captained India to T20 World Cup glory at Barbados, finishes as the highest scorer in T20Is - 4231 runs in 159 matches - and also holds the record for the most centuries in men's T20Is via fine tons, apart from being a two-time world champion in the shortest format.\n\n\"I've witnessed your evolution from a promising youngster to a World Cup-winning captain from close quarters. Your unwavering commitment & exceptional talent have brought immense pride to the nation. Leading India to a T20 World Cup victory is the perfect culmination of your stellar career. Well done, Rohit!\" added Tendulkar.\n\nIndia skipper Rohit Sharma was full of emotions after the title-clinching seven-run win over South Africa in the T20 World Cup final in Barbados on Saturday.\n\nRohit, who finished the tournament as India's highest run-getter, was fully pumped up as India ended their more than decade-long ICC title drought in the absence of legendary captain MS Dhoni.\n\nJust after securing the title, Rohit patted multiple times on the ground and was also seen eating the soil of Kensington Oval's pitch later as Indian players continued their celebrations on the ground.\n\nThe official 'X' account of Wimbledon shared pictures of Rohit and Novak Djokovic in similar action, drawing similarity between the two greats of their respective sports.\n\nNetizens were also quick to notice Rohit's epic soil eating celebration similar to that of Djokovic, who has a habit of eating grass after winning the Wimbledon Grand Slam.\n\nPreviously, Rohit had also admitted to being a Djokovic fan.\n\nRohit, who had played in each edition of the T20 World Cup, announced his retirement from the T20I following the footsteps of his teammate Virat Kohli. Both players will continue to play the ODI and Test cricket for the country.\n\nIn a nervy summit clash, Men in Blue remained calm and composed in a pressure situation and successfully defended 176 despite Heinrich Klaasen's fiery 52 off 27 balls. Hardik Pandya bagged the pricey dismissal and scripted the late fight back to get their hands on the second shortest format title.\n\nIndia's pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah also built the pressure from the other end and bagged the wicket of Marco Jansen before Pandya returned to stamp his authority with the scalps of David Miller and Kagiso Rabada in the final over to restrict them to 169/8 in 20 overs.\n\nEarlier, India won the toss and opted to bat first but were reeling at 34/3 after 4.3 overs as they lost Rohit Sharma, Rishabh Pant and Suryakumar Yadav inside the powerplay.\n\nHowever, Kohli stepped up on the occasion and played an anchor knock of 76 off 59 balls while Axar Patel scored 47 off 31 balls to take their total to 176/7.\n\nOn India winning 2024 Men's T20 World Cup with a thrilling seven-run victory over South Africa at the Kensington Oval, former fast-bowler Sreesanth, a member of the 2007 edition winning team, lauded the Rohit Sharma-led side for having 'nothing short of extraordinary' journey in the competition.\n\nIndia went into Saturday's title clash as one of the two unbeaten teams alongside South Africa. Player of the Match Virat Kohli stepped up when it mattered the most with a 59-ball 76 to help India post a competitive 176/7, the highest total in a Men's T20 World Cup final.\n\nHis 72-run stand for the fourth wicket with Axar Patel, who made 47 off 31 balls, and a 57-run partnership with Shivam Dube, who hit a 16-ball 27, helped India go past 175-run mark, as they got 42 runs off the last three overs.\n\nIn reply, South Africa were very much in sight to chase down the total. But Hardik taking out Heinrich Klaasen propelled India to come back into the match and emerge victorious to end a long 11-year global trophy drought as they restricted South Africa to 169/8. While Pandya took 3-20, Player of the Tournament Jasprit Bumrah shined with 2-18.\n\n\"As we lift the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2024 trophy, I am overwhelmed with pride for Team India. Our journey in this tournament has been nothing short of extraordinary, filled with grit, resilience, and moments that will be etched in history. This victory is a testament to the hard work and dedication of every player, coach, and support staff involved.\n\n\"I want to thank our fans whose unwavering support fueled our determination on the field. It's a privilege to see such a talented group of individuals who have shown immense character and skill throughout the tournament,\" said Sreesanth on 'Caught and Bold' show on Disney+ Hotstar.\n\nIndia now join West Indies and England as two-time winners of the Men's T20 World Cup, and also gave a winning farewell to head coach Rahul Dravid. It also meant Kohli and captain Rohit Sharma signed off from playing T20Is for India on a glorious high.\n\n\"This win is not just for us but for every Indian cricket lover who shares our passion and belief. Let's celebrate this triumph and look forward to more successes in the future,\" added Sreesanth.", "source": {"uri": "morungexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MorungExpress"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sachin Tendulkar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgetown", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bridgetown"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bridgetown"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Oval", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Oval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Novak Djokovic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Jansen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Jansen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MS Dhoni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axar_Patel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Axar Patel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Over (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wicket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One Day International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney+_Hotstar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disney+ Hotstar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivam_Dube", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shivam Dube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Miller_(South_African_cricketer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "David Miller (South African cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabh_Pant", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rishabh Pant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagiso_Rabada", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kagiso Rabada"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerplay_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Powerplay (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Sreesanth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

Under the leadership of Rohit Sharma, the Men in Blue came to closer to winning the World Test Championship and ODI World Cup titles, but lost both to Australia.\n\nApart from leading the team to T20 World Cup triumph, Rohit Sharma emerged as the highest run-getter for India, amassing 257 runs, including three fifties, at an average of 36.71 in 8 matches.\n\n'One of the greats of the gentleman's game': Tendulkar on Virat Kohli\n\nThe legendary batter hailed Virat Kohli as one of the greats of the sport, adding that he is looking forward to see Kohli winning matches for Team India in ODIs and Tests.\n\n\"You have been a true champion of this sport. You may have had a rough time earlier in the tournament, but last night you proved why you're truly one of the greats of the gentleman's game.

Dhoni, who also led India to title victory in T20's showpiece event in 2007 at the inaugural edition.\n\nA rookie Rohit, now 37, was part of the first T20 triumph when India beat arch-rivals Pakistan in the final in Johannesburg.\n\nThe two stalwarts, who have 45,961 runs between them across three international formats, will stay on in Test and ODI cricket\n\nThe title clash with South Africa was also the last match for outgoing coach Rahul Dravid, a former captain who left the international stage as a player without a World Cup win.\n\nDravid, 51, said he will miss Rohit as a person more than just as a captain and player who amassed runs and records.\n\nFormer India batsman Gautam Gambhir is widely reported to succeed Dravid as coach of the high-profile Indian team.\n\nGambhir, who remained a key part of India's 2011 ODI World Cup win at home, coached IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders to their third title this year.\n\n\"There was speculation that some senior players will be sent off after Gambhir comes in (as coach), but both Rohit and Kohli ended on a high note,\" former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar said on his YouTube channel.\n\n\"It was a good decision by both. Before anybody sacks them, or creates a doubt about their selection, a big player should decide their own fate.\"\n\nThe T20 triumph has been redemption for Rohit, who was stripped of his IPL captaincy from Mumbai Indians this year.\n\nPandya was handed the leadership role, much to the disappointment of many fans.\n\nKohli proved his big-match credentials, with his 59-ball 76 in the final clash -- after he managed just 75 runs in seven innings during the competition until the finale.\n\nAll-rounder Pandya will be Rohit's likely replacement as leader in the T20 format, but batsman Suryakumar Yadav also remains in the fray for the role.\n\nRohit succeeded Kohli as white-ball skipper in 2021 and became all-format captain months later with BCCI and fans getting uneasy over India's global title drought since their Champions Trophy win in 2013.\n\nBut Pandya said there was \"a lot of time\" before the next T20 World Cup in 2026 for India to prepare.\n\n\"I am very happy for both

I wanted to make the most of it. And this was our aim. We wanted to win an ICC tournament, we wanted to lift the cup.\"\n\n\"This was an open secret; it was not something that I was not going to announce if we'd lost. It's time for the next generation to take over. There are some amazing players playing in India. I've no doubts they'll keep the flag waving high, and really take this team further from here now,\" he added.\n\nKohli played 125 T20I matches in his career, scoring 4,188 runs at an average of 48.69 and a strike rate of 137.04. He is the second-highest scorer in the format. The ace Indian batter, who made his T20I debut against Zimbabwe in 2010, is also the fastest batter to reach the 3,500-run milestone in T20Is, hitting the mark in just 96 innings.\n\nWith 1,292 runs in 35 matches, Kohli, a former Team India captain across formats, also finishes his career at the top of the run scorers' charts in T20 World Cups. He remains the only player to have been the highest run scorer in two different T20 World Cups.\n\nKohli scored 319 runs in the 2014 World Cup in Bangladesh and followed it up with 296 runs in the 2022 edition in Australia. His 319 runs in 2014, scored at an average of 106.33, is the highest run tally for any batsman at a single edition of the T20 World Cup. He was also named in the ICC Men's T20I Team of the Decade from 2011 to 2020.\n\nRohit Sharma, with 4,231 runs in 159 outings, has accumulated more runs in the T20I format than Kohli. Rohit made his T20I debut in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2007 against England and helped India win the trophy under M.S. Dhoni's captaincy.\n\nConfirming his decision to retire from T20 International cricket in the press conference following the T20 World Cup win, Rohit Sharma said, \"This was my last (T20) game as well... No better time to say goodbye to this format. I've loved every moment of this. I started my India career playing this format. This is what I wanted; I wanted to win the cup.\"\n\n\"I wanted this badly. Very hard to put in words. It was a very emotional moment for me. I was very desperate for this title in my life. Happy that we eventually crossed the line,\" Rohit added.\n\nHe doubled up at the T20 World Cup 2024, leading the Indian men's cricket team from the front as captain and finishing as his team's highest run-scorer in the tournament with 257 in eight matches. The Hitman has also scored five T20I hundreds, the most in the format alongside Australia's Glenn Maxwell.\n\nAs captain, the 37-year-old Rohit led India in 62 T20Is, winning 49 and losing only 12.

The skipper of the team posted a picture on his social media account with the trophy beside his bed on Sunday (30th June).\n\nThe cricket gods were kind to Rohit Sharma as the India captain finally had his hands on the World Cup. The India National Cricket Team won the T20 World Cup 2024 as they defeated South Africa in the final by 7 runs at the Kensington Oval in Bridgetown Barbados on Saturday (29th June).\n\nIndia captain Rohit Sharma gave his best with the bat as well as the leader throughout the tournament as he made sure that he took his team to the title win. After the team lost the final of the ICC World Cup 2023, Rohit was devasted and was in tears and now months later, he was again in tears but those were tears of joy.\n\nIndia displayed a sensational performance in the T20 World Cup 2024. They remained unbeaten throughout the tournament and then won the final from the jaws of defeat as South Africa almost stole the game with Heinrich Klaasen taking bowlers to cleaners all over the park.\n\nRohit Sharma displayed a magnificent performance as the leader of the team as he held his nerves and was spot-on with his field placements and bowling changes. The bowlers in Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, and Hardik Pandya repaid the faith of the India captain and won the game by the barest of margins.\n\nAfter the win every Indian player got emotional and then later expressed their excitement on the social media posts. The likes of Hardik Pandya, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah, and others all posted happy pictures and thanked the fans for their support throughout.\n\nHowever, skipper Rohit Sharma was silent after the win as he didn't post anything on social media. Many were waiting for the post from the captain and now he has come up with a sensational story on his Instagram account after winning the T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nRohit Sharma posted his picture on the bed with the T20 World Cup trophy around the corner. He shared the story with the caption: \"Morning everybody\".\n\nRohit Sharma gave his best for the team in the T20 World Cup 2024. He ended the tournament as the leading run-getter for his team. The opening batter showed the path to his team and led from the front. He batted with an aggressive mindset and provided team with the great starts in every game.\n\nRohit Sharma scored 257 runs in 8 matches with a strike rate of 156.70. He also slammed three fifties in the tournament and took his team to the final. The opening batter after the tournament announced his retirement and had a fairytale ending.\n\nRohit Sharma finished his T20I career as the all-time leading run-getter with 4231 runs. The skipper finished with five hundred, the most by a batter in T20I cricket. He also hit 32 fifties and had a career strike rate of 140.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Oval", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Oval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgetown", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridgetown"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bridgetown"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arshdeep_Singh_(cricketer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arshdeep Singh (cricketer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Not out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_Klaasen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heinrich Klaasen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/RohitSharmaInstagrampost.webp?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694125", "eventUri": "eng-9694125", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 244, "textEnd": 253}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 532, "textEnd": 541}], "sentiment": 0.3960784313725489, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

We all will miss them but... this is the best farewell we can give them,' Hardik Pandya, Rohit's deputy in the tournament, said after the win.\n\nRoger Binny, who was part of the 1983 World Cup-winning team and is now president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, termed the two stalwarts' exit a 'great loss'.\n\nHe said it would be tough to replace them immediately, despite India's good pool of T20 players in the Indian Premier League.\n\nKohli, 35, won his second World Cup crown after the 2011 ODI win under MS Dhoni, who also led India to title victory in T20's showpiece event in 2007 at the inaugural edition.\n\nA rookie Rohit, now 37, was part of the first T20 triumph when India beat arch-rivals Pakistan in the final in Johannesburg.\n\nThe two stalwarts, who have 45,961 runs between them across three international formats, will stay on in Test and ODI cricket.\n\nThe title clash with South Africa was also the last match for outgoing coach Rahul Dravid, a former captain who left the international stage as a player without a World Cup win.\n\nDravid, 51, said he will miss Rohit as a person more than just as a captain and player who amassed runs and records.\n\nFormer India batsman Gautam Gambhir is widely reported to succeed Dravid as coach of the high-profile Indian team.\n\nGambhir, who remained a key part of India's 2011 ODI World Cup win at home, coached IPL team Kolkata Knight Riders to their third title this year.\n\n'There was speculation that some senior players will be sent off after Gambhir comes in (as coach), but both Rohit and Kohli ended on a high note,' former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar said on his YouTube channel.\n\n'It was a good decision by both. Before anybody sacks them, or creates a doubt about their selection, a big player should decide their own fate.'\n\nThe T20 triumph has been redemption for Rohit, who was stripped of his IPL captaincy from Mumbai Indians this year.\n\nPandya was handed the leadership role, much to the disappointment of many fans.\n\nKohli proved his big-match credentials, with his 59-ball 76 in the final clash -- after he managed just 75 runs in seven innings during the competition until the finale.\n\nAll-rounder Pandya will be Rohit's likely replacement as leader in the T20 format, but batsman Suryakumar Yadav also remains in the fray for the role.\n\nRohit succeeded Kohli as white-ball skipper in 2021 and became all-format captain months later with BCCI and fans getting uneasy over India's global title drought since their Champions Trophy win in 2013.\n\nBut Pandya said there was 'a lot of time' before the next T20 World Cup in 2026 for India to prepare.\n\n'I am very happy for both Rohit and Virat, two giants and legends of Indian cricket, (they) thoroughly deserved this,' he said.", "source": {"uri": "newagebd.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Age | The Most Popular Outspoken

The victory was against South Africa, with India winning by a narrow margin of seven runs in Barbados. This triumph was not just a testament to the team's skill and determination, but also a moment of redemption after coming agonisingly close to winning the tournament on several occasions since their maiden victory in 2007.\n\nThe victory was particularly special for the current squad, who had dominated the tournament and etched their names into the record books. The team, led by skipper Rohit Sharma, showcased a level of cricket that was both thrilling and strategic, leading to a series of records being set during the campaign.\n\nIndia became only the third team to lift the iconic T20 World Cup trophy multiple times, joining the ranks of West Indies and England. This achievement was further amplified by the fact that India managed to go undefeated throughout the tournament, a feat that had only been achieved by four teams in the past, but none had managed to win the final.\n\nIndia's Record-Breaking Performance\n\nThe Indian team's performance was bolstered by the exceptional contributions of its players. Virat Kohli, known for his aggressive batting style and strategic acumen, made a significant 76-run contribution in the first innings. This powered India's total to 176, the highest score ever in a T20 World Cup final, surpassing Australia's 173 set in the 2021 World Cup finals. Kohli's performance not only helped India secure the title but also cemented his legacy as one of the best batters in the history of the T20 World Cup.\n\nRohit Sharma, the team's captain, also made history by becoming the first player to win the trophy both as a player and as a captain. This achievement was even more remarkable considering that Sharma is one of only two players to have played in all nine editions of the tournament. His leadership was further validated when he became the first captain to win 50 matches in T20I history.\n\nIndia's pace spearhead, Jasprit Bumrah, was another standout performer. He became the first out-and-out bowler to win the Player of the Tournament at the T20 World Cup, thanks to his phenomenal bowling effort throughout the tournament. Bumrah maintained an unbelievable economy of 4.17 throughout the competition, the lowest economy rate in a T20 World Cup edition.\n\nA Victory for the Ages\n\nThe victory also saw India breaking the record for most matches won during a single edition with eight games to their name. This achievement was a testament to the team's consistency and dominance throughout the tournament.\n\nThe Indian cricket team's victory in the 2024 T20 World Cup was not just a win for the players and the coaching staff, but also for the millions of fans who had been waiting for this moment for 17 years. The win was a testament to the team's hard work, determination, and the never-give-up attitude that has become synonymous with Indian cricket.\n\nThe victory also marked a significant moment for Indian cricket off the field. The team's success in the T20 World Cup has sparked a renewed interest in the sport in India, with more young people taking up cricket and aspiring to represent their country on the international stage.\n\nIn conclusion, India's victory in the 2024 T20 World Cup was a historic moment that will be remembered for years to come. The team's performance throughout the tournament was a testament to their skill, determination, and the spirit of cricket. The records set during the campaign will serve as a benchmark for future teams, and the victory will undoubtedly inspire a new generation of cricketers in India. This victory is a testament to the team's hard work, determination, and the spirit of cricket that is deeply ingrained in the fabric of Indian society.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.co.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times, India Edition"}, "authors": [{"uri": "qurat_ull_ann@ibtimes.co.in", "name": "Qurat Ull Ann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Indies cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bowling (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/799841/india-wins-icc-mens-t20-cricket-world-cup.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694125", "eventUri": "eng-9694125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

This Indian cricket team came with the baggage of having lost a home ODI World Cup final six months or so back, had been royally humbled by England in the 2022 World Cup semi-finals and were looking to end a World Cup trophy drought that had lasted for 13 years.\n\nT20 can be a fickle format. It reduces the gap between the best teams and the not so good ones. A couple of bad overs here and there are enough to tilt the scales of the match. Both India and South Africa were coming off an unbeaten run and the bowlers of both teams were the reason behind them reaching the final.\n\nIn what was a high intensity seesaw battle, Heinrich Klaasen almost managed to break the morale of the Indian team and fans in the same way that has earned him the reputation of being one of the best white ball players at present. This time though, the script had a different ending. One, that did not have India as runners up.\n\nAs Hardik Pandya ran in to bowl the last over, almost all Indian cricket lovers had their hearts racing. When the full-toss off the first ball went up in the air from David Miller's bat, a few of us thought it was all over. For when its in Miller's arc, it goes out of the park. Out of nowhere came Surya Kumar Yadav, arguably India's best T20 batter, whose place was worth questioning in the 50 over World Cup squad, and juggled a catch in the boundary. \"By the barest of margins,\" in Ian Smith's words from the 2019 ODI World Cup final, Surya's feet missed touching the boundary cushions. That was the catch that sealed the match!\n\nIndia - the powerhouse of cricket, the largest revenue earner for the ICC, runners up at two World Test Championships and an ODI World Cup, finally won an ICC Trophy after 11 long years and a World Cup after 13 years. Yes, they had reached the number team ranking across formats multiple times during these 10 years, but the trophy cabinet had nothing to show for. It is important to remember that IPL wins do not get classified as World Cup wins!\n\nTo see the outpour of emotions from the team who had failed to cross the final hurdle multiple times in the last three years was worth staying up late in the night for. To see two of India's modern day greats in Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma call it quits in this format on the day they won a World Cup, seemed appropriate.\n\nFor a 90's kid who grew up watching and admiring Rahul Dravid, the ecstasy of seeing his emotions upon holding the trophy aloft, as a head coach, in the same region where he captained India to an unceremonious first round exit in the 2007 ODI World Cup cannot be described in words. I am sure there were plenty more like me who shed a tear seeing the happiness on his face.\n\nT20 World Cups come thick and fast. The next one will be here even before one realizes it. This win does not take away the hurt from the 50 over final defeat, but it certainly covers up the wounds to an extent. More importantly, it allows players to breathe a sigh of relief. It allows them to let the feeling of being \"World Champions\" sink in. You do not win a World Cup every day. Running the most cash-rich high profile global T20 tournament does not win you ICC titles by default. Team India have learnt this the hard way.\n\nHopefully, the new coach and captain combination can work with the same attitude and ensure that the next title does not take this long to come! Farewell in T20I cricket, Rohit and Kohli. Thank you Rahul Dravid, for giving us a glimpse of emotions which we have long craved to see! More importantly, congratulations Team India!

The Indian cricket team had just faced one of its most disappointing days, exiting the ODI World Cup after failing to chase a modest target on a seemingly harmless pitch.\n\nFast forward 17 years, and on his final day as India's head coach, Dravid leapt out of his chair as Anrich Nortje hit Hardik Pandya for a single to deep midwicket.\n\nSouth Africa needed 30 off 30 balls with six wickets in hand to win its maiden World Cup title, but Dravid's India fought back to end an 11-year wait for an ICC title.\n\nIndia was the world champion again.\n\nIndia captain Rohit Sharma accepted the trophy he first won as a rookie player back in 2007. In many ways, he forged this white-ball team in his image.\n\nA young Rohit Sharma during the 2007 T20 World Cup. | Photo Credit: Getty Images\n\nA young Rohit Sharma during the 2007 T20 World Cup. | Photo Credit: Getty Images\n\nHaving won his first ICC trophy as captain, Rohit announced his retirement from T20Is. Moments earlier, Virat Kohli had ended his T20 international career, breaking the news shortly after receiving the Player of the Match award for his 59-ball 76 in India's seven-run victory.\n\nTheir retirements, following the T20 World Cup win in Bridgetown, represent a poignant and poetic full circle. For well over a decade, Kohli and Rohit have been at the forefront of India's stellar achievements in international cricket.\n\nA second T20 world title was something both were chasing desperately, especially after the gut-wrenching defeat in the 50-over final last year. Now that the T20 World Cup trophy is in the cabinet, they've passed the baton to the next generation of T20 cricketers.\n\nRELATED: Jasprit Bumrah peers into future to drag India back from dead\n\nTwo promising talents, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rinku Singh, who have already been initiated into the T20 scheme, did not get a game in this tournament but have undoubtedly learned a lot by watching the seniors play. It's now time for them to make their own memories.\n\nThe path is now clear for India's young talent to take over the T20 reins. | Photo Credit: K. MURALI KUMAR\n\nThe path is now clear for India's young talent to take over the T20 reins. | Photo Credit: K. MURALI KUMAR\n\nTactically, the retirements of Rohit and Kohli open up numerous possibilities for the side. The team now has the chance to establish a new T20I opening combination, with Jaiswal seemingly having secured one spot.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav can move to No. 3, while Rinku Singh can be slotted in as a death-overs power-hitter. His ability to take down pace bowlers from overs 17-20 will make his inclusion even more enticing.\n\nThe performance of spin-bowling all-rounder Axar Patel, both with the ball and the bat, has been outstanding, highlighted by his crucial 47 in the final. This will be hard to overlook, especially considering Ravindra Jadeja's below-par campaign.\n\nAxar's electrifying fielding is an added bonus, further enhancing his value to the team. It was a moment of redemption for all-rounder Hardik Pandya.\n\nAfter a challenging IPL 2024 campaign, both as captain and player, he redeemed himself spectacularly in this competition. He capped it off by successfully defending 15 runs in the last over. Hardik finished the tournament with 144 runs and 11 wickets in eight matches.\n\nRELATED: Axar Patel's batting beyond a footnote in ending India's World Cup drought\n\nMeanwhile, it was heartbreak once again for South Africa at the final hurdle. The Proteas needed 26 runs from 24 balls to chase down a target of 177, but the wicket of Heinrich Klaasen, who scored 52 from 27 balls, shifted the momentum dramatically in India's favor.\n\nThis match could well have been Quinton de Kock's final international appearance for his country, adding to the disappointment of missing the chance to usher in a new era for South African cricket. Despite the loss, there were many positives for the team, including Klaasen's excellent form, Aiden Markram's captaincy skills, and Ottniel Baartman's impressive bowling.\n\nA dejected South African team after the final defeat. | Photo Credit: AFP\n\nA dejected South African team after the final defeat. | Photo Credit: AFP\n\nThere was more anguish in store, this time for the 2022 world champion, England, which made it to the semifinals riding on a mix of some good cricket and dollops of luck.\n\nBut in a bit of symmetry, after the events of Adelaide 2022, their run was snapped by rampant India spinners, who sent Jos Buttler's side tumbling to a 68-run defeat in Georgetown, Guyana. The low, slow surface there proved much too much for the Three Lions, whose power-hitters clearly like pace on.\n\nUnder the leadership of Jos Buttler and head coach Matthew Mott, England has lost both its white-ball world titles in the past seven months. Mott, who was appointed as the white-ball coach in 2022, quickly led the team to victory in the T20 World Cup in Australia.\n\nHowever, since then, the results have been mixed, raising questions about whether Mott will remain in charge for the upcoming series against Australia in September.\n\nWith no T20 World Cup for the next two years, England has time to reassess. The next edition will be held in India and Sri Lanka, where England is familiar with the conditions and will know how to improve.\n\nALSO READ: England announces squad for home Tests vs West Indies; Woakes returns; Bairstow, Wood dropped\n\nAdditionally, the Champions Trophy in Pakistan next year will also feature slow, low pitches, similar to those that have recently exposed England's inability to perform on such surfaces.\n\nRob Key, the managing director of England men's cricket, faces a considerable challenge ahead. A complete reboot could be on the cards, including debates over Buttler's captaincy.\n\nEngland's Jos Buttler and his team after the semifinal loss to India. | Photo Credit: Getty Images\n\nEngland's Jos Buttler and his team after the semifinal loss to India. | Photo Credit: Getty Images\n\nEngland's arch-rival, Australia, fared even worse, crashing out after back-to-back losses in the Super 8s and failing to reach the finals of the ICC flagship event for the second consecutive time.\n\nDavid Warner's departure leaves a significant gap at the top of the order. The 37-year-old exits as his country's leading men's T20I run-scorer, amassing 3,277 runs at an average of 33.43.\n\nJake Fraser-McGurk is likely to fill Warner's spot. Fraser-McGurk impressed during the last IPL season, representing the Delhi Capitals and scoring 330 runs in nine innings at a strike rate exceeding 200.\n\nWarner even posted a photo on social media of the pair drinking by the pool with the caption -- 'All yours now, champion'.\n\nThe Australian selectors must also consider the ageing squad, as only Tim David (28) and Nathan Ellis (29) were under 30 among the 13 players used in this T20 World Cup. By the time of the next edition, Glenn Maxwell will be 37, Marcus Stoinis 36, Mitchell Starc 36, and Josh Hazlewood 35, indicating that the T20 team may need a significant overhaul.\n\nAustralia's David Warner played his last international match this T20 World Cup. | Photo Credit: AFP\n\nAustralia's David Warner played his last international match this T20 World Cup. | Photo Credit: AFP\n\nMeanwhile, the early exit of co-host West Indies robbed the event of its festive fervour. Though fans were disappointed with the result, they could not fault the effort.\n\nRovman Powell's men, serenaded by Calypso legend David Rudder's live rendition of the anthem, Rally Round the West Indies, before the games, brought large crowds back to the stadium.\n\nALSO READ: T20 World Cup Diary: Cricket, rum and Bajan hospitality - true spirit of Barbados\n\n\"When you look on a large scale, we haven't won the World Cup. We aren't in the semi-finals,\" Powell had said earlier. \"But I think the cricket we have played in the last 12 months is commendable. Credit has to be given to the team. If you can move from number 9 to number 3 in the world in a year, that's tremendous work.\"\n\nPowell is right. Since March last year, West Indies has won multiple series against South Africa (away), India, England, and South Africa (at home).\n\nEven in its only series defeat, against Australia, its batters racked up scores of 202, 207, and 220. This is a side that can challenge for the title in the future, led by the likes of Nicholas Pooran, Powell, Akeal Hosein, and Alzarri Joseph.\n\nWest Indies' Roston Chase and Rovman Powell. | Photo Credit: AP\n\nWest Indies' Roston Chase and Rovman Powell. | Photo Credit: AP\n\nMeanwhile, co-host USA's dream run to the Super 8s will remain one of the lasting moments of this tournament, and its win over Pakistan a seminal event.\n\nHaving already won its first match at a T20 World Cup by beating Canada, USA held its nerve in a Super Over to defeat the 2022 finalist. USA even ran South Africa close in its opening Super 8 match before being comprehensively beaten by West Indies and England.\n\nBy qualifying for the Super 8s, the USA secured direct entry to the next edition in 2026. However, it currently has no fixtures planned against major cricketing nations before that tournament. Securing victories against stronger teams will be a top priority, but the players also need to adapt to different conditions and pitches.\n\nRELATED: A second coming for their second home in the T20 World Cup 2024\n\nThe drop-in wickets at Nassau County International Cricket Stadium drew criticism for their poor quality, leading to low-scoring matches. This was evident after just two games at the venue, with South Africa bowling Sri Lanka out for 77 -- its lowest T20 score -- and India dismissing Ireland for 96.\n\nConsequently, the toss in New York became pivotal, with the team bowling first gaining a significant advantage. Eight of the 16 matches in the USA leg were allotted to New York, which included the marquee India vs Pakistan match. It is thus evident that besides investment in talent, USA also needs to up its game when it comes to the holistic upliftment of cricket infrastructure to compete with the best.\n\nTeam Afghanistan after its loss to South Africa in the semifinal. | Photo Credit: REUTERS\n\nTeam Afghanistan after its loss to South Africa in the semifinal. | Photo Credit: REUTERS\n\nThe World Cup was illuminated by many more such remarkable moments. Like when Afghanistan killed two birds with one stone by defeating Bangladesh, thereby knocking both Bangladesh and Australia out of the tournament.\n\nAfghanistan's first semifinal appearance in an ICC event reaffirms its remarkable progress since qualifying for the T20 World Cup for the first time in 2010. Another highlight was Uganda's qualification and participation in its maiden T20 World Cup, having risen through the ranks in the Africa Qualifier.\n\nOn the other hand, the early exits of Pakistan and Sri Lanka in the first round should prompt introspection regarding their team compositions and strategies.\n\nThere is a compelling case to be made here for this being one of the most engaging tournaments in recent years, with an expanded pool of 20 teams. While there's still work to be done in terms of scheduling matches, engaging a wider audience, and enhancing the spectator experience, the excitement and unpredictability of the competition were undeniable.\n\nAfter nearly a month of traversing the Americas and playing 55 matches, the fact that the winner was decided on the last ball of the final is a win for the sport.\n\nLatest on

He referenced what transpired in Melbourne back in the 2022 T20 World Cup where he single-handedly won India the game against Pakistan. He considered the T20 World Cup 2024 his farewell from international T20s, believing it's the right moment to retire after a fulfilling career.\n\n\"Honestly, more than the award, what struck me today is significant. As I told you in Melbourne, you think you're in control, but moments like these remind you that so much is beyond your control. In such times, humility and respect for the game and the occasion are all you can rely on to move forward. This experience has been a profound lesson for me, even at this stage of my career, in my last T20 International. This is my last T20 World Cup for India and this is the perfect finish.

After a 2023 calendar year full of heartbreaks and setbacks, Virat and Rohit felt all the emotions yesterday at the Kensington Oval in Barbados.\n\nIt's where Rohit Sharma laid the foundation and placed the Indian flag on Barbadian soil along with Hardik Pandya BCCI Secretary Jay Shah. Whereas Virat Kohli proved his mettle early on in the game with his bat. The 35-year-old became the second cricketer from New Delhi, after Gautam Gambhir, to score 70+ in a World T20 final.\n\nEven though Gambhir didn't get the Man of the Match award but Virat Kohli also went level with Irfan Pathan as the Players of the T20 WC final. Both Rohit and Virat were enjoying the achievements, milestones, glory, and respect they have earned from the Indian population.\n\nThe T20 World Cup was a huge motivation for them to leave the hustle and bustle of the nature of this format. It will be fair to say that we will be seeing Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma trying to win those that missed out last year - the WTC and the ODI World Cup on home soil.\n\nWith Gautam Gambhir expected to be coming in as the head coach, we all can expect him to work with Virat and Rohit to win bigger prizes. The title they are closest to playing is the ICC Champions Trophy, which had remained as the last trophy of Indian cricket before yesterday's antics in Barbados.\n\nBut for a fact, the occasion would be big too if the Indian team is allowed to travel to Pakistan next year for the 8-team tournament. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma winning the competition on Pakistani soil is a die-hard Cricket fan's wildest dream. But whatever it may be, Suryakumar Yadav had something to say about their T20 retirement.\n\nWhile speaking to Sportstak after the final, Suryakumar Yadav opined that Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli were prepared for their retirements. Suryakumar claimed that the legendary duo could not have had a better moment than that to say goodbye to the T20 format.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav also disclosed that the players in the dugout were bantering about Virat and Rohit having two more years of T20 cricket and they can play the next T20 WC.\n\n\"I think it is very difficult to leave the game at this stage but it's a big thing to do. It's good they left on a high but while sitting at the dugout we were saying that they still have 2 and a half years as the next T20 World Cup is in India, but I guess they had made up their minds before the final and there can not be a better moment than this,\" Suryakumar Yadav told Sportstak.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suryakumar_Yadav", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Suryakumar Yadav"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautam_Gambhir", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gautam Gambhir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Oval", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kensington Oval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irfan_Pathan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Irfan Pathan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Champions_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ICC Champions Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/ViratKohliRohitSharma.jpg?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694125", "eventUri": "eng-9694125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

He confidently declared, \"In 2023 (ODI World Cup final) at Ahmedabad, even though we did not win the World Cup after 10 straight wins, we won hearts. I want to promise you that in 2024 (T20 World Cup), under Rohit Sharma's captaincy, we will hoist the Indian flag in Barbados.\"\n\nIndia's Journey to Glory\n\nIndia had a fantastic run in the 2023 ODI World Cup under the leadership of Rohit Sharma. They won the semifinal match against New Zealand with ease and dominated the league stage. But in the end, they were defeated by Australia in the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad by a margin of six wickets.\n\nRohit Sharma was India's most dependable hitter throughout the tournament, even though he got out for nine in the T20 World Cup final. Rohit became the tournament's second-highest run scorer after amassing 257 runs in eight innings at a remarkable average of 36.71 and strike rate of 156.71. His clutch 57 off 39 in the semifinal match against England and his explosive 92 off 41 balls against Australia in the Super 8 stage were key in leading India to the championship.\n\nThe Grand Finale: India vs. South Africa\n\nIndia scored a competitive total of 176-7 in the decisive match against South Africa. The bowlers then put on a controlled display to limit the Proteas to 169-8, earning the trophy and a thrilling triumph by a margin of only seven runs.\n\nFollowing India's historic victory, Jay Shah's February 2024 video, in which he prophesied this momentous occasion, went viral very quickly, contributing to the festive mood. For Indian cricket fans around the world, the Men in Blue's victory under Rohit Sharma's captaincy was historic since it not only delivered on Shah's promise but also ended India's quest for an ICC

It was only India's 4th World Cup title after the 1983, 2007, and 2011 triumphs but all the fans and former cricketers had to wait for a long time for this.\n\nRohit Sharma will go down as only the 3rd Indian captain to have won an ICC trophy and this one would have definitely felt very good. Last year, team India were just one step away from becoming World Champions in the longest as well as second longest formats but on both occasions - Australia defeated Rohit and co. in the finals of WTC and ODI World Cup 2023.\n\nThe entire nation was taken aback by the way things panned out for the Indian team last year but all of that has been sufficed at last. Rohit Sharma, who was a part of the Men in Blue when they won the inaugural T20 WC edition 2007, will finish his T20I career with another World T20 title.\n\nSome players in the team won this coveted silverware for the very first time. The most notable names are of Virat Kohli, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, and Jasprit Bumrah among others. All of their efforts made sense at the end of the day.\n\nAll the players who played a key role in this World Cup triumph actually fulfilled BCCI Honorable Secretary Jay Shah's prophecy.\n\nEarlier this year in February when England were on a 5-match Test series tour of India, Jay Shah had attended a ceremony on the eve of the 4th Test. Shah was there to felicitate some players from Gujarat and also held a reception for the renaming of the stadium in Rajkot.\n\nIt was during his media address that Jay Shah delivered one of the biggest statements ever made by a BCCI official. He started off by saying that people wanted to hear from him as to what he thinks of India's dream campaign in the Cricket World Cup 2023.\n\nJay Shah backed his players and said that even if they had lost the World Cup, they certainly won the hearts of countless Indian fans. Shah then claimed that he has a strong belief that the Indian team, under Rohit Sharma's captaincy, is going to hoist the Indian flag in the final of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 in Barbados. And so yesterday they did.\n\nAfter India completed the enthralling victory over South Africa, Rohit Sharma was seen digging up a hole in the ground to place the Indian flag. Rohit was then joined by vice-captain Hardik Pandya and Jay Shah as the trio took a picture together.", "source": {"uri": "cricketaddictor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CricketAddictor"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Shah", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jay Shah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cricket World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Control_for_Cricket_in_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Board of Control for Cricket in India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbados", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Barbados"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aiden_Markram", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aiden Markram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardik_Pandya", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hardik Pandya"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flag of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cricket_Council", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Cricket Council"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rishabh_Pant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rishabh Pant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasprit_Bumrah", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jasprit Bumrah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia national cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gujarat"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkot", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajkot"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rajkot"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Kabbadi", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.cricketaddictor.com/images/2024/HardikPandya%2CJayShahandRohitSharma.jpg?q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694125", "eventUri": "eng-9694125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

According to News18 CricketNext, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) officials are planning a meet-up of Team India players with PM Narendra Modi and a majority of the players, barring Sanju Samson and Yashasvi Jaiswal is expected to attend the meet.\n\nBoth Samson and Jaiswal are part of India's squad for the upcoming T20I series against Zimbabwe in the African nation. The India-Zimbabwe series will begin on 6 July in Harare.\n\nPM Modi had spoken to India head coach Rahul Dravid and captain Rohit Sharma following India's seven-run win over South Africa in the T20 World Cup final on Saturday.\n\nThis is India's first T20 World Cup title win since 2007, the only other time the Men in Blue had won the showpiece event. This was also India's first ICC trophy win since their Champions Trophy triumph in 2013 , when they had beaten England in the final under MS Dhoni's captaincy.\n\nIndia had won the toss in the final against South Africa and opted to bat first. Although the Men in Blue were off to a worrying start as they were reduced to 35/3, Virat Kohli (76) and Axar Patel (47) stitched a 72-run stand for the fourth wicket to guide India to 176/7. In reply, despite gritty fightbacks from Heinrich Klaasen (53), Quinton de Kock (39) and Tristan Stubbs (31), some fine death bowling from Hardik Pandya (3/20), Jasprit Bumrah (2/20) and Arshdeep Singh (2/18) eventually helped India edge the Proteas and clinch the title.\n\nSuryakumar Yadav's stunning catch to dismiss David Miller off Hardik Pandya's ball in the final over of the run chase changed the complexion of the game and set the tone for India's win.

Debuting in the T20 World Cup 2007 and retiring in the T20 World Cup 2024, Rohit has come full circle, evolving from a young, talented batter to a mature, winning captain. Now, it's time to pass on the legacy, and these five players have the talent to carve out their own place in the team.\n\nShubman Gill is likely to return to India's T20 squad and be considered a future captain following Rohit Sharma's departure. Although his captaincy for Gujarat Titans in IPL 2024 was not outstanding, he excelled with the bat. Gill will lead India in an upcoming five-match series in Zimbabwe. In 14 T20 matches, he has scored 335 runs.\n\nAbhishek Sharma is another choice for India. The left-handed batter proved his worth in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024, scoring 484 runs at an average of 32.27 and an outstanding strike rate of 204.22.\n\nYashasvi Jaiswal's inclusion in the team is certain. If Virat Kohli hadn't opened the batting, Jaiswal would have been in the team. He will now be the first choice for the opening batter. His aggressive batting will be an asset for India.\n\nRuturaj Gaikwad, a strong contender for a leadership role, has scored 500 runs in 19 T20Is for India. Despite inconsistency at the national level, his solid IPL performances and leadership with Chennai Super Kings, where he scored 583 runs in 14 matches, highlight his potential.\n\nSai Sudharsan is another talented opener with outstanding records in T20Is. He has scored 1503 runs at an average of 40.62 and a strike rate of 130.69 in the T20 format.", "source": {"uri": "insidesport.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inside Sport India"}, "authors": [{"uri": "payal_tomar@insidesport.in", "name": "Payal Tomar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICC_Men's_T20_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ICC Men's T20 World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rohit Sharma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Captain (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20_International", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20 International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty20", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twenty20"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cricket"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gujarat Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting order (cricket)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shubman_Gill", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shubman Gill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Sharma_(cricketer,_born_2000)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Sharma (cricketer, born 2000)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Zimbabwe"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sai_Sudharsan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sai Sudharsan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yashasvi_Jaiswal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Yashasvi Jaiswal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruturaj_Gaikwad", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ruturaj Gaikwad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chennai Super Kings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virat_Kohli", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virat Kohli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Ratings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Players", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://d16f573ilcot6q.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/rohit-4.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9694125", "eventUri": "eng-9694125", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

Following the win, Rohit walked to the Indian dugout to meet Ritika and daughter Samaira and the family shared an emotional moment.\n\nA few hours after the thrilling finale, Ritika also took to social media and hailed Team India over their massive effort.\n\n\"No words.... Just emotions and pride! So much to say but can't find the words yet..... These boys, this team,\" she wrote.\n\nDuring the post-match press conference, Rohit announced his retirement from T20I format.\n\nThe Men in Blue got hold of the prestigious T20 WC trophy for the second time, defeating South Africa by seven runs in Barbados.\n\nWith 4231 runs in 159 games, Rohit is the format's best scorer going out.

The Men in Blue had their back against the wall after being reduced to 34 for 3 inside the powerplay. However, Virat Kohli roared back to form and let his bat do the talking on the grand stage once again.\n\nThe former India skipper, who had been facing severe criticism for his poor run with the bat in the tournament, went on to play a brilliant knock of 76 runs to guide the team to 176 for 7. Axar Patel also played a crucial knock of 47 runs for the team.\n\nIn reply, South Africa lost two wickets inside the powerplay as well but recovered soon. Heinrich Klaasen scored a whirlwind fifty to put his team in the driver's seat. At one stage, the Proteas were on 151 for 4 and needed only 26 runs from the last 4 overs with Klaasen and David Miller batting in the middle. However, India's bowlers staged a remarkable comeback to restrict South Africa to 169 for 8.\n\nAfter Rohit Sharma brilliantly led India to victory in the T20 World Cup 2024 final, Yuvraj Singh and his former India teammate Mohammad Kaif heaped praise on him. On Sunday (June 30), Kaif took to X (formerly Twitter) to post a video in which he and Yuvraj Singh congratulated Team India and praised the players, especially captain Rohit Sharma.\n\nKaif started by praising Rohit Sharma not only for his captaincy but also for his man-management and his batting in the tournament. The former India batter also complimented head coach Rahul Dravid on the memorable win.\n\nOn the other hand, Yuvraj Singh said: \"I am very happy for Rohit Sharma. He's a brilliant captain. Towards the end when the match was in a critical situation, he brought Bumrah in at the right moment, and that changed the game.\n\n\"Winning from there was a huge achievement. I am very happy for the guy, very happy for coach Rahul Dravid, and Virat Kohli,\" added Yuvraj Singh.\n\nThe legendary batsman then went on to hail Rohit Sharma as the number one captain, saying: \"Captain Rohit Sharma, love the guy.

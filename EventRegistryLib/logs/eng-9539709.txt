In Polk County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of Houston, officials said there had been more than 100 water rescues in the previous few days.\n\nChannelview Fire Department and sheriffs get ready to help evacuate the area due to severe flooding, Saturday, May 4, 2024, in Channelview, Texas. (Raquel Natalicchio/Houston Chronicle via AP)\n\nHOUSTON PRONE TO FLOODING\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nOf particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River, which was expected to continue rising as more rain falls and officials release water from a full reservoir. Hidalgo issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for people living along portions of the river.\n\nThe weather service reported the river was at nearly 74 feet (22.6 meters) late Saturday morning after reaching nearly 78 feet (23.7 meters). The rapidly changing forecast said the river was expected to fall to near flood stage of 58 feet (17.6 meters) by Thursday.\n\nMost of Houston's city limits were not heavily impacted by the weather. Officials said the area received about four months' worth of rain in about a week's time.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers), a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nWater could be seen flowing into parts of the couple's subdivision, but Aron Brown said he wasn't worried because their home is at a higher elevation than others in the neighborhood.\n\nBrown, who drove from his home in a golf cart, said the flooding wasn't as bad as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. He pointed to nearby power lines and said flooding during Harvey reached the top of the lines.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors":

The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nOf particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River, which was expected to continue rising as more rain falls and officials release water from a full reservoir. Hidalgo issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for people living along portions of the river.\n\nThe weather service reported the river was at nearly 74 feet (22.6 meters) late Saturday morning after reaching nearly 78 feet (23.7 meters). The rapidly changing forecast said the river was expected to fall to near flood stage of 58 feet (17.6 meters) by Thursday.\n\nMost of Houston's city limits were not heavily impacted by the weather. Officials said the area received about four months' worth of rain in about a week's time. The greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers), a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown. The system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nWater could be seen flowing into parts of the couple's subdivision, but Aron Brown said he wasn't worried because their home is at a higher elevation than others in the neighborhood.\n\nBrown, who drove from his home in a golf cart, said the flooding wasn't as bad as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. He pointed to nearby power lines and said flooding during Harvey reached the top of the lines.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Others prepared to evacuate their property.\n\nA wide region was swamped from Houston to rural East Texas, where game wardens rode airboats through waist-high waters rescuing both people and pets who did not evacuate in time. One crew brought a family and three dogs aboard as rising waters surrounded their cars and home.\n\nA flood watch was in effect through Sunday afternoon, as forecasters predicted additional rainfall Saturday night and the likelihood of major flooding.\n\n\"It's going to keep rising this way,\" said Miguel Flores Jr., of the northeast Houston neighborhood of Kingwood. \"We don't know how much more. We're just preparing for the worst.\"\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nWater could be seen flowing into parts of the couple's subdivision, but Aron Brown said he wasn't worried because their home is at a higher elevation than others in the neighborhood.\n\nBrown, who had driven from his home in a golf cart, said the flooding wasn't as bad as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. He pointed to nearby power lines and said that flooding during Harvey had reached the top of the lines.\n\nResidents in low-lying areas asked to evacuate\n\nFriday's fierce storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes. Officials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.\n\n\"A lull in heavy rain is expected through (Saturday) evening,\" according to the National Weather Service. \"The next round of heavy rainfall is expected late (Saturday) into Sunday.\"\n\nUp to 3 inches of additional rain was expected, with up to 5 inches possible in isolated areas.\n\nHarris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said more rain was expected Sunday, and if it's a lot, it could be problematic. Hidalgo is the top elected official in the nation's third-largest county.\n\nOngoing rain leaves parts of Texas drenched, residents trapped\n\nMost weekends, Miguel Flores Sr. is mowing his huge backyard on a 2.5-acre lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family were loading several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.\n\nWater from the San Jacinto River had already swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise -- what was about 1 foot high in the yard Friday measured about 4 feet the following day.\n\n\"It's sad, but what can I do?\" Flores said. He added that he has flood insurance.\n\nFor weeks, drenching rains in Texas and parts of Louisiana have filled reservoirs and saturated the ground. Floodwaters partially submerged cars and roads this week across parts of southeastern Texas, north of Houston, reaching the roofs of some homes.\n\nMore than 21 inches fell over a five-day period through Friday in Liberty County near the city of Splendora, about 30 miles northeast of Houston, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nHidalgo said Saturday that 178 people and 122 pets have been rescued so far in the county. Scores of rescues took place in neighboring Montgomery County. In Polk County, about 100 miles northeast of Houston, officials said they have done over 100 water rescues in the past few days.\n\nHouston one of the most flood-prone metro areas in U.S.\n\nAuthorities in Houston have not reported any deaths or injuries. The city of more than 2 million people is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country and has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nOf particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River, which was expected to continue rising as more rain falls and officials release water from a full reservoir. Hidalgo issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for people living along portions of the river.\n\nThe weather service reported that the river was at nearly 74 feet late Saturday morning after reaching nearly 78 feet. The rapidly changing forecast said the river was expected to fall to near flood stage of 58 feet by Thursday.\n\nMost of Houston's city limits were not heavily impacted by the weather. Officials said the area received about four months' worth of rain in about a week's time.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles -- a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles of channels, creeks and bayous that drain into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news",

Others prepared to evacuate their properties.\n\nA flood watch remained in effect through Sunday afternoon as forecasters predicted additional rainfall Saturday night and the likelihood of major flooding in Harris County, the nation\u00b4s third-largest county which includes Houston, and nearby areas.\n\n\"A lull in heavy rain is expected through (Saturday) evening,\" the National Weather Service reported. \"The next round of heavy rainfall is expected late (Saturday) into Sunday.\"\n\nUp to 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of additional rain was expected, with up to 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) possible in isolated areas.\n\nHouston authorities have not reported any deaths or injuries. Judge Lina Hidalgo, Harris County\u00b4s top elected official, said Saturday that 178 people and 122 pets had been rescued so far in the county.\n\nA wide region has been swamped from Houston to rural East Texas, where game wardens rode airboats through waist-high waters rescuing people and pets who did not evacuate in time. One crew brought a family and three dogs aboard as rising waters surrounded their cars and home.\n\nTexas Parks & Wildlife Department game wardens use a boat to rescue residents from floodwaters in Liberty County, Texas, on Saturday, May 4, 2024. (AP Photo/Lekan Oyekanmi)\n\n\"It\u00b4s going to keep rising this way,\" said Miguel Flores Jr., of the northeast Houston neighborhood of Kingwood. \"We don\u00b4t know how much more. We\u00b4re just preparing for the worst.\"\n\nFriday\u00b4s fierce storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes. Officials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.\n\nMost weekends Flores' father, Miguel Flores Sr., is mowing his huge backyard on a 2.5-acre (1-hectare) lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family loaded several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.\n\nWater from the San Jacinto River already had swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise, from about 1 foot (30 centimeters) high in the yard Friday to about 4 feet (1.2 meters) the following day.\n\n\"It\u00b4s sad, but what can I do,\" Flores said, noting that he has flood insurance.\n\nFor weeks, drenching rains in Texas and parts of Louisiana have filled reservoirs and saturated the ground. Floodwaters partially submerged cars and roads this week across parts of southeastern Texas, north of Houston, reaching the roofs of some homes.\n\nMore than 21 inches (53 centimeters) fell over a five-day period through Friday in Liberty County near the city of Splendora, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Houston, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nScores of rescues took place in neighboring Montgomery County. In Polk County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of Houston, officials said there had been more than 100 water rescues in the previous few days.\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nOf particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River, which was expected to continue rising as more rain falls and officials release water from a full reservoir. Hidalgo issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for people living along portions of the river.\n\nThe weather service reported the river was at nearly 74 feet (22.6 meters) late Saturday morning after reaching nearly 78 feet (23.7 meters). The rapidly changing forecast said the river was expected to fall to near flood stage of 58 feet (17.6 meters) by Thursday.\n\nMost of Houston\u00b4s city limits were not heavily impacted by the weather. Officials said the area received about four months' worth of rain in about a week\u00b4s time.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers), a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city\u00b4s growth and bigger storms.\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nWater could be seen flowing into parts of the couple\u00b4s subdivision, but Aron Brown said he wasn\u00b4t worried because their home is at a higher elevation than others in the neighborhood.\n\nBrown, who drove from his home in a golf cart, said the flooding wasn\u00b4t as bad as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. He pointed to nearby power lines and said flooding during Harvey reached the top of the lines.\n\nThe Associated Press\u00b4 climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Others prepared to evacuate their property.\n\nA wide region was swamped from Houston to rural East Texas, where game wardens rode airboats through waist-high waters rescuing both people and pets who did not evacuate in time. One crew brought a family and three dogs aboard as rising waters surrounded their cars and home.\n\nA flood watch was in effect through Sunday afternoon, as forecasters predicted additional rainfall Saturday night and the likelihood of major flooding.\n\nREAD: Heavy rains in Texas close schools, flood roadways\n\n\"It's going to keep rising this way,\" said Miguel Flores Jr., of the northeast Houston neighborhood of Kingwood. \"We don't know how much more. We're just preparing for the worst.\"\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nWater could be seen flowing into parts of the couple's subdivision, but Aron Brown said he wasn't worried because their home is at a higher elevation than others in the neighborhood.\n\nREAD: Heavy rains soak Texas; downpours continue drenching parts of US\n\nBrown, who had driven from his home in a golf cart, said the flooding wasn't as bad as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. He pointed to nearby power lines and said that flooding during Harvey had reached the top of the lines.\n\nResidents in low-lying areas asked to evacuate\n\nFriday's fierce storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes. Officials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.\n\n\"A lull in heavy rain is expected through (Saturday) evening,\" according to the National Weather Service. \"The next round of heavy rainfall is expected late (Saturday) into Sunday.\"\n\nUp to 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of additional rain was expected, with up to 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) possible in isolated areas.\n\nHarris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said more rain was expected Sunday, and if it's a lot, it could be problematic. Hidalgo is the top elected official in the nation's third-largest county.\n\nOngoing rain has left parts of Texas drenched, residents trapped\n\nMost weekends Flores' father, Miguel Flores Sr., is mowing his huge backyard on a 2.5-acre (1-hectare) lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family were loading several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.\n\nWater from the San Jacinto River had already swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise -- what was about 1 foot (30 centimeters) high in the yard Friday measured about 4 feet (1.2 meters) the following day.\n\n\"It's sad, but what can I do,\" Flores said. He added that he has flood insurance.\n\nFor weeks, drenching rains in Texas and parts of Louisiana have filled reservoirs and saturated the ground. Floodwaters partially submerged cars and roads this week across parts of southeastern Texas, north of Houston, reaching the roofs of some homes.\n\nMore than 21 inches (53 centimeters) fell over a five-day period through Friday in Liberty County near the city of Splendora, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Houston, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nHidalgo said Saturday that 178 people and 122 pets have been rescued so far in the county. Scores of rescues took place in neighboring Montgomery County. In Polk County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of Houston, officials said they have done over 100 water rescues in the past few days.\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the US\n\nAuthorities in Houston have not reported any deaths or injuries. The city of more than 2 million people is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country and has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nOf particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River, which was expected to continue rising as more rain falls and officials release water from a full reservoir. Hidalgo issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for people living along portions of the river.\n\nThe weather service reported that the river was at nearly 74 feet (22.6 meters) late Saturday morning after reaching nearly 78 feet (23.7 meters). The rapidly changing forecast said the river was expected to fall to near flood stage of 58 feet (17.6 meters) by Thursday.\n\nMost of Houston's city limits were not heavily impacted by the weather. Officials said the area received about four months' worth of rain in about a week's time.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers) -- a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous that drain into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.", "source": {"uri":

Others prepared to evacuate their property.\n\nA wide region was swamped from Houston to rural East Texas, where game wardens rode airboats through waist-high waters rescuing both people and pets who did not evacuate in time. One crew brought a family and three dogs aboard as rising waters surrounded their cars and home.\n\nA flood watch was in effect through Sunday afternoon, as forecasters predicted additional rainfall Saturday night and the likelihood of major flooding.\n\n\"It's going to keep rising this way,\" said Miguel Flores Jr., of the northeast Houston neighborhood of Kingwood. \"We don't know how much more. We're just preparing for the worst.\"\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nWater could be seen flowing into parts of the couple's subdivision, but Aron Brown said he wasn't worried because their home is at a higher elevation than others in the neighborhood.\n\nBrown, who had driven from his home in a golf cart, said the flooding wasn't as bad as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. He pointed to nearby power lines and said that flooding during Harvey had reached the top of the lines.\n\nFriday's fierce storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes. Officials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.\n\n\"A lull in heavy rain is expected through (Saturday) evening,\" according to the National Weather Service. \"The next round of heavy rainfall is expected late (Saturday) into Sunday.\"\n\nUp to 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of additional rain was expected, with up to 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) possible in isolated areas.\n\nHarris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said more rain was expected Sunday, and if it's a lot, it could be problematic. Hidalgo is the top elected official in the nation's third-largest county.\n\nMost weekends, Miguel Flores Sr. is mowing his huge backyard on a 2.5-acre (1-hectare) lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family were loading several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.\n\nWater from the San Jacinto River had already swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise -- what was about 1 foot (30 centimeters) high in the yard Friday measured about 4 feet (1.2 meters) the following day.\n\n\"It's sad, but what can I do,\" Flores said. He added that he has flood insurance.\n\nFor weeks, drenching rains in Texas and parts of Louisiana have filled reservoirs and saturated the ground. Floodwaters partially submerged cars and roads this week across parts of southeastern Texas, north of Houston, reaching the roofs of some homes.\n\nMore than 21 inches (53 centimeters) fell over a five-day period through Friday in Liberty County near the city of Splendora, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Houston, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nHidalgo said Saturday that 178 people and 122 pets have been rescued so far in the county. Scores of rescues took place in neighboring Montgomery County. In Polk County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of Houston, officials said they have done over 100 water rescues in the past few days.\n\nAuthorities in Houston have not reported any deaths or injuries. The city of more than 2 million people is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country and has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nOf particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River, which was expected to continue rising as more rain falls and officials release water from a full reservoir. Hidalgo issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for people living along portions of the river.\n\nThe weather service reported that the river was at nearly 74 feet (22.6 meters) late Saturday morning after reaching nearly 78 feet (23.7 meters). The rapidly changing forecast said the river was expected to fall to near flood stage of 58 feet (17.6 meters) by Thursday.\n\nMost of Houston's city limits were not heavily impacted by the weather. Officials said the area received about four months' worth of rain in about a week's time.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers) -- a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous that drain into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Others prepared to evacuate their properties.\n\nA flood watch remained in effect through Sunday afternoon as forecasters predicted additional rainfall Saturday night and the likelihood of major flooding in Harris County, the nation's third-largest county which includes Houston, and nearby areas.\n\nAlso Read | What Is FLiRT? From Symptoms to Preventive Measures, Know All About New COVID-19 Variant Spreading Fast in US.\n\n\"A lull in heavy rain is expected through (Saturday) evening,\" the National Weather Service reported. \"The next round of heavy rainfall is expected late (Saturday) into Sunday.\"\n\nUp to 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of additional rain was expected, with up to 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) possible in isolated areas.\n\nAlso Read | Brazil Rains: 56 Dead, Many Missing Due to Torrential Rains and Mudslides in Rio Grande do Sul; Rescue Operations Underway.\n\nHouston authorities have not reported any deaths or injuries. Judge Lina Hidalgo, Harris County's top elected official, said Saturday that 178 people and 122 pets had been rescued so far in the county.\n\nA wide region has been swamped from Houston to rural East Texas, where game wardens rode airboats through waist-high waters rescuing people and pets who did not evacuate in time. One crew brought a family and three dogs aboard as rising waters surrounded their cars and home.\n\n\"It's going to keep rising this way,\" said Miguel Flores Jr., of the northeast Houston neighborhood of Kingwood. \"We don't know how much more. We're just preparing for the worst.\"\n\nRAIN FORCES EVACUATIONS, TRAPS RESIDENTS\n\nFriday's fierce storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes. Officials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.\n\nMost weekends Flores' father, Miguel Flores Sr., is mowing his huge backyard on a 2.5-acre (1-hectare) lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family loaded several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.\n\nWater from the San Jacinto River already had swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise, from about 1 foot (30 centimeters) high in the yard Friday to about 4 feet (1.2 meters) the following day.\n\n\"It's sad, but what can I do,\" Flores said, noting that he has flood insurance.\n\nFor weeks, drenching rains in Texas and parts of Louisiana have filled reservoirs and saturated the ground. Floodwaters partially submerged cars and roads this week across parts of southeastern Texas, north of Houston, reaching the roofs of some homes.\n\nMore than 21 inches (53 centimeters) fell over a five-day period through Friday in Liberty County near the city of Splendora, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Houston, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nScores of rescues took place in neighboring Montgomery County. In Polk County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of Houston, officials said there had been more than 100 water rescues in the previous few days.\n\nHOUSTON PRONE TO FLOODING\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nOf particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River, which was expected to continue rising as more rain falls and officials release water from a full reservoir. Hidalgo issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for people living along portions of the river.\n\nThe weather service reported the river was at nearly 74 feet (22.6 meters) late Saturday morning after reaching nearly 78 feet (23.7 meters). The rapidly changing forecast said the river was expected to fall to near flood stage of 58 feet (17.6 meters) by Thursday.\n\nMost of Houston's city limits were not heavily impacted by the weather. Officials said the area received about four months' worth of rain in about a week's time.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers), a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nWater could be seen flowing into parts of the couple's subdivision, but Aron Brown said he wasn't worried because their home is at a higher elevation than others in the neighborhood.\n\nBrown, who drove from his home in a golf cart, said the flooding wasn't as bad as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. He pointed to nearby power lines and said flooding during Harvey reached the top of the lines.

(/Houston Chronicle via AP)\n\nBy JUAN A. LOZANO and LEKAN OYEKANMI Associated Press\n\nHOUSTON (AP) -- High waters flooded neighborhoods around Houston on Saturday following heavy rains that have already resulted in crews rescuing more than 400 people from homes, rooftops and roads engulfed in murky water. Others prepared to evacuate their property.\n\nA wide region was swamped from Houston to rural East Texas, where game wardens rode airboats through waist-high waters rescuing both people and pets who did not evacuate in time. One crew brought a family and three dogs aboard as rising waters surrounded their cars and home.\n\nA flood watch was in effect through Sunday afternoon, as forecasters predicted additional rainfall Saturday night and the likelihood of major flooding.\n\n\"It's going to keep rising this way,\" said Miguel Flores Jr., of the northeast Houston neighborhood of Kingwood. \"We don't know how much more. We're just preparing for the worst.\"\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nWater could be seen flowing into parts of the couple's subdivision, but Aron Brown said he wasn't worried because their home is at a higher elevation than others in the neighborhood.\n\nBrown, who had driven from his home in a golf cart, said the flooding wasn't as bad as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. He pointed to nearby power lines and said that flooding during Harvey had reached the top of the lines.\n\nRESIDENTS IN LOW-LYING AREAS ASKED TO EVACUATE\n\nFriday's fierce storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes. Officials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.\n\n\"A lull in heavy rain is expected through (Saturday) evening,\" according to the National Weather Service. \"The next round of heavy rainfall is expected late (Saturday) into Sunday.\"\n\nUp to 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of additional rain was expected, with up to 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) possible in isolated areas.\n\nHarris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said more rain was expected Sunday, and if it's a lot, it could be problematic. Hidalgo is the top elected official in the nation's third-largest county.\n\nONGOING RAIN HAS LEFT PARTS OF TEXAS DRENCHED, RESIDENTS TRAPPED\n\nMost weekends, Miguel Flores Sr. is mowing his huge backyard on a 2.5-acre (1-hectare) lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family were loading several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.\n\nWater from the San Jacinto River had already swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise -- what was about 1 foot (30 centimeters) high in the yard Friday measured about 4 feet (1.2 meters) the following day.\n\n\"It's sad, but what can I do,\" Flores said. He added that he has flood insurance.\n\nFor weeks, drenching rains in Texas and parts of Louisiana have filled reservoirs and saturated the ground. Floodwaters partially submerged cars and roads this week across parts of southeastern Texas, north of Houston, reaching the roofs of some homes.\n\nMore than 21 inches (53 centimeters) fell over a five-day period through Friday in Liberty County near the city of Splendora, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of Houston, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nHidalgo said Saturday that 178 people and 122 pets have been rescued so far in the county. Scores of rescues took place in neighboring Montgomery County. In Polk County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of Houston, officials said they have done over 100 water rescues in the past few days.\n\nHOUSTON IS ONE OF THE MOST FLOOD-PRONE METRO AREAS IN THE US\n\nAuthorities in Houston have not reported any deaths or injuries. The city of more than 2 million people is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country and has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nOf particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River, which was expected to continue rising as more rain falls and officials release water from a full reservoir. Hidalgo issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for people living along portions of the river.\n\nThe weather service reported that the river was at nearly 74 feet (22.6 meters) late Saturday morning after reaching nearly 78 feet (23.7 meters). The rapidly changing forecast said the river was expected to fall to near flood stage of 58 feet (17.6 meters) by Thursday.\n\nMost of Houston's city limits were not heavily impacted by the weather. Officials said the area received about four months' worth of rain in about a week's time.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers) -- a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous that drain into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

But on Saturday, he and his family were loading several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.\n\nWater from the San Jacinto River had already swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise -- what was about 1 foot (30 centimeters) high in the yard Friday measured about 4 feet (1.2 meters) the following day.\n\n\"It's sad, but what can I do,\" Flores said.

Scores of rescues took place in neighboring Montgomery County. In Polk County, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northeast of Houston, officials said they have done over 100 water rescues in the past few days.\n\nHOUSTON IS ONE OF THE MOST FLOOD-PRONE METRO AREAS IN THE US\n\nAuthorities in Houston have not reported any deaths or injuries. The city of more than 2 million people is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country and has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nOf particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River, which was expected to continue rising as more rain falls and officials release water from a full reservoir. Hidalgo issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for people living along portions of the river.\n\nThe weather service reported that the river was at nearly 74 feet (22.6 meters) late Saturday morning after reaching nearly 78 feet (23.7 meters). The rapidly changing forecast said the river was expected to fall to near flood stage of 58 feet (17.6 meters) by Thursday.\n\nMost of Houston's city limits were not heavily impacted by the weather. Officials said the area received about four months' worth of rain in about a week's time.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers) -- a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous that drain into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Houston Road, making the road impassible on Sunday, May 5, 2024, in Humble, Texas. (Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle via AP)\n\nStorms in Texas brought additional rain Sunday to the already saturated Houston area where hundreds of people have been rescued from flooded homes and roads, while to the north in the Fort Worth area, a child died after being swept away when the car he was traveling in got stuck in floodwaters.\n\nOver the last week, areas near Lake Livingston, located northeast of Houston, have gotten upwards of 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain, National Weather Service meteorologist Jimmy Fowler said on Sunday afternoon. Meanwhile, he said, areas in northeastern Harris County, the nation's third-largest county that includes Houston, had a range of 6 inches (15 centimeters) to almost 17 inches (43 centimeters) of rain in that same period.\n\nScattered showers in the Houston area on Sunday brought light to moderate rainfall, he said.\n\n\"With the rainfall that fell overnight plus this morning it just kind of prolonged the river flooding that we were experiencing,\" Fowler said.\n\nHe said the rain would taper off in the evening, with no heavy rain events expected in the next week or so.\n\nCHILD DIES IN FLOODWATERS\n\nIn Johnson County, located south of Fort Worth, a 5-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said.\n\nThe child and two adults were trying to get to dry ground when they were swept away, Jamie Moore, the Johnson County Emergency Management director, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe two adults were rescued around 5 a.m. and taken to a hospital, while the child was found dead around 7:20 a.m. in the water, Moore said.\n\nStorms brought as 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to the Dallas-Fort Worth area overnight, said National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley. He said the rains washed out some roads west of Waco.\n\nHOUSTON-AREA RIVER LEVELS\n\nOver the last few days, storms have forced numerous high-water rescues in the Houston area, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes.\n\nJeff Lindner, a meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District, said Sunday afternoon that \"things are improving slowly.\"\n\n\"We have water going down on our river systems,\" said Lindner. The San Jacinto River crested on Saturday, with its east and west forks and main stem below Lake Houston falling from 1 foot (0.30 meters) to 3 feet (0.91 meters) overnight. he said.\n\nLindner said that so far, Sunday's additional rain did not seem to be causing any new flooding. He urged people to still be cautious, noting that many areas are still flooded.\n\n\"We really need everybody to give it just another day before we feel comfortable that conditions are safe,\" Lindner said.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, was staying put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. On Saturday, he packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nMoss moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where planned to stay until the waters recede. He said Sunday that the floodwaters had already gone down by a couple of feet and that he wasn't worried his home would flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\n\"It'll be OK to go in there in the morning,\" he said.\n\nHOUSTON PRONE TO FLOODING\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country.

We're just preparing for the worst.\"\n\nHouston authorities have not reported any deaths or injuries as a wide region from Houston to rural East Texas has been swamped.\n\nFlooding forces evacuations\n\nMost weekends Flores' father, Miguel Flores Sr., is mowing his huge backyard on a 2.5-acre (1-hectare) lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family loaded several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.\n\nWater from the San Jacinto River already had swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise, from about 1 foot (30 centimeters) high in the yard Friday to about 4 feet (1.2 meters) the following day.\n\nAs storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes, officials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, stood late Saturday afternoon by a golf cart as he eyed the several feet of water covering the road that leads to his home in Channelview, a community in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River.\n\nMoss had managed to pack up many of his belongings and leave before the road flooded Saturday.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nHe moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where he will stay until the waters recede. Moss said he is not worried his home will flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\nHouston prone to flooding\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers), a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nWhat's expected next\n\nRain in the area is expected to taper off by evening, said Adams, the National Weather Service meteorologist. But next up, residents recovering from the floods will have the heat and humidity to contend with.\n\nWith a combination of the lingering moisture from the rains and temperatures upwards of 90 F (32 C), the area may be looking at heat index values in the triple digits this week, she said.\n\n\"We want people to be mindful of the increasing temperatures, and heat exhaustion, heat stress,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Meanwhile, he said, areas in northeastern Harris County, the nation's third-largest county that includes Houston, had a range of 6 inches to almost 17 inches of rain in that same period.\n\nScattered showers in the Houston area on Sunday brought light to moderate rainfall, he said.\n\n\"With the rainfall that fell overnight plus this morning it just kind of prolonged the river flooding that we were experiencing,\" Fowler said.\n\nHe said the rain would taper off in the evening, with no heavy rain events expected in the next week or so.\n\nChild dies in floodwaters\n\nIn Johnson County, located south of Fort Worth, a 4-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said.\n\nThe child and two adults were trying to get to dry ground when they were swept away, Jamie Moore, the Johnson County Emergency Management director, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe two adults were rescued around 5 a.m. and taken to a hospital, while the child was found dead around 7:20 a.m. in the water, Moore said.\n\nStorms brought as 9 inches of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to the Dallas-Fort Worth area overnight, said National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley. He said the rains washed out some roads west of Waco.\n\nHouston-area river levels\n\nOver the last few days, storms have forced numerous high-water rescues in the Houston area, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes.\n\nJeff Lindner, a meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District, said Sunday afternoon that \"things are improving slowly.\"\n\n\"We have water going down on our river systems,\" said Lindner. The San Jacinto River crested on Saturday, with its east and west forks and main stem below Lake Houston falling from 1 foot to 3 feet overnight. he said.\n\nLindner said that so far, Sunday's additional rain did not seem to be causing any new flooding. He urged people to still be cautious, noting that many areas are still flooded.\n\n\"We really need everybody to give it just another day before we feel comfortable that conditions are safe,\" Lindner said.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, was staying put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. On Saturday, he packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nMoss moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where planned to stay until the waters recede. He said Sunday that the floodwaters had already gone down by a couple of feet and that he wasn't worried his home would flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government personnel across Harris County.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles, a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nStengle reported from Dallas, and Associated Press reporter Juan A.

Floodwaters partially submerged cars and roads this week across parts of southeastern Texas, north of Houston, reaching the roofs of some homes.\n\nMore than 53cm fell over a five-day period through Friday in Liberty County near the city of Splendora, about 350km northeast of Houston, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nHidalgo said on Saturday 178 people and 122 pets have been rescued so far in the county. Scores of rescues took place in neighbouring Montgomery County. In Polk County, about 160km northeast of Houston, officials said they have done over 100 water rescues in the past few days.\n\nAuthorities in Houston have not reported any deaths or injuries. The city of more than two million people is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country and has much experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nOf particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River, which was expected to continue rising as more rain falls and officials release water from a full reservoir. Hidalgo issued a mandatory evacuation order on Thursday for people living along portions of the river.\n\nThe weather service reported the river was at nearly 22.6m late on Saturday morning after reaching nearly 23.7m. The rapidly changing forecast said the river was expected to fall to near the flood stage of 17.6m by Thursday.\n\nMost of Houston's city limits were not heavily impacted by the weather. Officials said the area received about four months' worth of rain in about a week's time.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 25,900 square kilometres - a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is criss-crossed by about 2700km of channels, creeks and bayous that drain into the Gulf of Mexico, about 80km southeast of the downtown area.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering system initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz",

Meanwhile, he said, areas in northeastern Harris County, the nation's third-largest county that includes Houston, had a range of 6 inches (15 centimeters) to almost 17 inches (43 centimeters) of rain in that same period.\n\nScattered showers in the Houston area on Sunday brought light to moderate rainfall, he said.\n\n\"With the rainfall that fell overnight plus this morning it just kind of prolonged the river flooding that we were experiencing,\" Fowler said.\n\nHe said the rain would taper off in the evening, with no heavy rain events expected in the next week or so.\n\nCHILD DIES IN FLOODWATERS\n\nIn Johnson County, located south of Fort Worth, a 5-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said.\n\nThe child and two adults were trying to get to dry ground when they were swept away, Jamie Moore, the Johnson County Emergency Management director, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe two adults were rescued around 5 a.m. and taken to a hospital, while the child was found dead around 7:20 a.m. in the water, Moore said.\n\nStorms brought as 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to the Dallas-Fort Worth area overnight, said National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley. He said the rains washed out some roads west of Waco.\n\nHOUSTON-AREA RIVER LEVELS\n\nOver the last few days, storms have forced numerous high-water rescues in the Houston area, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes.\n\nJeff Lindner, a meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District, said Sunday afternoon that \"things are improving slowly.\"\n\n\"We have water going down on our river systems,\" said Lindner. The San Jacinto River crested on Saturday, with its east and west forks and main stem below Lake Houston falling from 1 foot (0.30 meters) to 3 feet (0.91 meters) overnight. he said.\n\nLindner said that so far, Sunday's additional rain did not seem to be causing any new flooding. He urged people to still be cautious, noting that many areas are still flooded.\n\n\"We really need everybody to give it just another day before we feel comfortable that conditions are safe,\" Lindner said.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, was staying put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. On Saturday, he packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nMoss moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where planned to stay until the waters recede. He said Sunday that the floodwaters had already gone down by a couple of feet and that he wasn't worried his home would flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\n\"It'll be OK to go in there in the morning,\" he said.\n\nHOUSTON PRONE TO FLOODING\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country.

The National Weather Service warns of more storms and up to 8 inches of additional rainfall, prompting evacuations. Authorities have not reported any casualties. Despite being a flood-prone area, Houston's infrastructure struggles to handle the city's growth and intense storms. Residents are urged to prepare for rising waters and subsequent heat and humidity after the rain subsides.\n\nMore storms were moving through the already saturated Houston area on Sunday, where flooding from heavy rains has led to the rescue of hundreds of people from homes, rooftops and roads.\n\n\"It's going to be raining through the day and some of the storms could be producing the heavier downpours,\" said National Weather Service meteorologist Hayley Adams.\n\nOver the last week, areas near Lake Livingston, located northeast of Houston, have gotten upwards of 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain, she said, while there has been as much as 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain in that period in areas of northeastern Harris County, the nation's third-largest county that includes Houston.\n\nAdams said the storms coming through Sunday were expected to bring up to 3 inches of rainfall, with up to 8 inches possible in some areas.\n\n\"It's going to keep rising this way,\" said Miguel Flores Jr., who lives in the northeast Houston neighborhood of Kingwood. \"We don't know how much more. We're just preparing for the worst.\" Houston authorities have not reported any deaths or injuries as a wide region from Houston to rural East Texas has been swamped.\n\nMost weekends Flores' father, Miguel Flores Sr., is mowing his huge backyard on a 2.5-acre (1-hectare) lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family loaded several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.\n\nWater from the San Jacinto River already had swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise, from about 1 foot (30 centimeters) high in the yard Friday to about 4 feet (1.2 meters) the following day. As storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes, officials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, stood late Saturday afternoon by a golf cart as he eyed the several feet of water covering the road that leads to his home in Channelview, a community in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River.\n\nMoss had managed to pack up many of his belongings and leave before the road flooded Saturday. \"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\" He moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where he will stay until the waters recede.

The system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nRain in the area is expected to taper off by evening, said Adams, the National Weather Service meteorologist. But next up, residents recovering from the floods will have the heat and humidity to contend with.\n\nWith a combination of the lingering moisture from the rains and temperatures upwards of 90 F (32 C), the area may be looking at heat index values in the triple digits this week, she said.\n\n\"We want people to be mindful of the increasing temperatures, and heat exhaustion, heat stress,\" she

We're just preparing for the worst.\"\n\nHouston authorities have not reported any deaths or injuries as a wide region from Houston to rural East Texas has been swamped.\n\nFlooding forces evacuations\n\nMost weekends Flores' father, Miguel Flores Sr., is mowing his huge backyard on a 2.5-acre (1-hectare) lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family loaded several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.\n\nWater from the San Jacinto River already had swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise, from about 1 foot (30 centimeters) high in the yard Friday to about 4 feet (1.2 meters) the following day.\n\nAs storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes, officials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, stood late Saturday afternoon by a golf cart as he eyed the several feet of water covering the road that leads to his home in Channelview, a community in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River.\n\nMoss had managed to pack up many of his belongings and leave before the road flooded Saturday.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nHe moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where he will stay until the waters recede. Moss said he is not worried his home will flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\nHouston prone to flooding\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nREAD MORE: Why Hurricane Harvey became so extreme\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers), a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nWhat's expected next\n\nRain in the area is expected to taper off by evening, said Adams, the National Weather Service meteorologist. But next up, residents recovering from the floods will have the heat and humidity to contend with.\n\nWith a combination of the lingering moisture from the rains and temperatures upwards of 90 F (32 C), the area may be looking at heat index values in the triple digits this week, she said.\n\n\"We want people to be mindful of the increasing temperatures, and heat exhaustion, heat stress,\" she said.\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jamie Stengle in Dallas contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "pbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "PBS.org"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@pbs.org", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "lekan_oyekanmi@pbs.org", "name": "Lekan Oyekanmi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "juan_a_lozano@pbs.org", "name": "Juan A.

The San Jacinto River crested on Saturday, with its east and west forks and main stem below Lake Houston falling from 1 foot (0.30 meters) to 3 feet (0.91 meters) overnight. he said.\n\nLindner said that so far, Sunday's additional rain did not seem to be causing any new flooding. He urged people to still be cautious, noting that many areas are still flooded.\n\n\"We really need everybody to give it just another day before we feel comfortable that conditions are safe,\" Lindner said.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, was staying put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River.

Meanwhile, she said, as much as 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain has fallen in northeastern Harris County, the nation's third-largest county that includes Houston.\n\nAdams said the storms coming through Sunday were expected to bring up to an additional 3 inches (8 centimeters) of rainfall, with up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) possible in some areas before tapering off in the evening.\n\n\"It's going to be raining through the day and some of the storms could be producing the heavier downpours,\" Adams said.\n\nCHILD DIES IN FLOODWATERS\n\nIn Johnson County, located south of Fort Worth, a 5-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said.\n\nThe child and two adults were trying to get to dry ground when they were swept away, Jamie Moore, the Johnson County Emergency Management director, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe two adults were rescued around 5 a.m. and taken to a hospital, while the child was found dead around 7:20 a.m. in the water, Moore said.\n\nStorms brought as 9 inches of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to Dallas-Fort Worth overnight, said National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley. Stalley said the rains washed out some roads west of Waco.\n\nHOUSTON-AREA RIVER LEVELS\n\nOver the last few days, storms have forced numerous high-water rescues in the Houston area, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes.\n\nJeff Lindner, a meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District, said Sunday afternoon that \"things are improving slowly.\"\n\n\"We have water going down on our river systems,\" said Lindner. The San Jacinto River crested on Saturday, with its east and west forks and main stem below Lake Houston falling from 1 foot to 3 feet overnight. he said.\n\nLindner said that so far, Sunday's additional rain did not seem to be causing any new flooding. He urged people to still be cautious, noting that many areas are still flooded.\n\n\"We really need everybody to give it just another day before we feel comfortable that conditions are safe,\" Lindner said.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, was staying put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. On Saturday, he packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nMoss moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where planned to stay until the waters recede. He said Sunday that the floodwaters had already gone down by a couple of feet and that he wasn't worried his home would flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\n\"It'll be OK to go in there in the morning,\" he said.\n\nHOUSTON PRONE TO FLOODING\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country.

The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles, a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nWhat's expected next\n\nRain in the area is expected to taper off by evening, said Adams, the National Weather Service meteorologist. But next up, residents recovering from the floods will have the heat and humidity to contend with.\n\nWith a combination of the lingering moisture from the rains and temperatures upwards of 90 F, the area may be looking at heat index values in the triple digits this week, she said.\n\n\"We want people to be mindful of the increasing temperatures, and heat exhaustion, heat stress,\" she said.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Meanwhile, she said, as much as 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain has fallen in northeastern Harris County, the nation's third-largest county that includes Houston.\n\nAdams said the storms coming through Sunday were expected to bring up to an additional 3 inches (8 centimeters) of rainfall, with up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) possible in some areas before tapering off in the evening.\n\nIt's going to be raining through the day and some of the storms could be producing the heavier downpours,\" Adams said.\n\nCHILD DIES IN FLOODWATERS\n\nIn Johnson County, located south of Fort Worth, a 5-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said.\n\nThe child and two adults were trying to get to dry ground when they were swept away, Jamie Moore, the Johnson County Emergency Management director, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe two adults were rescued around 5 a.m. and taken to a hospital, while the child was found dead around 7:20 a.m. in the water, Moore said.\n\nStorms brought as 9 inches of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to Dallas-Fort Worth overnight, said National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley. Stalley said the rains washed out some roads west of Waco.\n\nHOUSTON-AREA RIVER LEVELS\n\nOver the last few days, storms have forced numerous high-water rescues in the Houston area, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes.\n\nJeff Lindner, a meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District, said Sunday afternoon that \"things are improving slowly.\"\n\n\"We have water going down on our river systems,\" said Lindner. The San Jacinto River crested on Saturday, with its east and west forks and main stem below Lake Houston falling from 1 foot to 3 feet overnight. he said.\n\nLindner said that so far, Sunday's additional rain did not seem to be causing any new flooding. He urged people to still be cautious, noting that many areas are still flooded.\n\n\"We really need everybody to give it just another day before we feel comfortable that conditions are safe,\" Lindner said.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, was staying put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. On Saturday, he packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nMoss moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where planned to stay until the waters recede. He said Sunday that the floodwaters had already gone down by a couple of feet and that he wasn't worried his home would flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country.

It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.", "source": {"uri":

Meanwhile, he said, areas in northeastern Harris County, the nation's third-largest county that includes Houston, had a range of 6 inches (15 centimetres) to almost 17 inches (43 centimetres) of rain in that same period.\n\nScattered showers in the Houston area on Sunday brought light to moderate rainfall, he said.\n\n\"With the rainfall that fell overnight plus this morning it just kind of prolonged the river flooding that we were experiencing,\" Fowler said.\n\nHe said the rain would taper off in the evening, with no heavy rain events expected in the next week or so.\n\nIn Johnson County, located south of Fort Worth, a 5-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said.\n\nThe child and two adults were trying to get to dry ground when they were swept away, Jamie Moore, the Johnson County Emergency Management director, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe two adults were rescued around 5 a.m. and taken to a hospital, while the child was found dead around 7:20 a.m. in the water, Moore said.\n\nStorms brought as 9 inches (23 centimetres) of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to the Dallas-Fort Worth area overnight, said National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley.

He urged people to still be cautious, noting that many areas are still flooded.\n\n\"We really need everybody to give it just another day before we feel comfortable that conditions are safe,\" Lindner said.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, was staying put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. On Saturday, he packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nMoss moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbour's home, where planned to stay until the waters recede. He said Sunday that the flood waters had already gone down by a couple of feet and that he wasn't worried his home would flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\n\"It'll be OK to go in there in the morning,\" he said.\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government personnel across Harris County.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometres), a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is criss-crossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometres) of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometres) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.", "source": {"uri":

Meanwhile, she said, as much as 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain has fallen in northeastern Harris County, the nation's third-largest county that includes Houston.\n\nAdams said the storms coming through Sunday were expected to bring up to an additional 3 inches (8 centimeters) of rainfall, with up to 8 inches (20 centimeters) possible in some areas before tapering off in the evening.\n\n\"It's going to be raining through the day and some of the storms could be producing the heavier downpours,\" Adams said.\n\nCHILD DIES IN FLOODWATERS\n\nIn Johnson County, located south of Fort Worth, a 5-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said.\n\nThe child and two adults were trying to get to dry ground when they were swept away, Jamie Moore, the Johnson County Emergency Management director, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe two adults were rescued around 5 a.m. and taken to a hospital, while the child was found dead around 7:20 a.m. in the water, Moore said.\n\nStorms brought as 9 inches of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to Dallas-Fort Worth overnight, said National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley. Stalley said the rains washed out some roads west of Waco.\n\nHOUSTON-AREA RIVER LEVELS\n\nOver the last few days, storms have forced numerous high-water rescues in the Houston area, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes.\n\nJeff Lindner, a meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District, said Sunday afternoon that \"things are improving slowly.\"\n\n\"We have water going down on our river systems,\" said Lindner. The San Jacinto River crested on Saturday, with its east and west forks and main stem below Lake Houston falling from 1 foot to 3 feet overnight. he said.\n\nLindner said that so far, Sunday's additional rain did not seem to be causing any new flooding. He urged people to still be cautious, noting that many areas are still flooded.\n\n\"We really need everybody to give it just another day before we feel comfortable that conditions are safe,\" Lindner said.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, was staying put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. On Saturday, he packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nMoss moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where planned to stay until the waters recede. He said Sunday that the floodwaters had already gone down by a couple of feet and that he wasn't worried his home would flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\n\"It'll be OK to go in there in the morning,\" he said.\n\nHOUSTON PRONE TO FLOODING\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government personnel across Harris County.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers), a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Others prepared to evacuate their property.\n\nFloodwaters inundated a wide region Saturday, from Houston to rural East Texas, where game wardens rode airboats through waist-high waters and rescued both people and pets who did not evacuate in time. One crew brought a family and three dogs aboard as rising waters surrounded their cars and home. A flood watch remained in effect through Sunday afternoon as forecasters predicted additional rainfall Saturday night to the soaked region and the likelihood of major flooding. About 11 million people in Texas and Oklahoma are under flood warnings and watches this weekend.\n\nFriday's storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes. One such incident was caught on camera, as someone filmed a large truck being swept away as its driver jumped from the cab. The driver was later rescued.\n\nOfficials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.\n\nHarris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said Saturday that the area is expecting more rain on Sunday and if it's a lot, it could be problematic. Hidalgo is the top elected official in the nation's third-largest county.\n\nMore than 21 inches of rain fell during the five-day period that ended Friday in Liberty County near Splendora, a city about 30 miles northeast of Houston, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nHidalgo said Saturday that 178 people have been rescued and 122 pets have been rescued so far in the county. Scores of rescues took place in neighboring Montgomery County. In Polk County, located about 100 miles from Houston, officials said they have done over 100 water rescues in the past few days.\n\n\"A lull in heavy rain is expected through (Saturday) evening,\" the National Weather Service said. \"The next round of heavy rainfall is expected late (Saturday) into Sunday.\"\n\nAron Brown, 45, and his wife Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River in the northeast Houston neighborhood of Kingwood.\n\nThe floodwaters had risen several feet and had begun to flood nearby restaurants and a gas station.\n\nBrown, who had driven from his home in a golf cart, said the flooding wasn't as bad as Hurricane Harvey in 2017. He pointed to nearby power lines and said that flooding during Harvey had reached the top of the lines.\n\nMost weekends, Miguel Flores Sr. is mowing his huge backyard on a 2 1/2 acre lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family were loading several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items before flood waters inundated his home.\n\nWaters from the nearby San Jacinto River had swallowed his backyard and continued to rise on Saturday.\n\nFlores said the water in his backyard was only about 1 foot high on Friday. On Saturday, the water level now measured about 4 feet.\n\n\"It's sad, but what can I do,\" Flores said. He added that he has flood insurance.\n\nFor weeks, drenching rains in Texas and parts of Louisiana have filled reservoirs and saturated the ground. Floodwaters partially submerged cars and roads this week across parts of southeastern Texas, north of Houston, where high waters reached the roofs of some homes. Hundreds of structures are flooded, and more are dealing with power outages.\n\nIn the rural community of Shepherd, Gilroy Fernandes said he and his spouse had about an hour to evacuate after a mandatory order. Their home is on stilts near the Trinity River, and they felt relief when the water began to recede on Thursday.\n\nThen the danger grew while they slept.\n\n\"Next thing you know, overnight they started releasing more water from the dam at Livingston. And so that caused the level of the river to shoot up by almost 5 or 6 feet overnight,\" Fernandes said. Neighbors who left an hour later got stuck in traffic because of flooding.\n\nIn Montgomery County, Judge Mark Keough said there had been more high-water rescues than he was able to count.\n\n\"We estimate we've had a couple hundred rescues from homes, from houses, from vehicles,\" Keough said.\n\nShe said homes below Lake Livingston Dam and along the Trinity River have flooded.\n\n\"It'll be when things subside before we can do our damage assessment,\" Comstock said.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard said they evacuated via helicopter an hours-old baby from Cleveland, Texas amid the floodwaters. The baby, who was just 12 hours old, was reportedly experiencing low oxygen levels at Texas Emergency Hospital. The hospital does not have a neonatal intensive care unit, and flooding made it impossible to transport the baby to another facility via ambulance. The helicopter crew transported the baby, mother and a paramedic to Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. The baby is in stable condition, the Coast Guard said.\n\nAuthorities in Houston had not reported any deaths or injuries. The city of more than 2 million people is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country and has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall on the area, flooding thousands of homes and resulting in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nOf particular concern was an area along the San Jacinto River in the northeastern part of Harris County, which was expected to continue rising as more rain falls and officials release extra water from an already full reservoir. Judge Hidalgo on Thursday issued a mandatory evacuation order for those living along portions of the river.\n\nMost of Houston's city limits were not heavily impacted by the weather, except for the northeastern neighborhood of Kingwood. Officials said the area had about four months of rain in about a week's time. Houston Mayor John Whitmire said rising flood waters from the San Jacinto River were expected to impact Kingwood late Friday and Saturday.\n\nShelters have opened across the region, including nine by the American Red Cross.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles -- a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles of channels, creeks and bayous that drain into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles to the southeast from downtown.\n\nThe city's system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains. But engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nResidents in rural central and west Texas are also working to recover from tornadoes that left a trail of damage. In Hawley, Texas, two people were hurt Thursday, and the twisters left a trail of damage. This weekend's storms pose the threat of more tornadoes.\n\nTexas isn't the only area facing severe weather this weekend. Americans from Louisiana to Oregon are under the threat of severe, slow-moving storms. In Oregon's Cascades region, a winter weather warning was issued as the region braces for at least a foot of snow, according to local media.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris canceled a planned trip to a music festival in Las Vegas, Nevada after the event was canceled due to a high wind warning. Organizers said they are expecting winds between 30 and 35 miles per hour, with gusts of up to 60 miles per hour.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"},

But in North Texas, a 4-year-old boy died after riding in a car that was swept away in fast waters, authorities said.\n\nAfter days of heavy rainfall in the Houston area and other parts of Southeast Texas, the forecast on Monday called for mainly sunny skies with a slight chance of showers.\n\n\"We can absolutely see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we've made it through the worst of this weather event,\" Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the county's top elected official, told reporters Monday.\n\nAreas near Lake Livingston, located northeast of Houston, received upwards of 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain over the past week, National Weather Service meteorologist Jimmy Fowler said. Areas in northeastern Harris County, the nation's third-largest county, had a range of between 6 inches (15 centimeters) to almost 17 inches (43 centimeters) of rain in that same period.\n\nHidalgo said 233 people and 186 pets had been rescued in Harris County over the last few days. Active rescues stopped Monday, and officials were transitioning from a response phase into recovery mode and cleanup, she said.\n\nWhile many of the impacted neighborhoods and subdivisions along the San Jacinto River in Harris County were accessible on Monday, others remained cut off by flooded roadways.\n\nOfficials were still assessing how many homes were damaged.\n\n\"We're a resilient community. I know we'll continue to recover from this,\" said Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.\n\nAt least five school districts around the Houston area were closed on Monday due to the flooding.\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues.\n\nMost of the city of Houston was not heavily impacted by last week's rainfall, except for the neighborhood of Kingwood, where some homes and roads flooded.\n\nVarious counties and communities north and east of the Houston area also continued to recover on Monday.\n\n\"These folks have suffered much, people,\" Trinity County Sheriff Woody Wallace said Sunday during a Facebook livestream as he rode a boat through a rural flooded neighborhood. Partially submerged cars and street signs were around him.\n\nIn Johnson County, south of Fort Worth, a 4-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said. The Tarrant County medical examiner's office said the cause of death of the child, who would have turned 5 later this month, was drowning.\n\nStorms brought 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley said.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, stayed put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. A day earlier, he had packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jamie Stengle in Dallas and videojournalist Lekan Oyekanmi in Houston contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "kurv.com", "dataType": "news",

Meanwhile, he said, areas in northeastern Harris County, the nation's third-largest county that includes Houston, had a range of six inches (15 centimetres) to almost 17 inches (43 centimetres) of rain in that same period.\n\nScattered showers in the Houston area on Sunday brought light to moderate rainfall, he said.\n\n\"With the rainfall that fell overnight plus this morning it just kind of prolonged the river flooding that we were experiencing,\" Fowler said.\n\nHe said the rain would taper off in the evening, with no heavy rain events expected in the next week or so.\n\nChild dies in floodwaters\n\nIn Johnson County, located south of Fort Worth, a five-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said.\n\nThe child and two adults were trying to get to dry ground when they were swept away, Jamie Moore, the Johnson County Emergency Management director, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe two adults were rescued around 5 a.m. and taken to a hospital, while the child was found dead around 7:20 a.m. in the water, Moore said.\n\nStorms brought as nine inches (23 centimetres) of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to the Dallas-Fort Worth area overnight, said National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley. He said the rains washed out some roads west of Waco.\n\nHouston-area river levels\n\nOver the last few days, storms have forced numerous high-water rescues in the Houston area, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes.\n\nJeff Lindner, a meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District, said Sunday afternoon that \"things are improving slowly.\"\n\n\"We have water going down on our river systems,\" said Lindner. The San Jacinto River crested on Saturday, with its east and west forks and main stem below Lake Houston falling from one foot (0.30 metres) to three feet (0.91 metres) overnight, he said.\n\nLindner said that so far, Sunday's additional rain did not seem to be causing any new flooding. He urged people to still be cautious, noting that many areas are still flooded.\n\n\"We really need everybody to give it just another day before we feel comfortable that conditions are safe,\" Lindner said.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, was staying put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. On Saturday, he packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nMoss moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbour's home, where planned to stay until the waters recede. He said Sunday that the floodwaters had already gone down by a couple of feet and that he wasn't worried his home would flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government personnel across Harris County.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometres), a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometres) of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometres) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\n------\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

But in North Texas, a 4-year-old boy died after riding in a car that was swept away in fast waters, authorities said.\n\nAfter days of heavy rainfall in the Houston area and other parts of Southeast Texas, the forecast on Monday called for mainly sunny skies with a slight chance of showers.\n\n\"We can absolutely see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we've made it through the worst of this weather event,\" Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the county's top elected official, told reporters Monday.\n\nAreas near Lake Livingston, located northeast of Houston, received upwards of 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain over the past week, National Weather Service meteorologist Jimmy Fowler said. Areas in northeastern Harris County, the nation's third-largest county, had a range of between 6 inches (15 centimeters) to almost 17 inches (43 centimeters) of rain in that same period.\n\nHidalgo said 233 people and 186 pets had been rescued in Harris County over the last few days. Active rescues stopped Monday, and officials were transitioning from a response phase into recovery mode and cleanup, she said.\n\nWhile many of the impacted neighborhoods and subdivisions along the San Jacinto River in Harris County were accessible on Monday, others remained cut off by flooded roadways.\n\nOfficials were still assessing how many homes were damaged.\n\n\"We're a resilient community. I know we'll continue to recover from this,\" said Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez.\n\nAt least five school districts around the Houston area were closed on Monday due to the flooding.\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. Hurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues.\n\nMost of the city of Houston was not heavily impacted by last week's rainfall, except for the neighborhood of Kingwood, where some homes and roads flooded.\n\nVarious counties and communities north and east of the Houston area also continued to recover on Monday.\n\n\"These folks have suffered much, people,\" Trinity County Sheriff Woody Wallace said Sunday during a Facebook livestream as he rode a boat through a rural flooded neighborhood. Partially submerged cars and street signs were around him.\n\nIn Johnson County, south of Fort Worth, a 4-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said. The Tarrant County medical examiner's office said the cause of death of the child, who would have turned 5 later this month, was drowning.\n\nStorms brought 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley said.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, stayed put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. A day earlier, he had packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nAssociated Press reporter Jamie Stengle in Dallas and videojournalist Lekan Oyekanmi in Houston contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Juan A.

We're just preparing for the worst.\"\n\nHouston authorities have not reported any deaths or injuries as a wide region from Houston to rural East Texas has been swamped.\n\nFLOODING FORCES EVACUATIONS\n\nMost weekends Flores' father, Miguel Flores Sr., is mowing his huge backyard on a 2.5-acre (1-hectare) lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family loaded several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.\n\nWater from the San Jacinto River already had swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise, from about 1 foot (30 centimeters) high in the yard Friday to about 4 feet (1.2 meters) the following day.\n\nAs storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes, officials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, stood late Saturday afternoon by a golf cart as he eyed the several feet of water covering the road that leads to his home in Channelview, a community in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River.\n\nMoss had managed to pack up many of his belongings and leave before the road flooded Saturday.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nHe moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where he will stay until the waters recede. Moss said he is not worried his home will flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\nHOUSTON PRONE TO FLOODING\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers), a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nWHAT'S EXPECTED NEXT\n\nRain in the area is expected to taper off by evening, said Adams, the National Weather Service meteorologist. But next up, residents recovering from the floods will have the heat and humidity to contend with.\n\nWith a combination of the lingering moisture from the rains and temperatures upwards of 90 F (32 C), the area may be looking at heat index values in the triple digits this week, she said.\n\n\"We want people to be mindful of the increasing temperatures, and heat exhaustion, heat stress,\" she said.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

To the north in the Fort Worth area, a child died after being swept away when the car he was in got stuck in floodwaters.\n\nOver the last week, areas near Lake Livingston, northeast of Houston, have gotten upward of 20 inches of rain, said National Weather Service meteorologist Hayley Adams. Meanwhile, she said, as much as 12 inches of rain has fallen in northeastern Harris County, which includes Houston.\n\nAdams said the storms coming through Sunday were expected to bring up to an additional 3 inches of rainfall, with up to 8 inches possible in some areas before tapering off in the evening.\n\n\"It's going to be raining through the day and some of the storms could be producing the heavier downpours,\" Adams said.\n\nIn Johnson County, south of Fort Worth, a 5-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said.\n\nThe child and two adults were trying to get to dry ground when they were swept away, Jamie Moore, the Johnson County Emergency Management director, wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nThe two adults were rescued around 5 a.m. and taken to a hospital, while the child was found dead around 7:20 a.m. in the water, Moore said.\n\nStorms brought as 9 inches of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to Dallas-Fort Worth overnight, said National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley. Stalley said the rains washed out some roads west of Waco.\n\nOver the last few days, storms have forced numerous high-water rescues in the Houston area, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes.\n\nJeff Lindner, a meteorologist with the Harris County Flood Control District, said Sunday afternoon that \"things are improving slowly.\"\n\n\"We have water going down on our river systems,\" said Lindner. The San Jacinto River crested on Saturday, with its east and west forks and main stem below Lake Houston falling from 1 foot to 3 feet overnight. he said.\n\nLindner said that so far, Sunday's additional rain did not seem to be causing any new flooding. He urged people to still be cautious, noting that many areas are still flooded.\n\n\"We really need everybody to give it just another day before we feel comfortable that conditions are safe,\" Lindner said.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, was staying put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. On Saturday, he packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nMoss moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where planned to stay until the waters recede. He said Sunday that the floodwaters had already gone down by a couple of feet and that he wasn't worried his home would flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\n\"It'll be OK to go in there in the morning,\" he said.\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government personnel across Harris County.\n\nThe Houston area's system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Karen Warren/Houston Chronicle via Associated Press\n\nHOUSTON -- More storms were moving through the already saturated Houston area on Sunday, where flooding from heavy rains has led to the rescue of hundreds of people from homes, rooftops and roads.\n\n\"It's going to be raining through the day and some of the storms could be producing the heavier downpours,\" said National Weather Service meteorologist Hayley Adams.\n\nOver the last week, areas near Lake Livingston, located northeast of Houston, have gotten upwards of 20 inches of rain, she said, while there has been as much as 12 inches of rain in that period in areas of northeastern Harris County, the nation's third-largest county that includes Houston.\n\nRelated Houston braces for flooding to worsen in wake of storms\n\nAdams said the storms coming through Sunday were expected to bring up to 3 inches of rainfall, with up to 8 inches possible in some areas.\n\n\"It's going to keep rising this way,\" said Miguel Flores Jr., who lives in the northeast Houston neighborhood of Kingwood. \"We don't know how much more. We're just preparing for the worst.\"\n\nHouston authorities have not reported any deaths or injuries as a wide region from Houston to rural East Texas has been swamped.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFLOODING FORCES EVACUATIONS\n\nMost weekends Flores' father, Miguel Flores Sr., is mowing his huge backyard on a 2.5-acre lot behind his home in Kingwood. But on Saturday, he and his family loaded several vehicles with clothes, small appliances and other items.\n\nWater from the San Jacinto River already had swallowed his backyard and was continuing to rise, from about 1 foot high in the yard Friday to about 4 feet the following day.\n\nAs storms forced numerous high-water rescues, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes, officials redoubled urgent instructions for residents in low-lying areas to evacuate, warning the worst was still to come.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, stood late Saturday afternoon by a golf cart as he eyed the several feet of water covering the road that leads to his home in Channelview, a community in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River.\n\nMoss had managed to pack up many of his belongings and leave before the road flooded Saturday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nHe moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where he will stay until the waters recede. Moss said he is not worried his home will flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\nHOUSTON PRONE TO FLOODING\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles, a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles southeast of downtown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nWHAT'S EXPECTED NEXT\n\nRain in the area is expected to taper off by evening, said Adams, the National Weather Service meteorologist. But next up, residents recovering from the floods will have the heat and humidity to contend with.\n\nWith a combination of the lingering moisture from the rains and temperatures upwards of 90 F, the area may be looking at heat index values in the triple digits this week, she said.\n\n\"We want people to be mindful of the increasing temperatures, and heat exhaustion, heat stress,\" she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Partially submerged cars and street signs peeked above the water around him.\n\nAreas near Lake Livingston, located northeast of Houston, received upwards of 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain over the past week, National Weather Service meteorologist Jimmy Fowler said.\n\nIn Johnson County, south of Fort Worth, a 4-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said. The Tarrant County medical examiner's office said the cause of death of the child, who would have turned 5 later this month, was drowning.\n\nThe child and two adults were trying to reach dry ground when they were swept away. The adults were rescued around 5 a.m. and taken to a hospital, while the child was found dead around 7:20 a.m. in the water, Johnson County Emergency Management Director Jamie Moore wrote in a social media post.\n\nStorms brought 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley said.\n\nSince last week, storms have forced numerous high-water rescues in the Houston area, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, stayed put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River.

Moss said he is not worried his home will flood because it's on higher ground.\n\nHOUSTON PRONE TO FLOODING\n\nHouston is one of the most flood-prone metro areas in the country. The city of more than 2 million people has long experience dealing with devastating weather.\n\nHurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues by government rescue personnel across Harris County.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe greater Houston area covers about 10,000 square miles (25,900 square kilometers), a footprint slightly bigger than New Jersey. It is crisscrossed by about 1,700 miles (2,700 kilometers) of channels, creeks and bayous draining into the Gulf of Mexico, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown.\n\nThe system of bayous and reservoirs was built to drain heavy rains, but the engineering initially designed nearly 100 years ago has struggled to keep up with the city's growth and bigger storms.\n\nHusband and wife Aron Brown, 45, and Jamie Brown, 41, were two of the many residents who drove or walked to watch the rising waters near a flooded intersection close to the San Jacinto River. Nearby restaurants and a gas station were beginning to flood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWHAT'S EXPECTED NEXT\n\nRain in the area is expected to taper off by evening, said Adams, the National Weather Service meteorologist. But next up, residents recovering from the floods will have the heat and humidity to contend with.\n\nWith a combination of the lingering moisture from the rains and temperatures upwards of 90 F (32 C), the area may be looking at heat index values in the triple digits this week, she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We want people to be mindful of the increasing temperatures, and heat exhaustion, heat stress,\" she said.\n\nRelated StoriesView MoreFlash floods sweep across Texas, killing 5-year-old in Johnson CountyLetters to the Editor - Jewish state, antisemitism, media awards, the Tony AwardsLetters to the Editor -- The blurry lines between free speech and campus safetyHouston flooding with more rain to come\n\nBy JUAN A.

Judge Lina Hidalgo, Harris county's top elected official, said Saturday that 178 people and 122 pets had been rescued so far in the county.\n\nA wide region has been swamped from Houston to rural East Texas, where game wardens rode airboats through waist-high waters rescuing people and pets who did not evacuate in time.

Moss said he is not worried his home will flood because it's located on higher ground.\n\nWHAT'S EXPECTED NEXT\n\nRain in the area is expected to taper off by evening, said Adams, the National Weather Service meteorologist. But next up, residents recovering from the floods will have the heat and humidity to contend with.\n\nWith a combination of the lingering moisture from the rains and temperatures upwards of 90 F (32 C), the area may be looking at heat index values in the triple digits this week, she said.\n\n\"We want people to be mindful of the increasing temperatures, and heat exhaustion, heat stress,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "cw39.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CW39 Houston"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@cw39.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greater Houston"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adams County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Adams County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingwood,_Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kingwood, Houston"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Livingston", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lake Livingston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_County,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harris County, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Harris County, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Jacinto_River_(Texas)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Jacinto River (Texas)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hyperthermia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channelview,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Channelview, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Channelview, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Water Resources", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Natural_Disasters_and_Hazards", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Natural Disasters and Hazards", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Moving_and_Relocating/Moving", "label": "dmoz/Home/Moving and Relocating/Moving", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://cw39.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/AP24125795425316_2f7860.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539709", "eventUri": "eng-9539709", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

The densely populated metro center is home to more than 2 million people and has been swamped by consistently heavy downpours. Crews carried out hundreds of water rescues in Houston and the surrounding neighborhoods earlier in the weekend.\n\nFlood watches are issued when a mixture of weather hazards creates favorable conditions for flooding, but they do not necessarily mean that flooding is imminent in a particular region. A flood watch currently in effect from Harris County -- which includes Houston all the way to College Station -- was set to remain in place through Sunday evening. It also extended eastward from greater Houston toward the Gulf Coast.\n\nMeteorologists warned people within the flood watch boundaries to prepare for additional spells of rainfall and thunderstorms overnight Saturday and throughout the day on Sunday, after previous rounds of heavy rain drenched the area and submerged a wide section of land in murky high waters.\n\nCrews had already rescued more than 400 people from homes, rooftops, and roadways by Saturday as neighborhoods flooded around Houston, the Associated Press reported, while others prepared to evacuate. Judge Lina Hidalgo, the top official in Harris County where Houston is located, said at the time that 178 people and 122 pets had been rescued in that jurisdiction alone. No deaths or injuries tied to the severe weather have been reported in Houston.\n\nPeople still under flood watches in southeastern Texas were bracing for between 1 and 3 inches of additional rainfall on Sunday, although the National Weather Service said higher amounts -- possibly as much as 8 inches -- could end up happening in some places.\n\nOngoing flooding along the San Jacinto River was a main cause for concern as rain caused its water levels to rise past capacity. Houston Police shared a video on social media that showed an officer rescuing a man and three dogs who were trapped in 8 to 10 feet of floodwater on Saturday morning. That rescue happened in a trailer park along a section of the San Jacinto River near Lake Houston, police said.\n\n\"Excessive runoff has resulted in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations, particularly urban areas,\" the National Weather Service said in its latest advisory, noting that river flooding continued Sunday morning and ranged from moderate to major depending on the location.\n\nA severe weather outlook issued for the same region noted that localized flash flooding was also expected, \"especially for areas that already received heavy rainfall over the last few days.\" With that, powerful and potentially damaging winds, large hail and tornadoes could also occur, according to the weather service. The heaviest rainfall was forecast in the morning.\n\nSoutheastern Texas has been hit hard by heavy rains over the last week, with Houston and neighborhoods in its vicinity feeling the brunt of the impacts. Hidalgo on Thursday announced that she had signed a disaster declaration for Harris County after the area got more rain than expected the previous night, putting communities near the San Jacinto River at particular risk, CBS affiliate KHOU reported. But storms have for days imperiled people living in river basins much farther inland, and the disaster declaration for Harris County came on the same day Texas Governor Greg Abbott expanded a broader disaster declaration to include 88 of the state's counties in total.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Crews carried out hundreds of water rescues in Houston and the surrounding neighborhoods earlier in the weekend.\n\nFlood watches are issued when a mixture of weather hazards creates favorable conditions for flooding, but they do not necessarily mean that flooding is imminent in a particular region. A flood watch currently in effect from Harris County -- which includes Houston all the way to College Station -- was set to remain in place through Sunday evening. It also extended eastward from greater Houston toward the Gulf Coast.\n\nMeteorologists warned people within the flood watch boundaries to prepare for additional spells of rainfall and thunderstorms overnight Saturday and throughout the day on Sunday, after previous rounds of heavy rain drenched the area and submerged a wide section of land in murky high waters.\n\nCrews had already rescued more than 400 people from homes, rooftops, and roadways by Saturday as neighborhoods flooded around Houston, the Associated Press reported, while others prepared to evacuate. Judge Lina Hidalgo, the top official in Harris County where Houston is located, said at the time that 178 people and 122 pets had been rescued in that jurisdiction alone. No deaths or injuries tied to the severe weather have been reported in Houston.\n\nPeople still under flood watches in southeastern Texas were bracing for between 1 and 3 inches of additional rainfall on Sunday, although the National Weather Service said higher amounts -- possibly as much as 8 inches -- could end up happening in some places.\n\nOngoing flooding along the San Jacinto River was a main cause for concern as rain caused its water levels to rise past capacity. Houston Police shared a video on social media that showed an officer rescuing a man and three dogs who were trapped in 8 to 10 feet of floodwater on Saturday morning. That rescue happened in a trailer park along a section of the San Jacinto River near Lake Houston, police said.\n\n\"Excessive runoff has resulted in flooding of rivers, creeks, streams, and other low-lying and flood-prone locations, particularly urban areas,\" the National Weather Service said in its latest advisory, noting that river flooding continued Sunday morning and ranged from moderate to major depending on the location.\n\nA severe weather outlook issued for the same region noted that localized flash flooding was also expected, \"especially for areas that already received heavy rainfall over the last few days.\" With that, powerful and potentially damaging winds, large hail and tornadoes could also occur, according to the weather service. The heaviest rainfall was forecast in the morning.\n\nSoutheastern Texas has been hit hard by heavy rains over the last week, with Houston and neighborhoods in its vicinity feeling the brunt of the impacts. Hidalgo on Thursday announced that she had signed a disaster declaration for Harris County after the area got more rain than expected the previous night, putting communities near the San Jacinto River at particular risk, CBS affiliate KHOU reported. But storms have for days imperiled people living in river basins much farther inland, and the disaster declaration for Harris County came on the same day Texas Governor Greg Abbott expanded a broader disaster declaration to include 88 of the state's counties in total.\n\nLongtime Trump aide Hope Hicks takes the stand in New York trial\n\nLouisiana boy receives surprising reward after generously

A flood watch remained in effect through Sunday afternoon as forecasters predicted additional rainfall Saturday night and the likelihood of major flooding in Harris County, the nation's third-largest county which includes Houston, and nearby areas. Up to 3 inches (7.6 centimeters) of additional rain was expected, with up to 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) possible in isolated areas. Houston authorities have not reported any deaths or injuries. Judge Lina Hidalgo, Harris County's top elected official, said Saturday that 178 people and 122 pets had been rescued so far in the county.

The three occupants escaped but a 911 caller said they were swept into the floodwaters when they tried to get to safe ground, according to Moore.\n\nA man and woman were rescued, said Moore, who was involved in the search.\n\n\"I hope you will keep this family in your prayers,\" Moore told CNN.\n\nWith days of rain, rivers farther south have swollen, leaving homes and businesses flooded and thousands of people displaced.\n\nAt least 224 people have been rescued from homes and vehicles in Harris County, an official said Saturday night, with evacuation orders and flood watches in place, as more rain descended on the state Sunday, with a bull's-eye of excessive rainfall over the already waterlogged Houston area. No deaths or serious injuries had been reported in that area, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo told CNN, adding 153 pets have also been rescued during the deluge.\n\n\"It's been really sad to see the impact of people's livelihoods, homes, infrastructure as well as just the public infrastructure,\" Hidalgo told CNN on Saturday.\n\n\"We're really asking folks to give it a minute before they go back home.\"\n\nCNN's Rosa Flores rode in a boat Sunday with rescuers from the Harris County Sheriff's Office and said the craft passed over fences and mailboxes. Stop signs were at eye level.\n\nIn some areas, the water had receded Sunday but was still very high.\n\nThe first responders took CNN to an area where the banks of the San Jacinto River were not visible.\n\n\"It's kinda hard to tell where the river ends,\" Lt. David Jasper said.\n\nMany people in Houston were evacuated before the worst of the severe weather, Brent Taylor, chief communications officer for the Houston Office of Emergency Management, told CNN's Amara Walker.\n\n\"We have Houston Police and Houston Fire who are patrolling these neighborhoods that are near the river and where the water is gone so high,\" Taylor said. \"There's been some instances where it's someone just yelling for help saying, 'Hey, I'm stuck over here!'\"\n\n\"We have high water rescue vehicles. We have Jet Skis, we have air boats. Our Houston Public Works Department has dump trucks that can be outfitted to move people through those high waters, so it really is a unified effort to make sure that these Houstonians are staying safe,\" he added.\n\nNot everyone wanted to leave their homes, Deputy Darrell Bailey of the Harris County Sheriff's Office told CNN's crew on their ride-along.\n\n\"They have a lot of people in the area who don't want to leave because they'd have no place to go and they don't want to go to the shelter,\" he said.\n\nThe website for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's West Gulf River Forecast Center shows eight river gauges in Texas in major flood stage, 21 in moderate flooding and 38 in minor flooding.\n\nMost of the weekend's rain fell over western and central Texas, but there was a significant chance of heavier rain in the greater Houston area Sunday.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Houston posted on X at 1:30 p.m. CT, the \"next round of storms has arrived and continue to train along the I-10 corridor.\"\n\nJackson, Wharton, and Colorado counties were under a severe thunderstorm watch in effect until 7 p.m. Storm activity is expected to wind down this evening.\n\nEarlier, the office said 1 to 3 more inches of rain were possible by Monday morning. Some areas could see up to 4 to 8 inches.\n\n\"Because of multiple rounds of heavy rain over the past week, flooding may be seen earlier than would be expected under typical conditions. Rainfall today will continue to exacerbate existing river flooding,\" warned the Houston weather service office.\n\nThe rainfall amounts in the region have been huge over the past week, with some areas picking up two months worth of rain in five days. The weather service listed some of the rainfall totals it collected:\n\nThere is relief on the horizon, however. The rest of the week's forecast for Houston is showing dry weather and warm temperatures from Monday through Saturday, with lots of sunshine to help dry the region out.\n\nThis week's storms were just the latest in a series of brutal weather events that have pounded the state since early April. Dozens of tornadoes have hit from the Panhandle to the Gulf Coast, some areas of the state have been pounded with softball-sized hail and months of rain has fallen in East Texas in intense spurts, causing rivers to rise to levels not seen since the devastating floods of Hurricane Harvey in 2017.\n\nMandatory evacuations are in place in counties in and around the Houston area, as local officials make comparisons to past disasters. The flooding is \"85% worse than Hurricane Harvey,\" Emmitt Eldridge, San Jacinto County's emergency management coordinator, told CNN. \"This has been a historic flood for Walker County. We have flooded more from this event than we did during Hurricane Harvey,\" Sherri Pegoda, Walker County's deputy emergency management coordinator, said.\n\nA mandatory evacuation order remains in place for low-lying unincorporated areas of Polk County through Sunday evening, emergency managers said in a Facebook post, as are homes along rivers in Harris and Montgomery counties.\n\nDisaster declarations are active for over a third of Texas counties after Gov. Greg Abbott expanded the storm-related declarations in response to the flooding, according to a news release. Additional counties could be added in the coming days, particularly with more storms in the forecast.", "source": {"uri": "ksltv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSLTV.com"}, "authors": [],

Hurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues.\n\nIn one soggy area of Houston, school officials in Channelview canceled classes and said a survey of their employees found many of them had experienced circumstances that would prevent them from coming to work.\n\n\"These folks have suffered much, people,\" Trinity County Sheriff Woody Wallace said Sunday during a Facebook livestream as he rode a boat through a rural flooded neighborhood. Partially submerged cars and street signs peeked above the water around him.\n\nAreas near Lake Livingston, located northeast of Houston, received upwards of 23 inches (58 centimeters) of rain over the past week, National Weather Service meteorologist Jimmy Fowler said.\n\nIn Johnson County, south of Fort Worth, a 4-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said. The Tarrant County medical examiner's office said the cause of death of the child, who would have turned 5 later this month, was drowning.\n\nThe child and two adults were trying to reach dry ground when they were swept away. The adults were rescued around 5 a.m. and taken to a hospital, while the child was found dead around 7:20 a.m. in the water, Johnson County Emergency Management Director Jamie Moore wrote in a social media post.\n\nStorms brought 9 inches (23 centimeters) of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley said.\n\nToday's Top Headlines Rolls-Royce adding capacity at Graniteville plant to meet data center backup power demands Super fun: Kentucky Derby parties provide boost for charities Jackson resident finds purpose, fulfillment as foster parent Business roundup: New Japanese restaurant opens, La Parisienne has new co-owner Today's events for May 6 MEDICAL INSIGHTS: Limit your consumption of ultra processed foods 2 men arrested in connection with shooting near Hitchcock Animal Hospital Shakes and shouts: Greenville, Dorman's Ruth win titles on tense final day at Southern Cross Beautification and preservation: Garden Club of Aiken celebrates a century USC Aiken Eventing teams finish in top 10 at USEA Intercollegiate Championship, reflect on growth of club\n\nSince last week, storms have forced numerous high-water rescues in the Houston area, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes.\n\nGreg Moss, 68, stayed put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. A day earlier, he had packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nMoss moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where he planned to stay until the waters recede. The floodwaters had already gone down by a couple of feet and he wasn't worried his home would flood because it's located on higher ground, Moss said Sunday.\n\nThis story corrects the age of the young boy who died to 4 instead of 5.\n\nStengle reported from Dallas and Associated Press reporter Juan A.

We have Jet Skis, we have air boats. Our Houston Public Works Department has dump trucks that can be outfitted to move people through those high waters, so it really is a unified effort to make sure that these Houstonians are staying safe,\" he added.\n\nForecast calls for rain Sunday into Monday\n\nMost of the weekend's rain fell over western and central Texas, but there's a significant chance of heavier rain in the greater Houston area Sunday.\n\nAn additional 1 to 3 inches of rainfall possible by Monday morning, according to the Houston National Weather Service office. Isolated areas could see up to 4 to 8 inches of rainfall.\n\n\"Because of multiple rounds of heavy rain over the past week, flooding may be seen earlier than would be expected under typical conditions. Rainfall today will continue to exacerbate existing river flooding,\" warned the Houston weather service office.\n\nThe rainfall amounts in the region have been huge over the past week, with some areas picking up two months worth of rain in five days. The weather service listed some of the rainfall totals it collected:\n\nThere is relief on the horizon, however. The rest of the week's forecast for Houston is showing dry weather and warm temperatures from Monday through Saturday, with lots of sunshine to help dry the region out.\n\nThis week's storms were just the latest in a series of brutal weather events that have pounded the state since early April. Dozens of tornadoes have hit from the Panhandle to the Gulf Coast, some areas of the state have been pounded with softball-sized hail and months of rain has fallen in East Texas in intense spurts, causing rivers to rise to levels not seen since the devastating floods of Hurricane Harvey in 2017.\n\nMandatory evacuations are in place in counties in and around the Houston area, as local officials make comparisons to past disasters. The flooding is \"85% worse than Hurricane Harvey,\" Emmitt Eldridge, San Jacinto County's emergency management coordinator, told CNN. \"This has been a historic flood for Walker County. We have flooded more from this event than we did during Hurricane Harvey,\" Sherri Pegoda, Walker County's deputy emergency management coordinator, said.\n\nA mandatory evacuation order remains in place for low-lying unincorporated areas of Polk County through Sunday evening, emergency managers said in a Facebook post, as are homes along rivers in Harris and Montgomery counties.\n\nDisaster declarations are active for over a third of Texas counties after Gov. Greg Abbott expanded the storm-related declarations in response to the flooding, according to a news release. Additional counties could be added in the coming days, particularly with more storms in the forecast.\n\nCNN's Allison Chinchar, Ray Sanchez, Andy Rose and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.",

We have Jet Skis, we have air boats. Our Houston Public Works Department has dump trucks that can be outfitted to move people through those high waters, so it really is a unified effort to make sure that these Houstonians are staying safe,\" he added.\n\nMost of the weekend's rain fell over western and central Texas, but there's a significant chance of heavier rain in the greater Houston area Sunday.\n\nAn additional 1 to 3 inches of rainfall possible by Monday morning, according to the Houston National Weather Service office. Isolated areas could see up to 4 to 8 inches of rainfall.\n\n\"Because of multiple rounds of heavy rain over the past week, flooding may be seen earlier than would be expected under typical conditions. Rainfall today will continue to exacerbate existing river flooding,\" warned the Houston weather service office.\n\nThe rainfall amounts in the region have been huge over the past week, with some areas picking up two months worth of rain in five days. The weather service listed some of the rainfall totals it collected:\n\nThere is relief on the horizon, however. The rest of the week's forecast for Houston is showing dry weather and warm temperatures from Monday through Saturday, with lots of sunshine to help dry the region out.\n\nThis week's storms were just the latest in a series of brutal weather events that have pounded the state since early April. Dozens of tornadoes have hit from the Panhandle to the Gulf Coast, some areas of the state have been pounded with softball-sized hail and months of rain has fallen in East Texas in intense spurts, causing rivers to rise to levels not seen since the devastating floods of Hurricane Harvey in 2017.\n\nMandatory evacuations are in place in counties in and around the Houston area, as local officials make comparisons to past disasters. The flooding is \"85% worse than Hurricane Harvey,\" Emmitt Eldridge, San Jacinto County's emergency management coordinator, told CNN. \"This has been a historic flood for Walker County. We have flooded more from this event than we did during Hurricane Harvey,\" Sherri Pegoda, Walker County's deputy emergency management coordinator, said.\n\nA mandatory evacuation order remains in place for low-lying unincorporated areas of Polk County through Sunday evening, emergency managers said in a Facebook post, as are homes along rivers in Harris and Montgomery counties.\n\nDisaster declarations are active for over a third of Texas counties after Gov. Greg Abbott expanded the storm-related declarations in response to the flooding, according to a news release. Additional counties could be added in the coming days, particularly with more storms in the forecast.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Hurricane Harvey in 2017 dumped historic rainfall that flooded thousands of homes and resulted in more than 60,000 rescues.\n\nIn one soggy area of Houston, school officials in Channelview canceled classes and said a survey of their employees found many of them had experienced circumstances that would prevent them from coming to work.\n\n\"These folks have suffered much, people,\" Trinity County Sheriff Woody Wallace said Sunday during a Facebook livestream as he rode a boat through a rural flooded neighborhood.\n\n[Recovery a faraway thought for East Texas flood evacuees as more rain is expected]\n\nPartially submerged cars and street signs peeked above the water around him.Areas near Lake Livingston, located northeast of Houston, received upwards of 23 inches of rain over the past week, National Weather Service meteorologist Jimmy Fowler said.\n\nIn Johnson County, south of Fort Worth, a 5-year-old boy died when he was swept away after the vehicle he was riding in became stuck in swift-moving water near the community of Lillian just before 2 a.m. Sunday, an official said.\n\nThe child and two adults were trying to reach dry ground when they were swept away. The adults were rescued around 5 a.m. and taken to a hospital, while the child was found dead around 7:20 a.m. in the water, Johnson County Emergency Management Director Jamie Moore wrote in a social media post.Storms brought 9 inches of rain in a span of six to eight hours in some areas from central Texas to the Dallas-Fort Worth area, National Weather Service meteorologist Matt Stalley said.\n\nSince last week, storms have forced numerous high-water rescues in the Houston area, including some from the rooftops of flooded homes. Greg Moss, 68, stayed put in his recreational vehicle on Sunday after leaving his home in the community of Channelview in eastern Harris County near the San Jacinto River. A day earlier, he had packed up many of his belongings and left before the road to his home flooded.\n\n\"I would be stuck for four days,\" Moss said. \"So now at least I can go get something to eat.\"\n\nMoss moved his belongings and vehicle to a neighbor's home, where he planned to stay until the waters recede. The floodwaters had already gone down by a couple of feet and he wasn't worried his home would flood because it's located on higher ground, Moss said Sunday.\n\nDisclosure: Facebook has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

The heaviest downpours in central Texas will occur upstream of the flooding in Houston - which is located in Harris, potentially exacerbating flooding in a region where 12 river gauges have reached major flood stage.\n\nThis week's storms were just the latest in a series of brutal weather events that have pounded the state since early April. Dozens of tornadoes have hit from the Panhandle to the Gulf Coast, some areas of the state have been pounded with softball-sized hail and months of rain has fallen in East Texas in intense spurts, causing rivers to rise to levels not seen since the devastating floods of Hurricane Harvey in 2017.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center issued a tornado watch for southwestern Texas - including San Angelo and Del Rio - until 10 p.m. local time. Severe thunderstorms capable of producing a few tornadoes, hail as large as grapefruit and damaging winds up to 70 mph are possible across the region this afternoon and evening, according to the center.\n\n\"The risk for a strong tornado may maximize during the late afternoon to early evening timeframe,\" the center warned.\n\nA severe thunderstorm watch is in effect from southeastern New Mexico into northwestern Texas until 10 p.m. local time. It includes Abilene and Midland in Texas, and Carlsbad, New Mexico.\n\nThe forecast comes as some communities north of Houston picked up nearly two months' worth of rain Thursday. This rainfall plunged roadways underwater and forced rivers to overflow, leading to evacuations and water rescues.\n\nHere's what's happened in South Texas Friday evening:\n\n* San Jacinto County, 60 miles north of Houston: About 100-200 homes are affected by floodwaters and mandatory evacuations are in effect. The event is \"85% worse than Hurricane Harvey,\" Emmitt Eldridge, the county's emergency management coordinator, told CNN. Eldridge said since they are downstream from Dallas along the Trinity River, \"we are expecting to see a lot more water\" because of additional rainfall. \"Anything they deal with, we deal with,\" he added. According to Eldridge, there have been at least 58 water rescues in the county so far. More rain is expected in the area next week.\n\n* Walker County, about 70 miles northwest of Houston: Authorities are calling the floods historic there as well. \"This has been a historic flood for Walker County. We have flooded more from this event than we did during Hurricane Harvey,\" Sherri Pegoda, Walker County's deputy emergency management coordinator, told CNN. According to Pegoda, two communities are underwater along the Trinity River and are only accessible via high-water vehicles. \"Almost all roads in Walker County were completely submerged Monday night and into Tuesday,\" Pegoda said. \"We still have approximately 43 roads that are flooded with several major washouts and a couple of bridges that have been compromised.\" At least 42 high-water rescues have been performed in the county since April 28, she added.\n\n* Polk County, about 80 miles northeast of Houston: A mandatory evacuation order remains in place for low-lying unincorporated areas as severe weather is expected to impact the area Sunday, the Polk County Office of Emergency Management said in a Facebook post. Areas under evacuation orders are along the Trinity River and below the Lake Livingston Dam. \"Our area may receive up to 1 to 3 inches of rainfall with isolated amounts of up to 4 to 8 inches possible,\" the post said. The county is under a flood watch until 7 p.m. Sunday, the post said.\n\nRoughly 700 homes have been flooded, according to emergency management officials, who warned additional rainfall could keep flood levels on the rise in the coming days. A total of 1,000 homes are in a mandatory evacuation zone in the county, Polk County Judge Sydney Murphy told CNN. A flood warning remained in effect Friday for the county. The judge said they were concerned and keeping an eye on what was happening north of the county with the flooding because it would impact the area. \"Due to continuous rainfall across East Texas and rising levels in creeks and rivers, flood levels may increase. Please remain aware of changing flood levels along the Trinity River and ALL low-lying levels. If you wish to evacuate, please do so now!,\" the emergency management office recently said in a Facebook post.\n\n* Harris County, which also includes several northern Houston suburbs: Mandatory evacuations have been in place since Thursday for residents on the east side of the East Fork of the San Jacinto River. The river hit major flood stage on Thursday and is forecast to crest Saturday morning just a few feet shy of the record level during Harvey. \"We want you out of this area... this is a life-threatening situation,\" Hidalgo said at a news conference. The level of water rise anticipated will impact elevated structures and may rise to reach rooftops or power lines, according to Hidalgo.\n\nIn the Harris County suburb of Crosby, a school bus driver spotted flooding over a road that had not yet been barricaded, stopped the bus and had the middle and high school students on board exit through the rear door, according to a statement from the school district. Another bus brought the students to school, where they were provided with breakfast and dry clothes, the statement added.\n\n* Liberty County, about 45 miles northeast of Houston: The Coast Guard transported a 12-hour-old baby girl by helicopter from Cleveland, Texas, Friday. The girl was experiencing low oxygen levels at Texas Emergency Hospital, which does not have a neonatal intensive care unit, according to a news release from the Coast Guard. Due to flooding, she could not be transported by ambulance on the ground. The helicopter took the girl and her mother to Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, where the baby was reported to be in stable condition, the release added.\n\nVoluntary evacuations due to flooding were also in place for Montgomery County, just to the north of Harris County.\n\nDisaster declarations are active for over a third of Texas counties after Gov. Greg Abbott expanded the storm-related declarations in response to the flooding, according to a news release. Additional counties could be added in the coming days, particularly with more storms in the forecast.\n\nParts of eastern Texas have received anywhere from three to seven times their typical rainfall over the last three to four weeks. The repeated bouts of heavy rainfall soaked soils, making many areas extremely prone to both flash and river flooding. Nearly a foot of rain fell in some spots from Thursday to Friday morning, delivering the final blow. Periods of rain will continue through Friday evening, and an additional 1 to 2 inches of rain are possible.\n\nThe worst flooding is confined to southeastern Texas where at least a dozen river gauges - including parts of the San Jacinto and Trinity rivers - are in major flood stage, the highest level, as of Friday morning. Several more sites are forecast to experience major flooding by the weekend and could meet or exceed record levels set during Harvey.\n\nHurricane Harvey created a widespread flooding disaster in Houston after dropping 30 to 40 inches of rain across the entire metro in just 48 hours. While this week's ongoing flooding is notable, it's much less widespread and occurring north of where Harvey's worst rain fell.\n\nAs torrential rain flooded eastern Texas, severe thunderstorms spun up tornadoes both north and south of the Abilene area in west Texas. There were eight reports of tornadoes Thursday, according to the Storm Prediction Center.\n\nA \"large and extremely dangerous\" tornado impacted the towns of Hodges and Hawley - about 10 miles north of Abilene - Thursday evening.\n\nAround 30 homes in Hawley were shredded by the tornado's winds, with entire sections of some homes left completely exposed. Cars in the area also sustained damage from flying debris. There were \"numerous\" injuries, but no deaths as of Friday morning, Hawley Police Chief Brad Wilson told CNN.\n\nAt least one area school district is allowing students to study from home or take time to recover Friday, following Thursday evening's damaging tornado.\n\n\"The Hawley community has been hit pretty hard and we have several families that have lost homes,\" the Hawley Independent School District said in a Facebook post.\n\nRainfall totals from flooding in Texas and Louisiana this week showed nearly two feet of rain in five days, according to the National Weather Service. Totals ranged from 23.56 inches in Groveton, Texas, to 18.42 inches in Livingston, Texas.\n\nCNN's Allison Chinchar, Sara Tonks, Ray Sanchez, Andy Rose, Joe Sutton and Paradise Afshar contributed to

I think he just went under.\"\n\nFirst responders arrived and were able to rescue the man and woman around 5 a.m., said Moore, who was involved in the search. The man and woman were transported to the hospital.\n\nThe body of the boy, who was going to turn 5 in three weeks, was found in the water around 7:20 a.m., Moore said.\n\n\"I hope you will keep this family in your prayers,\" Moore told CNN.\n\nA GoFundMe page has been set up for the family of Lucas Warren. CNN has verified the page with GoFundMe.\n\nWith days of rain, rivers farther south have swollen, leaving homes and businesses flooded and thousands of people displaced.\n\nAt least 224 people have been rescued from homes and vehicles in Harris County, an official said Saturday night, with evacuation orders and flood watches in place, as more rain descended on the state Sunday, with a bull's-eye of excessive rainfall over the already waterlogged Houston area. No deaths or serious injuries had been reported in the area, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo told CNN, adding 153 pets have also been rescued during the deluge.\n\n\"It's been really sad to see the impact of people's livelihoods, homes, infrastructure as well as just the public infrastructure,\" Hidalgo told CNN on Saturday.\n\n\"We're really asking folks to give it a minute before they go back home.\"\n\nCNN's Rosa Flores rode in a boat Sunday with rescuers from the Harris County Sheriff's Office and said the craft passed over fences and mailboxes. Stop signs were at eye level.\n\nIn some areas, the water had receded Sunday but was still very high.\n\nThe first responders took CNN to an area where the banks of the San Jacinto River were not visible.\n\n\"It's kinda hard to tell where the river ends,\" Lt. David Jasper said.\n\nMany people in Houston were evacuated before the worst of the severe weather, Brent Taylor, chief communications officer for the Houston Office of Emergency Management, told CNN's Amara Walker.\n\n\"We have Houston Police and Houston Fire who are patrolling these neighborhoods that are near the river and where the water is gone so high,\" Taylor said. \"There's been some instances where it's someone just yelling for help saying, 'Hey, I'm stuck over here!'\"\n\n\"We have high water rescue vehicles. We have Jet Skis, we have air boats. Our Houston Public Works Department has dump trucks that can be outfitted to move people through those high waters, so it really is a unified effort to make sure that these Houstonians are staying safe,\" he added.\n\nNot everyone wanted to leave their homes, Deputy Darrell Bailey of the Harris County Sheriff's Office told CNN's crew on their ride-along.\n\n\"They have a lot of people in the area who don't want to leave because they'd have no place to go and they don't want to go to the shelter,\" he said.\n\nThe website for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's West Gulf River Forecast Center shows seven river gauges in Texas in major flood stage, 19 in moderate flooding and 36 in minor flooding.\n\nConditions were improving as Monday drew closer.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Houston posted on X at 7 p.m. CT: \"After 93 hours in effect, the Flood Watch has finally expired.\"\n\nEarlier, the office said 1 to 3 more inches of rain were possible by Monday morning, and some areas could see up to 4 to 8 inches. There was a 20% chance of rain Monday morning, forecasters said.\n\n\"Moderate to major river flooding will remain a concern through the next several days to over a week,\" the office said.\n\nRainfall amounts in the region have been huge over the past week, with some areas picking up two months' worth of rain in five days. Early Sunday, the weather service listed some of the rainfall totals it collected:\n\nThe rest of the week's forecast for Houston is showing dry weather and warm temperatures from Monday through Saturday, with lots of sunshine during the latter part of the week to help dry the region out.\n\nThis week's storms were just the latest in a series of brutal weather events that have pounded the state since early April. Dozens of tornadoes have hit from the Panhandle to the Gulf Coast, some areas of the state have been pounded with softball-sized hail and months of rain has fallen in East Texas in intense spurts, causing rivers to rise to levels not seen since the devastating floods of Hurricane Harvey in 2017.", "source": {"uri": "abc7ny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC7 New York"}, "authors": [],

The three occupants escaped but a 911 caller said they were swept into the floodwaters when they tried to get to safe ground, according to Moore.\n\nA man and woman were rescued, said Moore, who was involved in the search.\n\n\"I hope you will keep this family in your prayers,\" Moore told CNN.\n\nWith days of rain, rivers farther south have swollen, leaving homes and businesses flooded and thousands of people displaced.\n\nAt least 224 people have been rescued from homes and vehicles in Harris County, an official said Saturday night, with evacuation orders and flood watches in place, as more rain descended on the state Sunday, with a bull's-eye of excessive rainfall over the already waterlogged Houston area. No deaths or serious injuries had been reported in that area, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo told CNN, adding 153 pets have also been rescued during the deluge.\n\n\"It's been really sad to see the impact of people's livelihoods, homes, infrastructure as well as just the public infrastructure,\" Hidalgo told CNN on Saturday.\n\n\"We're really asking folks to give it a minute before they go back home.\"\n\nCNN's Rosa Flores rode in a boat Sunday with rescuers from the Harris County Sheriff's Office and said the craft passed over fences and mailboxes. Stop signs were at eye level.\n\nIn some areas, the water had receded Sunday but was still very high.\n\nThe first responders took CNN to an area where the banks of the San Jacinto River were not visible.\n\n\"It's kinda hard to tell where the river ends,\" Lt. David Jasper said.\n\nMany people in Houston were evacuated before the worst of the severe weather, Brent Taylor, chief communications officer for the Houston Office of Emergency Management, told CNN's Amara Walker.\n\n\"We have Houston Police and Houston Fire who are patrolling these neighborhoods that are near the river and where the water is gone so high,\" Taylor said. \"There's been some instances where it's someone just yelling for help saying, 'Hey, I'm stuck over here!'\"\n\n\"We have high water rescue vehicles. We have Jet Skis, we have air boats. Our Houston Public Works Department has dump trucks that can be outfitted to move people through those high waters, so it really is a unified effort to make sure that these Houstonians are staying safe,\" he added.\n\nNot everyone wanted to leave their homes, Deputy Darrell Bailey of the Harris County Sheriff's Office told CNN's crew on their ride-along.\n\n\"They have a lot of people in the area who don't want to leave because they'd have no place to go and they don't want to go to the shelter,\" he said.\n\nThe website for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's West Gulf River Forecast Center shows seven river gaugesin Texas in major flood stage, 19 in moderate flooding and 36 in minor flooding.\n\nConditions were improving as Monday drew closer.\n\nThe National Weather Service office in Houston posted on X at 7 p.m. CT: \"After 93 hours in effect, the Flood Watch has finally expired.\"\n\nEarlier, the office said 1 to 3 more inches of rain were possible by Monday morning, and that some areas could see up to 4 to 8 inches.There was a 20% chance of rain Monday morning, forecasters said.\n\n\"Moderate to major river flooding will remain a concern through the next several days to over a week,\" the office said.\n\nRainfall amounts in the region have been huge over the past week, with some areas picking up two months' worth of rain in five days. Early Sunday, the weather service listed some of the rainfall totals it collected:\n\nThe rest of the week's forecast for Houston is showing dry weather and warm temperatures from Monday through Saturday, with lots of sunshine during the latter part of the week to help dry the region out.\n\nThis week's storms were just the latest in a series of brutal weather events that have pounded the state since early April. Dozens of tornadoes have hit from the Panhandle to the Gulf Coast, some areas of the state have been pounded with softball-sized hail and months of rain has fallen in East Texas in intense spurts, causing rivers to rise to levels not seen since the devastating floods of Hurricane Harvey in 2017.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

With more rain coming, conditions aren't expected to improve.\n\nBelow, we're keeping updates from around the Houston area, plus have a list of resources for people dealing with flooding conditions.\n\nWater levels are expected to keep rising and disaster declarations have already been signed in Harris County and further north in Huntsville. Those allow for more resources to be deployed.\n\nThe City of Houston opened its joint information center Friday morning and the state is sending extra high-water vehicles to help.\n\nThe City of Houston was under a moderate risk for flooding Sunday. KHOU 11 reporter Victor Jacobo is in town, watching conditions. You can see his report that ran on KHOU 11 Morning News below.\n\nRiver Road in Channelview was turning into just that. KHOU 11 reporter Katiera Winfrey was in that area, tracking water levels. It's the same spot where reporter Stephen Goin was on Saturday night, tracking rescues.\n\nReporter Stephen Goin was in Channelview Saturday. Deputies with the Harris County Sheriff's Office told KHOU 11 News 22 adults, six children and some animals were rescued from some neighborhoods Saturday.\n\nReporter Anayeli Ruiz was in Kingwood Saturday where residents have been experiencing flooding for days and they now face the possibility of more flooding from rain on Sunday.\n\nReporter Katiera Winfrey was in Humble on Saturday. Residents there know that flooding is part of life along the West Fork of the San Jacinto River. That doesn't make what's happening now any easier.\n\nThe Kingwood area has been hit hard by flooding. On Saturday, Houston Mayor John Whitmire and HPD Chief Troy Finner took an aerial tour of the area. Here are some of the sights they saw.\n\nHarris County Judge Lina Hidalgo gave an update on flooding Saturday before touring areas in the northern portion of the county. She said that the evacuation order remains. She also said that right now the county is at a Level 1 response, which is the maximum. She expects to be at Level 3 by tomorrow afternoon.

Plum Grove is about 20 minutes south of Cleveland.\n\nThe San Jacinto River Authority said more than 20 inches of rain fell north of Lake Conroe over the last week.\n\nAt 204 feet, the lake has reached its third-highest level ever.\n\nSJRA said they have to release water from the lake to get it back to a safe level of 201 feet and preserve the safety and integrity of the dam.\n\nLake Conroe releases flow into the West Fork of the San Jacinto River. Inflows from the West Fork and East Fork flow into Lake Houston.\n\nThere are more than 12 tributaries that contribute to the levels at Lake Houston. The latest reports from the National Weather Service and Harris County Flood Control District predict the peak at Lake Houston Saturday evening.\n\nHarris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said deputies rescued 11 adults and 9 children from Tortuga Circle in Idlewilde, which is in the Huffman area.\n\nGonzalez said his deputies had rescued 39 people and 13 animals from flooded neighborhoods as of 3:54 p.m. on Friday.\n\nUnited Way of Houston said 211 is manned 24 hours a day and seven days a week.\n\n\"If you require assistance, please don't hesitate to call 2-1-1 day or night,\" United Way posted on Instagram.\n\nSeveral area roads still had high water on Friday afternoon, according to Houston TranStar.

Otherwise, prepare to stay in place for 2-3 days.\"\n\nEmergency officials expect the San Jacinto River to rise to 78 feet above sea level, which means there will be significant flooding.\n\n\"That is just three feet below where it was during (Hurricane) Harvey. So, we will go 78 feet higher than we were the other day, which means even elevated structures will get water. It also means street side structures will have rooftop flooding,\" Hidalgo said Thursday in a press conference.\n\nOfficials said the river will likely crest this weekend. That is why mandatory evacuations have been issued.\n\n\"Even elevated structures will get water. It also means street-side structures will have rooftop flooding. It means the water will be hitting power lines,\" Hidalgo said.\n\nThese are the neighborhoods included in the evacuation order.\n\nVoluntary evacuation advisories for several other communities around the San Jacinto River. People in the following areas should leave or plan to be stuck for two or three days.\n\nRELATED: List: High water locations across Houston area\n\nIn Montgomery County, officials issued a voluntary evacuation order and said roads were closed because of flooding along the river. The area got about 5 to 8 inches of rain within 24 hours, with some spots getting as much as 10 to 12 inches of rain, said National Weather Service meteorologist Hayley Adams.\n\n\"We are still having to rescue motorists who ignore barricades or water over roadways and place themselves and first responders in harms way,\" Montgomery County Judge Mark Keough said Friday in a Facebook post.\n\nA family in McDade Estates in Conroe sent us photos of water inside their home. McDade Estates is a subdivision along the east side of the San Jac W Fork along FM 2854.\n\nShelters are now open and available for any residents who need to evacuate because of flooding concerns. Pets are welcome at both locations.\n\nThe storm brought down trees and left vehicles stranded. It prompted the San Jacinto River Authority to close Lake Conroe and increase water releases from the dam that created the reservoir.\n\nThe San Jacinto River Authority said Friday morning that with a reduction in inflows into Lake Conroe and reduced rain overnight, dam operators have lowered the release from Lake Conroe to 48,528 CFS. The lake level is currently 204.3 feet. There will continue to monitor rain and runoff in the area throughout the day.\n\nHarris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said in a press conference Friday morning she spoke with Polk County Judge Sydney Murphy who told her that more than 700 homes had been flooded. She explained that while people there were prepared to be stuck in their homes for a few days, they were not prepared to be without water.\n\nRELATED: Boil water notice issued for several Lake Livingston communities\n\nThe Texas Parks and Wildlife Department has seen impacts to multiple sites due to the recent, extended rain and flooding experienced by parts of the state.\n\nTPWD officials said state parks such as Huntsville, Village Creek and Fort Parker have closed.

Two days later, a tornado destroyed a number of properties and vehicles in Hawley.\n\nAccording to the TexasFlood.org map, produced in collaboration with the Texas General Land Office, Texas Division of Emergency Management and Texas Water Development Board, six major floods have taken place on bodies of water to the northeast of Houston.\n\nThe areas affected are the West Fork of the San Jacinto River near Humble, the San Jacinto River near Sheldon, the Trinity River near Goodrich, Liberty and Moss Bluff and the Neches River at Saltwater Barrier.\n\nLess intense, moderate flood alerts are in force over a much wider area, as far north at the Sabine River near Gladewater, and minor floods have been recorded by TexasFlood.org across eastern Texas.\n\nHopes of rapid relief are fading, with TexasFlood.org forecasting flooding through to Friday for many areas, though water levels should fall by the end of the week.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that a number of high-water rescues took place over the weekend, including several from the roofs of flooded buildings, with some roads still waterlogged or blocked by debris.\n\nThe five-year-old boy died after being swept away from the vehicle he was riding in near Lillian, south of Fort Worth, according to a Facebook post from Johnson County emergency management director Jamie Moore.\n\nThe child and two adults were in a vehicle that became stuck in swift-moving water and they were then swept away while attempting to reach dry land.\n\nBoth adults were rescued alive at 5 a.m. on Sunday and transported to hospital, but around two hours later the child was found dead in the flood waters.\n\nOver the past week, the area around Lake Livingston, northeast of Houston, received up to 23 inches of rain according to Jimmy Fowler, a National Weather Service (NWS) meteorologist cited in The Telegraph.\n\nThe NWS Houston office said on X that the area will see a \"drying trend\" between Monday and Friday along with rising temperatures, though these are expected to fall a little over Thursday night.\n\nOn May 3, around 700 houses were evacuated in Polk County, near Houston, due to flooding, according to ABC News. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo told reporters that the East Fork of the San Jacinto River had risen to 75 feet above sea level, well above the usual 45 to 50 feet and nearing the record 81 feet that

There should also be heavy rain across much of Oklahoma, with cities like Oklahoma City and Tulsa facing 1 to 3 inches as well.\n\nMeanwhile, powerful thunderstorms have popped up seemingly every day this week across parts of Texas, and that will be the case again on Saturday.\n\nAn enhanced risk for severe thunderstorms is in the forecast for parts of western Texas on Saturday and this afternoon and into the evening, strong storms could bring the potential for damaging wind, huge hail and scattered tornadoes to cities like Midland and San Angelo, Texas.\n\nAdditionally, that severe weather threat is expected to shift east into the Houston area on Sunday, bringing a flooding rain chance with it as the potential for more severe thunderstorms on Monday in the central plains from Dallas to Sioux Falls is possible.\n\nAcross parts of the country, the first scorching heat wave of the year next could happen by the middle of the week as temperatures across much of the south are expected to

It is not your typical river flood.'\n\nShe further described the surge of water as 'catastrophic' and said several hundred structures were at risk of flooding.\n\nAs of Saturday, Hidalgo said that 122 pets and 178 people were rescued from the treacherous conditions.\n\nSchools in the path of the flooding canceled classes and roads remain jammed as officials have closed highways. Authorities have yet not reported any deaths or injuries.\n\n'It's going to keep rising this way,' Flores said.\n\n'We don't know how much more. We're just preparing for the worst.'\n\nHe told The Guardian that water from the San Jacinto River has consumed his backyard.\n\n'It's sad, but what can I do,' Flores said.\n\nThe state has been pounded with brutal weather conditions since early April as dozens of tornadoes have hit the Panhandle to the Gulf Coast.\n\nCertain parts of Texas have been smacked with 'softball-sized' hail and the relentless rainfall has caused rivers to see levels that have not been seen since the devastating floods of Hurricane Harvey in 2017.\n\nA Conroe firefighter is seen carrying an elderly woman to safety after her home flooded in Conroe, Texas\n\nAn SUV is seen almost completely submerged in flood water on Thursday in Spring, Texas\n\nA utility worker is see tying to fix power lines after a massive tree fell on a home in Spring, Texas\n\nOn Thursday alone, some Texan communities saw more rainfall than they normally would in a two month period.\n\nFriday's downpour left Texas officials scrambling to take cautionary efforts and issue evacuation warnings - worrying that the worst was yet to come.\n\nShocking footage captured the moment a huge white tractor trailer plunged into the deep floodwater in San Jacinto County as bystanders watched in shock and horror.\n\nThe driver was seen in bright neon yellow clambering out of the window in a frantic bid to escape the doomed vehicle.\n\nAs the truck continued to sink deeper and deeper, another truck zoomed past it - sending water gushing on both sides, as a different vehicle also managed to wade through.\n\nAfter escaping amidst the chaos - the driver perched on the hood of the vehicle, stuck in the middle of the body of water formed by the catastrophic flash flood.\n\nFor weeks, drenching rains in Texas and parts of Louisiana have filled reservoirs and completely saturated the ground.\n\nFloodwaters started to partially submerge cars and roads this week across parts of southeastern Texas, north of Houston, where high waters reached the roofs of some homes.\n\nIn the rural community of Shepherd, Gilroy Fernandes said he and his spouse had about an hour to evacuate after a mandatory order. Their home is on stilts near the Trinity River, and they felt relief when the water began to recede on Thursday but things worsened overnight.\n\n'Next thing you know, overnight they started releasing more water from the dam at Livingston. And so that caused the level of the river to shoot up by almost five or six feet overnight,' Fernandes said.\n\nNeighbors who left an hour later got stuck in traffic because of the flooding.\n\nA

through a Texas town, injuring two and damaging six homes in its wake, weather officials reported.\n\nThe tornado was first spotted west of Anson around 6.35pm before it moved south east toward Truby

spectator saw it near Highway 277 and 605 near Clear Fork Church.\n\nTerrified motorists were seen trying to get out of harm's way as the tornado followed close behind, causing downed trees and power lines, as per the National Weather Service.\n\nBy 7:23pm, the tornado hit County Road 494 and Fulwiler Road in Tye before it spun up into the cloud formations, as hail, described by one witness as 'baseball size' fell from the sky.\n\nThe area hit with the most destruction was located in the Hawley area, population 579 in 2024, according to World Population Review.\n\nMike Castillo, Warning Coordination Meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Angelo, told local KTAB/KRBC of the damage the tornado caused.\n\nIt is unknown what injuries the two people sustained.", "source":

Swaths of Texas have been hit by the flash floods, with areas as far north as the Dallas-Forth Worth metroplex being inundated.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the recent floods:\n\nRains forecast to hit north of the city Thursday ended up being more intense than originally predicted, causing waterways across the northern edge of Greater Houston, especially the San Jacinto River, to swell and flood surrounding communities.\n\nHundreds of homes and businesses have since flooded, and many school districts have canceled classes due to the dangerous conditions.\n\nThe flooding was exacerbated by water releases from Lake Houston and Lake Conroe, though some officials downplayed their impact on rising water levels.\n\nHarris, Montgomery, San Jacinto, Liberty, Walker and Polk counties are among those affected by the flash floods, though much of southeast Texas was also hit hard. More than 600 people have been rescued from flood waters across the region.\n\nOnline images showed the extent of the devastation in the flooded communities. Videos and photos showed homes and vehicles underwater, downed structures and streets turned into rivers by the floods.\n\nIn Houston, Kingwood has been hit especially hard. Mayor John Whitmire assessed the damage flying overhead in a helicopter during the weekend.\n\nParts of North Texas have also been affected by floods. A 5-year-old boy in Johnson County, near Fort Worth, died Sunday after being swept up by swift waters.\n\nOfficials from Harris County and other local governments on Thursday started to warn the potential flooding could be catastrophic as lake and creek levels rose through the day.\n\nThat day, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo called for mandatory evacuations along the east fork of the San Jacinto River. In Kingwood, Houston residents were told to leave the area or prepare to shelter in place for two days.\n\nThe Harris County Flood Control District said on Sunday it will be watching areas north of I-10 closely for new flooding as storms continued into Sunday night. Harris County agencies have rescued 233 people and 164 pets since the floods began as of Sunday, according to the Harris County Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management.\n\nNeighboring counties have reported destruction and a rising number of high-water rescues. The Waller County emergency management office reported at least 10 more rescues through Sunday, bringing the county's total to 60 since the flooding began. San Jacinto County has reported 62 rescues, which included dozens of pets.\n\nTrinity County Sheriff Woody Wallace took to Facebook live to show off the devastation caused by the floods. Wallace rode on a boat through a neighborhood underwater near Lake Livingston, showing houses partially submerged, some fallen power lines underwater and cars either fully or half covered by water.\n\nRelief organizations across the region like Red Cross and the Montgomery County Food Bank have both asked for donations to aid those affected by the floods. The Red Cross has opened several shelters around the disaster area and has asked for more local volunteers.\n\nMontgomery County Food Bank has asked for canned vegetables, hot and cold cereal and toiletries, among others.", "source": {"uri": "houstonchronicle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Houston Chronicle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood",

According to the National Weather Service, rainfall totals from flooding in Texas and Louisiana this week rose to almost two feet in five days. The area also remains under the threat of worsening flood conditions that are so disastrous, they have been compared to Hurricane Harvey in reports.A flood watch for the area is now in effect through Sunday afternoon with forecasters predicting more rain on Saturday night that will bring another 1-3 inches (2.5-7.6cm) and trigger major flooding.While these storms are the latest to prompt evacuations and rescues, Texas and some parts of Louisiana have been experiencing a series of intense weather events since early April, including tornadoes and softball-sized hail as well as months of rain that has triggered flooding comparable to the Category 4 Hurricane Harvey of 2017. Which dropped 30 to 40 inches of rain across the Houston area in just 48 hours.That strange weather is predicted to continue, according to the Storm Prediction Center which issued a tornado watch for southwestern Texas. The center also predicted hail as large as grapefruit and damaging winds up to 70 miles per hour on Saturday afternoon and evening. Friday's storms led to at least 400 people having to be rescued from rooftops, roads, and homes. But despite the downpour damaging homes and triggering evacuations, no deaths nor serious injuries have been reported, according to Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo.

The intense flooding forced 400 residents to evacuate and destroyed more than 100 homes. On Friday, heavy storms in Houston left drivers stranded and a school bus of children in need of high-water rescues due to floods. The following day, high waters flooded neighborhoods in Houston as forecasters warned residents that additional rainfall could come on Sunday, causing further flooding for Harris County.\n\nThe aerial shot showed parts of Harris County, one of the biggest in the country, almost completely covered in brown, murky flood water. 'We're just preparing for the worst,' Miguel Flores Jr., a resident from Kingwood, a neighborhood in Houston, said. Homes were mildly visible as most of them remained under water on Sunday morning. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo cautioned: 'This threat is ongoing and it's going to get worse. It is not your typical river flood.'\n\nShe further described the surge of water as 'catastrophic' and said several hundred structures were at risk of flooding. As of Saturday, Hidalgo said that 122 pets and 178 people were rescued from the treacherous conditions. Schools in the path of the flooding canceled classes and roads remain jammed as officials have closed highways. Authorities have yet not reported any deaths or injuries. 'It's going to keep rising this way,' Flores said. 'We don't know how much more. We're just preparing for the worst.'\n\nHe told The Guardian that water from the San Jacinto River has consumed his backyard. 'It's sad, but what can I do,' Flores said. The state has been pounded with brutal weather conditions since early April as dozens of tornadoes have hit the Panhandle to the Gulf Coast. Certain parts of Texas have been smacked with 'softball-sized' hail and the relentless rainfall has caused rivers to see levels that have not been seen since the devastating floods of Hurricane Harvey in 2017.\n\nOn Thursday alone, some Texan communities saw more rainfall than they normally would in a two month period. Friday's downpour left Texas officials scrambling to take cautionary efforts and issue evacuation warnings - worrying that the worst was yet to come. Shocking footage captured the moment a huge white tractor trailer plunged into the deep floodwater in San Jacinto County as bystanders watched in shock and horror.\n\nThe driver was seen in bright neon yellow clambering out of the window in a frantic bid to escape the doomed vehicle. As the truck continued to sink deeper and deeper, another truck zoomed past it - sending water gushing on both sides, as a different vehicle also managed to wade through. After escaping amidst the chaos - the driver perched on the hood of the vehicle, stuck in the middle of the body of water formed by the catastrophic flash flood.\n\nFor weeks, drenching rains in Texas and parts of Louisiana have filled reservoirs and completely saturated the ground. Floodwaters started to partially submerge cars and roads this week across parts of southeastern Texas, north of Houston, where high waters reached the roofs of some homes. In the rural community of Shepherd, Gilroy Fernandes said he and his spouse had about an hour to evacuate after a mandatory order. Their home is on stilts near the Trinity River, and they felt relief when the water began to recede on Thursday but things worsened overnight. 'Next thing you know, overnight they started releasing more water from the dam at Livingston. And so that caused the level of the river to shoot up by almost five or six feet overnight,' Fernandes said.\n\nNeighbors who left an hour later got stuck in traffic because of the flooding. Montgomery County Judge Mark Keough claims there have been more high-water rescues than he was able to count. 'We estimate we've had a couple hundred rescues from homes, from houses, from vehicles,' Keough said.\n\nOn Thursday, a ferocious tornado ripped through a Texas town, injuring two and damaging six homes in its wake, weather officials reported. The tornado was first spotted west of Anson around 6.35pm before it moved south east toward Truby and the community of Hodges and Hawley, a city in Jones County. The funnel whipped its way toward Abilene in Taylor County, located approximately 180 miles west of the Dallas-Fort Worth, before a spectator saw it near Highway 277 and 605 near Clear Fork Church. Terrified motorists were seen trying to get out of harm's way as the tornado followed close behind, causing downed trees and power lines, as per the National Weather Service. By 7:23pm, the tornado hit County Road 494 and Fulwiler Road in Tye before it spun up into the cloud formations, as hail, described by one witness as 'baseball size' fell from the sky.\n\nThe area hit with the most destruction was located in the Hawley area, population 579 in 2024, according to World Population Review. Mike Castillo, Warning Coordination Meteorologist with the National Weather Service in San Angelo, told local KTAB/KRBC of the damage the tornado caused. It is unknown what injuries the two people sustained.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

threat is expected to shift east into the Houston area on Sunday, bringing a flooding rain chance with it as the potential for more severe thunderstorms on Monday in the central plains from Dallas to Sioux Falls is possible.\n\nAcross parts of the country, the first scorching heat wave of the year next could happen by the middle of the week as temperatures across much of the south are expected to

The two adults were successfully rescued.\n\nHours later, Houston Police Department said on social media that two trapped women were rescued from floods and one of them was taken to nearby hospital.\n\nThe severe storms caused more damage than waterlogged neighborhoods and roadways, the Houston Chronicle reported.

Areas near Lake Livingston, which is northeast of Houston, received 23 inches of rain. Huntsville, a half hour north of Houston, saw 17 inches.

Temperatures are expected to top 90 degrees -- and with the saturated Earth and humidity, that could take the heat index over 100 degrees.\n\nForecasters had warned that last summer's extreme weather was not a one-off meteorological event. A report last month from the Texas State Climatologist at Texas A&M University, Dr. John Nielsen-Gammon, predicted more extreme events this year, including excessive rainfall, noting that clouds produce about 4% more rainfall for every Fahrenheit degree the average temperature increases. That can alter weather patterns and increase the number of dangerous storms.\n\nLast summer, Texas saw temperatures in some areas that were hotter than 99% of the planet, according to some meteorologists. In July, one forecast called for the northern part of the state to reach as high as 112 degrees.\n\nBy 2036, the Texas A&M report said, the chances of a 100-degree-plus day will be four times what it was in the 1970s and 1980s.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Texas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Texas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Greater Houston"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Livingston", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lake Livingston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humidity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humidity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conroe,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conroe, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Conroe, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Huntsville, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Huntsville, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorologist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meteorologist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Nielsen-Gammon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Nielsen-Gammon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_index", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heat index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extreme weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_A&M_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas A&M University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fahrenheit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temperature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meteorology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Tukong_Moosul", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Tukong Moosul", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2151175331-e1715004052875.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9539709", "eventUri": "eng-9539709", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 112, "relevance": 1}

Warren, was just weeks from his 5th birthday, according to the death records. Local authorities had previously given his age as 5.\n\nThe death comes as rounds of storms have prompted evacuations and rescues in the state, with forecasters warning of potential flash flooding. The storms exacerbated dangerous conditions and forecasters said that once the storms passed, rivers could be swollen for days or even weeks.\n\nParts of southeast Texas were under a flood warning Sunday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service in Houston. Other areas remained under flood watches, and up to 8 inches of rain were possible in some areas through Sunday, forecasters said.\n\nHeavy rainfall was expected to taper by Sunday evening, the weather service said. Forecasters said that because of the recent rounds of rainfall, flooding could occur earlier than would be expected in ordinary conditions.\n\nThe Harris County Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management said that as of 10 a.m. Sunday, there had been 233 rescues of people and 164 pet rescues in the county.\n\nThere remained a risk of flash flooding from central to northeastern Texas, the weather service's Weather Prediction Center said Sunday afternoon.\n\nJeremy Justice, hydrological operations manager at Harris County Flood Control District, said Saturday that some parts of Harris County could experience flooding near the record levels that were set during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, an event that claimed at least 68 lives and caused $125 billion in damage.\n\nSeveral rivers in Texas had yet to reach their highest flows Sunday morning but were expected to crest in the next 24 hours, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said. After cresting, the rivers' recession would be slow, leaving the waterways above the major flooding stage through the middle of the week.\n\nEleven rivers were in a major flooding stage Sunday morning, which means the flooding had caused an excessive inundation of roads and structures and required significant evacuations.\n\nAnother 18 rivers were experiencing moderate flooding, which can inundate some structures and may lead to evacuations.", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Preferential treatment was given by TTD to political elites at the expense of the common devotees,\u201d he said.Addressing the media in Tirumala on Friday, he gave a list of services and VIP protocol break-darshans provided to Peddireddy as an example of this mismanagement in TTD during the past five years.\"If one Peddireddy was granted so many darshans in a day, how many must have been allocated to other ex-ministers like RK Roja and K Narayana Swamy, who visited Tirumala three days a week,\" he asked.The Jana Sena leader accused the previous government of degrading Tirumala and transforming it into a profit-driven enterprise for personal gain. He called for action against former government officials and TTD administrators who may have facilitated these corrupt practices.", "summary": "", "url": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/southern-states/andhra-pradesh/andhra-pradesh-jana-sena-alleges-corruption-in-tirumala-under-ysrc-rule-1308618", "image": "https://www.deccanchronicle.com/h-upload/2024/06/29/1100366-la-1705100.webp", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 06:09:19", "author": "DC Correspondent", "authors": ["DC Correspondent"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.143}

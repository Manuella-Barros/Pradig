State also regularly playing Appalachian State and East Carolina in those sports also is required in the bipartisan House Bill 965, filed by Rep. David Willis, R-Union.\n\nThe bill also covers UNC Charlotte given the criteria it only affects athletic departments whose university has at least 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students.\n\nUNC System beneficiaries would be required to compete at the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. Those are Appalachian State and East Carolina.\n\nUNC, N.C. State and Charlotte would be required to:\n\n* Every sports year, play at least one home or away game against each other, or against Appalachian State or ECU.\n\n* Play both a home and an away game against Appalachian State or ECU and potentially one of the other six Division I programs during a six-year period.\n\nHB965 comes as the UNC System Board of Governors said it will attach UNC and N.C. State at the hip in any potential future conference realignment if the Atlantic Coast Conference ceases to exist.\n\nUNC is considered one, if not the top, choice of the Southeastern Conference and the Big 10 Conference because of the media attractiveness of the Triangle and UNC's stature among the nation's top public academic universities.\n\nThe bill also was filed as Clemson and Florida State have sued to be able to leave the ACC, with the ACC countersuing.\n\nAccording to WRAL, the measure requires schools to provide advance notice of any conference change, including a report on the financial impact, for the board president's approval.\n\nThe UNC System president can approve or reject the plan, while the board could also vote to reject a plan initially approved.\n\nMeanwhile, the UNC System members that play at the Division I Championship Bowl Subdivision level are N.C. A&T State, N.C. Central, UNC Asheville and Western Carolina. All four, plus UNC Greensboro and UNC Wilmington, play Division I men's and women's basketball.\n\nAccording to the bill, the goal is promoting economic development and sports tourism in North Carolina ... and \"to ensure that eligible constituent institutions of the University of North Carolina regularly compete against each other in eligible sports.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"We're just making sure we get those games,\" bill co-sponsor Rep. Jason Saine, R-Lincoln, and a Charlotte fan, told Raleigh TV station WRAL. \"They can't not play.\"\n\n\"There's enough wiggle room in there as far as space and calendaring that we'll get the maximum benefit without real injury to them. It's what fans want to see and it's a good way to do it.\"\n\nThe legislation could hamper UNC, N.C. State and Charlotte's ability to schedule nonconference games.\n\nUNC and N.C. State play eight ACC football, 20 men's basketball and 18 women's basketball games. That leaves for room for four nonconference games in football and 11 in men's basketball and 13 in women's basketball.\n\nCharlotte plays eight football games in the American Athletic Conference.\n\nIn some ways, the legislation appears unnecessary given how much UNC, N.C. State and Charlotte already play the other Division I schools in football.\n\nFor the 2024 football season, Charlotte is playing at UNC on Sept. 7 and hosting fellow AAC rival East Carolina on Oct. 5.\n\nN.C. State hosts Western Carolina on Aug. 29, while UNC hosts N.C. Central on Sept. 14.\n\nRecently, UNC has had a home-and-home scheduling with Appalachian State in football and is scheduled to host N.C. A&T in 2028.\n\nN.C. State has Appalachian State and East Carolina on the 2025 schedule, Appalachian State on the 2026 schedule, N.C. A&T on the 2027 schedule, East Carolina on the 2028 schedule and Charlotte on the 2030 and 2031 schedule.\n\nHowever, scheduling for men's and women's basketball could be trickier given nonconference games typically are not scheduled more than a year in advance, unless they are part of a high-level tournament.\n\nFor example, both UNC men's and women's play a national nonconference schedule with likely only one spot available to meet the legislation each season.\n\nThere is precedent for legislative action to compel UNC and N.C. State to play at least East Carolina.\n\nIn 1995, legislators compelled UNC and N.C. State to resume football games against East Carolina beginning in 1999, including an away game in Greenville.\n\nFor years, both UNC and N.C. State declined to play East Carolina, then an independent, because of recruiting issues, the limited number of nonconference dates available and a philosophy that neither had anything to gain by such a game.\n\nAt one time, the ECU-N.C. State rivalry has produced eight of the top-10 highest attended college football games in North Carolina.\n\nrcraver@wsjournal.com\n\n336-727-7376\n\n@rcraverWSJ\n\nTags Sports Politics Legislation Law Games And Toys Institutions American Football Police The Economy Basketball Get local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

State at the hip in any potential future conference realignment if the Atlantic Coast Conference ceases to exist.\n\nUNC is considered one, if not the top, choice of the Southeastern Conference and the Big 10 Conference because of the media attractiveness of the Triangle and UNC's stature among the nation's top public academic universities.\n\nThe bill also was filed as Clemson and Florida State have sued to be able to leave the ACC, with the ACC countersuing.\n\nAccording to WRAL, the measure requires schools to provide advance notice of any conference change, including a report on the financial impact, for the board president's approval.\n\nThe UNC System president can approve or reject the plan, while the board could also vote to reject a plan initially approved.\n\nMeanwhile, the UNC System members that play at the Division I Championship Bowl Subdivision level are N.C. A&T State, N.C. Central, UNC Asheville and Western Carolina. All four, plus UNC Greensboro and UNC Wilmington, play Division I men's and women's basketball.\n\nAccording to the bill, the goal is promoting economic development and sports tourism in North Carolina ... and \"to ensure that eligible constituent institutions of the University of North Carolina regularly compete against each other in eligible sports.\"\n\n\"We're just making sure we get those games,\" bill co-sponsor Rep. Jason Saine, R-Lincoln, and a Charlotte fan, told Raleigh TV station WRAL. \"They can't not play.\"\n\n\"There's enough wiggle room in there as far as space and calendaring that we'll get the maximum benefit without real injury to them. It's what fans want to see and it's a good way to do it.\"\n\nThe legislation could hamper UNC, N.C. State and Charlotte's ability to schedule nonconference games.\n\nUNC and N.C. State play eight ACC football, 20 men's basketball and 18 women's basketball games. That leaves for room for four nonconference games in football and 11 in men's basketball and 13 in women's basketball.\n\nCharlotte plays eight football games in the American Athletic Conference.\n\nIn some ways, the legislation appears unnecessary given how much UNC, N.C. State and Charlotte already play the other Division I schools in football.\n\nFor the 2024 football season, Charlotte is playing at UNC on Sept. 7 and hosting fellow AAC rival East Carolina on Oct. 5.\n\nN.C. State hosts Western Carolina on Aug. 29, while UNC hosts N.C. Central on Sept. 14.\n\nRecently, UNC has had a home-and-home scheduling with Appalachian State in football and is scheduled to host N.C. A&T in 2028.\n\nN.C. State has Appalachian State and East Carolina on the 2025 schedule, Appalachian State on the 2026 schedule, N.C. A&T on the 2027 schedule, East Carolina on the 2028 schedule and Charlotte on the 2030 and 2031 schedule.\n\nHowever, scheduling for men's and women's basketball could be trickier given nonconference games typically are not scheduled more than a year in advance, unless they are part of a high-level tournament.\n\nFor example, both UNC men's and women's play a national nonconference schedule with likely only one spot available to meet the legislation each season.\n\nThere is precedent for legislative action to compel UNC and N.C. State to play at least East Carolina.\n\nIn 1995, legislators compelled UNC and N.C. State to resume football games against East Carolina beginning in 1999, including an away game in Greenville.\n\nFor years, both UNC and N.C. State declined to play East Carolina, then an independent, because of recruiting issues, the limited number of nonconference dates available and a philosophy that neither had anything to gain by such a game.\n\nAt one time, the ECU-N.C. State rivalry has produced eight of the top-10 highest attended college football games in North Carolina.\n\nNorth Carolina small businesses thrive in these counties North Carolina small businesses thrive in these counties #50.

Those are Appalachian State and East Carolina.\n\nUNC, N.C. State and Charlotte would be required to:\n\nPeople are also reading...

State at the hip in any potential future conference realignment if the Atlantic Coast Conference ceases to exist.\n\nUNC is considered one, if not the top, choice of the Southeastern Conference and the Big 10 Conference because of the media attractiveness of the Triangle and UNC's stature among the nation's top public academic universities.\n\nThe bill also was filed as Clemson and Florida State have sued to be able to leave the ACC, with the ACC countersuing.\n\nAccording to WRAL, the measure requires schools to provide advance notice of any conference change, including a report on the financial impact, for the board president's approval.\n\nThe UNC System president can approve or reject the plan, while the board could also vote to reject a plan initially approved.\n\nMeanwhile, the UNC System members that play at the Division I Championship Bowl Subdivision level are N.C. A&T State, N.C. Central, UNC Asheville and Western Carolina. All four, plus UNC Greensboro and UNC Wilmington, play Division I men's and women's basketball.\n\nAccording to the bill, the goal is promoting economic development and sports tourism in North Carolina ... and \"to ensure that eligible constituent institutions of the University of North Carolina regularly compete against each other in eligible sports.\"\n\n\"We're just making sure we get those games,\" bill co-sponsor Rep. Jason Saine, R-Lincoln, and a Charlotte fan, told Raleigh TV station WRAL. \"They can't not play.\"\n\n\"There's enough wiggle room in there as far as space and calendaring that we'll get the maximum benefit without real injury to them. It's what fans want to see and it's a good way to do it.\"\n\nThe legislation could hamper UNC, N.C. State and Charlotte's ability to schedule nonconference games.\n\nUNC and N.C. State play eight ACC football, 20 men's basketball and 18 women's basketball games. That leaves for room for four nonconference games in football and 11 in men's basketball and 13 in women's basketball.\n\nCharlotte plays eight football games in the American Athletic Conference.\n\nIn some ways, the legislation appears unnecessary given how much UNC, N.C. State and Charlotte already play the other Division I schools in football.\n\nFor the 2024 football season, Charlotte is playing at UNC on Sept. 7 and hosting fellow AAC rival East Carolina on Oct. 5.\n\nN.C. State hosts Western Carolina on Aug. 29, while UNC hosts N.C. Central on Sept. 14.\n\nRecently, UNC has had a home-and-home scheduling with Appalachian State in football and is scheduled to host N.C. A&T in 2028.\n\nN.C. State has Appalachian State and East Carolina on the 2025 schedule, Appalachian State on the 2026 schedule, N.C. A&T on the 2027 schedule, East Carolina on the 2028 schedule and Charlotte on the 2030 and 2031 schedule.\n\nHowever, scheduling for men's and women's basketball could be trickier given nonconference games typically are not scheduled more than a year in advance, unless they are part of a high-level tournament.\n\nFor example, both UNC men's and women's play a national nonconference schedule with likely only one spot available to meet the legislation each season.\n\nThere is precedent for legislative action to compel UNC and N.C. State to play at least East Carolina.\n\nIn 1995, legislators compelled UNC and N.C. State to resume football games against East Carolina beginning in 1999, including an away game in Greenville.\n\nFor years, both UNC and N.C. State declined to play East Carolina, then an independent, because of recruiting issues, the limited number of nonconference dates available and a philosophy that neither had anything to gain by such a game.\n\nAt one time, the ECU-N.C. State rivalry has produced eight of the top-10 highest attended college football games in North Carolina.\n\nNorth Carolina small businesses thrive in these counties North Carolina small businesses thrive in these counties #50.

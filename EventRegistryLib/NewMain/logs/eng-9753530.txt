Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will continue the same psychological thriller theme as the first movie, but this time it will take a much more unorthodox approach, continuing the DC franchise in the form of a musical.

Music will play a key role in the film, and seems set to establish a poignant connection between Joker and Harley Quinn through classic songs. \"For Once in My Life\" reflects Joker's newfound joy and sense of love while hinting at his continued transformation into the Clown Prince of Crime.\n\nThe second trailer for Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux has been released with a song being covered by Arthur Fleck himself that carries a deeper meaning within the DC Elseworlds movie. Joker: Folie a Deux is slated for release on October 4, gearing up to continue the $1 billion success of 2019's Joker. The movie is once again written and directed by Todd Phillips with Joaquin Phoenix reprising his role as the titular Batman villain. Lady Gaga will join him as she portrays Harley Quinn, who will reportedly go by \"Lee\" in this movie.\n\nIt is already apparent that music will play a key role in the film, which has been described as a Jukebox Musical. From trailer footage and promotional images, it seems clear that Arthur Fleck will encounter Lee in Arkham Asylum before the two seemingly embark on a chaotic crime spree as Joker and Harley Quinn. The music for the first Joker teaser trailer featured Sammy Davis Jr. and Tom Jones's rendition of \"What the World Needs Now.\" The second trailer, meanwhile, features Arthur Fleck himself covering another popular song from the 1960s.\n\nRelated\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux Cast & DC Character Guide\n\nJoaquin Phoenix returns Arthur Fleck in Todd Phillips's Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux - we rundown the cast of the Joker sequel and their roles in the film.\n\nThe Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux Trailer Song Is \"For Once In My Life\"\n\nThe Song Is A Cover Of A Track Originally Sung By Stevie Wonder\n\nThe first half of the second Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux trailer features Fleck's cover of \"For One in My Life.\" This song was written for Motown Records by Ron Miller and Orlando Murden and, like many songs of the era, has been frequently covered by various artists. The most popular and recognizable rendition of the song is Stevie Wonder's, whose upbeat take became the definitive version of the song, originally intended to be a much slower ballad.\n\nThe second trailer also features an edited, slowed version of Frank Sinatra's \" When You're Smiling ,\" originally recorded in 1950 and re-recorded in 1960.\n\nFollowing the first trailer's use of \"What the World Needs Now,\" the second Joker: Folie \u00e0 deux trailer continues its use of music from the 1960s, despite the movie being set in the 1980s. Harley Quinn can be heard in the trailer saying \"When I saw you, for once in my life, I didn't feel so alone anymore,\" mirroring the lyrics \"For once in my life...I'm not alone anymore.\" Suffice it to say, this speaks to the deeper meaning of the song being used in the trailer and sung specifically by Arthur Fleck during his incarceration.\n\nRelated\n\n10 DC Heroes & Villains That We Want To Appear In Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux\n\nAlthough Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is set in Todd Phillips' standalone DC Elseworlds universe, it could feature a few cameos by Gotham heroes and villains.\n\nWhy \"For Once In My Life\" Fits Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux's Story\n\nThe Lyrics Can Refer To Joker's Relationship With Harley Quinn\n\nClose\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will be as much of a romance as it is a musical, depicting the chaotic first days of Joker and Harley Quinn's toxic relationship. Folie \u00e0 Deux translates into English as \"Madness of two,\" indicating the significance of Joker and Harley Quinn sharing in a seemingly matched perspective of the world. This is a particularly poignant state of affairs for Arthur Fleck, who spent his debut movie suffering from severe loneliness and conjuring an imaginary romance with Zazie Beetz's Sophie, as his encounter with Lee will presumably change this.\n\n\"For Once in My Life\" is a song about the joy of encountering true love for the first time. It seems apparent, therefore, that Joker is relishing this exact feeling after a lifetime of loneliness. It also seems clear that his romance with Harley Quinn - which will no doubt culminate in committing further crimes together - will help to hone Joker's newfound self-confidence and metamorphosis into the Clown Prince of Crime. Until Joker: Folie a Deux releases, however, exactly how this will transpire remains to be seen.\n\nJoker: Folie a Deux\n\nR\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is the sequel to Todd Phillips' critically acclaimed comic book thriller Joker. Reprising his Academy Award-winning performance as the failed comedian Arthur Fleck, Joaquin Phoenix revisits the iconic DC character alongside Lady Gaga, who makes her debut as Joker's lover Harley Quinn in this standalone continuity of the DC Universe.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips\n\nRelease Date October 4, 2024\n\nWriters Todd Phillips , Scott Silver , Bob Kane , Paul Dini , Bill Finger , Bruce

It is a sequel to Todd Philips' highly anticipated Joker movie from 2019. In 'Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux', Joaquin Phoenix plays the title supervillain again, and Lady Gaga portrays Harley Quinn, his lady love.\n\nEverything you need to know about 'Joker 2' is here, including the release date, stellar cast and plot, and much more.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux new trailer\n\nThe majority of the film 'Joker' takes place in Arkham Asylum, as seen the teaser. Here is where Joker first meets Harley, a woman who instantly connects with him when she sees him smile. In a few moments, we are introduced to the Joker & Harley act, which builds on Joaquin's crazy yet famous dance from the first movie, as the couple sets out on dark escapades.\n\nHarley takes in all the chaos even as Joker amazes with his song; the two seem to be built for each other in Gotham's nightmare. A scene of a calm Harley and Joker harmonising to songs marks the end of the trailer.\n\nALSO READ: Deadpool & Wolverine Was The Appetizer, Here Are Seven Must-watch Marvel Releases You Cannot Miss\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux plot\n\nAs the first trailer suggested, Joker and Harley are seen appearing victorious as they stand on the steps of a courtroom. It also seems that they may be getting married. As expected from this crazy duo, they could be on some sort of criminal rampage. Along with Gaga's Harley dancing on those popular stairs, set photographs and videos also feature Harley singing, Arkham burning down, and even a nod to Harvey Dent (commonly known as Two-Face).\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux cast\n\n'Joker', directed by Todd in 2019, received eleven Oscar nominations. Joaquin won best actor and Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir took home the original score trophy.

Expect impactful performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga as they navigate the chaos of Arkham Asylum and the outside protests. Following up on the success of 2019's Joker, this sequel promises to be a dark, twisted, and musical journey through the Joker's perspective.\n\nWarner Bros. has released the first official trailer for Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux. The sequel to 2019's Joker will see Joaquin Phoenix reprise his role as the titular Batman villain alongside pop star Lady Gaga hitting theaters on October 4, 2024.\n\nDirected by Todd Phillips, Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux will pick up after the events of Joker where Arthur Fleck, aka Joker, is placed in Akrham Asylum while he waits for his trial for the crimes he committed in the first film. Unlike the original, this sequel will not only be a love story but also a musical.\n\nRelated\n\nDid the new Deadpool & Wolverine trailer just spoil the movie's biggest cameo?\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine just dropped another trailer meme days before its release, and while viewers were likely excited for one last tease before the film drops, the trailer also spoils a MAJOR cameo from a character who hasn't been seen on screen in years. We won't spoil it here, but if you want to check out the trailer you can at on YouTube, but be warned, that huge spoilers are in the video. With this in mind we have to ask, how do you feel about spoilers in trailers? Do you hate seeing surprises beforehand, or do you like getting extended sneak peeks? Tell us what you think below!\n\nPut a smile on that face\n\nThe Joker in love\n\nThe official trailer for Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux takes us through the aftermath of the first film as Arthur is being admitted into Akrham Asylum. Here, he first meets Lady Gaga's Harleen Quinzel, aka Harley Quinn, who fell in love with Joker after feeling an immediate connection with him. Meanwhile, outside the walls of the asylum, hundreds protest in support of Joker and call for his freedom.\n\nInterlaced with musical and dance numbers, Harley enables and supports Joker's mania. He will once again don the iconic clown makeup and make impassioned speeches to the court. Naturally, with the film being from the Joker's perspective, many shots will no doubt be twisted or fabricated from what is happening in reality.\n\nAlongside Joaquin Phoenix's Joker and Lady Gaga's Harley, other stars featured will include Brendan Gleeson, John Lacy, and Zazie Beetz.\n\n2019's Joker was a critical and commercial smash. The film earned over $1 billion at the box office and remains the highest-grossing film with an R rating of all time. It was nominated for 11 Oscars and took home two, one for best performance by an Actor in a leading role for Phoenix and for best achievement in music written for a motion picture. The film was intended to be a standalone film, and only had very loose ties to the wider DC universe.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux began production in 2022 and will have its world premiere at the 81st

While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\n\nThe movie also stars Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson (The Banshees of Inisherin) and Catherine Keener (Get Out), alongside Zazie Beetz, reprising her role from Joker.\n\nPhillips, who was nominated for Oscars for directing, writing and producing Joker, directed Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux from a screenplay by fellow Oscar nominee Scott Silver & Phillips, based on characters from DC. This follow-up was produced by Phillips, Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff and Joseph Garner. Lady Gaga served as music consultant.\n\nThe executive producers are Michael E. Uslan, Georgia Kacandes, Silver, Mark Friedberg and Jason Ruder.\n\nWorking with Phillips behind the camera are his team from Joker, including Oscar-nominated director of photography Lawrence Sher, production designer Mark Friedberg, Oscar-nominated editor Jeff Groth, and composer Hildur Gu\u0111nad\u00f3ttir, who won the Oscar for her work on the first movie.\n\nNew to the team is Oscar-nominated costume designer Arianne Phillips (Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood). Ruder is the Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux's executive music producer and the music supervisors are Randall Poster and George Drakoulias. Casting is by Francine Maisler (Dune).\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux will be released worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, and will be only in theaters nationwide on October 4, 2024, and beginning internationally on October 2, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "comicbookmovie.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comic Book Movie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gotham (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men_(film_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "X-Men (film series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banshees_of_Inisherin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Banshees of Inisherin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Joaquin Phoenix reprises his role as Arthur Fleck, the infamous Batman villain.The eagerly anticipated second trailer for Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux has been released, offering a glimpse into the forthcoming DC sequel. Joaquin Phoenix returns as Arthur Fleck, the infamous Batman villain, with the film exploring his dark psyche and tumultuous relationship with Harley Quinn, portrayed by Lady Gaga. Following the immense success of the 2019 Joker film, Warner Bros. Discovery and DC Studios are revisiting this gritty universe.\n\nThe latest trailer for Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux precedes its world premiere at this year's Venice International Film Festival. This sequel picks up where the 2019 hit left off, depicting Arthur Fleck's life in Arkham Asylum as he awaits trial for his crimes as Joker.\n\nThe trailer teases Fleck's struggle with his dual identity and his encounter with Harleen Quinzel, who will become Harley Quinn, as per the Screenrant report.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures launched a 24-hour livestream on July 22, building anticipation for the trailer's release. The stream featured an empty TV studio with a promise of a show by \"Joker & Harley.\" As the countdown concluded, the second trailer was unveiled, continuing the momentum generated by the film's first trailer three months prior, according to the Screenrant report.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips has emphasized the musical aspect of the sequel. The new trailer hints at musical sequences, with Phillips describing music as \"an essential element\" of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\n\nHe elaborated, \"Arthur [Fleck]'s weird and aloof and all these things, but he has music in him. He has a grace to him. That informed a lot of the dancing in the first film... it didn't feel like that big of a step here. It's different, but I think it'll make sense when you see it\", according to the Screenrant report.\n\nThe film features Zazie Beetz reprising her role as Sophie. Newcomers to the cast include Harry Lawtey, Jacob Lofland, Steve Coogan, Ken Leung, and Brendan Gleeson. Lady Gaga's portrayal of Harley Quinn has been described as \"very authentic.\"\n\nGaga stated, \"You know my version of Harley is mine, and it's very authentic to this movie and these characters. I've never done anything like I've done in this movie before, so it's all going to be completely brand new and really fun\", as quoted in the Screenrant report.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is set to hit cinemas on October 4, 2024. The new trailer and insights from the filmmakers and cast promise a unique blend of dark drama and musical elements, continuing the story of one of the most iconic villains in the DC universe.\n\nFans eagerly await the release, anticipating another compelling performance from Joaquin Phoenix and a fresh take on Harley Quinn by Lady Gaga.\n\nWhy is Joker 2 called Folie a Deux?\n\nThe title of Joker 2, Folie \u00e0 Deux, translates to \"shared delusion or mental illness between two people.\" The trailer expands on this concept, showing that Arthur Fleck is no longer alone.\n\nWhy is Joker 2 rated R?\n\nThe musical sequel to 2019's \"Joker,\" starring Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, has received an R rating for \"strong violence, pervasive language, some sexuality, and brief full nudity,\" according to the MPA's daily ratings bulletin.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Discovery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\"\n\nThis trailer gives us our best look yet at the musical elements of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, which have been hinted at for the longest time. We get to see Joker singing a few words of Frank Sinatra's For Once in My Life and Joker and Harley singing Sinatra's Get Happy.\n\nWhen Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux was first being reported, it was said it was going to be a musical. Director Todd Phillips has since come out and said, while it is not a full musical, music is an \"essential element,\" and this trailer really shows that.\n\nFor those worried this will change the feel of this sequel, Phillips also said Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux won't \"veer\" too far from the original and that Phoenix has always had \"music in him.\"\n\nFor more, check out how Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will be part of DC Elseworlds and live outside of James Gunn and Peter Safran's DCU and how the last trailer sparked wild fan theories about Arthur Fleck and Harley Quinn.\n\nHave a tip for us?

The mystery of the Joker's scars makes him more interesting, as his storytelling choices are more powerful than revealing his past.\n\nThe Dark Knight's Joker (Heath Ledger) is easily one of the most iconic villains to ever grace the silver screen, and it could be argued there has never been a better Joker. Iconic make-up, Ledger's own acting choices, and brilliant speeches about Gotham's soul bring this performance and character to life. But there is one question never answered about the Joker, and he's the one who keeps teasing us with the same rhetorical question: \"Do you want to know how I got these scars?\"\n\nMany have different theories about where Joker's Chelsea smile originated, some believing one of the Joker's various stories, others deriving theories from character details shown throughout The Dark Knight. Even Warner Bros. was interested in giving the Joker an origin story, as revealed by The Dark Knight writer David S. Goyer in an interview with ComicCon@Home. Thankfully, this did not happen as it's not the Joker's potential origin that makes the character interesting, but the Joker's choice not to reveal his past keeps us engaged.\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\nWhen the menace known as the Joker wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham, Batman must accept one of the greatest psychological and physical tests of his ability to fight injustice.\n\nRelease Date July 18, 2008\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan\n\nCast Christian Bale , Heath Ledger , Aaron Eckhart , Michael Caine , Maggie Gyllenhaal , Gary Oldman\n\nWriters Jonathan Nolan , Christopher Nolan , David S. Goyer , Bob Kane\n\nTagline Why so serious?\n\nThe Joker's Different Stories Contradict That He's An \"Agent Of Chaos\"\n\nThroughout The Dark Knight, the Joker has different interpretations about how he got his scars, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. For Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the Joker uses the idea of giving himself the scars for love, unnerving her by playing the role of some crazed boyfriend who'd do anything to make his love happy, invoking violence against women.\n\nFor the mob boss, Gambol (Michael Jai White), Joker uses the idea of his father being a drunk, though, at the end of the scene, he reveals, by looking at Gambol's henchmen, that the story was for them. This effectively portrays the Joker as the father when he finishes his speech with \"Why so serious?\" and tells the henchmen to kill each other with a pool stick for a spot-on Joker's team. In both scenarios, the Joker uses the story to put himself in an immediate position of psychological power.\n\nIn doing so, the Joker reveals he is not an \"agent of chaos,\" as he claims to Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), but a meticulous thinker who knows exactly what he is doing and why he is doing it. It reminds us of The Killing Joke, where the Joker (Mark Hamill) admits he'd rather his past be multiple choice. His point is to remind us that everyone is one bad day away from being like him, the same thing he is trying to argue in The Dark Knight, that society will go crazy when pushed.\n\nRelated\n\nFrom Heath Ledger to Jared Leto: The 8 Best Jokers, Ranked\n\n\"Have you ever danced with the Devil in the pale moonlight?\"\n\nThe Joker Should Never Have An Origin Story In A Battle Against Batman\n\nClose\n\nThere is the theory that the Joker is an ex-military officer who could've gotten his scars from combat, and that's why he references the injustice of no one caring if a truck of soldiers dies, as well as his tactical prowess and competent use of weaponry. However, even if this was true, it adds nothing to the Joker's character. All it could do is give sympathetic motivations to the Joker, and at no point are we supposed to feel this way about the character. Maybe the Joker makes points about society we can understand, but never ones we want to be true.\n\n2019's Joker gave the Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) an origin story as a mentally ill person forgotten and suffering in a broken Gotham run by corrupt elites like Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen). This path worked for the character of the Joker, but not because every Joker needs an origin or because simply flipping the narrative perspective makes a Joker origin enjoyable. This only worked because there was no Batman, so there was no shining light of hope to cling to. There was no way we could take Joaquin Phoenix's Joker's points as false because we were given no examples to disprove his points. Despite all this, even Joker shows that the audience shouldn't trust the Joker as a wholly reliable narrator. Ultimately, if The Dark Knight took this route, then Batman (Christian Bale) would become less of a hero, and Ledger's Joker would become someone it is okay to root for, which, in a story with Batman, should never be the case. It lessens Batman's heroic deeds as a hero who never gives up.\n\nAbove all else, the fact we don't know how The Dark Knight's Joker actually got his scars makes the character so much more interesting. It gives the character more power with his specific interpretations. The Joker's choice in how he presents his past is so much more fascinating than what his past could actually be. On top of this, it gives Batman a far greater enemy to go up against.

We first saw a \"Joker 2\" teaser back in April, so it's about time we get another look at this musical thriller.\n\n\"Joker 2,\" officially titled \"Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\" promises to delve even deeper into the twisted psyche of Arthur Fleck, portrayed once again by the Oscar-winning Joaquin Phoenix. With haunting visuals, a chilling score and glimpses of new and returning characters, this trailer sets the stage for a movie that could be as groundbreaking and disturbing as its predecessor.\n\nIn this trailer, we see more of Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn, the iconic character traditionally known as Joker's partner in crime (literally) and complex love interest. Her version of Harley is expected to bring a fresh and intense dynamic to the movie.\n\nGiven Gaga's dramatic flair and previous acting accolades, her portrayal of the popular anti-hero will add an intriguing layer to the sequel, and I'm personally excited to see her chemistry with Phoenix.\n\nThe first \"Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\" teaser was light on plot details and functioned as an effective mood-setter, but this new trailer expands the plot to see Joker and Harley feeding off of each other's insanity. There is violence, sinister music, explosions and visually pleasing dancing scenes of the two titular characters. Not to mention we're finally introduced to the Joker and Harley show, which will probably include some twisted acts considering Harley utters the words: \"We should give people what they want.\"\n\nWhen \"Joker 2\" was confirmed to be a musical (it has up to 15 songs), I was slightly concerned about this sequel acquiring a wackier and more cartoonish feel. Another colleague also expressed their worry about \"Joker 2\", but from the new trailer, it seems as though the movie is magnifying the sinister tone while using music to represent Joker and Harley's descent into chaos together.\n\nAt the end of the first \"Joker\" film, Arthur fully embraces his identity as the Joker after a series of violent and transformative events. The climax of the movie occurs on the Murray Franklin Show, where Arthur, invited as a guest, confesses to his earlier murders and then kills the host, Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro), on live television. This act incites chaos and riots throughout Gotham City, symbolizing the Joker's complete transformation and the city's descent into anarchy. In the final scenes, Arthur is in a psychiatric hospital, presumably Arkham State Hospital.\n\n\"Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\" continues his story and probably takes place not long after the first movie. It will explore the complex relationship between Arthur and Harley Quinn as they navigate their intertwined fates, as suggested by the meaning of \"Folie \u00e0 Deux.\"\n\nThe official synopsis for \"Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\" reads: \"Failed comedian Arthur Fleck meets the love of his life, Harley Quinn, while incarcerated at Arkham State Hospital. Upon his release, the two of them embark on a doomed romantic misadventure.\"\n\n\"Joker 2\" will land in theaters on October 4. If you can't wait for this sequel, why not have a look at some of the best movies on Amazon Prime Video?

Despite the mayhem they cause, their antics captivate the public, who show their support with banners and posters.\n\nThe trailer opens with Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) on his way to face trial for the cold-blooded murder of Murray Franklin, a crime he committed in 2019's Joker. As he makes his way, he is met by a crowd of fans donning Joker masks and cheering for him.

The follow-up to his 2019 film is officially titled Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, which means shared madness in French, and is headed to theaters this year.\n\nIn June 2022, the film's writer and director Todd Philips posted a photo of the script cover to his Instagram, confirming plans for the sequel and the French title.\n\nThe new movie has been kept pretty tightly under wraps, but ahead are all the details and rumors we know about Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\n\nOn Aug. 4, 2022, Phillips posted on Instagram announcing Phoenix and Gaga as the leads, as well as the movie's release date.\n\nAn October release could help increase the film's chances of being an award contender during the 2025 ceremonies.\n\nWho is in the cast?\n\nPhoenix will be retuning as the film's titular character. Lady Gaga was cast as Harley Quinn, which fans are very excited about.\n\nAccording to a 2023 article from IndieWire, it has been confirmed that breakout actor Jacob Lofland will be playing an inmate at Arkham Asylum who befriends Joker.\n\nAn April 2023 article by ScreenRant lists Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Harry Lawtey, George Carroll, Gattlin Griffith, Troy Metcalf, Sam Wren Vincent, Alfred Rubin Thompson, Mike Houston, Jimmy Smagula, and Anthony Gullota as cast members.\n\nIn October 2022, Deadline also reported on Lawtey's role, writing \"Warner Bros couldn't be reached for comment regarding Lawtey's casting, and while the specifics as to his part in the new Joker film aren't forthcoming, we hear that his role will be a big one.\"\n\nWhat will Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux be about?\n\nOfficial details on the Joker 2 plot have yet to be released. However, it's expected to pick up after the original movie, which follows Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), an unappreciated rent-a-clown and aspiring standup comedian who lives with his mother and suffers from a mental disorder that causes laughing fits. After being bullied and humiliated, losing his mother, and suffering financially, he takes a murderous turn. The first Joker ends with him in Arkham Asylum after killing a therapist, or so it's implied.\n\nFrom there, it's possible that Joker 2 will find Arthur in the asylum under Harleen Quinzel's (a.k.a. Harley Quinn) care, where she will then fall madly in love with him and be manipulated into being his evil sidekick. The Joker and Harley Quinn clearly have quite a toxic relationship, so we will probably watch Harleen Quinzel's downward spiral and the dangerous, even deadly, situations she gets pulled into.\n\nIn an interview in May 2024, Gaga teased how the character of Harley might be different from other iterations in the past.\n\n\"You know my version of Harley is mine, and it's very authentic to this movie and these characters,\" she told Access Hollywood. \"I've never done anything like I've done in this movie before, so it's all going to be completely brand new and really fun.\"\n\nThe film's asylum setting could also open the door to other Gotham City villains.\n\nIs Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux a musical?\n\nConsidering Gaga is most known for her amazing singing voice, it only makes sense that numerous outlets have reported that Joker 2 will be a musical. Plus, it would be interesting to see a whole new side of the Joker, and a brand new take on the story.\n\nScreenRant suggests the idea that the songs and musical numbers will take place inside the Joker's head, since much of the film will likely occur with him as a patient in Arkham Asylum. This would be similar to how he imagined his relationship with Sophie in the first movie. Arthur has always been a theatrical performer, so the musical aspect of the film just fits.\n\nAnd on March 22, 2024, Variety reported that insiders said the movie will be \"mostly a jukebox musical,\" with at least 15 covers of \"very well-known\" songs. One tune is said to be \"That's Entertainment\" from the 1953 musical \"The Band Wagon,\" sung famously by Judy Garland. There may also be an original song or two.\n\nIs there a trailer?\n\nWarner Bros. shared the first official trailer for the film on July 23, giving viewers a glimpse into the Joker's troubled mind. Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn also makes an appearance, establishing a romantic bond with Joaquin Phoenix's Joker amidst chaos. Full of crime, drama, and even a few musical numbers, check out the trailer below.\n\nHave they started filming?\n\nYes, in fact production officially wrapped on April 3, 2023. Phillips shared a tribute to the cast and crew at the time.\n\n\"That's a wrap. Thanks to these two (+ the entire cast) and the BEST crew that the film industry has to offer. From top to bottom. Gonna crawl into a cave now (edit room) and put it all together,\" he wrote.\n\nThey filmed the last scene on the iconic Bronx Shakespeare steps, where Joker dances while smoking a cigarette in the original movie.\n\nWhile the movie will still take place in the fictional Gotham City, inspired by New York, most of filming was actually done in Los Angeles this time around because of a $12.6 million tax break to Warner Bros. from the state of California, according to IndieWire.\n\nAre there any photos from production?\n\nGetty Images captured some pictures from set on March 25 and 26, and April 1, 2, and 3 of 2023 in New York City. While they don't show us too much, it gives just the perfect taste for the vibe of the film.\n\nOver the past two years, Phillips has also been sharing some teaser photos on Instagram.\n\nThe Motion Picture Association (MPA) has officially given Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux an R rating. MPA released a rating bulletin on April 3, stating that it is rated R due to \"some strong violence, language throughout, some sexuality, and brief full nudity.\" The first film was also rated R for, \"strong bloody violence, disturbing behavior, language and brief sexual images.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "briannah_rivera@ca.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Briannah Rivera", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asylum_Records", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Asylum Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Title character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lofland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Lofland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Keener", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine Keener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._W._Griffith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D.

Bruce's parents were then killed by a man wearing a clown mask during the final act, setting the stage for Bruce to become Batman...and to really hate Fleck for causing that uprising in Gotham City.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the sequel picks up with that in any way, but the closed captions for the latest sneak peek confirm Harvey Dent will make an appearance.\n\nSet photos showed Joker's supporters brandishing signs calling Dent a \"clown.\" so we've long suspected he might appear. When it comes to who plays him, we don't know, though Harry Lawtey (The Magpie Murders) has been linked to the role in the past.\n\nIf he's an up-and-comer in the District Attorney's office in Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux and out to keep Fleck behind bars, then it's easy to imagine a scenario where he's attacked in the courtroom, leading to the introduction of yet another iconic Batman villain.\n\nThe Joker franchise isn't beholden to the comics so while that would be a departure from the source material, there's still a chance we'll see a Bruce suit up as \"The Batman\" in a potential threequel.\n\nCheck out some screenshots from the trailer below (the scene comes around the 0:10 mark).\n\nFrom acclaimed writer/director/producer Todd Phillips comes Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux, the much-anticipated follow-up to 2019's Academy Award-winning Joker, which earned more than $1 billion at the global box office and remains the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\n\nThe sequel stars Joaquin Phoenix once again in his Oscar-winning dual role as Arthur Fleck/Joker, opposite Oscar-winner Lady Gaga (A Star Is Born). The movie also features Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson (The Banshees of Inisherin) and Catherine Keener (Get Out), alongside Zazie Beetz, reprising her role from Joker.\n\nPhillips, who was nominated for Oscars for directing, writing and producing Joker, directed Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux from a screenplay by fellow Oscar nominee Scott Silver & Phillips, based on characters from DC. This follow-up was produced by Phillips, Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff and Joseph Garner. Lady Gaga served as music consultant.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux will be released worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, and will be only in theaters nationwide on October 4, 2024, and beginning internationally on October 2, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "comicbookmovie.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comic Book Movie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Dent_(1989_film_series_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Dent (1989 film series character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Wayne_(DC_Extended_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Wayne (DC Extended Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gotham (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_captioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closed captioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Lawtey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Lawtey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Batman_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Batman (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banshees_of_Inisherin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Banshees of Inisherin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The film's gritty realism, coupled with Joaquin Phoenix's Oscar-winning performance, resonated deeply with audiences, propelling it to become the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. Now, the eagerly anticipated sequel, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, promises to delve even deeper into the twisted minds of its protagonists led by Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux Trailer: Joaquin Phoenix sings as Arthur Fleck faces trial, romances in Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn as they invite audiences to Harley & Joker show\n\nThe film's title, \"Folie \u00e0 Deux,\" is a French term referring to a shared delusional disorder affecting two or more individuals. This immediately sets the stage for a psychological exploration of a toxic, codependent relationship between the titular characters.\n\nAt the heart of the film is the dynamic duo of Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga. Phoenix reprises his role as Arthur Fleck, the mentally unstable comedian who transforms into the Joker. Joining him is Gaga, in her highly anticipated portrayal of Harley Quinn, a character traditionally associated with the vibrant and chaotic world of DC comics. This casting choice is a bold departure from the character's previous live-action iterations, suggesting a darker, more complex interpretation of the iconic anti-heroine.\n\nThe plot of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized in Arkham Asylum, awaiting trial for his heinous crimes. As he grapples with his dual identity, he unexpectedly discovers both love and a hidden musical talent. This intriguing narrative arc suggests a film that will explore not only the psychological depths of its characters but also delve into themes of artistic expression and redemption.\n\nThe film's trailer has already generated immense buzz, showcasing a darker and more chaotic world than its predecessor. The inclusion of musical elements adds an intriguing dimension to the story, hinting at a potentially groundbreaking portrayal of Harley Quinn.\n\nThe supporting cast is equally impressive. Brendan Gleeson and Catherine Keener bring their talents to the film. Additionally, Zazie Beetz reprises her role from the first film. With its October 4, 2024 release date looming, helmed by Todd Philips, the anticipation is at an all-time high for this highly anticipated chapter in the Joker saga.\n\nALSO READ: Joker: Folie \u00e0

(Image courtesy: ladygaga)\n\nWashington:\n\nJoaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga are back, causing chaos as Joker and Harley Quinn in the latest trailer for Warner Bros. and DC's Joker: Folie A Deux.\n\nThe sequel to the 2019 film Joker is set to release in theatres on October 4, 2024, after premiering at the Venice Film Festival. The first 'Joker' movie won the Golden Lion at Venice in 2019.\n\nThe first Joker was a huge success, both critically and commercially. It was nominated for 11 Oscars, with Joaquin Phoenix winning Best Actor and Hildur Gudnadottir winning for Original Score. It became the highest-grossing R-rated movie ever. In the sequel, Phoenix reprises his role as Joker, and Lady Gaga joins as Harley Quinn. The movie will mostly take place in Arkham Asylum.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Jacob Lofland, and Harry Lawtey. Zazie Beetz returns as Sophie from the first film. The sequel is said to be a musical, building on Phoenix's dancing scenes from the original.\n\nZazie Beetz told Variety, \"I think people will be surprised. I don't think it's going to be what they expect, around it being musical. We all sort of express musically and dancing in our lives day-to-day. I think it's going to work really well.\"\n\nJoker: Folie a Deux will be separate from other DC films, like the upcoming Superman and The Batman: Part II.\n\nLady Gaga's Harley Quinn will exist separately from Margot Robbie's character, seen in Birds of Prey and The Suicide Squad, and Kaley Cuoco's animated character from the Max series.\n\nTodd Phillips returns as the director of Joker: Folie a Deux. He co-wrote the script with Scott Silver and produced the film with Bradley Cooper.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been

Something she could do and just be real. But this... Man, she's good.

[...] She's going to blow your mind.\"\n\nGaga previously told Access Hollywood that her take on the role is an \"authentic\" understanding of the character.\n\n\"You know my version of Harley is mine and it's very authentic to this movie and these characters,\" Gaga said. \"I've never done anything like I've done in this movie before, so it's all going to be completely brand new and really fun.\"\n\n\"Joker\" was the first R-rated movie ever to gross over $1 billion worldwide. The feature received 11 Oscar nominations overall, with Phoenix winning Best Actor and composer Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir winning Best Original Score.\n\nThe title for its sequel, \"Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\" uses the French term folie \u00e0 deux, which means an identical or similar mental disorder affecting two or more individuals, usually members of a close family.\n\n\"Joker: Folie \u00e1 Deux\" premieres October 4 in theaters after debuting at Venice 2024.

I think it's going to work really well.\"\n\n'Joker: Folie a Deux' will be separate from other DC films, like the upcoming 'Superman' and 'The Batman: Part II.'\n\nLady Gaga's Harley Quinn will exist separately from Margot Robbie's character, seen in 'Birds of Prey' and 'The Suicide Squad,' and Kaley Cuoco's animated character from the Max series.\n\nTodd Phillips returns as the director of 'Joker: Folie a Deux.' He co-wrote the script with Scott Silver and produced the film with Bradley Cooper.

It will be released on October 4th.\n\nWhile Warner Bros. hasn't exactly had a consistent year so far, they are looking to start off the fall season on a very high note with Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux. The first film cracked a billion dollars at the worldwide box office on a budget of just $55 million and was an awards contender and winner on multiple fronts. Now, there is a very good chance that this film won't do the same numbers as the first film because \"hitting a billion in 2019\" and \"hitting a billion in 2024\" are two very different animals. They are going for it, though, and taking a big risk with this film's creativity instead of playing it safe, and you have to respect that even if you didn't like the first movie (i.e., someone like me). The first teaser was released in April, but today, we got the official trailer that teases some more of the musical elements, and we got the production notes, which give us a detailed summary of the film as well. We don't have a new poster or any images yet, which is fascinating. Of all the things to hold back, more posters and images are not what you would expect.\n\nFrom acclaimed writer/director/producer Todd Phillips comes Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux, the much-anticipated follow-up to 2019's Academy Award-winning Joker, which earned more than $1 billion at the global box office and remains the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. The new film stars Joaquin Phoenix once again in his Oscar-winning dual role as Arthur Fleck/Joker opposite Oscar-winner Lady Gaga (A Star Is Born).\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham, awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\n\nThe film also stars Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson (The Banshees of Inisherin) and Catherine Keener (Get Out, Capote), alongside Zazie Beetz, reprising her role from Joker. Phillips, who was nominated for Oscars for directing, writing, and producing Joker, directed Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux from a screenplay by fellow Oscar nominee Scott Silver & Phillips, based on characters from DC. The film was produced by Phillips, Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff and Joseph Garner. Lady Gaga served as music consultant. The film's executive producers are Michael E. Uslan, Georgia Kacandes, Silver, Mark Friedberg, and Jason Ruder.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures Presents A Joint Effort Production, A Film by Todd Phillips, Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux.

The follow-up to his 2019 film is officially titled Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, which means shared madness in French, and is headed to theaters this year.\n\nIn June 2022, the film's writer and director Todd Philips posted a photo of the script cover to his Instagram, confirming plans for the sequel and the French title.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Todd Phillips (@toddphillips)\n\nThe new movie has been kept pretty tightly under wraps, but ahead are all the details and rumors we know about Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux.\n\nWhen does it come out?\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will hit theaters on October 4.\n\nOn Aug. 4, 2022, Phillips posted on Instagram announcing Phoenix and Gaga as the leads, as well as the movie's release date.\n\nAn October release could help increase the film's chances of being an award contender during the 2025 ceremonies.\n\nWho is in the cast?\n\nPhoenix will be retuning as the film's titular character. Lady Gaga was cast as Harley Quinn, which fans are very excited about.\n\nAccording to a 2023 article from IndieWire, it has been confirmed that breakout actor Jacob Lofland will be playing an inmate at Arkham Asylum who befriends Joker.\n\nAn April 2023 article by ScreenRant lists Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Harry Lawtey, George Carroll, Gattlin Griffith, Troy Metcalf, Sam Wren Vincent, Alfred Rubin Thompson, Mike Houston, Jimmy Smagula, and Anthony Gullota as cast members.\n\nIn October 2022, Deadline also reported on Lawtey's role, writing \"Warner Bros couldn't be reached for comment regarding Lawtey's casting, and while the specifics as to his part in the new Joker film aren't forthcoming, we hear that his role will be a big one.\"\n\nWhat will Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux be about?\n\nOfficial details on the Joker 2 plot have yet to be released. However, it's expected to pick up after the original movie, which follows Arthur Fleck (Phoenix), an unappreciated rent-a-clown and aspiring standup comedian who lives with his mother and suffers from a mental disorder that causes laughing fits. After being bullied and humiliated, losing his mother, and suffering financially, he takes a murderous turn. The first Joker ends with him in Arkham Asylum after killing a therapist, or so it's implied.\n\nFrom there, it's possible that Joker 2 will find Arthur in the asylum under Harleen Quinzel's (a.k.a. Harley Quinn) care, where she will then fall madly in love with him and be manipulated into being his evil sidekick. The Joker and Harley Quinn clearly have quite a toxic relationship, so we will probably watch Harleen Quinzel's downward spiral and the dangerous, even deadly, situations she gets pulled into.\n\nIn an interview in May 2024, Gaga teased how the character of Harley might be different from other iterations in the past.\n\n\"You know my version of Harley is mine, and it's very authentic to this movie and these characters,\" she told Access Hollywood. \"I've never done anything like I've done in this movie before, so it's all going to be completely brand new and really fun.\"\n\nThe film's asylum setting could also open the door to other Gotham City villains.\n\nIs Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux a musical?\n\nConsidering Gaga is most known for her amazing singing voice, it only makes sense that numerous outlets have reported that Joker 2 will be a musical. Plus, it would be interesting to see a whole new side of the Joker, and a brand new take on the story.\n\nScreenRant suggests the idea that the songs and musical numbers will take place inside the Joker's head, since much of the film will likely occur with him as a patient in Arkham Asylum. This would be similar to how he imagined his relationship with Sophie in the first movie. Arthur has always been a theatrical performer, so the musical aspect of the film just fits.\n\nAnd on March 22, 2024, Variety reported that insiders said the movie will be \"mostly a jukebox musical,\" with at least 15 covers of \"very well-known\" songs. One tune is said to be \"That's Entertainment\" from the 1953 musical \"The Band Wagon,\" sung famously by Judy Garland. There may also be an original song or two.\n\nIs there a trailer?\n\nWarner Bros. shared the first official trailer for the film on July 23, giving viewers a glimpse into the Joker's troubled mind. Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn also makes an appearance, establishing a romantic bond with Joaquin Phoenix's Joker amidst chaos. Full of crime, drama, and even a few musical numbers, check out the trailer below.\n\nHave they started filming?\n\nYes, in fact production officially wrapped on April 3, 2023. Phillips shared a tribute to the cast and crew at the time.\n\n\"That's a wrap. Thanks to these two (+ the entire cast) and the BEST crew that the film industry has to offer. From top to bottom. Gonna crawl into a cave now (edit room) and put it all together,\" he wrote.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Todd Phillips (@toddphillips)\n\nThey filmed the last scene on the iconic Bronx Shakespeare steps, where Joker dances while smoking a cigarette in the original movie.\n\nWhile the movie will still take place in the fictional Gotham City, inspired by New York, most of filming was actually done in Los Angeles this time around because of a $12.6 million tax break to Warner Bros. from the state of California, according to IndieWire.\n\nAre there any photos from production?\n\nGetty Images captured some pictures from set on March 25 and 26, and April 1, 2, and 3 of 2023 in New York City. While they don't show us too much, it gives just the perfect taste for the vibe of the film.\n\nOver the past two years, Phillips has also been sharing some teaser photos on Instagram.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Todd Phillips (@toddphillips)\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Todd Phillips (@toddphillips)\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Todd Phillips (@toddphillips)\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Todd Phillips (@toddphillips)\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Todd Phillips (@toddphillips)\n\nIs Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux part of the DCU?\n\nTechnically, no. According to Variety in October 2022, a source revealed that Joker 2 will \"exist outside of any cinematic universe that [co-CEOs of DC Studios James Gunn and Peter Safran] will be building out.\"\n\nWhat is Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux rated?\n\nThe Motion Picture Association (MPA) has officially given Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux an R rating. MPA released a rating bulletin on April 3, stating that it is rated R due to \"some strong violence, language throughout, some sexuality, and brief full nudity.\" The first film was also rated R for, \"strong bloody violence, disturbing behavior, language and brief sexual images.\"\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\nThe 15 Best Organic And Clean Shampoos For Any And All Hair Types\n\n100 Gifts That Are $50 Or Under (And Look Way More Expensive Than They Actually Are)", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Title character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lofland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Lofland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Keener", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine Keener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._W._Griffith", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D.

Well, the first full trailer was released by Warner Bros. today, and Joaquin Phoenix sure does sing for a good portion of it, so those musical allegations certainly seem to be accurate (for context, a lot of films don't advertise themselves as musicals as it supposedly puts some viewers off). You can check out the trailer for yourself below to determine whether you think it is going to go down the full musical route.\n\nThe trailer's description explains that \"Joker Folie \u00c0 Deux finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\" I don't know about you, but that sounds like a musical! Though, if it is one, it'll seemingly be a jukebox musical, a type of musical that uses real-world songs rather than tracks specially composed for the show.\n\nIt also shows a first look at Brendan Glesson, a prison officer that watches over Arthur Fleck, aka Joker, while he's in Arkham Asylum. The whole thing unsurprisingly looks very theatrical, as alongside all the singing (which does include a little bit from Gaga), there's also plenty of dancing - and even more than that, it seems that there'll be plenty enough violence and rioting too. It's got it all!\n\nYou won't have too much longer to check it out either, as Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux is out in cinemas a few months from now, October 2.", "source": {"uri": "vg247.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VG247"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Musical theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jukebox_musical", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jukebox musical"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/joker-2-folie-a-deux.jpg?width=1200&height=600&fit=crop&enable=upscale&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-02", "textStart": 1847, "textEnd": 1856}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Todd Phillips burgeoning Joker franchise is in that category, and the sequel is one of the most highly anticipated upcoming DC movies heading to theaters. A new trailer for Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux has dropped, and it reveals some of Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix's musical numbers.\n\nWhat we know about Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is fairly limited, but fans are eager to see what happens after the ending of Joker. Lady Gaga will be playing Harley Quinn in the forthcoming movie, which will break new ground by including musical numbers. And this new trailer offered a deeper look at what Phillips has in store for the follow-up film.\n\nLady Gaga's casting as Harley Quinn is a big reason why the hype surrounding this new movie is so high. The original Joker (which is streaming with a Max subscription) was a grueling watch, but one that earned Joaquin Phoenix an Oscar for his performance as Arthur Fleck. This time he might have a partner in crime... if we can believe the unreliable narrator of the franchise.\n\nThis new Joker 2 trailer reveals that the movie will focus on Arthur Fleck's trial for his crimes in the first movie.

In this highly anticipated sequel, Joaquin Phoenix reprises his role as Arthur Fleck, now fully immersed in his chaotic alter ego, the Joker, while Lady Gaga makes her debut as Harley Quinn.\n\nSet to hit theatres on October 4, 2024, following its premiere at the Venice Film Festival, Joker: Folie A Deux builds on the dark and compelling universe established by its predecessor. The first Joker film, which won the Golden Lion at Venice in 2019, was both a critical and commercial success. It earned 11 Academy Award nominations, with Joaquin Phoenix winning Best Actor and Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir taking home Best Original Score. The film's success was further marked by its status as the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time.\n\nIn Folie A Deux, the action predominantly unfolds within the confines of Arkham Asylum, where Phoenix's Joker and Gaga's Harley Quinn stir up pandemonium. The sequel will introduce musical elements, a notable shift from the first film's tone. This development leverages Phoenix's memorable dance scenes from the original movie, adding a new layer of creativity and expression to the narrative.\n\nThe supporting cast includes Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Jacob Lattimore, and Harry Lawtey, with Zazie Beetz reprising her role as Sophie. Beetz has hinted at the film's surprising musical direction, suggesting that the integration of musical expression will feel natural and engaging.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips returns to helm the sequel, co-writing the script with Scott Silver and producing alongside Bradley Cooper. Joker: Folie A Deux will stand apart from other DC Universe films, including the upcoming Superman and The Batman: Part II. Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn is set to be distinct from Margot Robbie's portrayal in Birds of Prey and The Suicide Squad, as well as Kaley Cuoco's animated version from the Max series.\n\nWith its unique approach and star-studded cast, Joker: Folie A Deux is poised to capture the imagination of audiences worldwide and is eagerly awaited for its October release.", "source": {"uri": "liveindia.tv",

On Tuesday, Warner Bros. Pictures dropped the second full trailer for Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, bizarrely and beautifully showcasing the love story between Arthur Fleck / The Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) and Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga). This comes just a few months ahead of Folie \u00e0 Deux's cinematic debut, which is scheduled for early October.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is a sequel to the events of 2019's Joker, which grossed over $1 billion at the global box office and garnered multiple Academy Awards. While Joker was initially designed to be a singular standalone film, Folie \u00e0 Deux ups the ante even further, folding in some interesting touchstones for classic cinema in the process.\n\nWhat Is Joker 2 About?\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will be a musical that follows the twisted romance between Arthur Fleck and Harley Quinn, with a lot of the film believed to be taking place within Arkham Asylum. Directed by Todd Phillips, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will also feature appearances from Zazie Beetz, Brendon Gleeson, Catherine Keener, and Jacob Lofland.\n\n\"I actually think it makes wonderful sense,\" Beetz previously said of the film's musical elements. \"I wasn't really surprised by that Todd has always had a creative approach to the character. I love musicals, and I think of them as the characters are feeling and experiencing so much that they can only sing and dance about it, whether in sorrow or in joy. And I can actually see that within myself as well, because singing and dancing is quite a cathartic experience for me. I was going through a really, really difficult time at one point in my life, and I just started dancing and crying by myself. And that was an expression that matched where I was at that moment. And so, I can see Arthur, who is feeling and experiencing so much, dancing and singing about it. He's the Joker, so I think it makes sense to me.\"\n\nIs Joker 2 in the DC Universe?\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is technically classified as a DC Elseworlds production, meaning that it exists in a canon outside of James Gunn and Peter Safran's forthcoming DC Universe of movies and Max-exclusive television shows. In a previous post on the social media platform Threads, Gunn revealed his involvement in Folie a Deux, explaining that he did give notes on the finished footage. That being said, Gunn did stress that the Joker sequel is one of the few upcoming DC films being shepherded by Warner Bros. Pictures, given when the film was first put into development.\n\n\"Todd had Joker in full swing by the time we came onboard - I've watched and given notes, but it is mostly with WB, where it started,\" Gunn wrote at the tim. \"Everything forward in live-action we're involved with.\"\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will be released exclusively in theaters on Friday, October 4th.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(DC_Extended_Universe)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (DC Extended Universe)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The Joker is seen singing \"For Once In My Life\" by Stevie Wonder whilst in prison, while another scene sees the pair singing \"Get Happy\" by Judy Garland.\n\nThe co-stars are also seen in the trailer dancing beneath the moonlight on the infamous steps from the first film, whilst later sharing a kiss.\n\nA third scene sees the \"Rain On Me\" hitmaker telling her co-star, \"You can do anything you want, you're Joker.\" In true Harley Quinn fashion, she smudges her lipstick into a dark smile before adding blue clown-style makeup just like The Joker.\n\nThe first trailer hinted at the movie's focus being on the bond between Harley Quinn and The Joker, exploring the complexities of their relationship and the crimes in which they commit. There also appears to be a depiction of a musical-type show within the film, though this isn't clear if it's just a figment of their imagination, or not.\n\nVariety previously reported that the upcoming film is set to serve as a jukebox musical featuring 15 \"reinterpretations\" of popular songs. Both trailers have now seemed to confirm this, with the first trailer set to the 1965 song \"What the World Needs Now Is Love\", and the second featuring the 1928 track \"When You're Smiling\", among others.", "source": {"uri": "thepinknews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PinkNews | Latest lesbian, gay, bi and trans news | LGBTQ+ news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabriella_ferlita@thepinknews.com", "name": "Gabriella Ferlita", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

Just as the excitement for Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman's upcoming Deadpool and Wolverine reached a fever pitch, director Todd Phillips dropped a new trailer for Joker: Folie a Deux.\n\nThe trailer, featuring the Frank Sinatra classic \"When You're Smiling,\" sets an intriguing tone for the film. The tagline, \"When you're smiling, the whole world smiles with you,\" hints at the dark and twisted journey ahead.\n\n'Joker: Folie a Deux' is the highly anticipated sequel to the 2019 Academy Award-winning Joker, which grossed over $1 billion worldwide and remains the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time.Joaquin reprises his Oscar-winning role as Arthur Fleck/Joker, while Oscar winner Lady Gaga joins the cast as Harley Quinn.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux | Official Trailer\n\nWhile the film being a musical has been widely discussed, this trailer provides the first glimpse of how Phillips integrates musical elements into a comic book movie, especially one set in an asylum. Much of the promo is sung, but a voiceover from Mayor Harvey Dent sets a darker tone: \"They believe Arthur Fleck to be some kind of martyr. Well, he's not. He's a monster.\"\n\nThe official synopsis reveals that Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham Asylum, awaiting trial for his crimes as the Joker. While grappling with his dual identity, Arthur discovers true love and the music that has always been inside him.\n\nThe film also stars Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson and Catherine Keener, alongside Zazie Beetz, who reprises her role from Joker.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will be released exclusively in theaters and IMAX on October 4.\n\nThe TOI Entertainment Desk is a dynamic and dedicated team of journalists, working tirelessly to bring the pulse of the entertainment world straight to the readers of The Times of India.

Will it be full-on razzle-dazzle? What sort of songs are we talking here? And how will it sound when Phoenix's Arthur Fleck goes from attempting to crack jokes, to attempting to sing a showtune? Now, the latest Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux trailer offers some answers - not only giving us a greater look at the bad romance brewing between Arthur and Lady Gaga's Harley 'Lee' Quinn, but teasing some of their singing too. Give it a watch here:\n\nWhile few would have predicted this musical director for a Joker sequel, it looks like Phillips has another strong vision for what he wants Folie \u00c0 Deux to be - and that includes his lead characters singing already-established tunes like 'When You're Smiling (The Whole World Smiles With You)' and 'Get Happy', presented as musical flights of fancy in the otherwise grim Gotham. Narratively, this one follows in the aftermath of Arthur's televised murder of talk show host Murray Franklin, interrogating the symbol that Joker has since become - and seeing Arthur go on trial for his misdeeds. But he finds a partner in crime (in many senses) with Lee, ready to step into his imagined world of clownish escapism.\n\nHere's the official synopsis: \"Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux finds Arthur Fleck institutionalised at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\" Beyond Phoenix and Gaga, the film also stars Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, and a returning Zazie Beetz.\n\nWill Folie \u00c0 Deux prove to be another billion-dollar box office hit like its predecessor? How many songs can we expect on the soundtrack? And will audiences be along for the ride once Joker starts singing his heart out? We'll find out when Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux hits UK cinemas on 2 October.", "source": {"uri": "empireonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Empire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_You're_Smiling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "When You're Smiling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gotham (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Keener", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine Keener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Escapism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatric hospital"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soundtrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazie_Beetz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zazie Beetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Recordings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Art_and_Literature", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Art and Literature", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.bauerhosting.com/empire/2024/07/joker-2-new.png?ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=top&auto=format&w=undefined&q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-02", "textStart": 2010, "textEnd": 2019}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

The new preview for Todd Phillips' highly-anticipated sequel arrives ahead of San Diego Comic-Con weekend, setting the tone for what's sure to be a deluge of nerdy goodness, shiny previews, and surprises!\n\nIn today's new Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux trailer, Arthur (Joaquin Phoenix) and Harley (Lady Gaga) form a twisted union after falling madly in love while incarcerated in Gotham's Arkham Asylum. As the duo explores their \"compatible crazy,\" they continue fanning the flames of Arthur's reputation, whipping influential Gothamites into a frenzy that could bring the crime-ridden city to its knees. The fuse is lit, and the revolution is well on its way as Arthur and Harley dance through the streets, leaving chaos in their wake.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux has some big clown shoes to fill, especially after the first movie received 11 Academy Award nominations and became the first R-rated flick to gross over $1 billion worldwide. Warner Bros. has pumped a lot of money into the sequel, with reports stating the budget has grown to nearly $200 million, quite the leap from the $60 million budget of the first movie.\n\nThe sequel departs significantly from the original because it has some major musical elements. Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will be \"mostly a jukebox musical, including at least 15 reinterpretations of very well-known songs.\" In hindsight, it would have been hard to imagine Joaquin Phoenix returning for more of the same, no matter how many dump trucks full of money they drove to his house.\n\nIn addition to Phoenix and Gaga, the film also stars Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Jacob Lofland, and Harry Lawtey. Zazie Beetz returned to reprise her role as Sophie Dumond from the first movie, a love interest for Arthur. Official plot details remain a mystery, but the trailer paints a pretty picture, and it's been said that much of the sequel will occur within Arkham Asylum, where we left Arthur in the last film.

The DC film's latest trailer adds to that intrigue by subtly confirming the appearance of a major Batman villain.\n\nPer Collider, Folie \u00e0 Deux's new teaser reveals that the famous Gotham district attorney, Harvey Dent, will feature in the movie. Though Harvey never shows his face in the trailer, his voice is confirmed thanks to a quick activating of the closed caption button on YouTube. While Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) gets transported to another location in a van while the driver listens to the radio. Along the way, Arthur hears the words, \"They believe Arthur Fleck to be some kind of martyr,\" said on the radio, causing him to laugh. By turning on the subtitles, fans will discover that the line was from Harvey.\n\nRelated\n\nHow This Random Suicide Squad Isekai Easter Egg Ties The Joker to Studio Ghibli\n\nWhat do Studio Ghibli and The Joker have in common? Suicide Suad Isekai, apparently.\n\nClose\n\nIt's unknown who will portray Harvey in Folie \u00e0 Deux or whether Harvey will transform into his nefarious alter-ego, Two-Face. His line in the trailer suggests he's strictly the famed lawyer trying to speak to Gotham residents as a leader. However, Harvey's inclusion adds to the speculation about what Todd Phillips' Joker sequel will explore.\n\nJoker and Harley Unite in the Joker Sequel\n\nFolie \u00e0 Deux is a musical psychological thriller chronicling Arthur following his murder of talk show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) on live TV in the first film, leading to his incarceration inside Arkham State Hospital. At Arkham, Arthur falls madly in love with music therapist Harleen Quinzel, more popularly known as Harley Quinn (Stefani \"Lady Gaga\" Germanotta), with the duo developing a startling obsession with one another. Their shared delusions, coupled with Arthur's followers hatching an escape plan for him from Arkham, lead to the growth of the Clown Prince of Crime's criminal empire.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Dark Knight Figure Puts Heath Ledger's Joker in Batman Imposter Suit\n\nA brand-new figure of Heath Ledger's depiction of the Joker features him in an imitation of Christian Bale's iconic Batman suit from The Dark Knight.\n\nThe Joker sequel's musical elements have earned a mixed reception from fans following previous teasers, though Phillips insisted the singing sequences will \"make sense\" when the movie debuts. Despite the criticisms, the previews have generated a strong buzz, with the first one outdoing fellow Warner Bros.' Oscar-winning title and the highest-grossing film of 2023, Barbie. Phoenix and Germanotta star in Folie \u00e0 Deux alongside Zazie Beetz (Sophie Dumond), Brandon Gleeson, Leigh Gill and Sharon Washington.\n\nBoasting a $200 million budget, Folie \u00e0 Deux hopes to replicate the commercial success of Joker, the highest-grossing R-rated film ($1.074 billion worldwide) ever. The original movie also won Phoenix the Best Actor Oscar. Folie \u00e0 Deuxwill be a standalone film rather than a DC Elseworlds title, as initially speculated.\n\nFolie \u00e0 Deux opens in theaters internationally on Oct. 2 and across North America on Oct. 4.\n\nSource: Collider\n\nJoker: Folie a Deux\n\nDrama\n\nMusical\n\nCrime\n\nThe Joker returns in a new chapter of madness and mayhem in \"Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\" a sequel to the critically acclaimed and award-winning 2019 film.

The sequel expands the cast with Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn, Catherine Keener, and Brendan Gleeson. Joker: Folie \u00e1 Deux is set to release on October 4, 2024, continuing Arthur Fleck's story.\n\nOne of Batman's most famous nemesis' is officially confirmed to appear in the sequel to the 2019 Oscar-winning comic book movie. A new trailer for Joker: Folie \u00e1 Deux was released this morning, and if you turn the closed captions on before pressing play, you'll see a familiar name. In the beginning of the trailer, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is being transported somewhere in a van while the driver listens to the radio, and Arthur hears the line: \"They believe Arthur Fleck to be some kind of martyr.\" He begins laughing as he does when he's stressed out or upset, but this seems like no more than a throwaway line from a random radio shot host, until you turn on subtitles.\n\nAfter activating closed captions, it's revealed that the voice behind this line is none other than Harvey Dent, the famous Gotham district attorney who goes on to become Two-Face after a horrible accident. It's apparent that this version of Harvey Dent is still very much in his district attorney phase, speaking to the people of Gotham as a leader, not a terrifying villain with malignant intent. It's unknown at this time if the Joker sequel will see Harvey Dent turn into Two-Face, who will portray the character, or what role he'll play, but this is an exciting development nonetheless. While still lacking a Dark Knight, it appears Todd Phillips' Joker universe is expanding in ways none of us saw coming.\n\nWhat Else Do We Know About 'Joker: Folie \u00e1 Deux'?\n\nThe first Joker movie is largely considered to be one of the most divisive comic book films of all time, registering a 69% score from critics and an 89% rating from general audiences on Rotten Tomatoes. The sequel will see Phoenix return as the titular character along with Zazie Beetz back as Sophie Dumond, but has also vastly expanded its cast with additions like Lady Gaga as the iconic Harley Quinn, as well as Academy Award nominees Catherine Keener and Brendan Gleeson in undisclosed roles. Arthur Fleck meets the love of his love while imprisoned at Arkham State Hospital, and he and Harley head out on a crime-filled adventure that will see both of them wreak havoc on Gotham City.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e1 Deux arrives in theaters on October 4, 2024. Check out the image above showing Harvey Dent will appear in the film and watch the first Joker on Max.\n\nJoker: Folie a Deux\n\nDrama\n\nCrime\n\nMusical\n\nSequel to the 2019 film 'Joker.'\n\nRelease Date October 4, 2024\n\nDirector Todd Phillips\n\nCast Joaquin Phoenix , Zazie Beetz , Brendan Gleeson , Lady Gaga\n\nWriters Todd Phillips , Jerry Robinson , Scott Silver , bruce timm , Paul Dini , Bill Finger , Bob Kane\n\nWATCH ON MAX", "source": {"uri": "collider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Collider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_blevins@collider.com", "name": "Adam Blevins", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Dent_(1989_film_series_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Dent (1989 film series character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Keener", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catherine Keener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gotham (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_(film_and_television)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drama (film and television)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Finger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Finger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adventure film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotten Tomatoes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dini", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul Dini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazie_Beetz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zazie Beetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Showtimes", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Showtimes", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/joker-2-joaquin-phoenix-white-suit.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

The teaser also teased more of the chaos fans only got a taste of in the first film. Now, the official trailer is expected to offer a more in-depth look into what audiences can expect from the film.\n\nSo when can fans expect the Joker 2 trailer to drop?

The account uploaded a brief clip that features a static stage setting. This setting had a big screen surrounded by blue, yellow, and red curtains and stage lights. The screen simply showed Joker and Harley Quinn's names slowly flickering as the video progressed and concluded.\n\nAs of writing, the plot of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is largely unknown. However, based on the teaser trailer, the film will be a musical of sorts. Moreover, the story is also expected to largely feature the budding romance between Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck (Joker) and Lady Gaga's Harleen Quinzel (Harley Quinn). Furthermore, the teaser trailer also teased Joker and Harley going on a vicious crime spree.\n\nAside from Phoenix and Gaga, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will also star Catherine Keener, Brendan Gleeson, Zazie Beetz, Leigh Gill, Sharon Washington, Ken Leung, Jacob Lofland, Harry Lawtey, and Steve Coogan.", "source": {"uri": "comingsoon.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ComingSoon.net"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abdul_azim_naushad@comingsoon.net", "name": "Abdul Azim Naushad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Lawtey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Lawtey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lofland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Lofland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Leung", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ken Leung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Keener", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine Keener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Coogan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Coogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazie_Beetz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zazie Beetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Animation/Movies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Showtimes", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Showtimes", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.comingsoon.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Joker-2-folie-a-deux-trailer-release-date-time.jpg?resize=1200,630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 837, "textEnd": 844}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The director is set to reteam with his leading man, Joaquin Phoenix, in a sequel to his 2019 film. In Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, they'll be joined by a new player. Phoenix's Joker finally gets his Harley Quinn in the form of Lady Gaga, and Phillips is not shying away from Gaga's talents as a singer.\n\nWhere Joker cribbed from the Scorsesian crime dramas of the '70s, Folie \u00e0 Deux will invoke the technicolor musicals of Hollywood's Golden Age. That certainly puts even more scrutiny on the upcoming film, as musicals have a spotty track record, especially among general audiences. While its first trailer didn't feature any singing from Phoenix or Gaga, it did tease some visually stunning sequences for the Clown Prince and his new partner in crime.\n\nIts latest teaser is no different. Phillips may be a divisive filmmaker, but his visual eye can't be contested. If nothing else, Folie \u00e0 Deux is set to be a good-looking film, and its standalone story could be just what the DCU needs moving forward. Check out the new trailer below.\n\nThe first official trailer for Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux leans into the musical gimmick even more than we could've expected, with full-blown song-and-dance numbers and clear homages to classic Hollywood musicals. It certainly feels like the wild creative swing befitting the sequel to Joker, and one that accurately reflects the unhinged minds of Joker and Harley.\n\nIn the years that Folie \u00e0 Deux has been in production, DC has been in the midst of a massive creative overhaul. James Gunn and Peter Safran are now hard at work building out an interconnected universe for DC's heroes and villains, while its standalone projects are being phased out one by one. Apart from Matt Reeves' upcoming sequels and spinoffs for The Batman, this is the only non-DCU project coming down the pipeline -- and however you feel about Phillips' Joker, it's nice to see something carrying over from the old regime.\n\nThe sequel is one of the only non-DCU projects that the franchise seems to have faith in, as evidenced by its whopping $200 million budget. Whether it can follow in its predecessors footsteps and break a billion at the box office remains to be seen, especially as it's stepping into a new genre. But the Joker franchise has been underestimated before: maybe this could be the rare musical that appeals to general audiences and comic fans alike.", "source": {"uri": "inverse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Inverse"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lyvie_scott@inverse.com", "name": "Lyvie Scott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Musical theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shared universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Hollywood_cinema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Classical Hollywood cinema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technicolor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crime film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DC Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filmmaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Batman_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Batman (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gunn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Gunn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Safran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Safran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Reeves", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Reeves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Education", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound_Files", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Sound Files", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Computers", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2024/7/22/029aa7ab/vs-youtube-jokerfoliedeuxofficialteasertrailer-137.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The \"Shallow\" singer, 38, was seen sharing a passionate kiss with her co-star Joaquin Phoenix, 49, in one of the shots included in the trailer. The trailer definitely ramped up the excitement for the long-awaited sequel to 2019's Joker.\n\nThe trailer picks up where the first film left off, starting with Arthur Fleck (aka Joker) being driven away in a police car. As he arrives at Arkham State Hospital, he gets his first look at Harley, who gestures with her fingers pointing a gun at her head. The trailer then shows plenty of scenes of the madness happening with Joker's supporters, as well as moments of Harley and his musical relationship beginning, set to Frank Sinatra's \"When You're Smiling.\"\n\nIn addition to the madness of the protesters, there are also clips of Joker and Harley dancing, as well as Harley encouraging him. \"You can do anything you want. You're Joker,\" she says. Clips from Joker's trial are shown, and he shouts in court, \"I will no longer allow any of you to keep me down.\" There are also scenes where Joker and Harley appear to be on a TV show. The trailer ultimately ends with Joker and Harley doing some dance moves on the courtroom steps, similar to the classic dance scene in the original movie.\n\nThe first trailer for Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux was released back in April. Some of the clips were the same, but it gave a slightly different look into Arthur's relationship with Harley Quinn. The movie is set to hit theaters on October 4. It is a musical featuring multiple covers of pre-existing songs. Like the first film, Todd Phillips returned to direct. The original movie was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, winning two of them. Hildur Guonadottir won for Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures, and Joaquin won Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role.", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_crowley@hollywoodlife.com", "name": "James Crowley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_(Lady_Gaga_and_Bradley_Cooper_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shallow (Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frank Sinatra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Circus", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Circus", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1797535217_095245-e1721754456542.jpg?quality=100&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 143, "textEnd": 150}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-04", "textStart": 1606, "textEnd": 1615}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The Joker figure is incredibly detailed, resembling Ledger's performance in The Dark Knight with evil accessories included. Ledger won a posthumous Oscar for his portrayal of the Joker, breaking boundaries in comic book movies. Limited quantity of 3,000 units.\n\nOne of the most iconic villains of all time which was brought to life by a legendary performance is suiting up like you've never seen him with a new collectible. The official Hot Toys Instagram unveiled the first look at a new Heath Ledger Joker figure, but not based on his appearance in The Dark Knight. The new figure sees Ledger's Clown Prince of Crime suiting up in Christian Bale's Batman armor, except repainted to exemplify the style that only the Joker would be able to confidently sport. The armor is painted with various splashes of green, purple, and red, with a dark purple cape in place of Batman's black cape to tie the whole outfit together.\n\nEvery detail in the face of this figure looks so much like Ledger in The Dark Knight that it's almost unsettling. At first glance, it's impossible to discern the figure from Ledger's portrayal of the Joker in Christopher Nolan's Batman film. In addition to the painted Batman armor, this collectible comes with all The Clown Prince of Crime's evil accessories, including his guns, grenades, and playing cards, while also featuring custom Batarangs designed just for the Joker. He can also be adjusted to have his arms and legs stand in different stances to accommodate all of his accompanying gear and accessories. This figure will be released with a limited quantity of 3,000 units hitting select markets.\n\nHeath Ledger Won a Rare Posthumous Oscar\n\nIt's no secret that comic book movies are not the favorite of the Academy, except when it comes to Visual Effects or Costume categories. Despite many actors giving outstanding performances over the years, few comic book movie actors are ever even recognized with a nomination. However, some performers are so great that they transcend the boundaries and break the norm, which is exactly what Ledger did when he suited up as the Joker in The Dark Knight. Ledger sadly passed away on January 22, 2008, but posthumously won the award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for his performance as Joker at the 2009 Academy Awards.\n\nThe Heath Ledger Joker figure will be released with 3,000 units but is not yet on sale. Stay tuned to Collider for future updates, check out the images of the collectible above, and watch Ledger's legendary performance as Joker in The Dark Knight, now streaming on Max.\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\nPG-13\n\nAction\n\nCrime\n\nThriller\n\nSuperhero\n\nWhen the menace known as the Joker wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham, Batman must accept one of the greatest psychological and physical tests of his ability to fight injustice.\n\nDirector Christopher Nolan\n\nCast Christian Bale , Heath Ledger , Aaron Eckhart , Michael Caine , Maggie Gyllenhaal , Gary Oldman\n\nRuntime 152 minutes\n\nWriters Jonathan Nolan , Christopher Nolan , David S.

This time, he's joined by fellow asylum inmate Harkey Quinn (Lady Gaga) to bring a comic book criminal partnership for the ages to gritty life.\n\n(Spoilers for 2019's Joker below.)\n\nJoker was intended to be a standalone film -- part of DC Films' decision to move away from the shared-universe approach of its prior franchise DCEU films. (DC Studios CEO James Gunn is now calling it the \"DC Elseworld\" project.) It had no relation to the Justice League films that came before, so that freed Phillips to create his own darker, grittier version of this iconic character. He cited Martin Scorsese films like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and The King of Comedy among his influences. There's no real origin story for the Joker in the comics -- not a definitive one, anyway -- so Phillips and screenwriter Scott Silver were able to cherry-pick the canonical elements they needed and make up the rest. (In Batman: The Killing Joke, for instance, the Joker is a failed comedian.)\n\nThe sequel was officially announced in 2022. In addition to Phoenix and Gaga, Zazie Beetz returns as Sophie, Arthur's former neighbor and a single mom, on whom he had a crush, as well as Leigh Gill and Sharon Washington reprising their roles as Arthur's therapist and social worker, respectively. The cast also includes Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Jacob Lofland, Steve Coogan, Ken Leung, and Harry Lawley.\n\nPer the official premise, \"Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\" The first teaser was released in April and showed Fleck meeting Gaga's Dr. Harleen Quinzel, a fellow inmate who becomes increasingly obsessed with Arthur... and vice versa. It was clear the pair fed one another's particular delusions, right down to show-stopping fantasy musical numbers.\n\nThis latest trailer, set to the dulcet tones of Frank Sinatra, mostly offers more of the same, although we do get some new footage of Joker representing himself at his trial: \"Look around at all these people!\" he exclaims, perhaps referring to the throngs of frenzied admirers cheering him on outside. \"I will no longer allow any of you to keep me down.\" With Harley by his side, he's ready to give the people what they want. We're guessing they're going to choose violence.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux hits theaters overseas on October 2, 2024, followed by a US theatrical release on October 4, 2024. The film will make its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival in September.\n\nListing image by YouTube/Warner Bros.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars

I don't think it's going to be what they expect, around it being musical. We all sort of express musically and dancing in our lives day-to-day. I think it's going to work really well.\"\n\nIt's worth reiterating that Todd Phillips is returing as director of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, and he co-wrote the script with Scott Silver, as well as produced the film with Bradley Cooper.\n\nDiehard fans of DC Comics and the larger universe they fill should know that Todd Phillips' original Joker film and this new sequel exist in a separate world/universe from the main series' canon, which naturally follows series hero Batman.

The movie's first trailer came out months ago, and it's already playing pretty much every time I go to the theater for a non-kids' movie. Now, a longer second trailer has arrived, though it doesn't answer too many questions about what this movie is going to be.\n\nIf Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux really is a musical, then the marketing geniuses at Warner Bros. Pictures aren't too interested in showing evidence in the trailer -- something that's been true of a lot of musicals lately. There's definitely music in there. The trailer is set to what seems to be a slowed-down, ominous remix of Frank Sinatra's version of \"When You're Smiling,\" and there's a moment where Gaga whisper-sings Judy Garland's \"Get Happy\" to Joaquin Phoenix, so maybe they're going for a standards thing here -- like Gaga has finally found a blockbuster-sized outlet for her cocktail-jazz fixation.\n\nOther than that, we see a few isolated images that could come from musical numbers. There will be some dramatic courtroom scenes, with the Joker on trial in full makeup, and the Joker and Gaga might host a reality show? Virtually every moment in the trailer could come from a character's dream sequence, which I guess is in keeping with the original Joker. Also, people keep referring to the character as \"Joker\" rather than \"the Joker.\" I'm going to have a tough time getting used to that. If you liked the first movie, maybe you'll like this one.

The sequel to 2019's Joker brings back director Todd Phillips and star Joaquin Phoenix, who are joined by the multi-talented Lady Gaga as the DC antihero Harley Quinn. What sets Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux apart from its predecessor is the fact that it will be a musical, which should be entertaining to see when you incorporate characters like Joker and Harley Quinn. With the movie's release coming later this year and San Diego Comic-Con on the horizon, it's time we got another trailer to digest.\n\nThe Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux social media accounts revealed the next trailer will be released on July 23rd at 6 a.m. PT. As a bonus, a 24-hour live broadcast is currently playing on YouTube until the Joker 2 trailer debuts, which will come with something called the \"Joker & Harley Show.\" The video playing on a loop features a network studio set with monitor screens for a live studio audience, and is only waiting for the broadcast to go live so the lights can be turned on. You can get a look at the setup below.\n\nJoker 2 casting director praises Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn\n\nDuring a panel at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, Joker 2 casting director Francine Maisler offered high praise for Lady Gaga's work in the film, arguing that the actress and musician more than holds her own while playing such an iconic character.\n\n\"She's so good in it, you guys,\" Maisler explained. \"She's going to blow your mind. I didn't suggest Lady Gaga. It wasn't my idea. That was Todd Phillips, before me. But I will tell you, she's really surprising -- and really good. I saw it and I was really surprised. I mean, we all knew what she could do in A Star is Born, but I thought, 'Oh, well, that's kind of in her wheelhouse.' Something she could do and just be real. But this... Man, she's good. Joaquin blows your mind, but that she could keep up with him, and be real -- and not just wiped off the screen by what that role is and what the performance is -- shows she's good.\"\n\nWhat is Joker 2 about?\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will be a musical that follows the twisted romance between Arthur Fleck and Harley Quinn, with a lot of the film believed to be taking place within Arkham Asylum. Directed by Todd Phillips, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will also feature appearances from Zazie Beetz, Brendon Gleeson, Catherine Keener, and Jacob Lofland.\n\n\"I actually think it makes wonderful sense,\" Beetz previously said of the film's musical elements. \"I wasn't really surprised by that Todd has always had a creative approach to the character. I love musicals, and I think of them as the characters are feeling and experiencing so much that they can only sing and dance about it, whether in sorrow or in joy. And I can actually see that within myself as well, because singing and dancing is quite a cathartic experience for me. I was going through a really, really difficult time at one point in my life, and I just started dancing and crying by myself. And that was an expression that matched where I was at that moment. And so, I can see Arthur, who is feeling and experiencing so much, dancing and singing about it. He's the Joker, so I think it makes sense to me.\"\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux arrives in theaters on October 4th.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Comic-Con"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihero", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antihero"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karlovy_Vary_International_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karlovy Vary International Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lofland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Lofland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Keener", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine Keener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Musical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Musical theatre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazie_Beetz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zazie Beetz"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Bizarre", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Kissing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2024/07/22/840667f6-62de-429f-8846-bb065f2ceace/joker-2-teaser-header.jpg?width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-23", "textStart": 671, "textEnd": 680}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-04", "textStart": 3273, "textEnd": 3284}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

The trailer teases Dent's presence in the sequel, setting up the potential for him to become Two-Face. Dent's character may undergo a unique transformation influenced by Arthur Fleck's actions.\n\nHarvey Dent will appear in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux and the character should play a major role in the anticipated DC movie. The Joker universe has featured a few major characters from DC Comics, like a young Bruce Wayne long before he turned into Batman, as well as his parents. The DC sequel will continue that practice, with Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn having a major role in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux's story. With the sequel being described as a jukebox musical, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will be quite a surprising event.\n\nThe first Joker led to Joaquin Phoenix winning a Best Actor Oscar for his role as Arthur Fleck. Now that the new Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux trailer is out, it seems like fans can expect the same high-caliber performance once again. The new footage has teased several key moments of the movie, such as Arkham on fire, what Arthur Fleck has been up to since the first Joker, and how Harley Quinn fits into all of this. The trailer also teased a potential major player in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux's cast -- Harvey Dent.\n\nRelated Every Upcoming DC Movie In 2024 And Beyond\n\nHere's every new DC movie confirmed as in development by WB for 2024 and onwards, including release dates and where they belong in the franchise.\n\nThe New Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux Trailer Confirms Harvey Dent At Least Two Batman Villains Join Phoenix's Joker Close\n\nWhile his face was not shown, the Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux trailer featured a couple of lines of dialogue from Harvey Dent. That was confirmed by the subtitles of the trailer. This is the official confirmation that Dent will appear in the Joker sequel that fans have been waiting for after a long time. The reason for that is Harvey Dent's Joker Folie \u00e0 Deux role had been teased by set photos in 2023. The photos in question featured signs that said \"Free Joker\" and \"Dent Is A Clown.\"\n\nAt the moment, there has been no confirmation regarding who will be playing Harvey Dent in the movie. Speculation on social media has suggested Harry Lawtey could be playing Dent. While there is no official word on who Lawtey is playing, the 27-year-old actor did bear a resemblance to the character in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux set photos. Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face, last appeared in a live-action movie in The Dark Knight. Aaron Eckhart played the character, with his electric performance helping the Batman movie become as iconic as it was, which leaves a high standard for the new Dent.\n\nRelated Joker 2 Character Tease Is Bad News For The Batman 2\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux set photos tease the introduction of a famous Gotham villain, which could mean that The Batman - Part II will have to avoid him.\n\nHarvey Dent Appears To Be The Prosecutor In Arthur Fleck's Case The Character Is The Perfect Fit For The DC Sequel Close\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux will show how Arthur Fleck's actions in 2019's Joker have impacted the world. The trailer revealed that Arthur will be the focus of \"The Trial of the Century,\" which is the perfect setup to bring in Harvey Dent. Before becoming the Batman villain known as Two-Face, Dent was one of Gotham's biggest heroes, working as the city's District Attorney and helping clean Gotham City of its criminals. Harvey Dent should play a similar role in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, with the character being the prosecutor of Arthur Fleck's case.\n\nBesides his DC past, the trailer teases that prosecutor role for Dent without ever showing his face. At the start of the Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux trailer, Harvey Dent says, \"They believe Arthur Fleck to be some kind of martyr. Well, he's not. He's a monster.\" The character's words ring hard and true, sounding like they could be from Dent's opening arguments at the Joker's trial. Dent refers to how Arthur's actions in Joker have inspired others to rebel, including Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn, setting up the stage for a chaotic sequel.\n\nRelated 8 Best Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux Theories We Totally Believe After The Chilling First Trailer\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux has released its teaser trailer, and with it comes the brewing of fan theories both new and old regarding the details of the plot.\n\nWill Harvey Dent Become Two-Face In The Joker Universe? The Transformation Could Come With A Twist Close\n\nWith Harvey Dent confirmed to appear in Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, the question now turns to whether the character will become the villainous Two-Face in the movie or not. Joker brought forth multiple changes to DC lore, which included the exploration of the villain's origin, something DC has mostly left open. The sequel will once again make some original choices with the classic characters, and as such, Harvey Dent could become Two-Face with a major twist.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux could have Dent's transformation into Two-Face be caused by Joaquin Phoenix's Arthur Fleck. In the comics, a criminal threw acid on Dent's face, and the tragic scarring led to his descent into madness and the birth of Two-Face. That would be something Phoenix's Joker would have no problem doing based on his actions in the trailer and 2019's Joker. There is also the possibility that a third Joker movie will come, which could lead to Harvey Dent only being teased to become Two-Face at the end of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux before appearing in Joker 3.\n\nJoker: Folie a Deux R\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is the sequel to Todd Phillips' critically acclaimed comic book thriller Joker. Reprising his Academy Award-winning performance as the failed comedian Arthur Fleck, Joaquin Phoenix revisits the iconic DC character alongside Lady Gaga, who makes her debut as Joker's lover Harley Quinn in this standalone continuity of the DC Universe.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips Release Date October 4, 2024 Cast Joaquin Phoenix , Lady Gaga , Brendan Gleeson , Zazie Beetz , Catherine Keener ,

The new film stars Joaquin Phoenix once again in his Oscar-winning dual role as Arthur Fleck/Joker, opposite Oscar winner Lady Gaga (A Star Is Born).\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\n\nThe film also stars Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson (The Banshees of Inisherin) and Catherine Keener (Get Out, Capote), alongside Zazie Beetz, reprising her role from Joker.\n\nThe film follows in the footsteps of both the original Joker movie, and the Gotham TV show, in that both offer a slice of the Batman DC Comics universe, but without Batman. That this trick actually works is a testament to the quality of the screenwriting, the directing, and of course the acting that the entire performing ensemble brings to the table.\n\nPhillips, who was nominated for Oscars for directing, writing and producing Joker, directed Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux from a screenplay by fellow Oscar nominee Scott Silver & Phillips, based on characters from DC. The film was produced by Phillips, Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff and Joseph Garner. Lady Gaga served as music consultant. The film's executive producers are Michael E. Uslan, Georgia Kacandes, Silver, Mark Friedberg and Jason Ruder.\n\nWorking with Phillips behind the camera are his team from Joker, including Oscar-nominated director of photography Lawrence Sher, production designer Mark Friedberg, Oscar-nominated editor Jeff Groth, and composer Hildur Gu?nad\u00f3ttir, who won the Oscar for her work on the first film. New to the team is Oscar-nominated costume designer Arianne Phillips (Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood, Don't Worry Darling). Ruder is the film's executive music producer and the music supervisors are Randall Poster and George Drakoulias. Casting is by Francine Maisler (the Dune films, Challengers).\n\nThe film will be released worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, and will be only in theaters nationwide on October 4, 2024, and beginning internationally on 2 October, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "scifi.radio", "dataType": "news", "title": "SCIFI.radio - Scifi Fandom Radio"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Star_Is_Born_(2018_soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A Star Is Born (2018 soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Banshees_of_Inisherin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Banshees of Inisherin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Keener", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catherine Keener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truman_Capote", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Truman Capote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gotham (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DC Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazie_Beetz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zazie Beetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Groth_(film_editor)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Groth (film editor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Worry_Darling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Don't Worry Darling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Pictures", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros.

The trailer shows us that Arthur Fleck 'Joker' has been an inmate at Arkham Asylum for 2 years and the movie seemingly revolves around his trial and how he builds a chaos-laced romantic relationship with Harley Quinn.\n\nThe new trailer for Joker 2 shows us that Joker, who has been living with the thought that he is utterly alone, has found a companion in Harley Quinn who loves Arthur just the way he is. We see shots of his trial and some shots of him leaving the courthouse and also him and Harley hosting a comedy show. It seems that most of the movie will revolve around Joker's trial and the exquisite shots we have seen in the trailer are events that are happening in Joker's head.\n\nWe also get to hear Arthur sing and it is pretty clear that the songs we are going to listen to in the movie since it is a partial musical, will feature some numbers sung by Joaquin Phoenix himself which in itself is pretty exciting. So let's wait and see what Warner Bros has in store for us.

In this electrifying follow-up to the 2019 hit, Joaquin Phoenix reprises his role as Arthur Fleck, the infamous Joker. But this time, he's not alone.\n\nEnter Lady Gaga, who steps into the role of Harley Quinn with a performance that's as mesmerizing as it is unhinged. \"When I first saw Joker, when I first saw you...\" she mimics his infamous gunshot-to-the-head gesture, capturing the essence of their twisted connection.\n\n\"For once in my life, I didn't feel so alone anymore,\" she continues, her voice dripping with the kind of mania only Harley Quinn can muster.\n\n\"For once in my life, I have someone who needs me,\" Fleck echoes her sentiment, serenading a television screen from within the confines of Arkham Asylum. The chemistry between Phoenix and Gaga is palpable, promising a dynamic and chaotic relationship that will keep audiences on the edge of their seats.\n\nThe film delves deep into the origins of this infamous duo, chronicling their descent into madness as they wreak havoc across Gotham City. Fleck, who has become a symbol of rebellion and chaos, finds himself idolized by the city's downtrodden residents. Despite his criminal trial, many see him not as a monster, but as a martyr.\n\n\"I won't allow any of you to keep me down,\" Fleck declares with defiant intensity, as the trailer flashes scenes of him and Harley Quinn dancing, singing, and strutting through the streets of Gotham with maniacal glee. Their smiles, disturbingly wide, hint at the mayhem to come.\n\n\"You can do anything you want. You're Joker,\" Harley assures him, setting the stage for their grand, anarchic finale.\n\nThis trailer is just a taste of the madness that Joker Folie \u00e0 Deux promises to deliver. The film, directed by Todd Phillips, looks set to push boundaries and explore the darkest corners of these characters' psyches.\n\nStream the official trailer below, and prepare yourself for an unforgettable ride when Joker Folie \u00e0 Deux hits theaters on October 4.

The 3-minute preview hints at a new story following Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck, a.k.a. The Joker, and introducing Lady Gaga as Harleen Quinzel, a.k.a. Harley Quinn. However, it focuses more on depicting the chaos than making sense of it.\n\nJoker: Folie a Deux - or \"Joker 2\" as some are calling it for simplicity's sake - premieres at the Venice Film Festival in September before hitting theaters everywhere on Oct. 4, 2024. Writer Scott Silver and director Todd Phillips both return for this sequel, as do stars Phoenix and Zazie Beetz. The trailer doesn't give us any hints about Beetz's character Sophie Dumond, focusing mainly on the introduction of the Joker's sadistic sidekick and love interest Harley Quinn. It also gives plenty of screentime to Brandon Gleeson, who is playing a police officer or prison guard.\n\nAccording to a report by Deadline, Folie a Deux will take place mostly inside of Arkum Asylum, the fictional institution that looms so large in DC Comics and Batman stories. Arthur will meet Harleen, a fellow inmate, and their love affair will blossom into shared delusions coinciding with the real-life riots spurred by Arthur's actions in the first movie. The movie is at least partially a musical, though the trailer didn't hint at that too strongly.\n\nThe 2019 psychological thriller Joker struck a chord with a huge audience, though it had little to do with DC Comics canon or even other screen adaptations. It is set in Gotham City in the early 1980s, following Arthur's struggle with a neurological disorder, mental health issues and poverty. He works as a party clown and aspires to be a stand-up comedian, but fails miserably at both.

The sequel is said to be a musical, expanding on Phoenix's manic dancing from the first movie.\n\nAddressing the movie's musical components, Beetz told Variety: \"I think people will be surprised. I don't think it's going to be what they expect, around it being musical. We all sort of express musically and dancing in our lives day-to-day. I think it's going to work really well.\"\n\n\"Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux\" will be separate from the other upcoming films from DC Studios co-CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran's slate, like \"Superman,\" and exist in its own separate world. The same goes for Matt Reeves' \"The Batman: Part II,\" which tells its own standalone story. Gaga's Harley Quinn will exist separately from Margot Robbie's character, seen in \"Birds of Prey\" and \"The Suicide Squad,\" and Kaley Cuoco's animated character from the Max series.\n\nTodd

Phoenix crushed it as viewers got to watch Fleck transform into the legendary DC Comics villain.\n\nNow, it's time for round two.\n\nThe plot of the sequel with Lady Gaga l is described by Warner Bros. as, \"'Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux' finds Arthur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\"\n\nOn that music note, early whispers indicate there will be several songs featured as Fleck and Harley Quinn (Lady Gaga) start cutting it up, but it's unclear at this time how many will be originals to the movie.\n\nWhat we do knew is the new trailer promises a dark ride. Give it a watch below, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.\n\nI'm getting some serious vibes that \"Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux\" is going to be awesome. Again, the first film was outstanding. Director Todd Phillips - the same genius behind \"The Hangover\" - hit a home run.\n\nIt was an outstanding blend of a traditional comic book movie with plenty of elements that appealed to regular viewers. It was a similar formula \"The Dark Knight\" trilogy used, and it worked.\n\nNow, Phoenix is returning and Lady Gaga is joining him. Don't count out Gaga's acting skills. She was outstanding in \"A Star is Born.\" Definitely worth checking out if you've never seen it before. With a music element to \"Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux,\" adding her to the mix certainly makes sense on the surface.\n\nI'm certainly excited for whatever comes with the sequel, and I'm sure many of you are too once it hits theaters in early October.

Talented performers will join Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, including Zazie Beetz reprising her role, and new faces like Brendan Gleeson and Catherine Keener. The sequel's plot explores the relationship between Joker and Harley and is set to premiere on October 4, 2024.\n\nThe latest trailer for Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux has just dropped, and it looks as deliciously demented as we could possibly have hoped, with more funky tunes that give us a better idea of the musical path down which the movie shall tread. Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga take center stage in the lush trailer. The difference in the production values from the first movie are also apparent, which shouldn't come as any great surprise given the immense jump in the movie budgets, with the 2019 movie's $55 million jumping up to $200 million for Folie \u00e0 Deux.\n\nA vast swathe of wonderfully talented performers will be joining Phoenix and Gaga in the musical sequel. Zazie Beetz, who so memorably played Sophie, the striking next door neighbor who finds herself the unwitting object of Arthur's affection in the 2019 film, will reprise her role. Sharon Washington and Leigh Gill will also be reprising their roles from the first movie as Arthur's social worker and Arthur's coworker, Gary, respectively.\n\nThe film also sees a number of new faces. Brendan Gleeson (The Banshees of Inisherin), will also be joining the cast as a prison guard at Arkham Aslyum. Academy Award Nominated actress Catherine Keener (Get Out) has also joined the project in a key role. Other new cast members in the sequel include Harry Lawtey (Industry), Jacob Lofland (Mud), Academy Award nominee Steve Coogan (Philomena), and Ken Leung (Star Wars: The Force Awakens).\n\nWhat Is 'Folie \u00e0 Deux' About?\n\nWhile detailed plot information has been kept under wraps, there are several key elements known about the sequel.

Pictures\n\nThis week (July 23rd), we finally got the official trailer for the upcoming Joker film. Click inside to check out the action-packed preview!\n\nFrom acclaimed writer/director/producer Todd Phillips comes Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux, the much-anticipated follow-up to 2019's Academy Award-winning Joker, which earned more than $1 billion at the global box office and remains the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. The new film stars Joaquin Phoenix once again in his Oscar-winning dual role as Arthur Fleck/Joker, opposite Oscar winner Lady Gaga (A Star Is Born).\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux finds Arhtur Fleck institutionalized at Arkham awaiting trial for his crimes as Joker. While struggling with his dual identity, Arthur not only stumbles upon true love, but also finds the music that's always been inside him.\n\nIn addition to Phoenix and Lady Gaga, the film also stars Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson (The Banshees of Inisherin) and Catherine Keeer (Get Out, Capote), alongside Zazie Beetz, reprising her role from Joker.\n\nPhillips, who was nominated for Oscars for directing, writing and producing Joker, directed Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux from a screenplay by himself and fellow Oscar nominee Scott Silver, based on characters from DC. The film was produced Phillips, Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff and Joseph Garner. 13-time Grammy Award-winner Lady Gaga served as music consultant. The film's executive producers are Michael E. Uslan, Georgia Kacandes, Silver, Mark Friedberg and Jason Ruder.\n\nWorking with Phillips behind the camera was his team from Joker, including Oscar-nominated director of photography Lawrence Sher, production designer Mark Friedberh, Oscar-nominated editor Jeff Groth, and composer Hildur Gu\u0111nad\u00f3ttir, who won the Oscar for her work on the first film. New to the team was Oscar-nominated costume designer Arianne Phillips (Once Upon a Time in...Hollywood, Don't Worry Darling). Ruder was the film's executive music producer and the music supervisors were Randall Poster and George Darkoulias. Casting was by Francine Maisler (the Dune films, Challengers).\n\nThe film will be released worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures, and will only be in theaters nationwide on October 4th and beginning internationally on October 2nd.

The film will be released on October 4th.\n\nWarner Bros. is preparing everyone for a new Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux trailer, which is set to be released early tomorrow morning. At the moment, there is the above live stream with a countdown to the trailer with stage detailing. It's apparent that this will not be a one-man show, and Harley will be just as much of a main character as Joker. People are already being weird about Lady Gaga as Harley as if we haven't had several people play the Joker and Batman in various DC movies. If we can have multiple men playing Batman within this writer's lifetime, we can handle a second woman playing one of the most iconic female villains in the DC Universe. The casting director for the film had nothing but good things to say about Gaga, saying, \"She's so good in it, you guys. She's going to blow your mind.\"\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is slated for release on October 4, 2024. The film reunites director Todd Phillips with stars Joaquin Phoenix and Zazie Beetz from the first film, and Lady Gaga, Brendan Gleeson, and Catherine Keener are the newcomers to the cast. The first teaser trailer was released during the Warner Bros. CinemaCon presentation in April 2024; we haven't heard much about the film since. We can infer a couple of things from the title and what Folie \u00e0 Deux is, but Warner Bros. hasn't released much so far. It will be fascinating to see how Warner Bros. sells this film to the general public, who might not know who Joker or Harley is and haven't seen the first film. Joker was released in October 2019 to critical and commercial success across the board. It earned several award wins and nominations for its cast and crew, and it cracked a billion dollars at the box office on a budget of $55 million. That is the sort of story that studios dream of, so even though the film was initially pitched as a one-off, it isn't surprising to anyone that another film was greenlit.", "source": {"uri": "bleedingcool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleeding Cool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kaitlyn_booth@bleedingcool.com", "name": "Kaitlyn Booth", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DC Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazie_Beetz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zazie Beetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Keener", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine Keener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Theatre_Owners", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Theatre Owners"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://bleedingcool.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/JOKER2_VERT_TSR_STANDARD_2764x4096_DOM-1-2000x1125.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-04", "textStart": 139, "textEnd": 150}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-10-", "textStart": 1658, "textEnd": 1670}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards and won two, including Best Actor for Phoenix.\n\nWhen filming finished in April 2023, Phillips wrote on Instagram: \"That's a wrap. Thanks to these two (+ the entire cast) and the BEST crew that the film industry has to offer. From top to bottom.\"\n\n\"Gonna crawl into a cave now (edit room) and put it all together,\" he added.\n\nGaga, 38, gave some insight into her portrayal of the iconic character in May.\n\n\"You know, my version of Harley is mine and it's very authentic to this movie and these characters,\" she told Access Hollywood at the time. \"I've never done anything like I've done in this movie before, so it's all going to be completely brand new and really fun.\"\n\n\"I don't want to give anything from the movie away,\" the \"A Star is Born\" actress added. \"I think it's really something you have to experience in the theater.\"\n\nGaga also teased, \"This film has music, it has dance, it has amazing acting in it.\"\n\n\"I loved working with Joaquin, I loved working with Todd,\" Gaga continued. \"I've never done anything like I've done in this movie before, so it's all going to be completely brand new and really fun.\"\n\nThe musical aspect of the new rendition differs from the original.\n\nGaga, though a seasoned musician, almost wasn't considered for the role of Quinn. In fact, it wasn't casting director Francine Maisler's first idea at all to cast the \"Just Dance\" singer opposite Phoenix.\n\nInstead, Phillips chose her for the part, and apparently he knew what he was doing.\n\n\"She's so good in it, you guys. She's going to blow your mind,\" Maisler, 61, exclaimed when speaking at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival on July 5, via IndieWire. \"I didn't suggest Lady Gaga. It wasn't my idea. That was Todd Phillips, before me. But I will tell you, she's really surprising -- and really good. I saw it and I was really surprised. I mean, we all knew what she could do in 'A Star Is Born,' but I thought, 'Oh, well, that's kind of in her wheelhouse.' Something she could do and just be real. But this ... Man, she's good.\"\n\nMargot Robbie previously played Quinn in \"Suicide Squad\" (2016), \"Birds of Prey\" (2020) and \"The Suicide Squad\" (2021). The actress voiced her support for Gaga taking on the role, telling Entertainment Weekly in 2022 that she will \"do something incredible with it.\"\n\nIn January, she told Variety: \"I always wanted Harley to be a character that would get passed on to other actresses to play, the way there are so many iconic male characters.\"\n\nShe continued: \"That was always the dream for her. Harley's so fun and can go in so many different directions. You put her in someone else's hands, and it's like, 'What are they going to do with her?'

Fans can expect a gripping narrative and powerful performances from the star-studded cast, which also includes Zazie Beetz and Catherine Keener.\n\nJoker 2 is scheduled for release on October 4, 2024, promising a continuation of the gritty and provocative storytelling that made the first film a critical and commercial success.", "source": {"uri": "screengeek.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenGeek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frank_palmer@screengeek.net", "name": "Frank Palmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_drama", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychological drama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Keener", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine Keener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Psychosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazie_Beetz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zazie Beetz"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Reviews", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.screengeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/joker-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The newest trailer for the upcoming sequel teases a maddening wonderland with Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nFans were skeptical when it was announced that Joker would be getting a sequel. The Oscar-winning film seemed to be a lightning-in-a-bottle moment for DC. However, the more that comes out about the upcoming movie, from casting Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn to Joaquin Phoenix's victory lap as the crown prince of crime, the more fans have become excited at the prospect of a sequel.\n\nThe first trailer for the Joker follow-up wowed audiences with incredibly powerful performances by both Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga. The sequel seems to be leaning even harder into the musical elements of the first film, allowing the set designers to go hog wild in their depiction of DC's most deranged couple.\n\nJoker and Harley Quinn Wow unite in the official trailer\n\nYet it seems Joker isn't done earning its place just yet. The second trailer for the sequel just dropped, giving fans everything they wanted and more from the project. From new looks at Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn, to the growing scale of the musical numbers, this DC project is quickly becoming a must-watch this fall season.\n\nWhile the trailer itself was stunning, the Joker sequel has a lot of ground to make up. While the first film crossed a billion dollars, the reunion boasts a nearly $200 million pricetag, mostly due to the stunning paydays needed to secure Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga. Given the current state of DC, fans have to hope it at least makes its money back!\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is set to hit theaters on October 4, 2024.

First introduced in an episode of Batman: The Animated Series, Harley has grown to become one of the most popular characters in the DC Universe. Through most of her history, Harley has been the quintessential battered girlfriend, a woman who lost her own identity under that of her abusive, controlling boyfriend.\n\nHarley Quinn began as Dr. Harleen Quinzel, a psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum tasked with studying the Joker. The more she learned about the Joker, the more enamored with him she became, to the point that she lost all sense of herself and became a henchman.\n\nThe trailer for Folie \u00e0 Deux features a very different take on their dynamic. Instead, Harley (Lady Gaga) appears to be a fellow inmate in Arkham, not a doctor helping patients. And rather than follow the Joker's lead, she's egging on Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix). In what appears to be a foundational moment, Harley smashes a storefront window to steal a television broadcasting an interview with Arthur.

Ledger's take on the joke in The Dark Knight is arguably one of the most well-known renditions of the character. The Dark Knight's Joker is one of the scariest interpretations to date; the depiction of him in Batman's suit is a wonderfully unsettling choice.\n\nRelated\n\nJoker's Strangest Quirk in The Dark Knight Has a Surprising Behind-the-Scenes Explanation\n\nHeath Ledger's legendary portrayal of the Joker in the Dark Knight is unforgettable. However, one strange character tic is not what it seems.\n\nThe beautifully detailed figure features the Joker in a twisted version of Batman's suit. The imitation suit is notably tattered and features the Joker's iconic green and purple color scheme, as opposed to Batman's pure black suit. Only 3000 units of the exclusive figure are available for a limited time. The Hot Toy's caption states, \"Seize your opportunity to own this one-of-a-kind masterpiece before it slips away forever and let the Joker's sinister schemes consume you.\"\n\nThe Dark Knight Trilogy Remains Iconic\n\nThe Dark Knight Trilogy, directed by Christopher Nolan, remains one of the most iconic in the franchise. The trilogy consists of Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, and The Dark Knight Rises. The trilogy was known for having a more gritty take on its world and characters. The Dark Knight's version of the Joker was praised for being a uniquely realistic take on the character. The most recent entry into the franchise, The Batman, was also praised for its ability to innovate the concept.\n\nRelated\n\n15 Things No One Remembers About The Dark Knight\n\nOver 15 years after the release of The Dark Knight, Batman fans would be forgiven for forgetting a few details from Christopher Nolan's hit sequel.\n\nThe Dark Knight is available for streaming on Max.\n\nSource: Hot Toys on Instagram\n\nThe Dark Knight\n\n10\n\n10\n\nWhen the menace known as the Joker wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham, Batman must accept one of the greatest psychological and physical tests of his ability to fight injustice.", "source": {"uri": "cbr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBR"}, "authors": [{"uri": "olivia_thomas@cbr.com", "name": "Olivia Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batman in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath_Ledger", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Heath Ledger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Toys", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hot Toys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_Rises_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Dark Knight Rises (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Batman_(film)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Batman (film)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_Begins_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batman Begins (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gotham (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Nolan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Gothic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Subcultures/Gothic", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Cosmology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Cosmology", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Fantasy", "label": "dmoz/Games/Miniatures/Fantasy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Action_Figures", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Action Figures", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://static1.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/heath-ledger-is-the-joker-in-christopher-nolan-s-the-dark-knight.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Per the new preview, the film's story will revolve around Arthur Fleck's (a.k.a. Joker's) \"trial of the century\" as he faces consequences for his deadly actions from the first film.\n\nSet to Frank Sinatra's \"When You're Smiling,\" Arthur's fame catches the attention of Gaga's Harleen Quinzel (a.k.a. Harley Quinn). \"When I saw first Joker, when I saw you, for once in my life, I didn't feel so alone anymore,\" she states via voiceover.\n\nThe two meet at the infamous Arkham Asylum. In addition to causing chaos at the institution, Harley continues to prove she's the Joker's biggest supporter by staying by his side through his trial.\n\nThe trailer gives glimpses at the film's many musical numbers, which seemingly take place in Arthur's imagination as the story's events play out.\n\n\"I got this sneaking suspicion that we're not giving the people what they want,\" he tells Harley during a reimagined version of the Live! With Murray Franklin late-night show, titled Joker & Harley. She replies, \"It's OK, baby. Let's give the people what they want.\"\n\nWhat follows is a montage of high-energy clips, including Joker supporters cheering for Harley as she arrives at the trial, fights breaking out amongst Arkham Asylum patients and guards, Joker running away from police cars and Joker and Harley dancing on the steps of a courthouse.\n\nThe new trailer ends with an eerie clip of the film's leading couple singing along to Judy Garland's \"Get Happy,\" stating, \"Sing Hallelujah / Come on, get happy / Get ready for the judgment day.\"\n\nFolie \u00e0 Deux -- a French term that translates to \"madness for two\" -- takes place after the events of the 2019 film and catches up with Arthur Fleck (Phoenix) after he is locked up in Arkham Asylum for his role in the Gotham City uprising that led to the deaths of talk-show host Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) and Bruce Wayne's parents.\n\nIn addition to Gaga and Phoenix in leading roles, the ensemble cast includes Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener and Zazie Beetz. The sequel, which was greenlit in June 2022 and hits theaters on October 4, was granted a budget of $200 million, tripling its 2019 predecessor's budget of $60 million.\n\nWhile Gaga has garnered a reputable acting resume over the years -- she starred in the 2018 A Star Is Born remake opposite Bradley Cooper and season 5 of Ryan Murphy's American Horror Story -- Joker casting director Franchine Maisler revealed earlier this month that the \"Just Dance\" singer was not her first choice for the role of Quinn. Instead, the idea sprung from the mind of the film's director, Todd Phillips.\n\n\"She's so good in it, you guys. She's going to blow your mind. I didn't suggest Lady Gaga,\" Maisler said during a panel at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic on July 5. \"It wasn't my idea. That was Todd Phillips, before me. But I will tell you, she's really surprising -- and really good. I saw it and I was really surprised. I mean, we all knew what she could do in A Star Is Born, but I thought, 'Oh, well, that's kind of in her wheelhouse.' Something she could do and just be real. But this ... man, she's good.\"\n\nMaisler noted that while Phoenix \"blows your mind\" leading the film, Gaga's ability to match the actor with her performance is equally impressive.\n\n\"That she could keep up with him, and be real -- and not just wiped off the screen by what that role is and what the performance is -- shows she's good,\" she gushed.\n\nGaga's influence will be felt through more than just her acting. Folie \u00e0 Deux will be a \"jukebox musical,\" according to Variety, and will have at least 15 \"very well-known\" tunes and even some original pieces of music. Insiders told the outlet that while details of who pens or sings the tracks are unknown, Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir, the Oscar-winning composer of the first Joker, is said to \"infuse her distinctive, haunting [music] cues\" into each number.", "source": {"uri": "usmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Us Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kat_pettibone@usmagazine.com", "name": "Kat

Joker (Joaquin Phoenix) and Harley together on the big screen, sharing an unhinged love story as shown in the new \"Joker 2\" trailer, would be enough for some. However, those who watched the newest teaser with closed captioning may have spotted another addition from Batman's rogues gallery.\n\nThe beginning of the trailer shows Joker in a car while voice-overs of various figures talk about his crimes from the first film. One of the lines is credited to none other than Harvey Dent, who eventually becomes the villain Two-Face. However, before his antagonistic transformation, Harvey works as District Attorney for Gotham, and his legal expertise will undoubtedly be needed for the sequel.\n\nA later scene from the trailer shows Joker going on a rant in a courtroom, so it's not out of the question Harvey will appear in a greater capacity outside of a quick line villainizing Arthur Fleck. But this ultimately confirms a fan theory that \"Joker 2\" will contain at least one other Batman villain, even if it's from before he's a downright criminal.", "source": {"uri": "looper.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Looper.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Dent_(1989_film_series_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Dent (1989 film series character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_captioning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Closed captioning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gotham (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic_Strips_and_Panels", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic Strips and Panels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://www.looper.com/img/gallery/the-new-joker-folie-a-deux-trailer-hides-a-secret-batman-villain/l-intro-1721760893.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Filled with haunting visuals and what appear to be award-worthy performances from the lead actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga, the trailer leaves an enticing impression of the film. It looks like Todd Phillips is set to deliver another winner with his sequel to the 2019 billion-dollar-grossing movie, Joker, which won Phoenix his first Oscar for Best Actor. 'Joker - Folie \u00c0 Deux' Trailer: Joaquin Phoenix's Joker Does His Iconic Laugh and Kisses Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn Amidst Rebellion in Gotham City.\n\nWhile the trailer of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux has many positives among its chaotic images, one standout feature is its use of the song \"When You're Smiling\". In the trailer, the song is performed by the great Frank Sinatra, but this beautiful track has a history beyond the legend. However, before that...\n\n\"When You're Smiling\" was first written in 1928 by Larry Shay, Mark Fisher, and Joe Goodwin. The song gained popularity through several famous recordings, including Seger Ellis in the same year, Louis Armstrong in 1929, and Cliff Bruner's Texas Wanderers in 1938. The song, which entered the public domain in 2024, even became an unofficial anthem of the Leicester City Football Club, which was performed by Jersey Budd.\n\nFrank Sinatra's version of the song, which is used in the trailer of Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, was part of his 1950 album Sing and Dance with Frank Sinatra, released by Columbia Records. Thanks to his smooth vocals and the jazz feel of the track, his version became very popular. Joker Folie \u00e0 Deux: Margot Robbie Believes Lady Gaga Will Do Justice to Harley Quinn's Character (Watch Video).\n\nWhen you're smilin', when you're smilin'\n\nThe whole world smiles with you\n\nWhen you're laughin', when you're laughin'\n\nThe sun comes shinin' through\n\nBut when you're cryin', you bring on the rain\n\nSo stop that cryin', be happy again\n\nKeep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin'\n\nThe whole world smiles with you\n\nWhen you're smilin', when you're smilin'\n\nThe whole world, it smiles with you\n\nWhen you're laughin', oh babe, when you're laughin'\n\nThe sun would-a come shining through\n\nBut when you're cryin', you bring on the rain\n\nSo stop that sighin', come on and be happy again\n\nKeep on smilin', 'cause when you're smilin', baby\n\nThe whole world smiles with you.\n\nThe song feels apt for the Joker sequel, considering Arthur Fleck can't control his laughing fits and is obsessed with his clown persona. Now, he sees the whole world, including his new girlfriend, Harley Quinn (we hope she is real this time), putting on smiles (and revolting against the world).

The first trailer for the movie featured glimpses of romance and chaos set to Burt Bacharach's \"What the World Needs Now is Love,\" while the latest preview offers another look at Gaga's Harley and a post-shooting Joker.\n\nAs Fall Out Boy once taught us, \"Folie \u00e0 Deux\" means \"a madness shared by two,\" and it seems likely that -- just like in the original \"Joker\" -- elements of this new movie will be totally imagined, perhaps as a sort of shared daydream. Harley and Joker meet behind bars, but in Phillips' vision of Gotham, they also carry out a moonlit rooftop waltz, perform on a huge classic musical soundstage, and quite literally get their names in lights. No matter your \"Joker\" hot take (everybody's got one!), this movie's visuals are undeniably gorgeous.\n\n\"\"Arthur [Fleck]'s weird and aloof and all these things, but he has music in him. He has a grace to him,\" Phillips told attendees at CinemaCon earlier this year (per Entertainment Weekly), noting that \"music is an essential element\" even in the first film. Aside from the song-and-dance of it all, Gaga's casting has been the biggest headline of the sequel so far.

Chaos ensues. It looks very much like at least some of this chaos is entirely in their creative little brains, a theory borne out by the fact that Variety notes, \"The film will reportedly take place mostly in Arkham Asylum.\"\n\nVariety also notes, \"Gaga's Harley Quinn will exist separately from Margot Robbie's character, seen in Birds of Prey and The Suicide Squad, and Kaley Cuoco's animated character from the Max series.\" This movie is not related to any of the new DC Studios movies, nor is it related to The Batman. The various DC movies exist in their own bubble universes, which is fine, if sometimes a lot to keep track of.\n\nThe film also stars Zazie Beetz (returning from the first Joker), Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Jacob Lofland, and Harry Lawtey.

Here, he falls in love with Harley Quinn, a music therapist working at the institution. Their relationship becomes increasingly intense, and by the looks of the trailer, music seems to be a uniting factor between the pair.\n\nWhile the last movie had several musical moments, such as The Joker's iconic dance to Gary Glitter's 'Rock and Roll Part 2', the sequel is set to include many more. According to Variety, the new movie features 15 cover versions of popular songs.\n\nDiscussing this leap into further musical territory, Phillips said (via Entertainment Weekly), \"Arthur's weird and aloof and all these things, but he has music in him. He has a grace to him. That informed a lot of the dancing in the first film... it didn't feel like that big of a step here. It's different, but I think it'll make sense when you see it.\"\n\nA much bigger budget of $200 million has also been employed for Folie \u00e0 Deux, which is around $140 million more than the amount it cost to make Joker. However, the first film raked in over $1 billion at the box office, therefore, it seems as though the creators of the sequel aren't worried the new movie will bomb with viewers.\n\nIt will premiere at Venice Film Festival, which begins in September, before hitting theatres on October 4th. It is one of the most anticipated movies in the industry, with people expecting the movie to follow in the footsteps of Joker and win various accolades. It won two Oscars and the Golden Lion at Venice when it was released in 2019, so there's a good chance that the upcoming sequel will also excel during awards season.\n\nAlongside Phoenix and Gaga, Zazie Beetz will reprise her role as Sophie Dumond, while brand new characters will appear. These other as yet unidentified parts will be played by actors such as Brendan Gleeson, Steve Coogan and Catherine Keener.", "source": {"uri": "faroutmagazine.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Far Out Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "aimee_ferrier@faroutmagazine.co.uk", "name": "Aimee Ferrier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_character", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Title character"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Musical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_(Gary_Glitter_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rock and Roll (Gary Glitter song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Glitter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gary Glitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Entertainment Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover_version", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cover version"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dance music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Keener", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine Keener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Coogan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Coogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden Lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venice Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazie_Beetz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zazie Beetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Soundtracks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Soundtracks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/static/uploads/1/2024/03/Joker-Folie-a\u0300-Deux-2024-Joaquin-Phoenix-Lady-Gaga-Todd-Phillips-Far-Out-Magazine-02.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-04", "textStart": 1726, "textEnd": 1737}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Lady Gaga Confirmed as Harley Quinn in New Teaser!", "body": "When news came recently that Todd Phillips was making moves on his sequel to Joker, I was wondering what would be the hook for the sequel. Enter Lady Gaga.\n\nThe second trailer for the Joker sequel has arrived, and it definitely leans into the musical element, featuring plenty of Gaga herself:\n\nA teaser for the movie that debuted on August 4, 2022, confirmed Lady Gaga would play Harley Quinn in the Joker followup:\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter had previously written, in an exclusive, that the Academy Award-winning actress was in talks to play Harley Quinn in what would be, according to their sources, a musical sequel. Considering actor Joaquin Phoenix has experience singing due to his role as Johnny Cash in Walk the Line, I am actually excited about the idea of seeing this chaotic combination.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 deux is the title of the sequel, according to Phillips, who shared it on social media back in June. Folie \u00e0 deux, a madness/folly of two, is a term that refers to a \"shared madness\" or shared psychosis between at least two people. It was brought into the true-crime arena with the cases of Ursula and Sabina Eriksson or Christine and L\u00e9a Papin. That, of course, would play right into a Joker/Harley story.\n\nWith this confirmation, Lady Gaga will be the second live-action film version of Harley Quinn, and I also love the idea of seeing Harley played by a woman in her 30s, since Gaga and Joaquin only have a 9-year age gap.\n\nJoker was not a film I loved, but it was a huge success. It made over a billion dollars and got Phoenix his long-deserved Oscar, and since Warner Bros. will never stop making things related to Batman, then it was expected to see this sequel.

It pulls back the curtain a bit more on how the canonical love story/abusive relationship between Joaquin Phoenix's Joker and Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn will take center stage in the sequel, but who's going to be trying to fix who?\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux is out October 4. Fans got a peak at the romance musical earlier this year with a teaser trailer and reporting that suggested the movie would be centered around over a dozen well-known songs remixed for the Gotham-based comic book movie. The new trailer gives a better sense of the movie's setup, how Harley and the Joker meet up, and the retro show biz-styled chaos that will ensue.\n\nTake a look:\n\nIncarcerated in Arkham Hospital after his rampage at the end of the first movie, Arthur Fleck and Harleen Quinzel begin indulging one another's delusions of stardom while civil unrest boils up among disillusioned gangs of Jokerfied fans. The trailer ends with Joker and Harley on stage asking one another if they should give the audience what they want before blowing up the theater.\n\nIt's possibly a meta-nod to the tension between what comic books fans might want from a Joker movie and director Todd Phillips ambitions in making what some insiders have referred to as a \"Jukebox musical\" structured more around vignettes and then overarching story. But the highlight for me was seeing Brendan Gleeson show up as a prison guard chiding a smirking Phoenix.\n\n2019's Joker was a massive box office hit, bringing in over $1 billion worldwide despite its small budget. It hit at just the right time to give people fatigued from overdosing on the cookie-cutter MCU a different take on a comic book character origin movie, while also tapping into a lot of popular mythmaking populist undercurrents and anti-establishment sentiments during the first Trump presidency.

He begins to cackle as a voice on the radio dubs him \"some kind of martyr,\" and he is quickly proved wrong by finding a partner in crime (literally). Arthur eventually strikes up a romantic bond with Harleen Quinzel (Gaga), a fellow patient who, judging by her penchant for the institution's piano, harbors musical talents that enchant her new love interest. She even gently sings lyrics from \"Get Happy\" (the classic tune from 1952's Singin' in the Rain) as a means to inspire her man before they unleash their reign of terror on the urban cityscape.\n\n\"When I first saw Joker, when I saw you, for once in my life, I didn't feel so alone anymore,\" Harley says in the preview before shattering a store window and stealing a television set. Things get worse as the preview progresses, with Joker and Harley feeding off of each other's madness, and Arthur dialing up the violence in his ongoing trial for the crimes he committed in the first film. The clip eventually shows Joker holding a mallet and using it to smash the judge's head.\n\nTuesday's new trailer for director Todd Phillips' Joker sequel arrived just under four months after the studio unveiled the first teaser for the project in April, which re-introduced the Academy Award-winning Phoenix as the beloved character he first played in 2019's Joker, as well as shepherding Gaga's take on Harley Quinn into the DC arena.\n\nIn that clip -- soundtracked by \"What the World Needs Now Is Love\" -- the pair wreak havoc on Gotham City amid an aesthetic that recalls movie musicals of the past, from The Umbrellas of Cherbourg to touches of La La Land. Also in the preview, glistening stage lights spell out the title of a (potentially imagined) variety show called Joker & Harley, where many of the duo's \"dream ballet\"-style performances might culminate. The footage ends with a particularly haunting shot of Harley drawing the Joker's signature bright red lips over a glass panel separating prisoners from their visitors.\n\nPhillips previously elaborated on the new movie's tone at CinemaCon earlier this year, telling attendees that \"it's a film where music is an essential element\" that \"doesn't veer too far from the first film\" in that regard.\n\n\"Arthur [Fleck]'s weird and aloof and all these things, but he has music in him. He has a grace to him. That informed a lot of the dancing in the first film,\" he continued. \"It didn't feel like that big of a step here. It's different, but I think it'll make sense when you see it.\"\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nAhead of the teaser's debut, Warner Bros. dropped an official preview of Oscar winner Gaga's voice as Harley, with her vocal intonation contrasting other actresses' interpretations of the character in the past. The villainess is typically shown to have a thick Brooklyn accent -- most notably, perhaps, by Batman: The Animated Series voice actress Arleen Sorkin, who originated the character for her official DC debut in the TV show as Joker's love interest.\n\nMargot Robbie continued the trend with her foray into the DC Extended Universe's live-action projects, such as the Suicide Squad films and Birds of Prey, while Kaley Cuoco also voiced Harley with an accent in the Max animated series Harley Quinn.\n\nUpon its release in 2019, the first Joker film received widespread commercial and critical success, earning over $1 billion at the global box office and scoring 11 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Phoenix won his first Academy Award for playing the titular role, and his follow-up performance (as well as Gaga's) has already landed among early awards contender lists.", "source": {"uri": "ew.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Entertainment Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gotham (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin'_in_the_Rain_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Singin' in the Rain (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamics_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dynamics (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Record chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_La_Land_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "La La Land (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_World_Needs_Now_Is_Love", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "What the World Needs Now Is Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Musical film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aesthetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaley_Cuoco", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kaley Cuoco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arleen_Sorkin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arleen Sorkin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Robbie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margot Robbie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ew.com/thmb/Ix-wdhcVjydJNn_NFwjDR9o-L_8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/joker-tout-072324-df3c478491864c57b9995bd883bd046b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Now Arthur Fleck, this universe's Joker, is a high-profile resident of Arkham Asylum and comes across therapist Harleen Quinzel (Lady Gaga). We got our first look at the feature back in April, but we go all out with the bad romance here.\n\nThe trailer shows a musical mayhem murder tour as the couple falls in love and experiences shared delusions. Harleen slowly loses her own grip on reality and becomes the Joker's lover and accomplice. Since his murder of talk show host Murray Franklin, Fleck/Joker has been put on a pillar by those who consider themselves disenfranchised, with some of the movie centering around his trial. Check it out below.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips is returning as well as co-writing and producing the film. The sequel was officially announced in 2022, after a few years of Phillips saying he had no intention of developing one, but once the box office hit, it almost became inevitable. The first Joker film was intended as a standalone feature outside of the then DCEU, and used to launch DC Black. That label was rebranded DC Elseworlds under the DC Studios banner.\n\nThe first film's budget was reportedly somewhere in the $50-70 million range, but with the sequel, it's expanded to an estimated $200 million, which might explain the elaborate dance and musical numbers.\n\nAlso returning is Zazie Beetz who reprises her role from the previous film as Arthur's neighbor, as well as Leigh Gill and Sharon Washington returning as clown co-worker Gary and Arthur's social worker, respectively. Meanwhile, Brendan Gleeson, Catherine Keener, Jacob Lofland, Steve Coogan, Ken Leung, and Harry Lawtey have been cast in unannounced roles.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux is scheduled to hit theaters on October 2, with its international release, and October 4 for the United States.", "source": {"uri": "gamespot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GameSpot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lan_pitts@gamespot.com", "name": "Lan Pitts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Universe_(franchise)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DC Universe (franchise)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Studios", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DC Studios"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Lawtey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Lawtey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Extended_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DC Extended Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lofland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jacob Lofland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Leung", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ken Leung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folie_\u00e0_deux", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Folie \u00e0 deux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Keener", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catherine Keener"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Coogan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Coogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazie_Beetz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zazie Beetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Studios", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/1597/15976769/4337170-gtgahm_wqae0epd.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-02", "textStart": 2004, "textEnd": 2013}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-04", "textStart": 2051, "textEnd": 2060}], "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

A first teaser for Joker: Folie A Deux, released back in April, already teased a bit about what we could expect from the forthcoming sequel to Todd Phillips' 2019 film: Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) meets Harleen Quinn in an asylum sometime after the events of the first film. But now, with the reveal of the official trailer this morning, we have a slightly more of an idea of what the plot -- and the multiple musical numbers -- is all about.\n\nAfter this morning's announcement that Folie \u00c0 Deux will premiere at this year's Venice Film Festival, Warner Bros. has released a new trailer that is, truthfully, pretty similar to the first one. Gaga calls Phoenix \"Joker\" twice while he performs a country lawyer routine in front of a courtroom. They sing Stevie Wonder and Judy Garland while \"When You're Smiling\" scores the trailer proper, and they resolve to give the people what they want.\n\nThe 2019 Joker was objectively successful, even if its artistic merits are debatable. After that film also premiered at the Venice Film Festival, Phoenix went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actor -- the second performer to win an Oscar for portraying the Joker -- while the film itself sparked a brief panic over whether screenings of the film would lead to real-world violence. While that didn't exactly happen, given the near-constant state of gun violence in the United States, it's hard to call the concern completely unfounded, even if the politics in the actual film are too vague and confused to inspire much of anything.", "source": {"uri": "avclub.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The A.V.

In the just-released full trailer for the sequel set two years after 2019's Joker, infamous comedian-turned-criminal Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) is awaiting trial for his riot-inciting crimes as the Joker. Institutionalized at Arkham Asylum, Gotham City's clown-painted folk hero turns the televised \"trial of the century\" into a media circus when the future Batman arch-nemesis finds an accomplice -- and a shared psychosis -- in fellow patient Harleen Quinzel (Lady Gaga).\n\nBut the proto-Harley Quinn isn't the only Bat-villain debuting in director Todd Phillips' gritty and grounded DC universe. When watched with closed captioning, the Joker 2 trailer reveals that Harvey Dent -- Gotham City's crusading, law-abiding district attorney who eventually becomes the disfigured criminal Two-Face -- is prosecuting the Arthur Fleck trial.\n\nGotham's legion of pro-Joker protestors \"believe Arthur Fleck to be some kind of martyr,\" Dent intones in voiceover. \"Well, he's not. He's a monster.\"\n\nIndustry and The Pale Blue Eye actor Harry Lawtey (below) is playing the Joker version of Harvey Dent, who has appeared in live-action in 1989's Batman (played by Billy Dee Williams), 1995's Batman Forever (played by Tommy Lee Jones), and 2008's The Dark Knight (played by Aaron Eckhart).\n\nMost versions of the character depict Dent as suffering a psychotic break after half his face is horribly scarred by a criminal's attack. (In the Christopher Nolan-directed The Dark Knight, it's the Joker himself who drives Dent mad.) Dent is also rumored for the upcoming The Batman Part II -- the second chapter of Matt Reeves' standalone \"Epic Crime Saga\" that includes The Penguin -- with Josh Hartnett (Oppenheimer, Trap) and Joel Edgerton (Obi-Wan Kenobi, Dark Matter) the reported frontrunners for the iconic role.\n\nJoker: Folie \u00c0 Deux also stars Oscar nominees Brendan Gleeson (The Banshees of Inisherin) and Catherine Keener (Get Out), alongside Zazie Beetz (Deadpool 2), reprising her Joker role as Sophie Dumond, and Jacob Lofland (Mud), Steve Coogan (Philomena), and Ken Leung (X-Men: The Last Stand) in undisclosed roles. The movie opens only in theaters October 4th.", "source": {"uri": "comicbook.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comicbook"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Harley Quinn found and renovated the hideout for the Joker in 1999's Batman: Harley Quinn #1 , adding thematic clown decor and more to make it Joker's own. The Sanctum of Sanity was mainly used during the No Man's Land arc for gathering forces and torturing enemies, with it eventually being blown up for good.\n\nThe Batcave is one of the most iconic aspects of Batman's comic book lore, with the character's arch nemesis, the Joker, shacking up in his fair share of hideouts over the years in his never-ending quest to make Batman's life a living hell. Never staying in one place for too long, Joker once received his own version of the Batcave, complete with a name and location that fit the Joker's sadistic brand of villainy well.\n\nAn iconic DC Comics location that acts as Batman's home base, the Batcave gives Gotham's protector the space and means to build his signature gizmos and gadgets as well as plan his next move against the likes of the Joker, with the Clown Prince of Crime similarly needing places he can hole-up in to develop his latest scheme against his heroic counterpart.\n\nIn 1999's Batman: Harley Quinn #1, by Paul Dini and Yvel Guichet, Joker finally gets a hideout that rivals the Batcave -- dubbed the \"Sanctum of Sanity\" -- an at-the-time brand new lair located in Gotham's abandoned amusement park.\n\nRelated\n\nJoker Would Have Been Killed Off if the Second Robin Jason Todd Had Lived, DC Confirms\n\nDC Comics takes a look at a world where Jason Todd survived Joker's attack and reveals this timeline would have led to the killer clown's death.\n\nThe Joker's \"Sanctum of Sanity\" Hideout Was Renovated by Harley Quinn\n\nBatman: Harley Quinn #1 - 1999 (Paul Dini and Yvel Guichet)\n\nSet during Batman's devastating No Man's Land story arc, this issue also acts as the canon debut of Harley Quinn, with her presence being the entire reason Joker received his Batcave in the first place. After reintroducing herself to Joker as his newest henchman, Harley decides to impress Joker so he'll spend more time with her and takes it upon herself to search for and then find a new base for him. Creating a hidden lair inside an old amusement park's Tunnel of Love, Harley brands this new semi-permanent hideout Joker's Sanctum of Sanity, a place that's obviously anything but.\n\nRemodeling and retrofitting the dwelling to Mr. J's liking, Harley chooses the perfect name for Joker's Batcave, as the Sanctum of Sanity implies that Joker thinks he's the only one who sees the real \"truth\" of the world, passing off his insanity as nothing unusual. Filled with enough thematic clown decor to make the place undeniably Joker's, this Sanctum was mainly utilized during No Man's Land and was a hideout used to gather Joker's forces and to torture those that he didn't like, with its partial destruction at the end of the issue leading to its full-on leveling later on.\n\nThe Joker's Version of the Batcave Was Located in a Carnival's Tunnel of Love\n\nSo while this specific version of Joker's \"Batcave\" didn't last all that long in the grand scheme of the DC Universe, the fact that Harley Quinn -- in her official first appearance, no less -- was an integral part of making it happen is a fun fact that DC fans need to know about. It'll be interesting to see if the Joker will ever get a new \"Sanctum of Sanity\" in comics, but if he does, he'll need to up his game in even more ways than what was shown here, as Batman and his Batcave never cease to impress.\n\nThe Joker\n\nCreated By Bill Finger , Bob Kane , Jerry Robinson\n\nFirst Appearance Batman (1940)\n\nAlias Arthur Fleck\n\nAlliance Injustice League, Legion of Doom, Injustice Gang\n\nFranchise D.C.", "source": {"uri": "screenrant.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ScreenRant"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_colucci@screenrant.com", "name": "Brian Colucci", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batcave_(club)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batcave (club)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_man's_land", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "No man's land"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Clown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusement_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amusement park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gotham (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genius"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dini", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paul Dini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canon (fiction)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadistic_personality_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sadistic personality disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prince (musician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Story_arc", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Story arc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Finger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Finger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bob Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Robinson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Robinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Doom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legion of Doom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alias (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DC Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carnival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torture"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Motorcycles", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Retailers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Performers", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Performers", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Fan Pages", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/joker-in-the-batcave-and-smiling.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1999-01-", "textStart": 1884, "textEnd": 1892}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

The two seem to bond fast, with Harley sharing how much she admires him. The trailer also shows off a musical vibe for the series, showing Gaga and Phoenix singing a version of \"What The World Needs Know Is Love.\" It also features plenty of moments where the two are seen dancing alone and together, likely as a part of a shared delusion.\n\nDirector Todd Phillips shared that while the movie wasn't a musical, its score was important. \"We never really talked about it like that, but I like to say it's a film where music is an essential element,\" he said in an appearance at CinemaCon. \"To me, that doesn't veer too far from the first film.\"\n\n\"Arthur's weird and aloof and all these things, but he has music in him. He has a grace to him. That informed a lot of the dancing in the first film... it didn't feel like that big of a step here. It's different, but I think it'll make sense when you see it.\"\n\nYou can watch the full trailer below.\n\n\"Joker: Folie A Deux\" is one of this year's most awaited releases.

While it isn't clear if the young Wayne will return for the sequel, Joker: Folie a Deux, the latest trailer confirmed another infamous resident of Gotham will be appearing as the city wrestles with the long-awaited trial of Arthur Fleck.\n\nBelieve in Harvey Dent\n\nThe second trailer for Joker: Folie a Deux provides a better insight into the film, with Fleck's trial setting the stage for the mad romance that will unfold between him and Harleen Quinzel that appears to begin inside the walls of Arkham before spilling out into the streets of Gotham. It also provided looks at some of the supporting cast populating the sequel including Brendan Gleeson's Arkham security guard, a psychiatrist portrayed by Steve Coogan, and none other than Gotham's famed district attorney-turned-crime lord Harvey Dent, though it is not as clear who is portraying Dent.\n\nDent's inclusion in Joker: Folie a Deux was noticed by the DiscussingFilm X account, which shared an image of the trailer with subtitles that reveal Dent as one of the voices other than Fleck or Quinn that audiences hear early in the trailer.\n\nHis comments about Fleck's followers viewing him as a \"martyr\" instead of the \"monster\" he is hints that he could end up being the DA assigned to Fleck's trial in the film, itself. If this ends up being the case, audiences could end up seeing this director Todd Phillips' take on the origin of Two-Face.\n\nIn the comics, Harvey Dent was introduced as a Gotham City district attorney trying to prosecute infamous mob boss Sal Maroni when the mobster throws acid on Dent's face. The incident leaves half of Dent's face horribly scarred and disfigured, damage made only worse psychologically by the repulsion from society and even his own wife. It would ultimately lead Dent to a life of crime, becoming one of the most notorious crime bosses in Gotham City and one of Batman's most persistent, dangerous, and unstable foes.\n\nDent's character would be tweaked over the decades as the public learned more about mental health, with the villain becoming more of an allegory for dissociative identity disorder by presenting Dent and Two-Face as two entirely unique personalities.\n\nFrom Comic to Screen\n\nOn screen, Joker: Folie a Deux will mark the third time Dent has graced the big screen in some fashion.\n\nThe first came in 1995's Batman Forever, with Tommy Lee Jones serving as the film's iteration of Two-Face. While the film was a success, Jones' performance was a common point of criticism as many critics felt it was over-the-top and leaned closer to being a knockoff of The Joker.\n\nAaron Eckhart's performance as Harvey Dent in 2008's The Dark Knight, by comparison, was just one of many performances praised by critics at the time of release. He is shown to be a charismatic, fighting district attorney who is ultimately brought down to Joker and Batman's \"level\" due to the death of Rachel Dawes, with Dent ultimately succumbing to the idea that life is simply a game of chance and everyone has the same odds - 50/50.\n\nJoker: Folie a Deux is scheduled to release in theaters on October 4, 2024.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_billings@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Kevin Billings", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Dent_(1989_film_series_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Dent (1989 film series character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gotham (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_City_(song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gotham City (song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Wayne_(Gotham)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bruce Wayne (Gotham)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Coogan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Coogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Gleeson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brendan Gleeson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Security guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boss (video games)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_boss", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crime boss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/37th_Annual_Grammy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "37th Annual Grammy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Dawes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rachel Dawes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dissociative identity disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Eckhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Eckhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_Forever_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batman Forever (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batman in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Lee_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Lee Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gangster"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Joker-2-trailer-confirms-major-Batman-character-appearance.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

And watching these two beautifully bizarre people assume these iconic roles in the latest trailer from Warner Bros. Pictures is an absolute thrill.\n\nIt is almost impossible to tell from the trailer where the story will go in this second chapter, though Joker's fame is introduced from the off. We hear radio announcers describing the way his actions against Gotham have split the people, with some thinking he's a \"monster,\" the others seeing him as a \"martyr.\" (RELATED: Lady Gaga Has Young Girl Puke On Her Chest In Resurfaced Video)\n\n\"Failed comedian Arthur Fleck meets the love of his life, Harley Quinn, while incarcerated at Arkham State Hospital. Upon his release, the two of them embark on a doomed romantic misadventure,\" says IMDB. But my gut says we're in store for a pretty hefty twist somewhere along the way.\n\nGaga's Harley Quinn is chilling. She is the girl we all avoided in the cafeteria because we knew she'd be dangerous. She seems far from the Nancy to Phoenix's Sid Vicious. In anything, she seems like she'll be an inspiring force in whatever horror comes next.\n\nAside from Gaga's prowess and Phoenix's derangement, the cinematography for \"Joker: Folie \u00c0 Deux\" looks superb.

The official trailer for the movie \"Joker: Madness for Two\"", "body": "The official trailer for the second part of The Joker movie, starring the irreplaceable Joaquin Phoenix, has been released online. The plot of the story will revolve around the love story of the Joker and Harley Quinn, played by the eccentric singer and actress Lady Gaga. The film is scheduled to premiere on October 4, 2024.\n\nThe movie will be titled The Joker: Madness for Two\". The sequel will be a continuation of the first film about the villain from Gotham, the city ruled by Batman. In the new film, there will be two antagonists, which will create madness on the screen. Variety writes that the film will take place mostly in an asylum in the American city of Arkham.\n\nThe idea to create a sequel appeared after the successful release of the first part of The Joker. In 2019, the film won 11 Oscars, and Joaquin Phoenix won Best Actor. In particular, The Joker became the highest-grossing movie with an R-rating. It earned more than $1 billion during its release.\n\nRumor has it that the sequel will be in the genre of a musical. This is also evidenced by the Joker's singing on the trailer soundtrack and his performance on stage with Harley Quinn.\n\n\"I think people will be surprised. I don't think it's going to be what they expect in terms of music. We all express ourselves musically and dance in our lives every day. I think it will work very well,\" said actress Zazie Beetz, who plays the role of Sophie Dumont in the film.\n\nIt is known that this movie will be separated from the DC world, similar to Superman, and will exist in a separate world. This is also indicated by the absence of Margot Robbie in the role of Harley Quinn, which she played in Suicide Squad and Birds of Prey.\n\nEarlier, OBOZ.UA wrote that Madonna unexpectedly appeared at the premiere of the movie Deadpool and Wolverine with her adopted twin daughters. Ryan Reynolds' film will be released on July 25, and the 65-year-old singer, who took part in its creation, was able to watch the movie earlier.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Obozrevatel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gotham (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batman (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_film_rating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motion Picture Association film rating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Award for Best Actor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antagonist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antagonist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_Squad_(soundtrack)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide Squad (soundtrack)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madonna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_Prey_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Birds of Prey (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superman in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundtrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soundtrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margot_Robbie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Margot Robbie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zazie_Beetz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zazie Beetz"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Trivia", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2.obozrevatel.com/news/2024/7/23/znimok-ekrana-2024-07-23-163049.png?size=2010x1050", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 1882, "textEnd": 1889}], "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

The Clown Captain of Crime's outfit embraces a maritime theme with naval flair to match his extravagant vessel. Batman reveals Joker's major weakness in an intense boat chase scene.\n\nWARNING: Contains Potential Spoilers for From the DC Vault: Death in the Family - Robin Lives #1!The Joker has officially set sail for mayhem on his new boat, which is as gaudy as the Clown Prince of Crime himself. This is no surprise, considering that his water vessel is self-themed, showcasing his egomaniac tendencies. Along with his new ride, the Joker also debuts a costume befitting the high seas, making a strong case for changing his nickname to the Clown Captain of Crime.\n\nDC has just revealed that a sure way to defeat the Joker is to push him into a body of water and wait for him to drown.\n\nJ. M. DeMatteis, Rick Leonardi, and Rico Renzi's From the DC Vault: Death in the Family - Robin Lives #1 is a new miniseries that explores what would have happened if Batman's second Robin, Jason Todd, hadn't been voted by fans to be killed off by the Joker.\n\nAlthough Jason survives in this series, he is still brutalized by the clown. Consequently, Batman tracks down the Joker to seek justice and retribution for Jason. This pursuit leads to an intense boat chase between the Dark Knight and the clown, revealing the Joker's themed boat, which rivals all of Batman's bat-themed vehicles when it comes to staying on brand.\n\nRelated DC's ROBIN LIVES Series Answers a Massive Fan Question: What If Jason Todd Survived?\n\nDC has announced a four-issue ROBIN LIVES! miniseries that explores the aftermath of Jason Todd's Joker encounter -- only this time, Robin survived.\n\nJoker Debuts His Self-Themed Boat in From the DC Vault: Death in the Family - Robin Lives #1\n\nJoker's boat stays true to his theme with an explosion of his signature colors-green and purple-and a loud design. The water vessel features a larger-than-life figurehead of Joker at its bow, showcasing his classic green hair, white skin, purple suit, blood-red smile, and a gun in hand. Besides the figurehead, the most notable design element is the flag, which displays an image of his frequent partner in crime, Harley Quinn. However, Harley wasn't introduced until 1992 in Batman: The Animated Series, while the Death in the Family storyline took place in 1988, four years before her creation.\n\nRelated Harley Quinn's First Comic Appearance: Everything Fans Need To Know\n\nHarley Quinn has come a long way since her debut decades ago, with her first comic appearance being a unique one thanks to her TV-based origins.\n\nComplementing his extravagant boat, Joker embraces the maritime theme by forsaking his usual purple suit for an outfit more befitting of a Clown Captain of Crime. His ensemble includes stereotypical attire reminiscent of military sea captains, sporting a bicorn captain's hat, a Naval Jacket adorned with large brass buttons, epaulets, and shoulder boards that denote his supposedly high rank. Joker's purple and green uniform is further embellished with various medals and decorations, making it as ornate as possible and the perfect accessory to his boat.\n\nJoker's Boat Scene Reveals the Gotham Rogue Has 1 Major Weakness\n\nJoker's attire and boat provide a humorous touch to the scene, alongside the intense confrontation with Batman. Additionally, this encounter also reveals an unexpected vulnerability -- the Clown Prince of Crime can't swim. Fueled by his emotions, Batman doesn't hold back, ramming Joker's boat with his own speedboat. The impact sends the clown plummeting into the water, where he begins to drown until Superman arrives to rescue him. Hence, DC has just revealed that a sure way to defeat the Joker is to push him into a body of water and wait for him to drown.\n\nRelated DC Officially Reveals the Price on Joker's Head, But It Makes No Sense\n\nDC has officially put a price on Joker's head, yet the reward money is so insultingly low that even the Clown Prince of Crime would be offended.\n\n3\n\nFrom the DC Vault: Death in the Family - Robin Lives #1 is available now from DC Comics!\n\nFROM THE DC VAULT: DEATH IN THE FAMILY - ROBIN LIVES #1 (2024)\n\nWriter: J.

Joker: 2 received its second trailer, and with it, more insight into the blossoming relationship between Joaquin Phoenix's Joker and Lady Gaga's Harley Quinn.\n\nOf course, Harley and Joker's relationship is complicated, no matter the medium. Despite their trademark toxicity and chaos, their origin story as a couple remains relatively stable across comics, TV, and film. The Batman Adventures: Mad Love laid the foundation, which depicted psychiatrist Harleen Quinzel -- a doctor eager to exploit Arkham Asylum's residents for a tell-all book -- falling under the romantic and manipulative spell of her patient, the Joker.\n\nInterestingly, both Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux trailers depict Harley as a fellow Arkham Asylum patient, smitten and inspired by Joker's anarchy in the previous movie. However, a sneaky Easter Egg may back up the popular theory that this version of Harley Quinn isn't exactly what she seems.\n\nAt timestamp 0:58, Joker watches what appears to be the Pep\u00e9 Le Pew cartoon from the '40s before breaking into a love song. It's a brief moment, but it may hold symbolic significance. In most episodes, Pep\u00e9 Le Pew's unwavering and (let's just call it what it is) disturbing pursuit of romance sees him lusting after a black cat he mistakes as a fellow skunk because of a white stripe of paint on her tail. Pep\u00e9 assumes the \"fellow skunk\" won't be put off by his odor, but he's mistaken, and the black cat frantically flees from him just like all his other love interests.\n\nIt might sound like a leap for an old Warner Bros. cartoon to hold so much significance, but movies don't typically put things in the background that mean nothing. It's possible that Pep\u00e9 Le Pew is a clue about Joker's relationship with Harley. Like Pep\u00e9, he might think she's a fellow patient who will understand him, but in reality, she could be a psychiatrist masquerading as a patient to get close to Joker. Perhaps the storyline even riffs on The Batman Adventures: Mad Love, with Harley's motivations to play patient fueled by the opportunity to get up close and personal with Joker for a tell-all exclusive.\n\nThe twist might fly a little close to Shutter Island, but it's one fans wouldn't be overly surprised by. Given Harley's known origin story, many suspect there is more than meets the eye when it comes to Phillips' take on the character. That said, Phillips has completely revamped what little is known about Joker, so he may do the same with what has become one of DC's most notorious romances.", "source": {"uri": "themarysue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mary Sue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeanette_white@themarysue.com", "name": "Jeanette White", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep\u00e9_Le_Pew", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pep\u00e9 Le Pew"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Batman_Adventures:_Mad_Love", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Batman Adventures: Mad Love"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Psychiatrist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trademark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_cat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Black cat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anarchy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_egg_(media)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Easter egg (media)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romance film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skunk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_story", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Origin story"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cartoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romanticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_Island", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shutter Island"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic_Strips_and_Panels", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic Strips and Panels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Lady-Gaga-Joaquin-Phoenix-Joker-Folie-a-Deux.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

But DC's lone release this year will pack a punch: \"Joker: Folie a Deux,\" aka \"Joker 2,\" is coming down the pipeline in October. As the sequel to the biggest R-rated movie in cinema history, all eyes are on this one. And not just because Joaquin Phoenix is back as Arthur Fleck, but because Lady Gaga is playing Harley Quinn as well. To add to the intrigue, it looks like another classic DC Comics villain is going to be involved in the proceedings.\n\nA new full-length trailer for \"Joker: Folie a Deux\" dropped today, which offers a better sense of the musical-driven chaos that director Todd Phillips is bringing to the sequel. The captions contain a pretty big reveal that comes early on, as a voice heard off-screen is credited to none other than Gotham City's own Harvey Dent. This, of course, is the man who eventually becomes Two-Face, one of Batman's most notorious foes.\n\n\"They believe Arthur Fleck to be some kind of martyr. Well, he's not. He's a monster,\" Dent says in the trailer. We never actually get a look at the actor, so it's anyone's guess as to who is playing Dent, though Harry Lawtey (\"The Pale Blue Eye\") is in the film, very much looks the part, and his role has yet to be revealed. That's pure speculation at this point, but whether it's Lawtey or someone else, a classic DC villain is joining the \"Joker\" universe.\n\nThis will be the first time an actor has played the role in a live-action film since Aaron Eckhart in 2008's \"The Dark Knight.\" Misha Collins recently played the part in the short-lived \"Gotham Knights\" series on The CW, while Nicholas D'Agosto brought the character to life on Fox's \"Gotham.\" But Harvey Dent/Two-Face has been absent from the big screen for some time.", "source": {"uri": "slashfilm.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slashfilm"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadpool (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_in_other_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joker in other media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marvel Cinematic Universe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comic book"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Dent_(1989_film_series_character)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harvey Dent (1989 film series character)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harley_Quinn_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harley Quinn (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Villain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pale_Blue_Eye", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Pale Blue Eye"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_Knights_(video_game)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gotham Knights (video game)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_CW", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The CW"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_D'Agosto", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicholas D'Agosto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Eckhart", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Eckhart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotham_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gotham (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misha_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Misha Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_in_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batman in film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Live_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Live action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fictional universe"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic_Strips_and_Panels", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Comic Strips and Panels", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/youtube-may-have-just-spoiled-the-secret-dc-comics-villain-in-joker-2/l-intro-1721752458.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

With a new trailer, released this Tuesday, July 23, the second part of the Batman villain film gives a taste of the action, music, show and romance that will reign in the installment.\n\nIts arrival in theaters, scheduled for October 03, will offer fans of the actor and the character the acceptance of madness and anger that will bring nothing but chaos to Gotham City. The clip, which lasts just over two and a half minutes, finally shows the powerful connection that the protagonist villains will experience while love blossoms during the \"trial of the century.\"\n\nLady Gaga in her debut as Harley Quinn gives clues that in the feature film she will be seen singing, dancing and even playing the piano. She has a crucial role on her shoulders as she will motivate the Joker to accept and embrace her twisted personality. She will make him come out of his shell and face justice in a war that will reveal the risk behind power and the birth of false prophets.\n\nAccording to some data revealed, the film will be more risky, raw and violent than the first. There is talk that there will be full nudity and more than 15 musical numbers, as well as philosophical and existentialist speeches. They already made their debut in 2019 but return to promote the transition and maturity of Arthur Fleck / Joker in his character. However, the aesthetics of an author's film and not a superhero film will be maintained.\n\nIntimate and realistic 'Joker: folie a deux' promises a kind of treatise on madness. The martyr-monster duality will be key in the villain's obsession with believing himself to be God. Its duration will be 150 minutes with violence represented on stage and offensive speech.\n\nThe synopsis determines that after the criminal events and murders of the first film, the Joker must undergo a trial that will generate great expectations. At the doors of the courthouse, riots will be the order of the day as his popularity grows.\n\nLikewise, his time at the Arkham psychiatric hospital for criminals will be followed, where he will meet Harley Quinn. In the plot development, the character's twisted psyche will be shredded in search of the bottom of his madness.\n\nThe complicity of its scriptwriters with its director Todd Philips advances the hypothesis that it will be something extraordinary and incredible. \"Okay baby, let's give the people what they want,\" Harley Quinn warns in the trailer before giving way to the overwhelming chaos.

While there, he meets Quinn, and the pair embark on a whimsical and darkly chaotic musical journey that leaves viewers wondering what's real and what's imagined.\n\n\"When I first saw Joker -- when I saw you -- for once in my life, I didn't feel so alone anymore,\" Gaga says in a voice-over as she breaks through the glass of a store's display window to steal a TV airing footage of Fleck in a jail cell.\n\nThe video then cuts to clips of mobs swarming a courthouse to protest the Joker's imprisonment, and Fleck, fueled by the public's support, defending himself in court. All the while, he and Quinn waltz to Frank Sinatra's eerily cheerful \"When You're Smiling\" in both glamorous outfits and tattered clothes. The end culminates in the two characters hosting a 1960s-esque variety show, both wearing their signature clown face paint.\n\n\"I got the sneaking suspicion we're not giving the people what they want,\" Joker says into an old-fashioned microphone, to which Quinn replies, \"It's OK, baby -- let's give the people what they want.\"\n\nThe 13-time Grammy winner was first confirmed to star in Folie \u00c0 Deux -- which serves as a sequel to 2019's Joker -- in August 2022. The following April, photos surfaced of Gaga in her creepy costume filming musical scenes in New York City.\n\nThe trailer arrives one day after Gaga was spotted in Paris, fueling rumors that she's performing at the 2024 Olympics opening ceremony. She's also in the process of working on new music, having recently shared photos from the studio captioned, \"Happy as ever making music ... feel so grateful, heart is peaceful. It's like meditation.

Director Todd Phillips and Oscar winner Joaquin Phoenix returning to this unforgettable character, with the addition of Lady Gaga, just seems like a winning combination. And though the film won't open in theaters until October 4, one person who has seen it confirms all that and more.\n\nIn addition to today's release of the new trailer, the prestigious Venice Film Festival announced Joker: Folie \u00c3 Deux will be among the films screening at the festival. And, the festival's chief Alberto Barbera spoke to Deadline about how impressed he was with the Joker sequel.\n\n\"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a continuation of the story but the film is completely different from the first film,\" Barbera said. \"If you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expecting the same in terms of violence or other things, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll be surprised. When I saw the film in LA at the beginning of February there were four or five of us in the screening room, including writer Scott Silver, and we were astonished, our mouths were open at the end of the screening. It is a darker film.\"\n\n\"A darker film\" is saying something because that first movie is pretty freaking dark. Plus, isn't this sequel supposed to be a musical? Aren't musicals usually the antithesis of dark? \"It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a dystopian musical, or a musical of sorts,\" Barbera continued. \"I think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s one of the most daring, brave, and creative films in recent American cinema. And I think it really confirms Todd Phillips as one of the most creative directors working at the moment.\"\n\nLet's read that back again. \"One of the most daring, brave and creative films in recent American cinema.\" If that guy was a critic, and not promoting his own film festival, Warner Bros. could stop the marketing now and just run with that. Of course, that won't be happening, but it certainly has us even more intrigued about what's coming this fall.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "germain_lussier@gizmodo.com", "name": "Germain Lussier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joker (The Dark Knight)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joaquin_Phoenix", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joaquin Phoenix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Gaga", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lady Gaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Venice Film Festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sequel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Trailer (promotion)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Academy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Todd Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DC Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Silver", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scott Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dystopia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Warner Bros."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_festival", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Film festival"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_theatre", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Musical theatre"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film_Festivals", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Film Festivals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Genres", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory_and_Criticism", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Theory and Criticism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-23-at-12.54.20\u00e2\u20ac\u00afPM-e1721764578500.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9753530", "eventUri": "eng-9753530", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-10-04", "textStart": 56, "textEnd": 65, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

I'm definitely watching this.\"\n\nThe last time Dent appeared in a live-action Batman film was when he was brilliantly played by Aaron Eckhart in The Dark Knight.\n\nAnother fan said: \"The introduction of Harvey Dent adds a fascinating layer to the narrative.\"\n\nWith the film set to be a jukebox musical according to reports from Variety, some think this will suit the character to a tee.\n\nOne reply said: \"Cool, hope he sings with two different voices while shimmying to the side showing both different sides of his face\".\n\nWhilst the actor playing the role has not been confirmed, there are rumours already flying about who could take on the multi-dimensional character.\n\nThe leading theory is that Harry Lawtey, who came to prominence for his role in Industry, will play the role.\n\nWhilst Lawtey has been announced as part of the supporting cast for the film, he has not yet appeared in any of the trailers.

This has been an issue for as long as I can remember. I'm sure there is some test audience data that they assume reflects every human being on Earth. That data likely explains that people lose interest in a film when the characters start singing. However, instead of not making musicals (which would be dumb), studios tend to hide the musicality of a movie.\n\nThis tactic makes for some truly strange trailers. You will characters dancing and opening their mouths like they're singing. You won't hear any musical numbers from the movie. Instead, it will be stock songs to give the illusion that, perhaps, the movie isn't a musical but a fun time. Then, audiences attend the film and are distraught to learn that they were, essentially, tricked.\n\nRecent movies like Wonka and Mean Girls The Musical fell victim to this trend. I just want to reiterate that last example. A film with \"The Musical\" in the title was marketed as if it wasn't a musical or, at the very least, didn't use any of its own music for promotion. Audiences did not handle it well. Now, it looks as though Warner Brothers Discovery might make the same mistake.\n\nJoker Folie \u00c0 Deux, the sequel to the 2019 Joaquin Phoenix starring Joker, is a musical. It is a jukebox musical, yes, but a musical nonetheless. There will be singing and dancing in the follow-up to a film that angry dweebs and dufuses have based their whole personalities around. They may not know that if they watch the new trailer. Yes, Lady Gaga is in the movie, but the trailer does not present something that looks like a musical.\n\nThey tease the musicality of the film. We do see characters singing. There is a moment where Joker and Harley Quinn sing to each other! But, they are all muted and could be chalked up to weirdness before anything else. The response to this film will be intriguing. Last time, people thought its anarchistic messaging may cause violence.

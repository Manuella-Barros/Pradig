A small subset of religious persons, hermits mostly spend their lives engaged in quiet prayer.\n\nBrother Christian Matson, a Catholic diocesan hermit in Kentucky, has spent years doing just that. His monk's habit might catch his neighbor's eye, but he is known in the town where he lives primarily through his work with the local theater.\n\nBut recently Matson decided that his faith compels him to make a little more noise than usual.\n\n\"This Sunday, Pentecost 2024, I'm planning to come out publicly as transgender,\" Matson told Religion News Service on Friday (May 17), saying he was speaking out with the permission of his bishop, John Stowe of the Diocese of Lexington in Kentucky.\n\n___\n\nThis content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press. RNS and AP partner on some religion news content. RNS is solely responsible for this story.\n\n___\n\nMatson, who is also a Benedictine oblate, believes he is the first openly transgender person in his position in the Catholic Church. It is a difficult claim to confirm -- even Stowe told RNS he did not know for sure if Matson is the first -- but Matson's status is at least highly unusual and comes at a time when church officials are grappling with how to address transgender Catholics.\n\nAccording to Matson, 39, his \"disclosing,\" as he describes it, is a moment years in the making. He offered his story as indicative of the often difficult path for trans Catholics, including those seeking life as a religious -- a category that includes brothers and nuns.\n\n\"I am currently based in the Appalachian mountains of eastern Kentucky,\" he wrote in an email to friends and supporters on Sunday. \"I live in a hermitage at the top of a wooded hill, which I share with my German Shepherd rescue, Odie, and with the Blessed Sacrament, which was installed in my oratory shortly before Christmas.\"\n\nRaised in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Matson converted to Catholicism in 2010 -- four years, he noted, after transitioning in college, a step he refers to as a part of his \"medical history\" rather than a \"central part of my personal identity.\" After his conversion, Matson felt called to minister to people working in the arts, but knew he would encounter \"issues\" because of a 2000 Vatican document that, according to a Catholic News Service report from the time, declared that anyone who had undergone \"sex-change\" was ineligible \"to marry, be ordained to the priesthood or enter religious life.\"\n\nMatson approached a canon lawyer to discuss his options and was told that only two aspects of Catholic life were categorically off the table: marriage and the priesthood. According to Matson, the canon lawyer recommended being upfront about his status as a transgender man in any vocational conversations with church leaders and mentioned the role of a diocesan hermit, which could prove less challenging than enlisting with an existing religious order.\n\nThe canon lawyer, Matson said, effectively conveyed that \"there's no problem as long as there's a bishop who will accept you, because there's no distinction by sex and you're not in a community -- you're by yourself.\"\n\nWhat followed was roughly a decade of searching and no small amount of rejection. Living in the United Kingdom while pursuing a master's degree, and later a Ph.D. in theology, Matson entered a vocational discernment program and approached the Jesuit order to ask if he could join.\n\n\"They said, 'No, we just don't see how this would work for us,' which was crushing, because that's where I felt called,\" Matson said.\n\nOther communities offered similar responses, when they responded at all. \"People who knew me said, 'You clearly have a religious vocation,' and these were all people who knew my medical history,\" Matson said. \"But when they would go to the people in the community in charge of making that decision, they ... would often just refuse to even meet with me.\"\n\nIn one instance, Matson said, a religious leader declined to meet simply to hear his experience as a trans man, saying doing so would be \"a waste of time.\"\n\nBut Matson's call to religious life wouldn't abate. While visiting a monastery during a retreat, he found himself unable to sleep, consumed with the idea of starting \"a religious community of and for artists -- artists who are living together, (operating) in the church through their art, and ministering to the loneliness and sense of precarity many artists experience.\"\n\nIn 2015, he returned to New York City, where he had attended college. Having already taken private vows of poverty, chastity and obedience -- witnessed by his spiritual director -- before he arrived, he co-created a nonprofit called the Catholic Artist Connection. The group hosted retreats and connected artists to resources such as the Archdiocese of New York's Sheen Center for Thought and Culture, where Matson began working as a programming associate.\n\nMatson kept running into artists who wanted to pursue religious life, he said, and continued to feel the tug himself. But roadblocks kept appearing. \"As I spoke to friends in the archdiocese, I knew somebody with a trans background was never going to be accepted into religious life in the Archdiocese of New York,\" Matson said.\n\nHe tried again after a move to Minnesota in 2018, but his entreaties to various religious communities and orders were also rejected.\n\n\"I thought, well, if I can't find a religious community to sponsor me, maybe what I need is a bishop,\" Matson said.\n\nA priest friend recommended different bishops to contact, beginning with Stowe, who was emerging as a leading voice among Catholics calling for a more tolerant approach to LGBTQ+ people. In 2020, Matson sent Stowe a letter, conveying his status as a transgender man, his vision for an artists' community and his pull to religious life.\n\nStowe wrote back immediately, expressing his openness.\n\n\"It was an enormous relief,\" Matson said. \"I was in tears. I felt my hope revive.\"\n\nStowe confirmed Matson's account, saying the then-aspiring brother was recommended to him by a number of people.\n\n\"My willingness to be open to him is because it's a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church,\" Stowe said of Matson. \"Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life ... but they can be either male or female. Because there's no pursuit of priesthood or engagement in sacramental ministry, and because the hermit is a relatively quiet and secluded type of vocation, I didn't see any harm in letting him live this vocation.\"\n\nHe added that Matson's spiritual journey was \"consistent with the calling of that particular vocation.\"\n\nMatson moved to Kentucky, having already made progress on Stowe's suggestion that he link up with an additional community through which to experience religious life. Matson entered the novitiate at a Benedictine monastery in 2021, hoping the formation offered by that path would eventually help him form a new religious community for artists.\n\nFinally, in August 2022, Matson took his first vows as a diocesan hermit -- a yearlong commitment -- under Stowe's direction.\n\nFor the next year, Matson \"lived a life of basically spending half the day in prayer and half the day doing some form of work\" that included producing and writing at a local theater.\n\nThree years earlier, Matson read with frustration a document issued by the Vatican's Congregation for Catholic Education titled \"Male and Female He Created Them: Toward a Path of Dialogue on the Question of Gender Theory in Education.\" The instructional letter rejected \"calls for public recognition of the right to choose one's gender.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Diocese of Marquette, in Michigan, followed with its own instruction to priests to refuse transgender people asking to be baptized or confirmed until they have \"repented.\"\n\n\"It was suddenly becoming a lot more difficult in the church to be trans,\" Matson said.\n\nBut tolerance seems to be growing in some quarters. While Pope Francis has opposed elements of gender theory and recently called its proposals \"ugly,\" he has also met and dined with groups of transgender people.\n\nIn November 2023, the Vatican doctrine department ruled that transgender people may be baptized and serve as witnesses at Catholic weddings, so long as doing so \"doesn't cause scandal among the faithful.\"\n\nIn the United States in March, a coalition led by Catholic nuns released a letter voicing support for transgender, nonbinary and gender-expansive individuals, implicitly rebuking a statement put forward by a group of U.S. Catholic bishops discouraging Catholic health care groups from performing various gender-affirming medical procedures.\n\nBut overall, \"Vatican-level documents that have come out on the subject have not engaged with the science at all,\" Matson said, adding that he believes many diocesan-level statements are inconsistent in their attempts to categorize gender and cite scientific studies misleadingly. Matson has sent multiple private letters to Vatican offices, urging them to engage with transgender people and arguing that the church can embrace transgender people while maintaining orthodoxy.\n\nAs trans rights began to be debated in statehouses across the United States in recent months, conservative lawmakers have begun pushing bans on providing gender-affirming care for youth and, in some cases, adults.\n\nMatson vented his frustrations to Stowe and his spiritual director, saying he wanted to speak out. But he said he was advised to first \"build a foundation\" in religious life for several years.\n\nDuring that time, Matson had an experience that shook him. Attending a friend's play in his religious habit, he was approached by a student who identified as trans and nonbinary. After asking if Matson was a monk, the student said they were raised Catholic, but that their parents had rejected their identity, and the student felt like they \"don't have a place in the church anymore.\"\n\nMatson responded by saying there were people in the church who would support the student, and Matson prayed with them, asking God to show the student how they are \"wonderful the way you've made them.\" The student, Matson said, grew emotional, thanking the hermit profusely and saying, \"No one from the church has ever affirmed me for who I am.\"\n\nMatson, who renewed his vows in 2023, eventually began mulling a date to go public with his status. \"I have to say something,\" Matson told his spiritual director. He settled on Pentecost, which emphasizes preaching \"the good news of God's love to everyone,\" he said. It was also the day in the church calendar when he'd been baptized years before.\n\n\"I can't stand by and let this false and, at times, culpably ignorant understanding of what it means to be transgender continue to hurt people,\" he said. \"If I don't say anything and allow the church to continue to make decisions based on incorrect information, then I'm not serving the church.\"\n\nBoth Matson and Stowe said they are bracing for blowback after Sunday's announcement. Matson said he is largely unconcerned with \"online trolls\" but is sensitive to people who are \"legitimately concerned\" that \"accepting a trans person into religious life means Catholic anthropology gets thrown out the window.\"\n\nFor people with such concerns, he said, he looks forward to engaging in dialogue. \"I don't have a hidden agenda, I just want to serve the church,\" he said. \"People can believe that or not.\"\n\nBoth the hermit and his bishop are prepared for the possibility that church officials may push for Matson's removal. Stowe acknowledged that \"if I'm told to by higher authorities, then I will have to deal with that at the time.\"\n\nAs for ever leaving Catholicism itself, Matson bristled at the idea, calling the church \"my family.\" \"I'm Catholic,\" he said. \"I became Catholic after I transitioned because of the Catholic understanding -- the sacramental understanding -- of the body, of creation, of the desirability of the visible unity of the church and primarily because of the Eucharist.\"\n\nAt the very least, Matson said, he hopes going public will spark dialogue about his fellow transgender Catholics, a discussion he believes can enhance unity among the body of believers.\n\n\"You've got to deal with us, because God has called us into this church,\" he said. \"It's not your church to kick us out of -- this is God's church, and God has called us and engrafted us into it.\"", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [],

He offered his story as indicative of the often difficult path for trans Catholics, including those seeking life as a religious - a category that includes brothers and nuns.\n\n\"I am currently based in the Appalachian mountains of eastern Kentucky,\" he wrote in an email to friends and supporters on Sunday. \"I live in a hermitage at the top of a wooded hill, which I share with my German Shepherd rescue, Odie, and with the Blessed Sacrament, which was installed in my oratory shortly before Christmas.\"\n\nRaised in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Matson converted to Catholicism in 2010 - four years, he noted, after transitioning in college, a step he refers to as a part of his \"medical history\" rather than a \"central part of my personal identity.\" After his conversion, Matson felt called to minister to people working in the arts, but knew he would encounter \"issues\" because of a 2000 Vatican document that, according to a Catholic News Service report from the time, declared that anyone who had undergone \"sex-change\" was ineligible \"to marry, be ordained to the priesthood or enter religious life.\"\n\nMatson approached a canon lawyer to discuss his options and was told that only two aspects of Catholic life were categorically off the table: marriage and the priesthood. According to Matson, the canon lawyer recommended being upfront about his status as a transgender man in any vocational conversations with church leaders and mentioned the role of a diocesan hermit, which could prove less challenging than enlisting with an existing religious order.\n\nThe canon lawyer, Matson said, effectively conveyed that \"there\u00b4s no problem as long as there\u00b4s a bishop who will accept you, because there\u00b4s no distinction by sex and you\u00b4re not in a community - you\u00b4re by yourself.\"\n\nWhat followed was roughly a decade of searching and no small amount of rejection. Living in the United Kingdom while pursuing a master\u00b4s degree, and later a Ph.D. in theology, Matson entered a vocational discernment program and approached the Jesuit order to ask if he could join.\n\n\"They said, 'No, we just don\u00b4t see how this would work for us,\u00b4 which was crushing, because that\u00b4s where I felt called,\" Matson said.\n\nOther communities offered similar responses, when they responded at all. \"People who knew me said, 'You clearly have a religious vocation,\u00b4 and these were all people who knew my medical history,\" Matson said. \"But when they would go to the people in the community in charge of making that decision, they ... would often just refuse to even meet with me.\"\n\nIn one instance, Matson said, a religious leader declined to meet simply to hear his experience as a trans man, saying doing so would be \"a waste of time.\"\n\nBut Matson\u00b4s call to religious life wouldn\u00b4t abate. While visiting a monastery during a retreat, he found himself unable to sleep, consumed with the idea of starting \"a religious community of and for artists - artists who are living together, (operating) in the church through their art, and ministering to the loneliness and sense of precarity many artists experience.\"\n\nIn 2015, he returned to New York City, where he had attended college. Having already taken private vows of poverty, chastity and obedience - witnessed by his spiritual director - before he arrived, he co-created a nonprofit called the Catholic Artist Connection. The group hosted retreats and connected artists to resources such as the Archdiocese of New York\u00b4s Sheen Center for Thought and Culture, where Matson began working as a programming associate.\n\nMatson kept running into artists who wanted to pursue religious life, he said, and continued to feel the tug himself. But roadblocks kept appearing. \"As I spoke to friends in the archdiocese, I knew somebody with a trans background was never going to be accepted into religious life in the Archdiocese of New York,\" Matson said.\n\nHe tried again after a move to Minnesota in 2018, but his entreaties to various religious communities and orders were also rejected.\n\n\"I thought, well, if I can\u00b4t find a religious community to sponsor me, maybe what I need is a bishop,\" Matson said.\n\nA priest friend recommended different bishops to contact, beginning with Stowe, who was emerging as a leading voice among Catholics calling for a more tolerant approach to LGBTQ+ people. In 2020, Matson sent Stowe a letter, conveying his status as a transgender man, his vision for an artists\u00b4 community and his pull to religious life.\n\nStowe wrote back immediately, expressing his openness.\n\n\"It was an enormous relief,\" Matson said. \"I was in tears. I felt my hope revive.\"\n\nStowe confirmed Matson\u00b4s account, saying the then-aspiring brother was recommended to him by a number of people.\n\n\"My willingness to be open to him is because it\u00b4s a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church,\" Stowe said of Matson. \"Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life ... but they can be either male or female. Because there\u00b4s no pursuit of priesthood or engagement in sacramental ministry, and because the hermit is a relatively quiet and secluded type of vocation, I didn\u00b4t see any harm in letting him live this vocation.\"\n\nHe added that Matson\u00b4s spiritual journey was \"consistent with the calling of that particular vocation.\"\n\nMatson moved to Kentucky, having already made progress on Stowe\u00b4s suggestion that he link up with an additional community through which to experience religious life. Matson entered the novitiate at a Benedictine monastery in 2021, hoping the formation offered by that path would eventually help him form a new religious community for artists.\n\nFinally, in August 2022, Matson took his first vows as a diocesan hermit - a yearlong commitment - under Stowe\u00b4s direction.\n\nFor the next year, Matson \"lived a life of basically spending half the day in prayer and half the day doing some form of work\" that included producing and writing at a local theater.\n\nThree years earlier, Matson read with frustration a document issued by the Vatican\u00b4s Congregation for Catholic Education titled \"Male and Female He Created Them: Toward a Path of Dialogue on the Question of Gender Theory in Education.\" The instructional letter rejected \"calls for public recognition of the right to choose one\u00b4s gender.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Diocese of Marquette, in Michigan, followed with its own instruction to priests to refuse transgender people asking to be baptized or confirmed until they have \"repented.\"\n\n\"It was suddenly becoming a lot more difficult in the church to be trans,\" Matson said.\n\nBut tolerance seems to be growing in some quarters. While Pope Francis has opposed elements of gender theory and recently called its proposals \"ugly,\" he has also met and dined with groups of transgender people.\n\nIn November 2023, the Vatican doctrine department ruled that transgender people may be baptized and serve as witnesses at Catholic weddings, so long as doing so \"doesn\u00b4t cause scandal among the faithful.\"\n\nIn the United States in March, a coalition led by Catholic nuns released a letter voicing support for transgender, nonbinary and gender-expansive individuals, implicitly rebuking a statement put forward by a group of U.S. Catholic bishops discouraging Catholic health care groups from performing various gender-affirming medical procedures.\n\nBut overall, \"Vatican-level documents that have come out on the subject have not engaged with the science at all,\" Matson said, adding that he believes many diocesan-level statements are inconsistent in their attempts to categorize gender and cite scientific studies misleadingly. Matson has sent multiple private letters to Vatican offices, urging them to engage with transgender people and arguing that the church can embrace transgender people while maintaining orthodoxy.\n\nAs trans rights began to be debated in statehouses across the United States in recent months, conservative lawmakers have begun pushing bans on providing gender-affirming care for youth and, in some cases, adults.\n\nMatson vented his frustrations to Stowe and his spiritual director, saying he wanted to speak out. But he said he was advised to first \"build a foundation\" in religious life for several years.\n\nDuring that time, Matson had an experience that shook him. Attending a friend\u00b4s play in his religious habit, he was approached by a student who identified as trans and nonbinary. After asking if Matson was a monk, the student said they were raised Catholic, but that their parents had rejected their identity, and the student felt like they \"don\u00b4t have a place in the church anymore.\"\n\nMatson responded by saying there were people in the church who would support the student, and Matson prayed with them, asking God to show the student how they are \"wonderful the way you\u00b4ve made them.\" The student, Matson said, grew emotional, thanking the hermit profusely and saying, \"No one from the church has ever affirmed me for who I am.\"\n\nMatson, who renewed his vows in 2023, eventually began mulling a date to go public with his status. \"I have to say something,\" Matson told his spiritual director. He settled on Pentecost, which emphasizes preaching \"the good news of God\u00b4s love to everyone,\" he said. It was also the day in the church calendar when he\u00b4d been baptized years before.\n\n\"I can\u00b4t stand by and let this false and, at times, culpably ignorant understanding of what it means to be transgender continue to hurt people,\" he said. \"If I don\u00b4t say anything and allow the church to continue to make decisions based on incorrect information, then I\u00b4m not serving the church.\"\n\nBoth Matson and Stowe said they are bracing for blowback after Sunday\u00b4s announcement. Matson said he is largely unconcerned with \"online trolls\" but is sensitive to people who are \"legitimately concerned\" that \"accepting a trans person into religious life means Catholic anthropology gets thrown out the window.\"\n\nFor people with such concerns, he said, he looks forward to engaging in dialogue. \"I don\u00b4t have a hidden agenda, I just want to serve the church,\" he said. \"People can believe that or not.\"\n\nBoth the hermit and his bishop are prepared for the possibility that church officials may push for Matson\u00b4s removal. Stowe acknowledged that \"if I\u00b4m told to by higher authorities, then I will have to deal with that at the time.\"\n\nAs for ever leaving Catholicism itself, Matson bristled at the idea, calling the church \"my family.\" \"I\u00b4m Catholic,\" he said. \"I became Catholic after I transitioned because of the Catholic understanding - the sacramental understanding - of the body, of creation, of the desirability of the visible unity of the church and primarily because of the Eucharist.\"\n\nAt the very least, Matson said, he hopes going public will spark dialogue about his fellow transgender Catholics, a discussion he believes can enhance unity among the body of believers.\n\n\"You\u00b4ve got to deal with us, because God has called us into this church,\" he said. \"It\u00b4s not your church to kick us out of - this is God\u00b4s church, and God has called us and engrafted us into it.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

A small subset of religious persons, hermits mostly spend their lives engaged in quiet prayer.\n\nBrother Christian Matson, a Catholic diocesan hermit in Kentucky, has spent years doing just that. His monk's habit might catch his neighbor's eye, but he is known in the town where he lives primarily through his work with the local theater.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nBut recently Matson decided that his faith compels him to make a little more noise than usual.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"This Sunday, Pentecost 2024, I'm planning to come out publicly as transgender,\" Matson told Religion News Service on Friday (May 17), saying he was speaking out with the permission of his bishop, John Stowe of the Diocese of Lexington in Kentucky.\n\n___\n\nThis content is written and produced by Religion News Service and distributed by The Associated Press. RNS and AP partner on some religion news content. RNS is solely responsible for this story.\n\n___\n\nMatson, who is also a Benedictine oblate, believes he is the first openly transgender person in his position in the Catholic Church. It is a difficult claim to confirm -- even Stowe told RNS he did not know for sure if Matson is the first -- but Matson's status is at least highly unusual and comes at a time when church officials are grappling with how to address transgender Catholics.\n\nAccording to Matson, 39, his \"disclosing,\" as he describes it, is a moment years in the making. He offered his story as indicative of the often difficult path for trans Catholics, including those seeking life as a religious -- a category that includes brothers and nuns.\n\n\"I am currently based in the Appalachian mountains of eastern Kentucky,\" he wrote in an email to friends and supporters on Sunday. \"I live in a hermitage at the top of a wooded hill, which I share with my German Shepherd rescue, Odie, and with the Blessed Sacrament, which was installed in my oratory shortly before Christmas.\"\n\nRaised in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Matson converted to Catholicism in 2010 -- four years, he noted, after transitioning in college, a step he refers to as a part of his \"medical history\" rather than a \"central part of my personal identity.\" After his conversion, Matson felt called to minister to people working in the arts, but knew he would encounter \"issues\" because of a 2000 Vatican document that, according to a Catholic News Service report from the time, declared that anyone who had undergone \"sex-change\" was ineligible \"to marry, be ordained to the priesthood or enter religious life.\"\n\nMatson approached a canon lawyer to discuss his options and was told that only two aspects of Catholic life were categorically off the table: marriage and the priesthood. According to Matson, the canon lawyer recommended being upfront about his status as a transgender man in any vocational conversations with church leaders and mentioned the role of a diocesan hermit, which could prove less challenging than enlisting with an existing religious order.\n\nThe canon lawyer, Matson said, effectively conveyed that \"there's no problem as long as there's a bishop who will accept you, because there's no distinction by sex and you're not in a community -- you're by yourself.\"\n\nWhat followed was roughly a decade of searching and no small amount of rejection. Living in the United Kingdom while pursuing a master's degree, and later a Ph.D. in theology, Matson entered a vocational discernment program and approached the Jesuit order to ask if he could join.\n\n\"They said, 'No, we just don't see how this would work for us,' which was crushing, because that's where I felt called,\" Matson said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOther communities offered similar responses, when they responded at all. \"People who knew me said, 'You clearly have a religious vocation,' and these were all people who knew my medical history,\" Matson said. \"But when they would go to the people in the community in charge of making that decision, they ... would often just refuse to even meet with me.\"\n\nIn one instance, Matson said, a religious leader declined to meet simply to hear his experience as a trans man, saying doing so would be \"a waste of time.\"\n\nBut Matson's call to religious life wouldn't abate. While visiting a monastery during a retreat, he found himself unable to sleep, consumed with the idea of starting \"a religious community of and for artists -- artists who are living together, (operating) in the church through their art, and ministering to the loneliness and sense of precarity many artists experience.\"\n\nIn 2015, he returned to New York City, where he had attended college. Having already taken private vows of poverty, chastity and obedience -- witnessed by his spiritual director -- before he arrived, he co-created a nonprofit called the Catholic Artist Connection. The group hosted retreats and connected artists to resources such as the Archdiocese of New York's Sheen Center for Thought and Culture, where Matson began working as a programming associate.\n\nMatson kept running into artists who wanted to pursue religious life, he said, and continued to feel the tug himself. But roadblocks kept appearing. \"As I spoke to friends in the archdiocese, I knew somebody with a trans background was never going to be accepted into religious life in the Archdiocese of New York,\" Matson said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe tried again after a move to Minnesota in 2018, but his entreaties to various religious communities and orders were also rejected.\n\n\"I thought, well, if I can't find a religious community to sponsor me, maybe what I need is a bishop,\" Matson said.\n\nA priest friend recommended different bishops to contact, beginning with Stowe, who was emerging as a leading voice among Catholics calling for a more tolerant approach to LGBTQ+ people. In 2020, Matson sent Stowe a letter, conveying his status as a transgender man, his vision for an artists' community and his pull to religious life.\n\nStowe wrote back immediately, expressing his openness.\n\n\"It was an enormous relief,\" Matson said. \"I was in tears. I felt my hope revive.\"\n\nStowe confirmed Matson's account, saying the then-aspiring brother was recommended to him by a number of people.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"My willingness to be open to him is because it's a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church,\" Stowe said of Matson. \"Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life ... but they can be either male or female. Because there's no pursuit of priesthood or engagement in sacramental ministry, and because the hermit is a relatively quiet and secluded type of vocation, I didn't see any harm in letting him live this vocation.\"\n\nHe added that Matson's spiritual journey was \"consistent with the calling of that particular vocation.\"\n\nMatson moved to Kentucky, having already made progress on Stowe's suggestion that he link up with an additional community through which to experience religious life. Matson entered the novitiate at a Benedictine monastery in 2021, hoping the formation offered by that path would eventually help him form a new religious community for artists.\n\nFinally, in August 2022, Matson took his first vows as a diocesan hermit -- a yearlong commitment -- under Stowe's direction.\n\nFor the next year, Matson \"lived a life of basically spending half the day in prayer and half the day doing some form of work\" that included producing and writing at a local theater.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThree years earlier, Matson read with frustration a document issued by the Vatican's Congregation for Catholic Education titled \"Male and Female He Created Them: Toward a Path of Dialogue on the Question of Gender Theory in Education.\" The instructional letter rejected \"calls for public recognition of the right to choose one's gender.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Diocese of Marquette, in Michigan, followed with its own instruction to priests to refuse transgender people asking to be baptized or confirmed until they have \"repented.\"\n\n\"It was suddenly becoming a lot more difficult in the church to be trans,\" Matson said.\n\nBut tolerance seems to be growing in some quarters. While Pope Francis has opposed elements of gender theory and recently called its proposals \"ugly,\" he has also met and dined with groups of transgender people.\n\nIn November 2023, the Vatican doctrine department ruled that transgender people may be baptized and serve as witnesses at Catholic weddings, so long as doing so \"doesn't cause scandal among the faithful.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn the United States in March, a coalition led by Catholic nuns released a letter voicing support for transgender, nonbinary and gender-expansive individuals, implicitly rebuking a statement put forward by a group of U.S. Catholic bishops discouraging Catholic health care groups from performing various gender-affirming medical procedures.\n\nBut overall, \"Vatican-level documents that have come out on the subject have not engaged with the science at all,\" Matson said, adding that he believes many diocesan-level statements are inconsistent in their attempts to categorize gender and cite scientific studies misleadingly. Matson has sent multiple private letters to Vatican offices, urging them to engage with transgender people and arguing that the church can embrace transgender people while maintaining orthodoxy.\n\nAs trans rights began to be debated in statehouses across the United States in recent months, conservative lawmakers have begun pushing bans on providing gender-affirming care for youth and, in some cases, adults.\n\nMatson vented his frustrations to Stowe and his spiritual director, saying he wanted to speak out. But he said he was advised to first \"build a foundation\" in religious life for several years.\n\nDuring that time, Matson had an experience that shook him. Attending a friend's play in his religious habit, he was approached by a student who identified as trans and nonbinary. After asking if Matson was a monk, the student said they were raised Catholic, but that their parents had rejected their identity, and the student felt like they \"don't have a place in the church anymore.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMatson responded by saying there were people in the church who would support the student, and Matson prayed with them, asking God to show the student how they are \"wonderful the way you've made them.\" The student, Matson said, grew emotional, thanking the hermit profusely and saying, \"No one from the church has ever affirmed me for who I am.\"\n\nMatson, who renewed his vows in 2023, eventually began mulling a date to go public with his status. \"I have to say something,\" Matson told his spiritual director. He settled on Pentecost, which emphasizes preaching \"the good news of God's love to everyone,\" he said. It was also the day in the church calendar when he'd been baptized years before.\n\n\"I can't stand by and let this false and, at times, culpably ignorant understanding of what it means to be transgender continue to hurt people,\" he said. \"If I don't say anything and allow the church to continue to make decisions based on incorrect information, then I'm not serving the church.\"\n\nBoth Matson and Stowe said they are bracing for blowback after Sunday's announcement. Matson said he is largely unconcerned with \"online trolls\" but is sensitive to people who are \"legitimately concerned\" that \"accepting a trans person into religious life means Catholic anthropology gets thrown out the window.\"\n\nFor people with such concerns, he said, he looks forward to engaging in dialogue. \"I don't have a hidden agenda, I just want to serve the church,\" he said. \"People can believe that or not.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBoth the hermit and his bishop are prepared for the possibility that church officials may push for Matson's removal. Stowe acknowledged that \"if I'm told to by higher authorities, then I will have to deal with that at the time.\"\n\nAs for ever leaving Catholicism itself, Matson bristled at the idea, calling the church \"my family.\" \"I'm Catholic,\" he said. \"I became Catholic after I transitioned because of the Catholic understanding -- the sacramental understanding -- of the body, of creation, of the desirability of the visible unity of the church and primarily because of the Eucharist.\"\n\nAt the very least, Matson said, he hopes going public will spark dialogue about his fellow transgender Catholics, a discussion he believes can enhance unity among the body of believers.\n\n\"You've got to deal with us, because God has called us into this church,\" he said. \"It's not your church to kick us out of -- this is God's church, and God has called us and engrafted us into it.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

First of all, Matson is likely a biological female, though media outlets and her bishop, John Stowe, use male pronouns in reference to her. Matson told RNS she had a \"sex-change\" in college, several years before converting to Catholicism from the U.S. Presbyterian Church, and considers this \"sex-change\" part of her \"medical history.\"\n\nMatson also felt called to a Catholic religious vocation, but because of her gender-related \"medical history,\" is prohibited from entering into marriage or the priesthood, which is restricted to men. So, Matson spent about a decade earning various graduate degrees in theology and, in front of her spiritual director, even made private vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, though to whom she pledged obedience is unclear.\n\nShe also reached out to various religious communities, but none would accept her. Even the Jesuits, long considered to be among the most liberal Catholic religious communities, gave her a flat rejection. \"They said, 'No, we just don't see how this would work for us,' which was crushing, because that's where I felt called,\" Matson told RNS.\n\nThen, a canon lawyer suggested to Matson that she consider becoming a diocesan hermit. \"There's no problem as long as there's a bishop who will accept you,\" the canon lawyer explained, according to Matson's recollection, \"because there's no distinction by sex and you're not in a community -- you're by yourself.\"\n\nIn 2020, Matson connected with Bishop Stowe, who was willing to entertain the idea of a trans-identifying individual becoming a hermit in his diocese.\n\n\"My willingness to be open to him is because it's a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church,\" Stowe told RNS. \"Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life ... but they can be either male or female. Because there's no pursuit of priesthood or engagement in sacramental ministry, and because the hermit is a relatively quiet and secluded type of vocation, I didn't see any harm in letting him live this vocation.\"\n\nMatson then joined a Benedictine monastery and eventually became a Benedictine oblate, which St. Paul's Monastery in Minnesota defines as \"Christian women and men who actively associate themselves with a Benedictine monastery using the Rule of Benedict as a guide.\"\n\n\"Benedictine spirituality is flexible and adaptable, open to all who seek God and is a way to live out the Gospel message,\" the monastery's website adds.\n\nMatson says she now lives in an Appalachian hermitage \"with my German Shepherd rescue, Odie, and with the Blessed Sacrament, which was installed in my oratory shortly before Christmas.\"\n\nMatson claimed she wants her \"disclosing\" of her transgender identity to foster a change in the Vatican's view of transgenderism, which has not \"not engaged with the science at all.\" \"You've got to deal with us, because God has called us into this church,\" she continued. \"It's not your church to kick us out of -- this is God's church, and God has called us and engrafted us into it.\"\n\n\"I became Catholic after I transitioned because of the Catholic understanding -- the sacramental understanding -- of the body, of creation, of the desirability of the visible unity of the church and primarily because of the Eucharist.\"\n\nBishop Stowe noted that he and Matson both knew that Matson's transgender identity would spark outrage among the faithful, but he feels confident that Matson is where she belongs, describing her spiritual journey as \"consistent with the calling of that particular vocation.\"\n\nA quick glance at Stowe's X posts reveals that he strongly aligns with many liberal political causes, especially regarding illegal immigration. In December 2022, he even compared illegal aliens in the U.S. to the Holy Innocents slaughtered under King Herod.\n\nHe also demanded stricter gun control in the fallout of a trans-identifying mass shooter murdering six people at a Christian school in Nashville in March 2023. A year ago, he also retweeted an anti-bullying quote from Pope Francis, which said: \"Every man, every woman, every boy, every girl has the duty to be authentic, to be themselves, and the right to be respected.\"\n\nIn the following video, Bishop Stowe gives a message to Christians during the season of Advent:", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte

He believes that his coming out would stimulate important conversations regarding the inclusion of transgender people in the Catholic community.\n\nHis statement comes just a month after the Vatican issued \"Infinite Dignity,\" a 20-page document that condemns gender theory, abortion, and surrogacy as threats to humanity's relationship with God.\n\nMatson was disappointed that the Vatican's stance on transgender problems lacked scientific involvement.

First of all, Matson is likely a biological female, though media outlets and her bishop, John Stowe, use male pronouns in reference to her. Matson told RNS she had a \"sex-change\" in college, several years before converting to Catholicism from the U.S. Presbyterian Church, and considers this \"sex-change\" part of her \"medical history.\"\n\nMatson also felt called to a Catholic religious vocation, but because of her gender-related \"medical history,\" is prohibited from entering into marriage or the priesthood, which is restricted to men. So, Matson spent about a decade earning various graduate degrees in theology and, in front of her spiritual director, even made private vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, though to whom she pledged obedience is unclear.\n\nShe also reached out to various religious communities, but none would accept her. Even the Jesuits, long considered to be among the most liberal Catholic religious communities, gave her a flat rejection. \"They said, 'No, we just don't see how this would work for us,' which was crushing, because that's where I felt called,\" Matson told RNS.\n\nThen, a canon lawyer suggested to Matson that she consider becoming a diocesan hermit. \"There's no problem as long as there's a bishop who will accept you,\" the canon lawyer explained, according to Matson's recollection, \"because there's no distinction by sex and you're not in a community -- you're by yourself.\"\n\nIn 2020, Matson connected with Bishop Stowe, who was willing to entertain the idea of a trans-identifying individual becoming a hermit in his diocese.\n\n\"My willingness to be open to him is because it's a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church,\" Stowe told RNS. \"Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life ... but they can be either male or female. Because there's no pursuit of priesthood or engagement in sacramental ministry, and because the hermit is a relatively quiet and secluded type of vocation, I didn't see any harm in letting him live this vocation.\"\n\nMatson then joined a Benedictine monastery and eventually became a Benedictine oblate, which St. Paul's Monastery in Minnesota defines as \"Christian women and men who actively associate themselves with a Benedictine monastery using the Rule of Benedict as a guide.\"\n\n\"Benedictine spirituality is flexible and adaptable, open to all who seek God and is a way to live out the Gospel message,\" the monastery's website adds.\n\nMatson says she now lives in an Appalachian hermitage \"with my German Shepherd rescue, Odie, and with the Blessed Sacrament, which was installed in my oratory shortly before Christmas.\"\n\nMatson claimed she wants her \"disclosing\" of her transgender identity to foster a change in the Vatican's view of transgenderism, which has not \"not engaged with the science at all.\" \"You've got to deal with us, because God has called us into this church,\" she continued. \"It's not your church to kick us out of -- this is God's church, and God has called us and engrafted us into it.\"\n\n\"I became Catholic after I transitioned because of the Catholic understanding -- the sacramental understanding -- of the body, of creation, of the desirability of the visible unity of the church and primarily because of the Eucharist.\"\n\nBishop Stowe noted that he and Matson both knew that Matson's transgender identity would spark outrage among the faithful, but he feels confident that Matson is where she belongs, describing her spiritual journey as \"consistent with the calling of that particular vocation.\"\n\nA quick glance at Stowe's X posts reveals that he strongly aligns with many liberal political causes, especially regarding illegal immigration. In December 2022, he even compared illegal aliens in the U.S. to the Holy Innocents slaughtered under King Herod.\n\nHe also demanded stricter gun control in the fallout of a trans-identifying mass shooter murdering six people at a Christian school in Nashville in March 2023. A year ago, he also retweeted an anti-bullying quote from Pope Francis, which said: \"Every man, every woman, every boy, every girl has the duty to be authentic, to be themselves, and the right to be respected.\"\n\nIn the following video, Bishop Stowe gives a message to Christians during the season of Advent:", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors":

Why this Catholic hermit decided to come out as transgender", "body": "Pentecost is a momentous day in the Christian calendar, commemorating the moment when the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles of Jesus, leading them to speak in tongues and be bold in proclaiming the gospel. It is a fulfillment of a promise by the risen Jesus Christ that he would send his followers the Holy Spirit.\n\nThis year's Pentecost on May 19 was a momentous day for Brother Christian Matson, a Catholic hermit who lives a life of quiet devotion in Eastern Kentucky. It's when he fulfilled a promise to himself that he would celebrate his devotion to the Catholic Church by telling the world he was a transgender man, which he did with a long story in the Religion News Service.\n\n\"I picked Pentecost because of the connection to preaching the gospel,\" Matson told me in a phone interview.\n\nHe spoke with permission from his diocesan leader, Lexington Bishop John Stowe, who accepted him as a hermit in the diocese three years ago.\n\nMatson had some other reasons, too. He's about to turn 40. But most of all, he said, \"There are a number of laws getting passed around our country, including in Kentucky, as well as policies being published in the Church, that are making life more difficult for transgender people and are based on faulty assumptions about them.\"\n\nCatholic hermits are a centuries-old tradition, seen as living alone in the wilderness in a solitary life devoted to God. According to the Catholic Leader, they are known for a life devoted \"to the praise of God and salvation of the world through a stricter separation from the world, the silence of solitude, and assiduous prayer and penance.\"\n\nIn an email to supporters last week, Matson said, \"I live in a hermitage at the top of a wooded hill, which I share with my German Shepherd rescue, Odie, and with the Blessed Sacrament, which was installed in my oratory shortly before Christmas.\"\n\nHe did not disclose where he lives in Pikeville, but said he is well known in the community for his work with local theater groups.\n\nMost of his days are spent in quiet prayer, and afternoons and evenings are devoted to his theater work. Last year, he performed \"Every Brilliant Thing\" Duncan McMillan as part of the community's suicide prevention work.\n\nCould not find religious home as trans man\n\nMatson grew up in Texas and Virginia as a Presbyterian. He attended college at New York University, where he transitioned.\n\nHe went to graduate school at Loyola University Maryland.\n\n\"It was my first time in a Catholic environment -- I was very drawn to the beauty of the liturgy, but also to the Jesuit approach to education, which is care of the whole person, and the sense of Catholic education project in a rich intellectual history.\"\n\nMatson went to Oxford University in England to study theology, which is where he converted to Catholicism in 2010. But as an openly transgender man, he could not find a religious home.\n\nHe was rejected by the Jesuits and other orders for being transgender. He became a Benedictine oblate, a lay person associated with a monastery. But he still wanted to work with other artists and LGBTQ people who wanted to practice their faith within the Church and could not find a path.\n\nFinally, a friend connected him to Bishop John Stowe, who was known for his outreach to the LGBTQ community. In a speech he gave in 2022, he said: \"I believe that my first words to you and to the LGBT community in the church must be the same: 'I love you.'\"\n\nStowe was unavailable to speak to the Herald-Leader. But he told Religion News Service: \"My willingness to be open to him is because it's a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church. Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life ... but they can be either male or female.\n\n\"Because there's no pursuit of priesthood or engagement in sacramental ministry, and because the hermit is a relatively quiet and secluded type of vocation, I didn't see any harm in letting him live this vocation.\"\n\nMatson said that Stowe has been an inspiration to him as a religious leader.\n\n\"He wants to preach the Gospel regardless of consequences,\" Matson said.\n\n\"He's trying to serve the church by saying things about care for creation, care for immigrants, care for the LGBTQ community. He preaches it whether or not it's politically palatable. I'm so inspired by his courage and his love for Christ and the church and the Gospel.\"\n\nVatican allows baptism, becoming godparent\n\nPope Francis has slowly created more tolerance for LGBTQ Catholics, although same-sex marriage is still forbidden. Last year, the Vatican said it was allowed under certain circumstances, for transgender people to be baptized as Catholics and serve as godparents.\n\nMatson believes he is the first openly transgender person in his position in the church. So, will there be consequences from the Vatican for Brother Christian and Bishop Stowe?\n\n\"I would hope not,\" said Stan \"JR\" Zerkowski, the director of the Lexington Diocese's LGBTQ ministry and the author of \"Coming Out and Coming Home: A Gay Catholic Man's Journey from Marginalization to Ministry, with a Few Miracles Along the Way.\"\n\n\"I think this is an incredibly positive step for dialogue in the church and for transgender people to witness to their faith in heroic ways,\" Zerkowski said.\n\n\"I think Brother Christian is heroic -- the church has neither spoken kindly nor been kind to transgender people, and he still views service to the Lord and to the church as something far greater than something that would cause most people to back down. That's heroic faith.\"\n\nZerkowski was thrilled Matson made his announcement on Pentecost.\n\n\"People said, 'The Apostles are drunk, they're crazy, they're speaking in languages people don't understand,'\" he said.\n\n\"It's almost as if a new Pentecost is being called for in the Church. Brother Christian is asking them to speak a new language of love, and not just toward transgender people but a new language of love that transgender people have for the church.\n\n\"If that's not the Holy Spirit that has prompted this entire thing, then quite frankly, I'm in the wrong business.\"\n\nZerkowski believes Matson's story is a perfect example of how God works in incredibly powerful ways.\n\n\"One of the powerful ways is to see this humble servant of the Lord living in Eastern Kentucky, not looking for fanfare but wanting to say this is who I am, this is how the Lord inspired me, and this is my gift to the Church ... myself. And he's asking the church to do two things -- can you accept my gift, and can you accept the gift of people like me who want to gift themselves. Can the church understand this new language of love?\"\n\n'Both trying to serve the Gospel'\n\nMatson said he hopes that anyone who is concerned about him would come to him or Bishop Stowe and talk to them.\n\n\"We're both trying to serve the Gospel,\" he said. \"I hope they would say, let's see how we can incorporate your vocation and mission to the church in a way that helps witness all the children God has created in their complexity,\" he said.\n\nMost of all, he wants his story will resonate with others who have been rejected by the Church.\n\n\"My No. 1 hope is that other trans people in the church who want to have a relationship with it look at my story and say oh there's hope for someone in the church to understand me,\" he said.\n\n\"If I'm correct that it's OK to be trans and Catholic, then the church will come to that conclusion because it will be led by the Holy Spirit in all truth,\" he said.\n\n\"If I'm wrong, then I pray God shows me I'm wrong. I have confidence that God will continue to lead the church into the fullness of truth. ... If my theological position is true, then the church will eventually get there.\"", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Stowe is a left-wing Catholic who has called for increased acceptance of the LGBTQ agenda within the Catholic Church, despite this being in defiance of the Church's teachings.\n\nMatson claimed, with no evidence, that his motivation for speaking out was a story he had been told about a \"transgender\" student who felt that he had been rejected by the Catholic Church.\n\n\"I can't stand by and let this false and, at times, culpably ignorant understanding of what it means to be transgender continue to hurt people,\" said Matson.\n\nMatson expressed his anger over Vatican documents that reject \"calls for public recognition of the right to choose one's gender,\" including the recent release of \"Infinite Dignity,\" a document which condemns genital mutilation surgeries, as well as abortion and surrogacy, as violations of the dignity of man.

As the Religious News Service (RNS) reported, Matson, a woman who has been living as a man, will be able to remain a monk despite the fact that she's very obviously and confidently contradicting the biblical principles on gender and identity.\n\n\"This Sunday, Pentecost 2024, I'm planning to come out publicly as transgender,\" Matson told Religion News Service on May 17.\n\nSo yes, the church was alright with the announcement and her \"identity.\"\n\nMatson, a biological woman, decided to identify as a man in college, reports indicate. Four years later, Matson converted to Catholicism. After going through a vocational discernment following his masters degree and a Ph.D, Matson felt called to work in a religious setting.\n\nShe was denied, rightfully so in my opinion, by many bishops and churches across the nation but kept trying to get in. She even co-started a nonprofit called the Catholic Artist Connection. It's aim was to be a \"religious community of and for artists -- artists who are living together, (operating) in the church through their art, and ministering to the loneliness and sense of precarity many artists experience.\"\n\nMatson, having taken private vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, sent a letter to Bishop Stowe in 2020 after seeing how vocal Stowe was about Catholics being more pro-LGBTQ and asked to be sponsored by the Kentucky-based bishop. When Stowe accepted, Matson said she felt \"an enormous relief,\" adding \"I was in tears. I felt my hope revive.\"\n\nRelated: SHOCKER: 'American Idol' Finale Allows Worship Song\n\nFor context, Matson was accepted as a diocesan hermit. This role, traditionally, doesn't have a gender distinction and is more of an external and secluded role that spends most days in quiet prayer. Here's what Stowe said about Matson's involvement:\n\nMy willingness to be open to him is because it's a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church. Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life ... but they can be either male or female. Because there's no pursuit of priesthood or engagement in sacramental ministry, and because the hermit is a relatively quiet and secluded type of vocation, I didn't see any harm in letting him live this vocation.\n\nWhile there may be no \"harm\" in Stowe's eyes, he's clearly tip-toeing on what is and isn't appropriate for someone in an official role in the Catholic Church. Generally speaking, I assume the goal is to have employees or a team of individuals who love the Lord for how he made them and honor His word, even the words the He says about gender and how there's only two of them.\n\nYet, in \"2023, the Vatican doctrine department ruled that transgender people may be baptized and serve as witnesses at Catholic weddings, so long as doing so 'doesn't cause scandal among the faithful,'\" RNS reported.\n\nIt's rather difficult to watch our nation, and religion in our nation, cave to the woke mob.

He offered his story as indicative of the often difficult path for trans Catholics, including those seeking life as a religious -- a category that includes brothers and nuns.\n\n\"I am currently based in the Appalachian mountains of eastern Kentucky,\" he wrote in an email to friends and supporters on Sunday. \"I live in a hermitage at the top of a wooded hill, which I share with my German Shepherd rescue, Odie, and with the Blessed Sacrament, which was installed in my oratory shortly before Christmas.\"\n\nRaised in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Matson converted to Catholicism in 2010 -- four years, he noted, after transitioning in college, a step he refers to as a part of his \"medical history\" rather than a \"central part of my personal identity.\" After his conversion, Matson felt called to minister to people working in the arts, but knew he would encounter \"issues\" because of a 2000 Vatican document that, according to a Catholic News Service report from the time, declared that anyone who had undergone \"sex-change\" was ineligible \"to marry, be ordained to the priesthood or enter religious life.\"\n\nMatson approached a canon lawyer to discuss his options and was told that only two aspects of Catholic life were categorically off the table: marriage and the priesthood. According to Matson, the canon lawyer recommended being upfront about his status as a transgender man in any vocational conversations with church leaders and mentioned the role of a diocesan hermit, which could prove less challenging than enlisting with an existing religious order.\n\nThe canon lawyer, Matson said, effectively conveyed that \"there's no problem as long as there's a bishop who will accept you, because there's no distinction by sex and you're not in a community -- you're by yourself.\"\n\nWhat followed was roughly a decade of searching and no small amount of rejection. Living in the United Kingdom while pursuing a master's degree, and later a Ph.D. in theology, Matson entered a vocational discernment program and approached the Jesuit order to ask if he could join.\n\n\"They said, 'No, we just don't see how this would work for us,' which was crushing, because that's where I felt called,\" Matson said.\n\nOther communities offered similar responses, when they responded at all. \"People who knew me said, 'You clearly have a religious vocation,' and these were all people who knew my medical history,\" Matson said. \"But when they would go to the people in the community in charge of making that decision, they ... would often just refuse to even meet with me.\"\n\nIn one instance, Matson said, a religious leader declined to meet simply to hear his experience as a trans man, saying doing so would be \"a waste of time.\"\n\nBut Matson's call to religious life wouldn't abate. While visiting a monastery during a retreat, he found himself unable to sleep, consumed with the idea of starting \"a religious community of and for artists -- artists who are living together, (operating) in the church through their art, and ministering to the loneliness and sense of precarity many artists experience.\"", "source": {"uri": "ncronline.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Catholic Reporter"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Canon law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hermit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priesthood_in_the_Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priesthood in the Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian_Church_(USA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presbyterian Church (USA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oratory_(worship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oratory (worship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nun", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_Mountains", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Appalachian Mountains"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blessed_Sacrament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blessed Sacrament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "German language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecrated_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consecrated life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_News_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catholic News Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ordination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_man", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trans man"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_order", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religious order"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vocation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuits", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesuits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_calling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Religious calling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master's_degree", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Master's degree"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Humor", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2024-05/webRNS-Christian-Matson1-051924%20%281%29.jpg?h=f7d9296c&itok=zWz0WCk7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586999", "eventUri": "eng-9586999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

He expressed frustration over Vatican documents that reject \"calls for public recognition of the right to choose one's gender.\" (RELATED: US Bishops Warn Against Catholic Doctors Performing 'Gender Transition Procedures')\n\nMatson's disclosure also comes one month after the Vatican issued \"Infinite Dignity,\" a treatise condemning sex change surgeries, abortion and surrogacy as violations of human dignity and practices that go against God's plan.\n\n\"Vatican-level documents that have come out on the subject have not engaged with the science at all,\" Matson told Religious News Service. \"If I don't say anything and allow the church to continue to make decisions based on incorrect information, then I'm not serving the church.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hermit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Lexington", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Lexington"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictines", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benedictines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_News_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Religion News Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stowe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Stowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecrated_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consecrated life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Surrogacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Treatise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Catholic hermit in Eastern Kentucky comes out as transgender", "body": "Pentecost is a momentous day in the Christian calendar, commemorating the moment when the Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles of Jesus, leading them to speak in tongues and be bold in proclaiming the gospel. It is a fulfillment of a promise by the risen Jesus Christ that he would send his followers the Holy Spirit.\n\nThis year's Pentecost on May 19 was a momentous day for Brother Christian Matson, a Catholic hermit who lives a life of quiet devotion in Eastern Kentucky. It's when he fulfilled a promise to himself that he would celebrate his devotion to the Catholic Church by telling the world he was a transgender man, which he did with a long story in the Religion News Service.\n\n\"I picked Pentecost because of the connection to preaching the gospel,\" Matson told me in a phone interview.\n\nHe spoke with permission from his diocesan leader, Lexington Bishop John Stowe, who accepted him as a hermit in the diocese three years ago.\n\nMatson had some other reasons, too. He's about to turn 40. But most of all, he said, \"There are a number of laws getting passed around our country, including in Kentucky, as well as policies being published in the Church, that are making life more difficult for transgender people and are based on faulty assumptions about them.\"\n\nCatholic hermits are a centuries-old tradition, seen as living alone in the wilderness in a solitary life devoted to God. According to the Catholic Leader, they are known for a life devoted \"to the praise of God and salvation of the world through a stricter separation from the world, the silence of solitude, and assiduous prayer and penance.\"\n\nIn an email to supporters last week, Matson said, \"I live in a hermitage at the top of a wooded hill, which I share with my German Shepherd rescue, Odie, and with the Blessed Sacrament, which was installed in my oratory shortly before Christmas.\"\n\nHe did not disclose where he lives in Pikeville, but said he is well known in the community for his work with local theater groups.\n\nMost of his days are spent in quiet prayer, and afternoons and evenings are devoted to his theater work. Last year, he performed \"Every Brilliant Thing\" Duncan McMillan as part of the community's suicide prevention work.\n\nJourney to Pikeville\n\nMatson grew up in Texas and Virginia as a Presbyterian. He attended college at New York University, where he transitioned.\n\nHe went to graduate school at Loyola University Maryland.\n\n\"It was my first time in a Catholic environment -- I was very drawn to the beauty of the liturgy, but also to the Jesuit approach to education, which is care of the whole person, and the sense of Catholic education project in a rich intellectual history.\"\n\nMatson went to Oxford University in England to study theology, which is where he converted to Catholicism in 2010. But as an openly transgender man, he could not find a religious home.\n\nHe was rejected by the Jesuits and other orders for being transgender. He became a Benedictine oblate, a lay person associated with a monastery. But he still wanted to work with other artists and LGBTQ people who wanted to practice their faith within the Church and could not find a path.\n\nFinally, a friend connected him to Bishop John Stowe, who was known for his outreach to the LGBTQ community. In a speech he gave in 2022, he said: \"I believe that my first words to you and to the LGBT community in the church must be the same: 'I love you.'\"\n\nStowe was unavailable to speak to the Herald-Leader. But he told Religion News Service: \"My willingness to be open to him is because it's a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church. Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life ... but they can be either male or female.\n\n\"Because there's no pursuit of priesthood or engagement in sacramental ministry, and because the hermit is a relatively quiet and secluded type of vocation, I didn't see any harm in letting him live this vocation.\"\n\nMatson said that Stowe has been an inspiration to him as a religious leader.\n\n\"He wants to preach the Gospel regardless of consequences,\" Matson said.\n\n\"He's trying to serve the church by saying things about care for creation, care for immigrants, care for the LGBTQ community. He preaches it whether or not it's politically palatable. I'm so inspired by his courage and his love for Christ and the church and the Gospel.\"\n\n'Language of love'\n\nPope Francis has slowly created more tolerance for LGBTQ Catholics, although same-sex marriage is still forbidden. Last year, the Vatican said it was allowed under certain circumstances, for transgender people to be baptized as Catholics and serve as godparents.\n\nMatson believes he is the first openly transgender person in his position in the church. So, will there be consequences from the Vatican for Brother Christian and Bishop Stowe?\n\n\"I would hope not,\" said Stan \"JR\" Zerkowski, the director of the Lexington Diocese's LGBTQ ministry and the author of \"Coming Out and Coming Home: A Gay Catholic Man's Journey from Marginalization to Ministry, with a Few Miracles Along the Way.\"\n\n\"I think this is an incredibly positive step for dialogue in the church and for transgender people to witness to their faith in heroic ways,\" Zerkowski said.\n\n\"I think Brother Christian is heroic -- the church has neither spoken kindly nor been kind to transgender people, and he still views service to the Lord and to the church as something far greater than something that would cause most people to back down. That's heroic faith.\"\n\nZerkowski was thrilled Matson made his announcement on Pentecost.\n\n\"People said, 'The Apostles are drunk, they're crazy, they're speaking in languages people don't understand,'\" he said.\n\n\"It's almost as if a new Pentecost is being called for in the Church. Brother Christian is asking them to speak a new language of love, and not just toward transgender people but a new language of love that transgender people have for the church.\n\n\"If that's not the Holy Spirit that has prompted this entire thing, then quite frankly, I'm in the wrong business.\"\n\nZerkowski believes Matson's story is a perfect example of how God works in incredibly powerful ways.\n\n\"One of the powerful ways is to see this humble servant of the Lord living in Eastern Kentucky, not looking for fanfare but wanting to say this is who I am, this is how the Lord inspired me, and this is my gift to the Church ... myself. And he's asking the church to do two things -- can you accept my gift, and can you accept the gift of people like me who want to gift themselves. Can the church understand this new language of love?\"\n\nMatson said he hopes that anyone who is concerned about him would come to him or Bishop Stowe and talk to them.\n\n\"We're both trying to serve the Gospel,\" he said. \"I hope they would say, let's see how we can incorporate your vocation and mission to the church in a way that helps witness all the children God has created in their complexity,\" he said.\n\nMost of all, he wants his story will resonate with others who have been rejected by the Church.\n\n\"My No. 1 hope is that other trans people in the church who want to have a relationship with it look at my story and say oh there's hope for someone in the church to understand me,\" he said.\n\n\"If I'm correct that it's OK to be trans and Catholic, then the church will come to that conclusion because it will be led by the Holy Spirit in all truth,\" he said.\n\n\"If I'm wrong, then I pray God shows me I'm wrong. I have confidence that God will continue to lead the church into the fullness of truth ... if my theological position is true, then the church will eventually get there.\"", "source": {"uri":

He believes he is the first out trans person in his position; although that is difficult to confirm, he is undoubtedly one of very few.\n\nIn Catholicism, a hermit is a person who lives a secluded life devoted to prayer. Hermits are subject to approval by their local diocese, which Matson received from Bishop John Stowe of the Diocese of Lexington, Ky. Matson took his vows as a hermit in 2022 for a one-year commitment, and in 2023 he renewed his vows.\n\nAs a hermit, he has \"lived a life of basically spending half the day in prayer and half the day doing some form of work,\" he told Religion News Service. He writes, acts, and does production work at a theater in the area; he received rave reviews for his 2023 performance in Every Brilliant Thing,a show about grief and resilience.\n\nHe is also an oblate in the church's Benedictine order. An oblate is a member of a religious order who devotes their life to prayer and service to God.\n\nMatson, now 39, had a long journey to finding his place in the church. He grew up in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) but converted to Catholicism in 2010, four years after his gender transition. He had become interested in Catholicism while attending graduate school at Loyola University Maryland. \"It was my first time in a Catholic environment -- I was very drawn to the beauty of the liturgy, but also to the Jesuit approach to education, which is care of the whole person, and the sense of Catholic education project in a rich intellectual history,\" he told the Lexington Herald Leader.\n\nTo the news service, he noted, \"I became Catholic after I transitioned because of the Catholic understanding -- the sacramental understanding -- of the body, of creation, of the desirability of the visible unity of the church and primarily because of the Eucharist.\" The Eucharist is the sacrament of receiving bread and wine, representing the body and blood of Jesus Christ.\n\nHe tried to join various religious orders but was turned away, all while keeping his devotion to the faith. He ran a nonprofit organization for Catholics in the arts in New York City for a time. He was troubled, though, by statements from Pope Francis and other church leaders against gender transition. Francis, sometimes progressive and sometimes not, has spoken out against \"gender theory\" but has met privately with trans people who found him warm and accepting.\n\nEventually, friends of Matson's suggested he contact Stowe, who was known to be liberal on LGBTQ+ issues, so Matson wrote to the bishop in 2020. Matson was open about being a trans man and shared \"his vision for an artists' community and his pull to religious life,\" Religion News Service reports. Stowe replied quickly and with encouragement.\n\n\"It was an enormous relief,\" Matson told the news service. \"I was in tears. I felt my hope revive.\"\n\n\"My willingness to be open to him is because it's a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church,\" Stowe said. \"Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life ... but they can be either male or female. Because there's no pursuit of priesthood or engagement in sacramental ministry, and because the hermit is a relatively quiet and secluded type of vocation, I didn't see any harm in letting him live this vocation.\" Stowe supported Matson's coming-out.\n\nMatson had some political motivations for coming out. \"There are a number of laws getting passed around our country, including in Kentucky, as well as policies being published in the church, that are making life more difficult for transgender people and are based on faulty assumptions about them,\" he told the Herald Leader.\n\nMatson is receiving much praise. \"I think Brother Christian is heroic -- the church has neither spoken kindly nor been kind to transgender people, and he still views service to the Lord and to the church as something far greater than something that would cause most people to back down. That's heroic faith,\" Stan \"JR\" Zerkowski, the director of the Lexington Diocese's LGBTQ ministry, told the paper.\n\n\"Brother Christian has long sought to consecrate his life to Christ in the Church by living the evangelical counsels of poverty, chastity and obedience. He has consistently been accompanied by a competent spiritual director and has undergone formation in the Benedictine tradition,\" the Catholic Diocese of Lexington said in a statement, according to Newsweek. \"He does not seek ordination, but has professed a rule of life that allows him to support himself financially by continuing his work in the arts and to live a life of contemplation in a private hermitage. Bishop John Stowe, OFM Conv., accepted his profession and is grateful to Brother Christian for his witness of discipleship, integrity and contemplative prayer for the Church.\"", "source": {"uri":

He has consistently been accompanied by a competent spiritual director and has undergone formation in the Benedictine tradition,\" the statement from the diocese said.\n\n\"He does not seek ordination, but has professed a rule of life that allows him to support himself financially by continuing his work in the arts and to live a life of contemplation in a private hermitage. Bishop John Stowe, OFM Conv., accepted his profession and is grateful to Brother Christian for his witness of discipleship, integrity and contemplative prayer for the Church,\" the statement added.\n\nLast week, Matson spoke with the Religious News Service, following approval from the bishop, and said that he was planning to come out as transgender.\n\n\"You've got to deal with us, because God has called us into this church,\" Matson told the outlet. \"It's not your church to kick us out of -- this is God's church, and God has called us and engrafted us into it.\"\n\nThe Vatican published a 20-page declaration last month titled the \"Infinite Dignity,\" in which Pope Francis discussed the Catholic Church's views on transgender individuals. The declaration said God created men and women as biologically different beings, and that no one should try to alter that plan or \"make oneself God.\"\n\nThe Vatican said that gender-affirming surgery violates God's gift of human dignity as attempting to play God on the surgeon's table during a \"sex-change intervention.\"\n\nAccording to the Religious News Service, Matson converted to Catholicism in 2010, four years after he underwent his transition. Matson was later rejected by many Catholic communities, after being advised to consider becoming a diocesan hermit.\n\nIn 2020, Stowe received a letter from Matson and the bishop expressed openness to allowing him to join his diocese, the Religious News Service reported.\n\n\"My willingness to be open to him is because it's a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church.

RNS and AP partner on some religion news content. RNS is solely responsible for this story.\n\n___\n\nMatson, who is also a Benedictine oblate, believes he is the first openly transgender person in his position in the Catholic Church. It is a difficult claim to confirm -- even Stowe told RNS he did not know for sure if Matson is the first -- but Matson's status is at least highly unusual and comes at a time when church officials are grappling with how to address transgender Catholics.\n\nAccording to Matson, 39, his \"disclosing,\" as he describes it, is a moment years in the making. He offered his story as indicative of the often difficult path for trans Catholics, including those seeking life as a religious -- a category that includes brothers and nuns.\n\n\"I am currently based in the Appalachian mountains of eastern Kentucky,\" he wrote in an email to friends and supporters on Sunday. \"I live in a hermitage at the top of a wooded hill, which I share with my German Shepherd rescue, Odie, and with the Blessed Sacrament, which was installed in my oratory shortly before Christmas.\"\n\nRaised in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Matson converted to Catholicism in 2010 -- four years, he noted, after transitioning in college, a step he refers to as a part of his \"medical history\" rather than a \"central part of my personal identity.\" After his conversion, Matson felt called to minister to people working in the arts, but knew he would encounter \"issues\" because of a 2000 Vatican document that, according to a Catholic News Service report from the time, declared that anyone who had undergone \"sex-change\" was ineligible \"to marry, be ordained to the priesthood or enter religious life.\"\n\nMatson approached a canon lawyer to discuss his options and was told that only two aspects of Catholic life were categorically off the table: marriage and the priesthood. According to Matson, the canon lawyer recommended being upfront about his status as a transgender man in any vocational conversations with church leaders and mentioned the role of a diocesan hermit, which could prove less challenging than enlisting with an existing religious order.\n\nThe canon lawyer, Matson said, effectively conveyed that \"there's no problem as long as there's a bishop who will accept you, because there's no distinction by sex and you're not in a community -- you're by yourself.\"\n\nWhat followed was roughly a decade of searching and no small amount of rejection. Living in the United Kingdom while pursuing a master's degree, and later a Ph.D. in theology, Matson entered a vocational discernment program and approached the Jesuit order to ask if he could join.\n\n\"They said, 'No, we just don't see how this would work for us,' which was crushing, because that's where I felt called,\" Matson said.\n\nOther communities offered similar responses, when they responded at all. \"People who knew me said, 'You clearly have a religious vocation,' and these were all people who knew my medical history,\" Matson said. \"But when they would go to the people in the community in charge of making that decision, they ... would often just refuse to even meet with me.\"\n\nIn one instance, Matson said, a religious leader declined to meet simply to hear his experience as a trans man, saying doing so would be \"a waste of time.\"\n\nBut Matson's call to religious life wouldn't abate. While visiting a monastery during a retreat, he found himself unable to sleep, consumed with the idea of starting \"a religious community of and for artists -- artists who are living together, (operating) in the church through their art, and ministering to the loneliness and sense of precarity many artists experience.\"\n\nIn 2015, he returned to New York City, where he had attended college. Having already taken private vows of poverty, chastity and obedience -- witnessed by his spiritual director -- before he arrived, he co-created a nonprofit called the Catholic Artist Connection. The group hosted retreats and connected artists to resources such as the Archdiocese of New York's Sheen Center for Thought and Culture, where Matson began working as a programming associate.\n\nMatson kept running into artists who wanted to pursue religious life, he said, and continued to feel the tug himself. But roadblocks kept appearing. \"As I spoke to friends in the archdiocese, I knew somebody with a trans background was never going to be accepted into religious life in the Archdiocese of New York,\" Matson said.\n\nHe tried again after a move to Minnesota in 2018, but his entreaties to various religious communities and orders were also rejected.\n\n\"I thought, well, if I can't find a religious community to sponsor me, maybe what I need is a bishop,\" Matson said.\n\nA priest friend recommended different bishops to contact, beginning with Stowe, who was emerging as a leading voice among Catholics calling for a more tolerant approach to LGBTQ+ people. In 2020, Matson sent Stowe a letter, conveying his status as a transgender man, his vision for an artists' community and his pull to religious life.\n\nStowe wrote back immediately, expressing his openness.\n\n\"It was an enormous relief,\" Matson said. \"I was in tears. I felt my hope revive.\"\n\nStowe confirmed Matson's account, saying the then-aspiring brother was recommended to him by a number of people.\n\n\"My willingness to be open to him is because it's a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church,\" Stowe said of Matson. \"Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life ... but they can be either male or female. Because there's no pursuit of priesthood or engagement in sacramental ministry, and because the hermit is a relatively quiet and secluded type of vocation, I didn't see any harm in letting him live this vocation.\"\n\nHe added that Matson's spiritual journey was \"consistent with the calling of that particular vocation.\"\n\nMatson moved to Kentucky, having already made progress on Stowe's suggestion that he link up with an additional community through which to experience religious life. Matson entered the novitiate at a Benedictine monastery in 2021, hoping the formation offered by that path would eventually help him form a new religious community for artists.\n\nFinally, in August 2022, Matson took his first vows as a diocesan hermit -- a yearlong commitment -- under Stowe's direction.\n\nFor the next year, Matson \"lived a life of basically spending half the day in prayer and half the day doing some form of work\" that included producing and writing at a local theater.\n\nThree years earlier, Matson read with frustration a document issued by the Vatican's Congregation for Catholic Education titled \"Male and Female He Created Them: Toward a Path of Dialogue on the Question of Gender Theory in Education.\" The instructional letter rejected \"calls for public recognition of the right to choose one's gender.\"\n\nIn 2021, the Diocese of Marquette, in Michigan, followed with its own instruction to priests to refuse transgender people asking to be baptized or confirmed until they have \"repented.\"\n\n\"It was suddenly becoming a lot more difficult in the church to be trans,\" Matson said.\n\nBut tolerance seems to be growing in some quarters. While Pope Francis has opposed elements of gender theory and recently called its proposals \"ugly,\" he has also met and dined with groups of transgender people.\n\nIn November 2023, the Vatican doctrine department ruled that transgender people may be baptized and serve as witnesses at Catholic weddings, so long as doing so \"doesn't cause scandal among the faithful.\"\n\nIn the United States in March, a coalition led by Catholic nuns released a letter voicing support for transgender, nonbinary and gender-expansive individuals, implicitly rebuking a statement put forward by a group of U.S. Catholic bishops discouraging Catholic health care groups from performing various gender-affirming medical procedures.\n\nBut overall, \"Vatican-level documents that have come out on the subject have not engaged with the science at all,\" Matson said, adding that he believes many diocesan-level statements are inconsistent in their attempts to categorize gender and cite scientific studies misleadingly. Matson has sent multiple private letters to Vatican offices, urging them to engage with transgender people and arguing that the church can embrace transgender people while maintaining orthodoxy.\n\nAs trans rights began to be debated in statehouses across the United States in recent months, conservative lawmakers have begun pushing bans on providing gender-affirming care for youth and, in some cases, adults.\n\nMatson vented his frustrations to Stowe and his spiritual director, saying he wanted to speak out. But he said he was advised to first \"build a foundation\" in religious life for several years.\n\nDuring that time, Matson had an experience that shook him. Attending a friend's play in his religious habit, he was approached by a student who identified as trans and nonbinary. After asking if Matson was a monk, the student said they were raised Catholic, but that their parents had rejected their identity, and the student felt like they \"don't have a place in the church anymore.\"\n\nMatson responded by saying there were people in the church who would support the student, and Matson prayed with them, asking God to show the student how they are \"wonderful the way you've made them.\" The student, Matson said, grew emotional, thanking the hermit profusely and saying, \"No one from the church has ever affirmed me for who I am.\"\n\nMatson, who renewed his vows in 2023, eventually began mulling a date to go public with his status. \"I have to say something,\" Matson told his spiritual director. He settled on Pentecost, which emphasizes preaching \"the good news of God's love to everyone,\" he said. It was also the day in the church calendar when he'd been baptized years before.\n\n\"I can't stand by and let this false and, at times, culpably ignorant understanding of what it means to be transgender continue to hurt people,\" he said. \"If I don't say anything and allow the church to continue to make decisions based on incorrect information, then I'm not serving the church.\"\n\nBoth Matson and Stowe said they are bracing for blowback after Sunday's announcement. Matson said he is largely unconcerned with \"online trolls\" but is sensitive to people who are \"legitimately concerned\" that \"accepting a trans person into religious life means Catholic anthropology gets thrown out the window.\"\n\nFor people with such concerns, he said, he looks forward to engaging in dialogue. \"I don't have a hidden agenda, I just want to serve the church,\" he said. \"People can believe that or not.\"\n\nBoth the hermit and his bishop are prepared for the possibility that church officials may push for Matson's removal. Stowe acknowledged that \"if I'm told to by higher authorities, then I will have to deal with that at the time.\"\n\nAs for ever leaving Catholicism itself, Matson bristled at the idea, calling the church \"my family.\" \"I'm Catholic,\" he said. \"I became Catholic after I transitioned because of the Catholic understanding -- the sacramental understanding -- of the body, of creation, of the desirability of the visible unity of the church and primarily because of the Eucharist.\"\n\nAt the very least, Matson said, he hopes going public will spark dialogue about his fellow transgender Catholics, a discussion he believes can enhance unity among the body of believers.\n\n\"You've got to deal with us, because God has called us into this church,\" he said. \"It's not your church to kick us out of -- this is God's church, and God has called us and engrafted us into it.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 Religion News Service LLC.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Ap State Catholic Transgender Hermit Kentucky Gender Lgbtq People Religion Roman Catholicism U.s.

The 39-year-old was raised in the Presbyterian Church but converted to Catholicism in 2010, four years after starting to transition genders.\n\nMatson declared the intention to come out in an interview with Religious News Service with the permission of Bishop John Stowe of the Diocese of Lexington.\n\n\"You've got to deal with us because God has called us into this church,\" Matson was quoted as saying. \"It's not your church to kick us out of -- this is God's church, and God has called us and engrafted us into it.\"\n\nAccording to the report, Matson felt a calling to minister to people in the arts after converting to Catholicism in 2010. However, a document completed by the Vatican in 2000 concludes that sex-change surgeries are \"superficial\" and do not change whether an individual was born male or female. The document answered the question about whether a woman who underwent a sex-change operation could serve as a priest, a role in the Church that can only be served by men.\n\nAfter various religious communities and orders rejected Matson, a friend suggested reaching out to Stowe. The bishop is known for attempting to reach out to the LGBT community.\n\nMatson wrote Stowe a letter in 2020 expressing the call to enter religious life as a trans-identified person. Matson eventually took vows as a diocesan hermit in August 2022.\n\n\"Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life ... but they can be either male or female,\" Stowe said of Matson. \"Because there's no pursuit of priesthood or engagement in sacramental ministry, and because the hermit is a relatively quiet and secluded type of vocation, I didn't see any harm in letting him live this vocation.\"\n\nIn a phone interview with the Lexington Herald-Leader published Tuesday, Matson cited laws passed in Kentucky and other parts of the country and \"policies being published in the Church, that are making life more difficult for transgender people and are based on faulty assumptions about them.\"\n\nLast year, Kentucky passed a law banning cosmetic sex change surgeries and puberty-blocking drugs for minors with gender dysphoria. In April, the Vatican published \"Infinite Dignity,\" a declaration that said \"that human life in all its dimensions, both physical and spiritual, is a gift from God.\"\n\n\"Another prominent aspect of gender theory is that it intends to deny the greatest possible difference that exists between living beings: sexual difference. This foundational difference is not only the greatest imaginable difference but is also the most beautiful and most powerful of them,\" the document stated. \"In the male-female couple, this difference achieves the most marvelous of reciprocities. It thus becomes the source of that miracle that never ceases to surprise us: the arrival of new human beings in the world.\"\n\nIn November 2023, the Vatican's doctrinal office released a document stating that trans-identified individuals can be baptized and serve as godparents in some circumstances.\n\nThe guidance says that people who have undergone sex-change surgeries or have taken cross-sex hormones can be baptized, provided \"there are no situations in which there is a risk of generating public scandal or disorientation among the faithful.\"\n\nRegarding whether a trans-identified person can serve as the godparent of a baptized child, the guidance stressed it \"can be allowed under certain conditions\" but noted that serving as a godparent is not a right. The document clarified that \"pastoral prudence demands that it should not be allowed if there is a danger of scandal, undue legitimization, or confusion in the educational sphere of the ecclesial community.\"", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hermit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "God"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Stowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecrated_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consecrated life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pentecost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Spirit", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holy Spirit"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vocation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presbyterianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Priest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sacrament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington_Herald-Leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lexington Herald-Leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godparent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Godparent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_dysphoria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender dysphoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gender studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prudence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prudence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoral", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pastoral"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Fictional", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Fictional", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/25/96/259648.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586999", "eventUri": "eng-9586999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

She converted to Catholicism in 2010, four years after beginning an attempted gender transition, the publication reported, and quickly became interested in challenging Vatican teaching on priesthood and ordination.\n\nThe trans-identifying individual indicated that she decided to go public with her transgender identity out of a desire to further challenge Catholic Church teaching, such as the Vatican's Congregation for Catholic Education titled \"Male and Female He Created Them: Toward a Path of Dialogue on the Question of Gender Theory in Education,\" which condemns \"calls for public recognition of the right to choose one's gender.\"\n\n\"I am currently based in the Appalachian Mountains of eastern Kentucky,\" Matson wrote in an email on Sunday published by Religion News Service. \"I live in a hermitage at the top of a wooded hill, which I share with my German shepherd rescue, Odie, and with the Blessed Sacrament, which was installed in my oratory shortly before Christmas.\"\n\nIn her interview with RNS, Matson shared that she kept trying to join male religious orders and kept being rejected.\n\n\"I thought, well, if I can't find a religious community to sponsor me, maybe what I need is a bishop,\" Matson told the publication.\n\nStowe, who is bishop of the Diocese of Lexington, gave a statement to the publication that repeatedly used male pronouns to refer to Matson.\n\n\"My willingness to be open to him is because it's a sincere person seeking a way to serve the church,\" the bishop said. \"Hermits are a rarely used form of religious life ... but they can be either male or female. Because there's no pursuit of priesthood or engagement in sacramental ministry, and because the hermit is a relatively quiet and secluded type of vocation, I didn't see any harm in letting him live this vocation.\"\n\nThe Vatican did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this article.", "source": {"uri": "dailysignal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Signal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_margaret_olohan@dailysignal.com", "name": "Mary Margaret Olohan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Diocese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Christianity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bishop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Lexington", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roman Catholic Diocese of Lexington"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical_counsels", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Evangelical counsels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catholic Church"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stowe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Stowe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mysticism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian mysticism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consecration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ordination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Heritage Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pentecost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciple_(Christianity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Disciple (Christianity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_transition", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender transition"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedictines", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benedictines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claretians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Claretians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_News_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion News Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_direction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spiritual direction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitage_(religious_retreat)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hermitage (religious retreat)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hermit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemplation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contemplation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Holy See"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Christianity", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Christianity", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Religion_and_Spirituality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Religion and Spirituality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative_Lifestyles", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Alternative Lifestyles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Scientology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Scientology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://first-heritage-foundation.s3.amazonaws.com/live_files/2024/05/Screenshot-2024-05-21-at-2.57.53-PM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9586999", "eventUri": "eng-9586999", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

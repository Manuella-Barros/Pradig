'They usually end up forgotten, scorned and alone.'\n\nHe then pointed to the fact that Ms Payman won her seat in WA with only 1,600 below-the-line votes of the 500,000 overall votes the party received.\n\n'A rat with 1600 votes whose only issue is a non-issue for the majority of people in the state she's supposed to represent as a Labor Senator will disappear quicker than most rats,' he wrote.\n\nIn a further comment, he then took aim at Ms Payman's comments about her experience fleeing to Pakistan from Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, before her family settled in Perth as refugees.\n\n'My family did not flee from a war-torn country to come here as refugees for me to remain silent when I see atrocities inflicted on innocent people,' she said during her press conference on Thursday, fighting back tears.\n\nMr Davison wrote: 'And to say she's the only person in the Labor caucus whose known hardship is the embodiment of an arrogant self serving lie.\n\n'She's a petulant, childish, individualist who has betrayed her party & Western Australia She should resign now and stand as an independent at the election.'\n\nMs Payman did not suggest she was the only person in caucus to have undergone hardship.\n\nAnother X user, Matt Martin, echoed the sentiment: 'I've been involved in many upper house selection ballots in the ALP - both state and senate - and I can assure you Fatima Payman is a rat.\n\n'She knew what she signed up for and she should be expelled from the Party.'\n\nHowever, in a sign of the divisions within the party, the NSW Young Labor Left branch welcomed Ms Payman's decision to join the crossbench.\n\nShe will feature speak at an event organised by the branch called 'Palestine and the labour movement' next Tuesday.\n\nMs Payman will appear via Zoom. Other speakers include NSW state Labor MP Anthony D'Adam and Erima Dall, a Maritime Union of Australia delegate.\n\n'Forcing action over Israel's genocide in Gaza still requires a bigger and more powerful movement for Palestine,' the event description read.\n\n'Unions have supported many past social movements, but most are yet to throw their full backing behind Palestine.\n\n'In the run up to the protest at the NSW Labor conference, this forum will discuss the links between unions and the Labor Party and how we can win greater support among Labor members and the labour movement.'",

In one respect, the three are the same. Technically speaking, they have been directly chosen by the people of Victoria and Western Australia. Therefore, the fact of leaving a big party is irrelevant. They can sit as independents until their terms expire. The three senators are David Van (a Victorian ex-Liberal), Lidia Thorpe (a Victorian ex-Green) and Fatima Payman (a Western Australian ex-Labor senator). Van differs from the other two in that his term expires on 30 June 2025 from which point he will, I confidently predict, no longer be a senator.\n\nDavid Pocock from the ACT is the only independent actually elected as an independent, but there are now five altogether, Pocock, Van, Thorpe, Payman and Tammy Tyrrell (Tasmania) who was elected under the Jacquie Lambie Network but recently decided to be an independent. That means the state of parties is now 31 for the Coalition, 25 Labor, 11 Greens, two from Pauline Hanson's One Nation party, one for the United Australia Party plus Jacquie Lambie and the five independents named above.\n\nThough senators are technically described as \"directly chosen by the people\", every schoolboy knows that the disgraceful Australian Senate voting system is not really one of direct election. The ballot paper, supplemented by the propaganda and misinformation pumped out by the Australian Electoral Commission, \"educates\" voters to know that the purpose of the vote is to distribute numbers of party machine appointments between political parties according to a formula of proportional representation between political parties. The dishonest ballot paper has not been designed according to any democratic principle. It has been rigged to ensure that big parties get their senators elected in the \"correct\" order - the order determined by the big-party machines.\n\nThorpe and Payman enjoy terms expiring on 30 June 2028. That is their main similarity. Neither needs re-election next year. Both, however, have been foolish in giving up probable re-election in 2028, which is quite likely to see eight senators elected from each state as part of a Senate electoral reform designed to improve Senate voting but also to increase the number of members of the House of Representatives by some 24 or 25 seats in 2028. Whereas there will be 150 members elected to the House of Representatives next year, that number is likely to be 174 or 175 in 2028.\n\nThe reason for the above is the requirement of section 24 of the Constitution that the number of members of the lower house shall be as nearly as practicable twice the number of senators. Since I don't admire either Thorpe or Payman, I think both are foolish to give up what might have been a long-term career in the Senate. Those who are filled with such admiration, by contrast with me, might well argue that they have shown principles that led to their defiant attitude towards the party that gave their seats to them. Thorpe is more problematic than Payman. The WA senator seems to be a likeable politician - something I can't say about Thorpe who looks troublesome to me. The reason why I don't admire Payman is that, to me anyway, she has attacked Albanese and Labor because they are not antisemitic enough for her.\n\nOne respect in which the two differ relates to the extent to which their election was generally expected. Thorpe was guaranteed election, but Payman won her seat from the third position caused by Labor's unexpectedly high vote in Western Australia in May 2022. In Victoria, an elector who placed the number \"1\" above the line for Group G (The Greens) must have known that vote would be counted as a first preference for Lidia Thorpe who was guaranteed election from the top Greens position.\n\nBy contrast, the Western Australian elector who placed the number \"1\" above the line for Group D (Australian Labor Party) may well have heard of Senator Lines and Senator Sterle but would be very unlikely to have heard of the third candidate Payman. Since the system is one of pretend candidate-base (while actually being party-based) that above-the-line vote was read as being \"1\" for Sue Lines, \"2\" for Glenn Sterle, \"3\" for Fatima Payman and \"4\" for Vicki Helps, all Labor candidates.\n\nLet me give the statistics from the May 2022 WA Senate election. The total formal vote was 1,526,123 meaning that the quota for election was 218,018 votes. The counting began with Sue Lines winning the first seat. Her first preference vote was counted as being 523,139, that being made up of Labor's above-the-line vote of 511,226 plus her own below-the-line vote of 11,913. Below-the-line votes for the other Labor candidates were 1,285 for Sterle, 1,681 for Payman and 1,214 for Helps. The only other candidate to win on the first count was the Liberal Party's Michaelia Cash whose vote, in principle, was made up like that for Lines. The Liberal Party vote being lower than that for Labor one other Liberal senator (Dean Smith) was elected and eventually Dorinda Cox of The Greens and Payman were elected.\n\nNow supposing that a case was made against Payman on the ground of her dual citizenship - she is being both Afghan and Australian, then the High Court would declare she had not been eligible to be a candidate and the votes would be recounted as though she had not been on the ballot paper with her preferences distributed accordingly. In that event Helps would replace Payman as the third Labor senator elected in 2022. I don't expect that to happen, and I would be very critical of Labor if it tried to play such a trick.\n\nIn the meantime, Payman and Thorpe are independent senators with four more years to serve. Both have been directly chosen by the people at an election accepted by the High Court as candidate-based and therefore constitutional. What happens thereafter is anyone's guess. My advice to Payman is to join The Greens, the party to which she really belongs. She might be re-elected in 2028 under their banner.", "source": {"uri": "switzer.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Switzer Daily"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

On the one hand, her supporters have branded the newly independent senator a fresh breath of conscience; on the other hand, the Labor faithful have used charming party adjectives to brand her a \"rat\". But it's the displays of ignorance and uninformed assumptions about Islam that has stood out to Muslim journalists, with some branding the industry's coverage of Payman's defection \"disgusting\".\n\nCrikey spoke to a number of Muslim journalists about the Payman affair and what it demonstrates about the fourth estate's relationship with Islam. There are so few Muslim journalists in Australia, especially in Canberra, that no-one would speak to us on the record for fear for their safety or possible professional fallout, with one noting that there had been an exodus of diverse journalists from the industry since October 7.\n\nA number of hot takes have done the rounds in the past week. The Sydney Morning Herald's Parnell Palme McGuinness suggested that the Islamic concept of ummah (community) was out of step with notions of social cohesion, while stablemate Peter Hartcher asked whether Payman was the \"Pauline Hanson of the left\" in becoming a single-issue politician. The Australian Financial Review's Phil Coorey, in an appearance on the ABC's Insiders, described the mere act of political groups organising around Islam (as compared to the Christian Democrats of the late 1990s) \"inflammatory\", while The Australian's Paul Kelly said Payman had \"broken the unwritten rules of multiculturalism\".\n\nDirt pieces run by News Corp featuring former Labor colleagues backgrounding against Payman described her donations to a \"Barbie-hating Islamic TV studio\", and asked whether she had \"questions to answer\" over her dual citizenship with Afghanistan, having fled the now-ruling Taliban for Australia as a refugee in 2003.\n\n(When elected in 2022, Payman and the Labor Party said they had received legal advice that her eligibility to sit in the Parliament was not in question as she had undertaken all reasonable steps to renounce her citizenship. With Australia having since established a special representative to Afghanistan (based in Qatar), it is less clear whether it is now possible for Payman to renounce her citizenship. In any case, Professor Anne Twomey, a constitutional law expert from the University of Sydney, notes a referral from the Senate to the Court of Disputed Returns would be unlikely, given Labor endorsed Payman in the first place with full knowledge of her circumstances.)\n\nIn a piece since edited to include remarks from Payman's press conference on Thursday, the ABC's Patricia Karvelas highlighted apparent concerns from the senator's former caucus colleagues \"over claims [Payman] was being 'guided by God'\":\n\nWhen asked by several colleagues about her view on the amendment being moved by fellow Labor Senator Penny Wong about the need for a two-state solution, [Payman] said it was 'absolutely in God's hands'.\n\nOne journalist Crikey spoke to said the media coverage suggested \"the media doesn't even understand Islam\".\n\n\"Patricia [Karvelas] ran with a story ... because she had no understanding of the religion or what [Payman] was saying,\" they said.\n\nThe journalist said it also rankled to see uninformed coverage surface given all of the lip service employers have paid to the need for diversity in newsrooms.\n\n\"People at my workplace know I'm a Muslim. They can ask me. If they want to do a representative article, they can come and ask me if they want to.\"\n\nAnother journalist said the \"bullying of Fatima Payman is completely reminiscent\" of the bullying they experienced at the hands of their employer since the war intensified.\n\n\"It's been exceptionally triggering to see this all unfold. At times I falsely thought this country's media had progressed in how they cover Muslims but it's just as cheap and nasty as it was post-9/11,\" they said.\n\n\"The wider Australian population has progressed ... but the media are very out of touch with that reality. The fact that a visibly Muslim senator cannot say the word 'inshallah' without a dog-whistling article that leans on 'backgrounding' by anonymous Labor politicians painting Senator Payman as some kind of fundamentalist is pathetic.\n\n\"I think the media for a long time have thought of Muslims as 'fair game', and that is something deeply embedded in how they sell the narrative, leaning on tropes of the extremist or sinister Muslim who has an Islamic agenda.\"\n\nOne reporter told Crikey they expected a response, but not one as intense as they had seen.\n\n\"Disgusting. I knew some would go after her faith, but I never expected it to be this rabid. It goes to show we still have a long way to go in this industry.\"\n\nAnother reporter said \"every time I write about Senator Payman, I am inundated with the most Islamophobic shit I have ever seen,\" telling Crikey the environment \"will only lead to more journalists of colour retreating, disheartened by the utter dehumanisation of their families and communities.\"\n\n\"Media diversity is more than just about superficial representation. It's about having access to misunderstood languages and cultures that will enable newsroom discussions about the merits of what is offered to journalists on background, to be able to properly assess whether it's news, or just plain perpetuating stereotypes and Islamophobia.\"\n\nMariam Veiszadeh, CEO of Media Diversity Australia, told Crikey that her organisation is \"regularly in touch with culturally diverse journalists, some of whom include Australian Muslims, including in the past few weeks as the Senator Payman situation has been unfolding. The sentiments expressed to us confidentially echo the sentiments shared with Crikey anonymously.\"\n\n\"Over the past year as we have been speaking to several journalists there is a growing concern that their diverse backgrounds are tokenised, their lived experiences overlooked, and some have expressed feeling stifled. We have seen several departures from the industry citing these reasons,\" said Veiszadeh.\n\nDisclosure: Daanyal Saeed, like Senator Payman, is a Muslim. In light of the last week of media coverage, some commentators may take the view that this makes him less than objective.\n\nWhat have you made of the media's coverage of the Fatima Payman affair?

Payman faced severe intimidation and bullying from her colleagues following her vote to recognize Palestinian statehood, putting her at odds with the Labor government's official stance.\n\nDriving the news\n\nLast week, pro-Palestinian protesters breached security at Australia's Parliament House to unfurl banners from the roof as Payman quit the government over its direction on the Gaza war.\n\nThe incident occurred on the final sitting day before a five-week break, highlighting the ongoing tensions over Israel's war against Hamas.\n\nThe four protesters managed to gain access to the roof of Parliament House and draped banners with the words \"war crimes\" and \"genocide\" over the building's fa\u00e7ade, known as the Great Verandah. They also displayed the Palestinian rallying cry, \"from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" which remained visible for more than an hour before the protesters were arrested.\n\nWhy it matters\n\nThis incident comes amidst growing concerns and debates surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with many individuals and organizations worldwide expressing their support for the Palestinian cause. The protesters' actions serve as a powerful reminder of the ongoing struggle and the urgent need for a peaceful resolution to the long-standing conflict.\n\nPayman's departure underscores the pervasive Islamophobia in Australian politics.\n\nHer principled stance on Palestinian sovereignty and the subsequent backlash reveal the challenges faced by Muslim politicians. This incident highlights broader issues of religious discrimination and the marginalization of Muslim voices in the political arena.\n\nWho is Fatima Payman?\n\nFatima Payman was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 1995. Her family fled the Taliban and moved to Pakistan before migrating to Australia in 2003.\n\nPayman's father arrived in Australia in 1999 via boat and worked various jobs to support his family. The family settled in Perth, Australia, where Payman attended the Australian Islamic College.\n\nPayman graduated from the Australian Islamic College and later obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Anthropology and Sociology and a Graduate Diploma of Pharmaceutical Science from the University of Western Australia.\n\nShe served as president of Young Labor WA and worked as an organizer for the United Workers Union before becoming an electorate officer for Pierre Yang.\n\nIn the 2022 Australian federal election, Payman was elected to the Australian Senate as a senator for Western Australia. She became the third youngest senator in Australian history.\n\nPayman is the first Muslim woman to wear a hijab in the Australian Parliament.\n\nHer political priorities include increasing political participation from diverse backgrounds, improving early childhood education, and addressing climate change.\n\nIn 2022, Payman was awarded \"Australian Muslim Role Model of the Year.\"\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"My family did not flee from a war-torn country to come here as refugees for me to remain silent when I see atrocities inflicted on innocent people,\" Payman told reporters.\n\nFatima Payman: \"When I told my colleagues that I would be praying and seeking guidance from God, that was in confidence and I did not expect that they would go around telling people almost in a condescending, ridiculing way.\"\n\nNora Amath, Executive Director, Islamophobia Register of Australia: \"The scornful and alarmist tone of the comments referencing God can be seen as mocking an Australian Muslim woman's faith and seem particularly pointed at her Islamic religion, given parliament begins each day of sitting with the Lord's Prayer.\"\n\nMedia watch: The media criticism program denounced the remarks of Payman's former colleagues as blatant \"dog whistling\" to anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\nBetween the lines\n\nThe backlash against Payman included being ostracized by her colleagues and portrayed as an extremist.\n\nRight-wing politicians issued warnings about the potential rise of a \"Muslim political party\" threatening Australia's social cohesion. This incident has exposed the deep-rooted Islamophobia within Australian politics, with Payman's treatment reflecting broader societal attitudes towards Muslims.\n\nWhat's next\n\nPayman will continue her role in the Senate as an independent.\n\nThe Australian government has recently appointed a special envoy to combat antisemitism and plans to appoint an envoy to tackle Islamophobia shortly.\n\nHowever, opposition leader Peter Dutton and his colleagues have expressed concerns about Muslim political representation, revealing a double standard in the treatment of religious minorities in politics.\n\n(With inputs from agencies)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

'They usually end up forgotten, scorned and alone.'\n\nBen Davison is pictured with his wife Van Badham. They run a political podcast together\n\nFatima Payman is pictured during her resignation press conference on Thursday\n\nHe then pointed to the fact that Ms Payman won her seat in WA with only 1,600 below-the-line votes of the 500,000 overall votes the party received.\n\n'A rat with 1600 votes whose only issue is a non-issue for the majority of people in the state she's supposed to represent as a Labor Senator will disappear quicker than most rats,' he wrote.\n\nIn a further comment, he then took aim at Ms Payman's comments about her experience fleeing to Pakistan from Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, before her family settled in Perth as refugees.\n\n'My family did not flee from a war-torn country to come here as refugees for me to remain silent when I see atrocities inflicted on innocent people,' she said during her press conference on Thursday, fighting back tears.\n\nMr Davison wrote: 'And to say she's the only person in the Labor caucus whose known hardship is the embodiment of an arrogant self serving lie.\n\n'She's a petulant, childish, individualist who has betrayed her party & Western Australia She should resign now and stand as an independent at the election.'\n\nMs Payman did not suggest she was the only person in caucus to have undergone hardship.\n\nBen Davison issues a scathing attack on Fatima Payman for leaving the Labor Party (posts pictured)\n\nAnother ALP supporter Matt Martin also slammed the senator for crossing the floor (pictured)\n\nAnother X user, Matt Martin, echoed the sentiment: 'I've been involved in many upper house selection ballots in the ALP - both state and senate - and I can assure you Fatima Payman is a rat.\n\n'She knew what she signed up for and she should be expelled from the Party.'\n\nHowever, in a sign of the divisions within the party, the NSW Young Labor Left branch welcomed Ms Payman's decision to join the crossbench.\n\nShe will feature speak at an event organised by the branch called 'Palestine and the labour movement' next Tuesday.\n\nMs Payman will appear via Zoom. Other speakers include NSW state Labor MP Anthony D'Adam and Erima Dall, a Maritime Union of Australia delegate.\n\n'Forcing action over Israel's genocide in Gaza still requires a bigger and more powerful movement for Palestine,' the event description read.\n\n'Unions have supported many past social movements, but most are yet to throw their full backing behind Palestine.\n\n'In the run up to the protest at the NSW Labor conference, this forum will discuss the links between unions and the Labor Party and how we can win greater support among Labor members and the labour movement.'\n\nRead

I feel sympathy for Senator Fatima Payman but appreciate the challenge that her identity and conscience present to the party's powerbrokers.\n\nFrom time to time all political groupings have to deal with internal stresses, sometimes by total expulsions, formal splits, the formation of coalitions (or secret agreements) or simply respect for differences (remember when PM Turnbull was laughed at by fellow Liberals when he stated that his party had no factions?).\n\nThose of us on the left of politics who wish to join the Labor Party are presented with the choice of joining one of the \"factions\" -- the membership of which, over decades, has become very codified and rigid and involves penalties for disobedience to the directives of the leaders of the factions. It is not compulsory to join and be obedient to your faction's directives, but it is undeniable that \"independent thinkers\" face an uphill battle if they intend to stand for office or election.\n\nIn my experience most Labor members are not active members of any faction, apart from the Labor Party itself, but still maintain their party membership to work diligently for the return of a Labor government, and not the advancement of just their faction. Over time, the factions have fought to exercise greater control over preselection and now the vast majority of elected members are members of the dominant factions.\n\nSenator Payman may well sense Labor membership sympathy for her views, but it is far less likely to be shared by those folk who exercise their power through the factions present in caucus. Factions have been shown to be a useful way of managing Labor's internal stresses, but the complex nature of the emerging electorate(s) means that Labor leaders may need to make space for the legitimacy of non-faction activities and commitments. This will require sensitivity and experience, not just greater discipline.\n\nLabor is part of my identity -- a source of both pride and anguish.\n\nHasan Ehdeyhed writes: Speaking as a Palestinian Muslim raised in Australia, the media framing of Senator Payman has been extremely poor and one-sided, so much so that I (and many friends and family) have completely tuned out mainstream media. We get news from directly from social media and publications like Crikey -- I subscribed for the first time just last week due to your balanced coverage on this and detailed analysis on this and many issues.\n\nAs a note, the Muslim Votes initiative is not aiming to instil Sharia or religious law into Australian politics -- I know this as I have sat in a number of its presentations. The aim is to empower and educate a Muslim voting bloc that has previously been apathetic to politics in Australia.\n\nA lot of Muslim voters are first- or second-generation voters who have come from countries without functioning democracies and this mentality has carried on. The group's focus is to educate people on their duty and power as Australian citizens to vote and how they can actually make changes to issues that have deeply affected the community, such as Palestine.\n\nSenator Payman represents the thoughts of a significant proportion of the Muslim population that has been largely marginalised in Australia to date. Instead of the media and politicians approaching us to get this feedback and understand how they can bridge the gap, they have gone the opposite approach and isolated us further.\n\nMarilyn Lake writes: Bernard Keane is spot-on in his suggestion that the political class and associated media -- epitomised by David Speers -- are fuelling a resurgence of the politics of whiteness.\n\nLabor's endless invocation of the imperative of \"social cohesion\" attempts both to diminish and deflect from the outrage of Israel's war on Gaza and enforce a new version of assimilationism at home. And then on top of that, for Albanese to assert that we've never had faith-based politics in Australia is to confirm how historically illiterate and/or hypocritical our politicians really are.\n\nDonald Maclean writes: On Senator Fatima Payman crossing the floor, the issue is how and when to implement ALP policy for recognition of a Palestinian state, given Hamas sparked the predictable Israeli overreaction in Gaza, and is in conflict with Fatah that governs the West Bank.\n\nPayman took the bait, a stunt offered by the Greens who are more concerned with playing divisive politics and stealing Labor seats than dealing with realities and practicalities. She could have abstained.\n\nNeil Dwyer writes: The only reason the Senator Payman issue has not prompted my resignation as a rank-and-file member of the ALP is that I had already resigned by then. I did so in April specifically because of the Albanese government's ongoing failure to call Israel's actions in Gaza for what they are: genocide. Had I not done so in April, I would most certainly be resigning now.\n\nAllan White writes: What is the issue here? The Labor Party rules are what they are. Life is complex and nothing is perfect but the rules have worked okay for 120 years and that's why the party keeps them. Senator Payman joined the party knowing the rules.

She is also a former union organiser. For several months she has been publicly outspoken about Labor needing to do more to defend Palestine.\n\nHer \"crime\" was to break Labor caucus solidarity by crossing the floor to vote with the Greens over -- wait for it -- a Labor policy position that would have recognised a Palestinian state.\n\nThe outrage that has erupted since her decision has included a large amount of Islamophobic attacks.\n\nLabor, the corporate media and the Coalition have fallen over themselves to abuse her.\n\nPayman has been described as a turncoat, a religious zealot and even a non-Australian, motivated by greed.\n\nRoger Cook, Premier of Western Australia, outdid the lot in vileness by indirectly referring to her as \"cane toad poison\".\n\nBut the most disturbing Islamophobic comments have come from Opposition leader Peter Dutton and the Prime Minister.\n\nDutton and Albanese are reacting to The Muslim Vote group blaming Albanese's support for Israel's war on Gaza as a key reason why Muslims are so angry with Labor and support Payman.\n\nDutton's comments about Muslim candidates causing \"disaster\" if elected are nothing short of racist.\n\nUsman Khawaja, Australian cricket's star opening batsman, described them as \"bigotry at its best\" and \"fuelling Islamophobia from the very top\". He also correctly pointed out that MPs play a big role in normalising Islamophobia.\n\nWhile Albanese tried to sound less blatantly racist, he did unfairly target Muslim communities who are saying they are sick of being taken for granted.\n\nAlbanese claimed that if \"faith-based political parties\" ran in elections it would \"undermine social cohesion\".\n\nHypocritically, he ignored all the religious-based Christian values parties, such as Australian Christians, Family First Party and others.\n\nSuch comments show just how worried Albanese and Labor are by the groundswell of pro-Palestine support in long-held Labor seats.\n\nIn the recent British elections, despite Labour's huge victory over the Conservatives, four seats in Muslim constituencies were won by independent candidates standing on pro-Palestinian platforms.\n\nThat could happen here, including in ministers Tony Bourke and Jason Clare's electorates.\n\nBut it is not just electoral losses that motivate dog whistling on the scale we have seen in recent weeks.\n\nIt is also the way Payman's defiance challenges Labor's undemocratic methods for keeping its ranks in check, while serving the needs of capital.\n\nAbiding by the supposed democracy of the Labor caucus is considered to be a more important principle than abiding by policy decided at Labor conferences, such as recognition of a Palestinian state.\n\nLabor decided at its 2023 conference that it: \"Supports the recognition and right of Israel and Palestine to exist as two states within secure and recognised borders; b. Calls on the Australian Government to recognise Palestine as a state; and c. Expects that this issue will be an important priority for the Australian Government.\"\n\nLabor caucus positions are largely decided by party operatives and senior MPs, whose first loyalty is to maintaining the capitalist status-quo, not to respect internal democracy or serve their constituencies.\n\nPayman has done something that Labor's career politicians cannot fathom: she has stood up for a principle and against genocide.\n\nThe real reason behind Labor's bullying and attempted isolation of Payman is to warn any other Labor MP thinking of breaking caucus solidarity that they will receive the same treatment.\n\nHowever Payman is not isolated.\n\nShe has received huge support from unions, Labor 4 Palestine groups, Muslim communities and hundreds of thousands of pro-Palestine

Her action, spurred by the Gaza issue, has intensified Labor fears about the possible impact of the Muslim vote in some of its safe seats at the election.\n\nThe now-independent senator joined the podcast to discuss her decision, the challenges of regrouping as a crossbencher, and the impact of the Muslim vote.\n\nPayman is bluntly against Muslims forming their own party:\n\nI don't think it would be wise to have a Muslim party. And so if I was to advise them, I'd say, don't establish a Muslim party because you need to look at your broader base.\"\n\nIn her position on Palestine, Payman insists she was following Labor's platform:\n\nI understood our platform to be very clear [...] The advocates from Gough Whitlam to Bob Hawke to Paul Keating, all those big Labor giants who have been so outspoken on Palestinians' right to self-determination and statehood. And knowing that the Prime minister himself has advocated for longer than I've been around. For me, I felt like this is the best time. Like, we've come from opposition, into government, we're progressive. We've got our party platform in order. We know what our constituents and rank-and-file members want from us. So, I did not see it as a recipe for disaster.\n\nOn how she'll vote on other issues, Payman styles herself as an independent voice for West Australians:\n\nIt's going to be quite challenging and an interesting new chapter in my life because, obviously, I'll have to go through each piece of legislation, understand how it's going to impact West Australians. Make sure that I know what West Australians need from me as their independent voice in Canberra and then moving forward, make those big decisions. It's no longer just following what the whip or the caucus decide as a whole.\n\nOn her identity, personal and public, she says:\n\nI am a devout Muslim. That's personal and private to me. I try praying five times a day. And I do rely on spiritual guidance. But that's for me. That's personal. When I'm serving the best interests of West Australians, I'll be talking to people. I'll be on the ground. I will listen to their concerns and be their voice in Canberra. And whether that's through a party or me as an independent, [it's] paramount for me to make it clear to everyone that, no, I will not be forming a Muslim party because I represent voices from all backgrounds, people from all walks of life, here in WA.\n\nAsked what message she would give the local Jewish community, Payman says:\n\nI'm very hopeful that in the time to come that there [will be] a ceasefire, to be able to see Israelis and Palestinians be able to live side by side within their own recognised borders, their own states, their own freedoms and liberties. And hopefully that will ease the tensions here in Australia because I believe that we can live in a harmonious society with our differences but focusing more on what brings us together and what the common denominator is here in Australia, and that's that we're all proud Australians.\n\nMichelle Grattan does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation

Curtis\n\nNewly independent senator Fatima Payman could be in line for an extra two staff after she quit the Labor Party -- but she is at the mercy of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to get the additional support.\n\nShe will also have to hire at least five new staff and work out the practicalities of running an independent political office such as how to keep track of constituents without access to the central electoral roll databases the major parties maintain.\n\nThe first-term WA senator quit Labor last week over her frustration with the party's approach to Palestinian statehood and the Gaza conflict.\n\nOn Monday she pledged to visit \"every single town\" in the State to find out what was important to the voters she will represent for another four years.\n\nTheNightlyGet in front of tomorrow's news for FREE\n\nJournalism for the curious Australian across politics, business, culture and opinion.\n\nREAD NOW\n\nPolitical strategists say she now has to decide how she wants to position herself across a broad range of issues while dealing with the practicalities of setting up a fresh office from scratch.\n\nNotre Dame University politics professor Martin Drum said a positive of being in a political party was they provided their MPs with expert advice around legislation.\n\n\"That's much trickier when you're an independent or in a very small party; you have to do all your own research -- and they've got some resources in their own office, but obviously not the same resources that would come from a minister's office or a shadow minister's office,\" he said.\n\n\"So you're dealing with a complete reset of your staff and at the same time, you don't have the same advice on a whole range of issues.\n\n\"I think that she will find it a challenging and isolating experience.\"\n\nPrecedent suggests Senator Payman would be allocated an extra two staff -- known as personal staff -- beyond what she was entitled to as a Labor backbencher.\n\nHer Labor-aligned existing staff are in the process of departing by mutual agreement, as The West revealed last week.\n\nMost minor party and independent members are given additional staff as a recognition of the workload involved in scrutinising every piece of legislation, particularly for senators since the Government does not have a majority in the upper house.\n\nBut it is Mr Albanese's prerogative to allocate these positions.\n\nHe drew the ire of the new \"teal\" independents after the election when he moved to cut the number of staff allocated to crossbenchers after it had crept up on Scott Morrison's watch.\n\nFigures tabled in Senate estimates show that in April, crossbench senators Pauline Hanson, Ralph Babet, Malcolm Roberts, Tammy Tyrell, David Pocock and Lidia Thorpe had two extra staffers on top of their five electorate officers.\n\nSenator Jacqui Lambie had three additional staffers, with the third only appointed until the Royal Commission into defence and veterans suicide wrapped up.\n\nIn the lower house, the independents who were elected in 2022 were allocated one extra staffer while Helen Haines, Bob Katter, Andrew Wilkie, Rebekha Sharkie and Andrew Gee all had two.\n\nSenator David Van, who left the Liberal Party amid allegations of misbehaviour that are still under investigation, has no additional staff.\n\nThe Government increased the number of electorate staff every parliamentarian could hire from four to five last year to alleviate workloads.\n\nMr Albanese's office declined to say whether he would allocate Senator Payman extra staff, and she did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRedbridge pollster Kos Samaras said if Senator Payman wanted to achieve long-term success, she had to build a narrative beyond the issue of the conflict in the Middle East.\n\nYounger people, particularly in outer suburban areas, had become very disenchanted with the major parties, feeling economically abandoned and ignored, Redbridge research over six months of speaking with Senator Payman's generation has found.\n\n\"There's a new class of working class in this country and it is one that is extremely diverse and lacks a political voice,\" Mr Samaras said.\n\n\"If just that's where she chooses to go, I think she'll have plenty to work with.\"\n\nSenator Payman said people who had voted for a Labor Government were telling her it wasn't \"serving their best interests\" anymore.\n\n\"They voted for a change in government, they wanted to see values of justice, equality and freedom upheld and they're just not seeing that,\" she told ABC TV.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails", "source": {"uri": "thewest.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The West Australian"}, "authors":

Or was it just plain old incomprehension and incompetence?\n\nPeople who know about these things tell me that American football lost its thrill once cheap camcorders came on the market. Teams could now film not merely actual games, but every practice from multiple angles. Coaching became a fascinated, endless rewatching of the particular moment when a sequence of play went one way, and one could hear bones cracking beneath a pile of bodies. It is possible, in such circumstances, to conclude that though everything went wrong, the play was right.\n\nWhich brings us to the Albanese government, and the departure of Senator Fatima Payman from Labor. Talk about the sound of bones cracking under a pile-on. From the bleachers it looks like nothing was done right. Anyone with the most basic sense of the world would surely have realised that Senator Payman, an Afghanistan-born Muslim, would feel enormous moral disgust and horror at what is happening in Gaza, and at some point be unable to rubber-stamp Labor's weak position on Palestinian statehood.\n\nThe obvious solution would have been to make this a one-time conscience vote on foreign policy, acknowledge it as a special category, and let the pressure out. Why that hasn't happened has multiple possible explanations. Has Labor been scared straight by the permanent Defence establishment, and told in no uncertain terms that there can't be a sheet of parchment between Australia and the US on this matter?\n\nDid Labor's right-wing Defence establishment enforce this anyway, as sycophants to power who don't need to be bullied into doing the US' bidding? Was it influenced by the Right faction's need to keep the Left -- ostensibly in power -- on a leash? Was it simple, utter, blitheness on the part of Labor, not really understanding that at some point, Payman would not be existentially able to support some of these votes?\n\nTo all of these scenarios, the answer was surely to arrange a situation where a Labor loyalist, and an asset, could acquit her conscience while remaining true to her party. The onus is on the leadership to do that. Politics isn't about imposing rules. That's science. Politics is the art of knowing when the exception applies, when it must apply, and bringing it to fruition. A successful political career of a leader is simply a series of applied exceptions.\n\nThe Labor leadership forced Payman out. The notion that she had engineered this for any length of time (there may have been a little politicking at the end) is surely ludicrous. She has been a teenage Laborista, an early leader, and won the unlikely third place in the 2022 West Australian Laborslide. No-one knocks that back, for reasons political or personal, for the insurgent/fringe world of community campaigns and Glenn Druery, unless they really have to.\n\nLook, there's probably layers within that, who knows. But watching the pile-on and hearing the crunch last week, one could also conclude that Labor was playing triage. That it had concluded that any accommodation with Payman would be a net negative, and the Anglo/European-Australian mainstream would see it as weakness in relation to \"multiculturalism\" etc etc. To be stern and unyielding would then be a ruthless triage that would signal to the mainstream that Labor was not captive to special interests.\n\nThat may well have worked. In the progressive heartland, there were near-universal howls of dismay at Labor's unyieldingness to conscience, of its fetish of caucus etc. Further out, many people had little interest in the politics of caucus solidarity. Most -- I can attest from a week spent in Victorian country newsagents, which are either reflections of the zeitgeist or gully traps of rural cranks -- saw Payman as a troublemaker and Palestinians as terrorists, when they were aware of the story at all. These electorates are not Labor's, but it is reasonable to believe that there is the same moral panic in Mill Park too. So the brutal politics of forcing out a senator gets some reward, or at least cuts the party's losses.\n\nThis case, the rational angle, is strengthened if polling shows that Labor is not being hit as hard in the high Middle Eastern-Australian areas of western Sydney and northern Melbourne as first thought. There is palpable anger with Labor in these areas. But there is perpetual palpable anger in rural seats too, but people always troop back to the Nats in the end. It is going to take a great deal of work and a bit of luck to detach this vote en bloc from Labor. Labor may be counting on that.\n\nBut of course there's always the other explanation, which is simple incomprehension and incompetence. The possibility that European-Australian Laboristas -- Albanese, Plibersek, Marles -- simply have not understood the full moral horror of what has occurred in Gaza. The dimwit section of the press corps certainly hasn't, the dozy suburban mentality at its worst on display in the notion that the politics of Gaza are \"identity politics\", as if it were an argument over whether falafel could be called an Israeli food or not. If the pronouncements of Hartcher et al on this are genuine, then they are either genuinely ignorant, or simply unable to see the significance of what is happening to a non-European people, because they're a non-European people.\n\nThe howl is now going up that Fatima Payman is creating a fractured, religious politics by leaving Labor. One junior senator from WA is doing that, is she? Truly her powers must be awesome. The better explanation for the beginning of the great fracturing is that you can't create the most high-immigrant, multicultural society in the world and then run a Labor Party as if it's 1934 and we're all eating stewed lamb and playing two-up. Albanese Labor, and the Left faction that leads it, has relied on the votes of multiple nationalities, and then betrayed them with the AUKUS deal, which is simply the continuation of American overextension across the world. AUKUS is glued together with Anglicity. It treats non-white people as subject colonials, inside or outside our borders.\n\nThe Labor Right, bound up with the permanent security establishment, are enforcing it on the Left, which is taking it far from unwillingly. Its capacity to do so represents the lag in multiculturalising our polity, which has lagged behind our social multiculturalisation. The two are on a collision course, brought about by the haphazard way we have run immigration over the past decade or so, a true major-party unity ticket. The right is utterly hypocritical on this, conjuring up a fantasy multicultural policy, without which the hundreds of thousands of people streaming in from ancient cultures would all drop all affiliations immediately and subsist on footy and the vegemite song.\n\nIt's either stupid, again, or a cynical way to support high immigration, while beating the progressives over the head about it. The left, well the left won't even admit one can have political positions on the volume of immigration at all, still less that a multi-source fully multiculturalised country must have a process of conscious social integration -- one not reliant on the right's fantasy of assimilation -- which we are not doing.\n\nFracture? Of course we're going to fracture. Our two major cities are gaining huge Chinese populations at the same as we might go to war with it over Taiwan, a Chinese civil dispute. If, like Hartcher and others, you go around thinking that solidarity with your people is \"identity politics\", and that the \"real\" political divide is over interest rates, then of course you will never see this coming. Or you will understand it only in social technocratic terms, as a matter of social cohesion.\n\nBy that logic, no slaughter of your own people, however brutal, justifies crossing the floor God forbid. It is a conclusion you can only come to from within deep and unreflective Anglicity, in which your own ethnicity and its bonds have been so generalised that their history disappears. Like most moral and intelligence defaults, at its root is a failure of the imagination. And a lack of will to imagine the lives of others.\n\nLabor's fault lies not in the enforcement of caucus solidarity -- though its ritualistic clog dancing cry cry over it marked the party as out of step with an individualistic post 60s society, who regarded the performance in amazement. The failure, if it was that at all, is in the choices Labor is making about how exterior powers relate to interior politics, and the belief that these can remain separate. If we are going to play American football, or be one, there are going to be a few painful breaks along the way.\n\nWas Labor's handling of Fatima Payman a political strategy or just plain incompetence?

Payman claims she was exiled by her Labor peers, who reportedly \u201cleaked\u201d to the national broadcaster that she had sought \u201cGod\u2019s guidance\u201d on the issue \u2013 a thinly-veiled attempt to portray her as an extremist.\n\nRight-wing politicians, meanwhile, renewed warnings that Payman\u2019s actions could foster a new \u201cMuslim political party\u201d and threaten Australia\u2019s \u201csocial cohesion\u201d.\n\nHer decision to vote with the Greens to support a motion on Palestinian statehood late last month resulted in her suspension from the Labor caucus.\n\nObserver say her resignation has now exposed the ugly underbelly of Australian politics, where principled stances on sensitive foreign policy issues can result in a politician\u2019s career being unceremoniously derailed.\n\nMedia Watch, a media criticism programme from national broadcaster ABC, denounced Payman\u2019s former colleagues\u2019 remarks as blatant \u201cdog whistling\u201d to anti-Muslim sentiment.\n\nThe Islamophobia Register of Australia, meanwhile, expressed deep concern that the \u201ccurrent tone of political commentary and public discussion\u201d could \u201cinflame\u201d further discrimination against the Muslim community. The organisation\u2019s executive director Nora Amath in a statement blasted \u201cthe scornful and alarmist tone\u201d of the comments referencing God, which she said \u201ccan be seen as mocking an Australian Muslim woman\u2019s faith and seem particularly pointed at her Islamic religion, given parliament begins each day of sitting with the Lord\u2019s Prayer\u201d.\n\nMuslim journalists, speaking anonymously to local publication Crikey, slammed the mainstream media\u2019s tone-deaf handling of Islamic religious terminology like \u201cInshallah\u201d \u2013 a common phrase meaning \u201cif God wills it\u201d \u2013 which Payman had invoked. Some dismissed the furore as a \u201cbeat-up\u201d online, while the senator herself decried being singled out as \u201ca visibly Muslim woman\u201d and said she felt offended and insulted that she would be asked to justify her use of \u201cGod\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhen I told my colleagues that I would be praying and seeking guidance from God, that was in confidence and I did not expect that they would go around telling people almost in a condescending, ridiculing way,\u201d Payman, now an independent senator in parliament, told ABC last week.\n\nThis was not the first time Payman had faced such targeted abuse. Earlier this year, she was subject to cries of \u201cterrorist\u201d in parliament over her vocal support for the Palestinian cause and use of the phrase \u201cfrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\u201d \u2013 deemed by some as antisemitic and sympathetic to extremism.\n\nBy contrast, politicians elsewhere across the Asia-Pacific have taken a more unequivocal stance on the Palestinian crisis.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has emerged as a leading regional voice opposing Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza, while Indonesia\u2019s outgoing President Joko Widodo has vocally condemned the attacks.\n\nCloser to home, the Australian government has sought to address the growing bigotry, appointing a new special envoy to combat antisemitism on Tuesday and pledging an envoy to tackle Islamophobia \u201cshortly\u201d as well.\n\nHowever, the opposition has struck a more ominous tone. Opposition leader Peter Dutton speculated last week that having \u201cMuslim candidates\u201d in a future Labor government would be \u201ca disaster\u201d, while his colleagues have expressed alarm about a perceived \u201cMuslim voices movement\u201d in Australia.\n\nThe Islamophobia Register\u2019s Amath noted the glaring double standard, observing that other faith-based political groups like the Australian Christian Party faced no such vilification. These attitudes, she said, suggested \u201conly Muslim political movements were a problem.\u201d\n\nAnalysts note that the opposition\u2019s concerns were not that a \u201cfaith-based\u201d party could emerge per se, but one that specifically has a Muslim political identity.\n\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s multiculturalism worries over the place of Muslims in Australian society. The country calls itself secular, but retains a Christian identity in culturally ambiguous but nonetheless tangible ways,\u201d said Australian National University Professor of History Frank Bongiorno in an analysis in The Conversation this week.\n\n\u201cMuslims are commended when they conform to the role of model minority in such a society. Explicit support for \u2018Australian values\u2019 is regularly demanded of them in a way no Christian migrant group experiences.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why the media-political class in Australia could not overcome its Islamophobia, Greg Noble, a professor at the Western Sydney University\u2019s Institute for Culture and Society, said Australia has resorted to \u201creducing a complex world into simple answers\u201d, similar to countries like the United States.\n\n\u201c\u2018Islam has long been code in the West for violence, terrorism, despotism, and so on. So rather than try to disentangle complex situations, they opt for scare figures,\u201d Noble told This Week in Asia.\n\n\u201cThe Labor party have effectively backed Payman into a corner by depriving her of the ability to speak publicly about an issue which is of central importance not only to those of Muslim background but to many whose families come from the Middle East.\u201d", "source":

Her action, spurred by the Gaza issue, has intensified Labor fears about the possible impact of the Muslim vote in some of its safe seats at the election.\n\nThe now-independent senator joined the podcast to discuss her decision, the challenges of regrouping as a crossbencher, and the impact of the Muslim vote.\n\nPayman is bluntly against Muslims forming their own party:\n\nI don't think it would be wise to have a Muslim party. And so if I was to advise them, I'd say, don't establish a Muslim party because you need to look at your broader base.\"\n\nIn her position on Palestine, Payman insists she was following Labor's platform:\n\nI understood our platform to be very clear [...] The advocates from Gough Whitlam to Bob Hawke to Paul Keating, all those big Labor giants who have been so outspoken on Palestinians' right to self-determination and statehood. And knowing that the Prime minister himself has advocated for longer than I've been around. For me, I felt like this is the best time. Like, we've come from opposition, into government, we're progressive. We've got our party platform in order. We know what our constituents and rank-and-file members want from us. So, I did not see it as a recipe for disaster.\n\nOn how she'll vote on other issues, Payman styles herself as an independent voice for West Australians:\n\nIt's going to be quite challenging and an interesting new chapter in my life because, obviously, I'll have to go through each piece of legislation, understand how it's going to impact West Australians. Make sure that I know what West Australians need from me as their independent voice in Canberra and then moving forward, make those big decisions. It's no longer just following what the whip or the caucus decide as a whole.\n\nOn her identity, personal and public, she says:\n\nI am a devout Muslim. That's personal and private to me. I try praying five times a day. And I do rely on spiritual guidance. But that's for me. That's personal. When I'm serving the best interests of West Australians, I'll be talking to people. I'll be on the ground. I will listen to their concerns and be their voice in Canberra. And whether that's through a party or me as an independent, [it's] paramount for me to make it clear to everyone that, no, I will not be forming a Muslim party because I represent voices from all backgrounds, people from all walks of life, here in WA.\n\nAsked what message she would give the local Jewish community, Payman says:\n\nI'm very hopeful that in the time to come that there [will be] a ceasefire, to be able to see Israelis and Palestinians be able to live side by side within their own recognised borders, their own states, their own freedoms and liberties.

But what I can say is, I don't think it would be wise to have a Muslim party.\n\n\"And so if I was to advise them, I'd say, don't establish a Muslim party because you need to look at your broader base.\"\n\nDifferent states had different demographics but \"I just don't think that would be conducive to the way things function in our democratic system\".\n\nWhile it was the prerogative of those involved as to whether to go down that route, \"if I was to advise whoever wants to start a party out there [I'd say] think about the bigger picture. Think about Australia as a whole.\n\n\"Think about how we look so different to what we did even 30 years ago. And we're going to keep evolving into this melting pot of incredible cultures and, you know, identities and belief systems. And I think that's just beautiful.\"\n\nLast week Prime Minister Anthony Albanese warned against faith-based parties. He said: \"I [...] don't want Australia to go down the road of faith-based political parties because what that will do is undermine social cohesion\".\n\nPayman pointed out there have been faith-based parties previously, and said a Muslim party would not challenge social cohesion.\n\n\"People are free to do what they want to do and [set up] parties they want to set up. There's the fishers and farmers and all sorts of parties out there. So if people want to go down this route they can.\n\n\"It's incorrect to [...] not just politicise the Muslim faith, but also to make it seem like they're a threat to social cohesion or it's going to impact the way we politically engage.\"\n\nShe said the important thing was to educate the community about their right to vote, how to use it effectively and how to understand the political system.\n\n\"A lot of multicultural communities out there have come from countries where democratic ways of governing is not established or is not a thing. And so for them, voting can be quite an alien concept. And so education is paramount to these communities.\"\n\n\"They have the right to voice their concerns, to voice their opinions and if they think that their elected members or incumbent members are not doing a great job representing their voice, they can they can use the elections as a way of sending a message to their local representatives.\"\n\nPayman said if she were setting up a party - which she hasn't ruled out - \"I would not set up a Muslim-only party. I see the bigger picture of my constituency in Western Australia and know that I represent people from all walks of life.\"\n\nShe said the genocide in Palestine was \"not the only thing that I'm focused on. And that's why it's important for me to immerse myself within the broader West Australian community to understand what are the things that are important to them,\"\n\nShe was not intending to play a major role in mobilising the Muslim vote at the next election.\n\n\"I don't intend on doing that. But more power and strength to as many communities out there who want their voices heard.\"\n\nMichelle Grattan does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Muslims"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation_(website)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Conversation (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatima_Payman", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fatima Payman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Grattan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Grattan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Canberra", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Canberra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbencher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Crossbencher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australian Labor Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Melbourne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Albanese"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting_pot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Melting pot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_United_Kingdom_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2010 United Kingdom general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiculturalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multiculturalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alien (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Western Australia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9716799", "eventUri": "eng-9716799", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

But what I can say is, I don't think it would be wise to have a Muslim party.\n\n\"And so if I was to advise them, I'd say, don't establish a Muslim party because you need to look at your broader base.\"\n\nDifferent states had different demographics but \"I just don't think that would be conducive to the way things function in our democratic system\".\n\nWhile it was the prerogative of those involved as to whether to go down that route, \"if I was to advise whoever wants to start a party out there [I'd say] think about the bigger picture. Think about Australia as a whole.\n\n\"Think about how we look so different to what we did even 30 years ago. And we're going to keep evolving into this melting pot of incredible cultures and, you know, identities and belief systems. And I think that's just beautiful.\"\n\nLast week Prime Minister Anthony Albanese warned against faith-based parties. He said: \"I [...] don't want Australia to go down the road of faith-based political parties because what that will do is undermine social cohesion\".\n\nPayman pointed out there have been faith-based parties previously, and said a Muslim party would not challenge social cohesion.\n\n\"People are free to do what they want to do and [set up] parties they want to set up. There's the fishers and farmers and all sorts of parties out there. So if people want to go down this route they can.\n\n\"It's incorrect to [...] not just politicise the Muslim faith, but also to make it seem like they're a threat to social cohesion or it's going to impact the way we politically engage.\"\n\nShe said the important thing was to educate the community about their right to vote, how to use it effectively and how to understand the political system.\n\n\"A lot of multicultural communities out there have come from countries where democratic ways of governing is not established or is not a thing. And so for them, voting can be quite an alien concept. And so education is paramount to these communities.\"\n\n\"They have the right to voice their concerns, to voice their opinions and if they think that their elected members or incumbent members are not doing a great job representing their voice, they can they can use the elections as a way of sending a message to their local representatives.\"\n\nPayman said if she were setting up a party - which she hasn't ruled out - \"I would not set up a Muslim-only party. I see the bigger picture of my constituency in Western Australia and know that I represent people from all walks of life.\"\n\nShe said the genocide in Palestine was \"not the only thing that I'm focused on. And that's why it's important for me to immerse myself within the broader West Australian community to understand what are the things that are important to them,\"\n\nShe was not intending to play a major role in mobilising the Muslim vote at the next election.\n\n\"I don't intend on doing that.

Payman was effectively forced out of Labor, for taking a limited stand in defence of the Palestinians.\n\nThat formed part of a stepped-up campaign by the government in defence of the Israeli genocide in Gaza, and against all opposition. In little over a week, this has included:\n\n* The government compelling Payman to resign from Labor, because she voted for a Greens motion for token recognition of Palestine. That vote was deemed a breach of caucus solidarity, even though it was in line with formal Labor policy, prompting her indefinite suspension from the caucus. Payman was vilified and pressured to quit parliament altogether by the government leadership, before Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced that she would \"resign\" from Labor, forcing her hand.\n\n* A government frenzy over the prospect of an Islamic political party, even though there is no indication that anyone plans to form such an organisation. Albanese and other Labor leaders have preemptively denounced Muslims for \"isolating\" themselves from the \"Australian community\" and purportedly sowing sectarianism, on the basis of this non-existent organisation. This has been a blatant dog whistle to Islamophobic racism, accompanied by assertions that any concerns about the mass deaths in Gaza are religiously motivated.\n\n* Then on Tuesday, the government appointed businesswoman Jillian Segal to the newly-created position of \"Special Envoy to Combat Antisemitism in Australia.\" Segal is a Zionist lobbyist who has explicitly defended Israel's bombing of hospitals in Gaza, and has publicly demanded the repression of pro-Palestinian protesters, including university students.\n\nThese developments contain important political lessons to take forward the fight against the genocide and imperialist war.\n\nIn the first instance, they demonstrate that Labor has not shifted one iota from its full backing of Israel, even as the Zionist regime perpetrated some of the worst war crimes of the past eighty years. Labor's occasional crocodile tears and words of concern over the mass civilian deaths are a public relations exercise, and camouflage for continuing political, diplomatic and material support for Israel, including through active weapons export permits.\n\nLabor is a party of imperialist war and repression\n\nAmong the most critical lessons is that there is nothing accidental or conjunctural about Labor's alignment with the genocide or its intense hostility to the popular opposition. In their pro-genocide policies, Labor leaders such as Albanese and Foreign Minister Penny Wong are acting in line with the organisation's character as a party of imperialist war.\n\nEven a brief review of its history shows that Labor has supported Australia's participation in every major imperialist war, and has tended to be in office to directly oversee Australia's alignment with major developments in the imperialist war drive.\n\nIt was the Labor government of John Curtin that presided over the shift of Australia's primary allegiance from British to American imperialism amid World War II. As a middle-sized imperialist power, Australia has always pursued its own predatory interests, particularly in the South Pacific, under the umbrella of the dominant power of the day.\n\nThe Labor administration of Ben Chifley was then among the first in the world to recognise the Israeli state, established through a campaign of terror and dispossession against the Palestinians, in 1948.\n\nIn keeping with its complete commitment to the US alliance, Labor supported American imperialism's brutal neo-colonial wars in the Indo-Pacific, including the assault on Korea in the 1950s and the more than decade long onslaught against Vietnam.\n\nThe genocide cannot be understood outside the near 40-year eruption of American militarism. The strategists of US imperialism, confronting its economic decline, viewed the 1991 Stalinist dissolution of the Soviet Union as an opportunity to establish untrammeled global hegemony. Labor was in office at the time, with its CIA-connected Prime Minister Bob Hawke dispatching Australian troops to the first shot of the war drive: the 1991 Gulf War against Iraq.\n\nLabor, then in opposition, also supported the criminal invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 2000s, repeating all of the lies used to justify these massive war crimes, including the fraud that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. Presaging the current Islamophobic campaign, Labor was integral to the demonisation of Muslims associated with the \"war on terror.\" This included its New South Wales state governments, of Bob Carr and then Morris Iemma, waging a racist campaign against \"Lebanese gangs\" which helped to instigate the 2005 anti-Muslim Cronulla race riot.\n\nAnother key turning point occurred with Labor back in office. Having supported a murderous US \"troop surge\" in Afghanistan the year before, in 2011, the Labor government of Julia Gillard aligned Australia with the US \"pivot to Asia,\" a vast military build-up directed against China, which Washington views as the chief threat to its global dominance. Having set in motion the pivot, Labor would also back, from opposition, a racist anti-China campaign that included the bipartisan passage in 2017 of \"foreign interference\" laws that can potentially be used to criminalise opposition to imperialist war.\n\nThe current Albanese Labor administration is completing Australia's transformation into a frontline state for war against China, including through the AUKUS pact and the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines. That is only one component of a vast build-up, including the acquisition of offensive capabilities across all branches of the military, and a huge expansion of US basing arrangements including for nuclear-capable American war planes and submarines.\n\nLabor is supporting the other key plank of American imperialism's global war drive, its proxy war against Russia in Ukraine, which threatens nuclear war in Europe. That has included boosting Australia's contribution to the Ukrainian puppet regime to over $1 billion, including through the dispatch of offensive weaponry.\n\nLabor's backing of the genocide can only be understood in this context. It is one element of the government's involvement in an eruption of imperialist militarism that threatens world war. The onslaught on opposition to the genocide is similarly part of a broader campaign, aimed at creating the conditions to outlaw broader hostility to war.\n\nLabor cannot be pressured to end its support for Israel\n\nThis framework underscores the complete fraud of claims that \"pressure\" can compel Labor to end its support for the Israeli genocide. That line has been advanced for the past nine months by the Greens and various fake-left organisations, even as Labor has defied the most sustained anti-war protests in Australian history.\n\nPayman is a featured speaker at a Sydney meeting next Tuesday called by one such pseudo-left group, Solidarity. Promotion states that \"this forum will discuss the links between unions and the Labor Party and how we can win greater support among Labor members and the labour movement.\" That is, opposition to the genocide must be directed to Labor and its aligned trade union bureaucracy.\n\nLast month, Solidarity's leader Ian Rintoul wrote an article presenting Labor dissidents as the key to ending the Albanese government's support for the genocide. Rintoul presented a tortured and convoluted chain of pressure. Protests would pressure the union leaders, who would help to pressure Labor MPs, and then, when there were enough \"dissident\" parliamentarians, the government would change course.\n\nThe Payman affair further refutes this bankrupt line.\n\nPayman did not criticise the government's complicity in the genocide for the best part of seven months, and repeated its lies, including the demonstrably false claim that Australia has not exported weapons to Israel in the past five years. Payman made very limited criticisms in May and then voted for the Greens motion earlier this month.\n\nFar from resulting in a flowering of opposition within the federal Labor Party, the exact opposite has been the case. Payman's conditional statements were met with a furious attack. And not one of Payman's 103 federal Labor colleagues has so much as criticised the witch-hunt against her!\n\nSolidarity's line, so clearly contradicted by objective reality, is not the result of a misunderstanding. While occasionally employing socialist phraseology, the pseudo-left represents a privileged layer of the upper middle class, ensconced in the trade union bureaucracy, the upper echelons of the public sector and academia. It is tied by a thousand strings to Labor and the union apparatus, and its role is to prevent any independent political struggle by the working class against these pro-capitalist forces.\n\nSolidarity is particularly close to the Maritime Union of Australia (MUA) and its Sydney branch. The pseudo-left group has functioned as the political attorney of the MUA bureaucracy. Solidarity has made excuses for the MUA enforcing the loading and unloading of cargo from the Israeli ZIM shipping line, which in October dedicated its entire fleet to the genocide. Solidarity also covered up and then sought to defuse anger when the MUA invited Albanese, the genocide supporter in chief, as the keynote speaker at the union's annual convention in February.\n\nThe pseudo-left, in other words, is not fighting the genocide, but is doing everything it can to defend the political forces that are directly complicit in the mass murder of the Palestinians.\n\nFighting the genocide means building a socialist anti-war movement\n\nA central mechanism by which the pseudo-left performs this function is by presenting the Gaza genocide as an isolated development, which can be fought through single-issue protest. Many of the pseudo-left groups have actively supported other fronts in the war drive, including through support for the Ukrainian proxy war and depictions of China as an \"expansionist\" threat to the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe experiences of the past nine months, and the global context of a new eruption of war between the major powers, demonstrate in spades that the genocide can only be fought through a struggle against imperialist war generally. That cannot be taken forward by appealing to the very governments overseeing the militarist frenzy, but through a political struggle against them.\n\nThat means connecting the struggle of the working class for its social rights with the fight against war. It is the working class that is and will be made to pay for war, as social programs are slashed and vast funds diverted to the military. There is no brick wall between the attitude of governments, including the Australian Labor administration, to the Palestinians, and their brutal austerity measures targeting workers domestically. This offensive, including the slashing of wages and working conditions, is enforced by the same union bureaucracy that has not taken a single action against the genocide.\n\nThe world Trotskyist movement, the International Committee of the Fourth International, and its affiliated Socialist Equality Parties are the only political tendency advancing the fight against war on the basis of a socialist and internationalist program. We explain that the fight against war must be:\n\n1. Directed against the capitalist nation-state system, the source of conflict. Imperialist wars are a product of the striving of the major powers to overcome their own crisis through the acquisition of resources, markets and profits at the expense of their rivals. As the 20th century demonstrates, unless halted by a socialist movement of the working class, capitalism leads to world war. That alternative is the reorganisation of society on socialist lines, to meet human needs, not the profit drive of the major corporations and banks.\n\n2. International in scope. War can only be fought through the unification of workers internationally in a struggle against their own governments and on the basis of their common class interests.\n\n3. Independent from all of the pro-capitalist parties, as well as the pro-imperialist trade union bureaucracy and the pseudo-left. The working class can only advance its independent interests by breaking with these political forces, which are wedded to the capitalist and nation-state systems.\n\nThis socialist and revolutionary perspective is viable, because it is necessary. There is mass opposition to the genocide and to war, but to go forward, lessons must be drawn and a new path embarked upon. Opponents of the genocide should join and build the Socialist Equality Party. As one component of this struggle, become an electoral member, to ensure there is a genuine anti-capitalist and socialist party on the ballot at the next federal election.\n\nRead moreFatima Payman

In her stance, Fatima urged the ruling Labor Party to honour its promise. She argued that if the Labor Party truly supports a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, it must first recognize the state of Palestine. Notably, a few weeks ago, Labor Party Foreign Minister Senator Penny Wong stated that her government supports a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine issue.\n\nSenator Fatima Payman hails from Western Australia. Born in Kabul, Afghanistan, in 1995, she is the eldest of four siblings. Her family fled to Pakistan to escape the US-led military operations in Afghanistan. Fatima's father arrived in Australia as a refugee by boat in 1999. Initially detained, he was later granted a refugee visa. He worked tirelessly as a kitchen hand, security guard, and taxi driver to support his family and secure their visas. In 2003, when Fatima was five, she, her mother, and her siblings joined her father in Australia.\n\nFatima received her education in Australia, attending an Islamic school in Perth and later graduating with a degree in pharmacy. As the eldest sibling, she worked hard and excelled academically. She first joined the youth wing of the Labor Party in Perth and formed the United Workers Union. Fatima also worked as an electoral officer for Western Australian Labor Party politician Pierre Yang before officially joining the Labor Party.\n\nFatima's political career advanced rapidly. After the 2022 national elections, the Labor Party appointed her as a Senator. Becoming a Senator at such a young age was a significant achievement for Fatima. Unlike many who spent years working at lower levels within the Labor or Liberal Party before earning a provincial or national ticket, Fatima quickly rose to prominence. She is the first Muslim woman parliamentarian in Australia to wear a hijab. Known for her eloquence and natural political talent, she speaks fearlessly both inside and outside the House of Representatives.\n\nFatima Payman has been a vocal advocate for Palestinian rights and has led demonstrations against Israeli actions in Palestine. During Israel's brutal attack on Gaza last October, she was at the forefront, actively opposing Israeli military operations against civilians. Her strong stance drew negative reactions from several senior pro-Israel Labor leaders. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese cautioned Fatima about her outspoken views, urging her to align with party policies. However, she remained steadfast in her convictions.\n\nSenator Fatima's story is a powerful reminder of the impact one individual can have in challenging the status quo and advocating for change.\n\nWhen the Green Party presented a pro-Palestinian resolution in Parliament, Fatima supported it by crossing the floor against the Labor Party's position. Despite warnings from the party and Prime Minister Albanese, she did so again when a second resolution was proposed. Fatima argued that the Labor government's support for a two-state solution was hypocritical without recognizing Palestine as a state.\n\nGreen Party Deputy Leader and Pakistani-descent Senator Mehreen Farooqui strongly supported Fatima, praising her courage and principled stance on Palestine. In an interview with ABC, Farooqui expressed pride in Fatima's actions and welcomed another Muslim woman wearing a headscarf into Australian politics.\n\nFatima's journey is a testament to her resilience and dedication. Her early years in Australia were marked by challenges, as her family navigated the complexities of resettlement. Her father's determination to provide a stable future for his children was a driving force behind Fatima's ambitions. She embraced her new home, excelling in her studies and becoming actively involved in her community.\n\nHer involvement with the Labor Party began in her youth, where she quickly became known for her leadership skills and commitment to social justice. Fatima's work with the United Workers Union highlighted her dedication to workers' rights and equality. Her role as an electoral officer further honed her political acumen, preparing her for the challenges of a parliamentary career.\n\nAs a senator, Fatima has been a powerful voice for marginalized communities. Her speeches in the Senate have been noted for their clarity and passion, often addressing issues of social justice, immigration, and human rights. Her advocacy for Palestinian rights is part of a broader commitment to justice and equality, principles that she has championed throughout her career.\n\nThe controversy surrounding her support for the Green Party's resolution brought her significant attention, both positive and negative. Many within the Labor Party saw her actions as a betrayal, while others praised her courage and integrity. Her stance has sparked a broader conversation about the Labor Party's position on Israel and Palestine, challenging the party to reevaluate its policies and commitments.\n\nFatima's future in politics remains uncertain. Speaking to the media, she said she has not yet decided whether to continue her political career as an independent or form a new party.\n\nDiscussions among Islamic youth are ongoing, with speculation that Fatima and several young Muslims may establish a new political party to unify Australian Muslims and advocate for Palestinian rights. Islamic community media and pro-Palestine groups are giving her significant coverage, highlighting her as a figure of inspiration and leadership.\n\nFatima's story is a powerful reminder of the impact one individual can have in challenging the status quo and advocating for change. Her journey from a refugee to a senator is a testament to her resilience and determination. As she continues to navigate the complex world of politics, her unwavering commitment to justice and equality will undoubtedly inspire many.\n\nThe writer is a Sydney-based journalist, analyst, writer

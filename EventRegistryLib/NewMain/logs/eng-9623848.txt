Check out the post positions for the Belmont Stakes field and the latest Belmont Stakes odds!\n\n**bet365 Belmont odds are not available in the United States\n\nThe post positions and odds for the 2024 Belmont Stakes were assigned on Monday with Sierra Leone favored at 9-5 while looking to avenge a narrow loss in the Kentucky Derby vs. Mystik Dan at Saratoga Race Course this Saturday. The race is not being held at it's traditional home of Belmont Park due to construction, and the third leg of the Triple Crown has been temporarily shortened from 1 1/2-miles to 1 1/4-miles (matching the Kentucky Derby distance) due to the configuration of Saratoga.\n\nThis will be only the 22nd time that the Derby winner and Preakness winner square off in the Belmont. The last time it happened was 2013, when Derby winner Orb was favored over Preakness winner Oxbow. Both lost to Palace Malice, who skipped the Preakness after an off-the-board effort in the Derby.\n\nAnother storyline in the Belmont Stakes field is the Todd Pletcher-trained triumvirate led by Mindframe, who is making his stakes debut in the Belmont. He's crushed the competition in two highly-rated efforts to kick off his career. Pletcher also trains Peter Pan Stakes winner Antiquarian and third-place finisher Protective. The Peter Pan is the local prep for the Belmont and the race Arcangelo won ahead of his 2023 Belmont Stakes score.\n\nQualifying for the Belmont Stakes is a little different from making the grade for the previous two Triple Crown races but still requires a thoroughbred horse to be three years old and come in at a weight of 126 pounds for colts and 121 pounds for fillies.\n\nHorses who finished Top 3 in either the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes are given automatic spots in the Belmont, if they choose to run. Beyond that, every horse wishing to run must be Triple Crown nominated and pay a series of entry fees. As many as 14 horses can be in the Belmont Stakes field.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes is known as \"The Test of the Champion\" because it is the final leg of horse racing's Triple Crown, and typically the longest of the three events at 1 1/2 miles (12 furlongs). However, the 2024 season does not have a Triple Crown contender entering the Belmont, and the race will be run at 1 1/4-miles this year.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes is selective in which type of horses compete in one of the most historic events in North American horse racing, limiting the field to three-year-old thoroughbreds.\n\nThoroughbred horses are known for their long athletic builds and speed, making them ideal for racing. They're sleeker and lighter than other breeds, which is ideal for the length of the Belmont Stakes.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes is limited to three-year-old horses. This age of horse is ideal for racing as they have yet to fully mature and have limited races on their resume, leaving an aura of mystery, but still post fast times and exciting finishes.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orb_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orb (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxbow_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oxbow (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Pan Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_Malice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Palace Malice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(mass)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pound (mass)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furlong", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Furlong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filly", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/f9b39a80-e607-428b-9e1a-556bcca6d15f.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623848", "eventUri": "eng-9623848", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 531, "textEnd": 537}], "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 234, "relevance": 1}

Here's the full race field, with odds.", "body": "The final leg of horse racing's Triple Crown will feature a different venue, and a different distance, compared to normal.\n\nWith Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, out of action due to ongoing renovations, this year's Grade 1, $2 million Belmont Stakes will instead be run at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York.\n\nAnd because of the configuration of Saratoga's main track, this year's Belmont Stakes will be run at 1 1/4 miles instead of the usual 1 1/2 miles at Belmont Park.\n\nBut those major changes -- along with the impossibility of a Triple Crown winner -- did little to dampen the excitement that came with Monday's post-position draw for the Belmont Stakes, which has a post time of 6:41 p.m. Saturday and will be broadcast on Fox.\n\nA field of 10 horses were assigned starting gates and morning-line odds during a pill pull event at Universal Preservation Hall in downtown Saratoga Springs.\n\nSierra Leone -- who won the Risen Star Stakes and the Blue Grass Stakes before running second in the Derby as part of a three-way photo finish -- is the morning-line favorite for the Belmont. Sierra Leone has odds of 9-5 and will leave from post position 9, which is the second-furthest outside post.\n\n\"He's been doing great. He bounced out of the Derby, which can obviously be a tough race on horses, he's bounced out well,\" said Sierra Leone's trainer, Chad Brown, after the post-position draw. \"He shipped up here right away and he's trained really good here. Just hoping for a good trip.\"\n\nJockey Tyler Gaffalione was aboard Sierra Leone for the Kentucky Derby, and was fined but not suspended for his part in a Derby stretch duel with third-place finisher Forever Young. On Saturday, Sierra Leone will be ridden by jockey Flavien Prat in a race for the first time.\n\nThe second choice according to the morning-line odds is Mindframe, a Todd Pletcher trainee who is making his Triple Crown debut in the Belmont. Mindframe -- a perfect 2-for-2 in his young racing career -- has 7-2 odds and will leave from post position 10, the furthest outside post.\n\nKentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan, who ran second in the Preakness Stakes, will leave from post position 3 (the same starting spot he had in the Kentucky Derby) and has morning-line odds of 5-1.\n\n\"He's a very consistent horse,\" trainer Kenny McPeek said of Mystik Dan. \"I think that's the biggest deal. You've got to be a little careful with the spacing of these races nowadays, and I had been worried about it, making sure that he's right. But he's been very consistent from the Arkansas Derby all the way through today.\"\n\nPreakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey, who went wire-to-wire in winning the second leg of the Triple Crown, is also back for the Belmont. The D. Wayne Lukas trainee will leave from post position 1, the furthest inside starting spot, and had morning-line odds of 8-1.\n\nOf the 10 horses in the Belmont Stakes field, only Mystik Dan will be completing all three Triple Crown races by running Saturday.\n\nDornoch ran 10th in the Derby after departing from post position 1 in that race. Honor Marie, who received significant pre-Derby buzz, ran eighth in the Run for the Roses. Resilience finished sixth. In running second and losing out in a photo finish, Sierra Leone was part of the closest finish to a Kentucky Derby since 1996.\n\nAccording to America's Best Racing, horses that ran in the Kentucky Derby have won 12 of the last 20 editions of the Belmont Stakes. This includes 10 winners who went straight from the Derby to the Belmont, without a start in between.\n\nIn addition to Mystik Dan, Seize the Grey is the only other horse in the Belmont field that ran in the Preakness Stakes.\n\nIn the last 20 years, three horses have won the Belmont after also winning the Preakness: Afleet Alex (2005), American Pharoah (2015) and Justify (2018). American Pharoah and Justify did so as part of Triple Crown-winning campaigns.\n\nBelmont Stakes field includes plenty of past racing champions\n\nWhile there won't be a Triple Crown on the line this weekend in Saratoga Springs, there will be plenty of quality on offer with the 10 horses that make up the Belmont field.\n\nThe winners of the Kentucky Derby (Mystik Dan), Preakness Stakes (Seize the Grey), Blue Grass Stakes (Sierra Leone), Wood Memorial (Resilience) and Peter Pan Stakes (Antiquarian) will all be running.\n\nPletcher -- a four-time Belmont Stakes-winning trainer with filly Rags to Riches (2007), Palace Malice (2013), Tapwrit (2017) and Mo Donegal (2022) -- leads all trainers with three horses in this year's Belmont field.\n\nAntiquarian (post position 5 with 12-1 morning-line odds) won the Grade 3 Peter Pan Stakes last month. The field for that race also included two other Belmont horses: The Wine Steward (post position 4 with 15-1 morning-line odds) and Protective (post position 7 with 20-1 morning-line odds).\n\nThe Wine Steward ran second in the Grade 3 Stonestreet Lexington Stakes at Keeneland in April (the final Kentucky Derby prep race), while Protective is also trained by Pletcher.\n\nGaffalione, the former jockey of Sierra Leone, will ride Protective in the Belmont.\n\nAccording to America's Best Racing, the Peter Pan Stakes -- or an equivalent race contested under the same conditions -- has produced four Belmont Stakes winners since 2010.\n\nThe final Pletcher trainee in the Belmont field is Mindframe, who is the second choice on the morning line and has won both career starts in a maiden special weight race at Gulfstream Park and in an allowance optional claiming race at Churchill Downs.\n\nMindframe is the only horse in the Belmont field yet to compete in a graded stakes race.\n\n\"He's a very talented colt,\" Pletcher said. \"His two races have been very impressive. He trained very impressively before his debut. Of course, we're giving up a lot of seasoning, a lot of experience to some good really good horses. So that's the main concern.\"\n\nEach of the other seven horses in the Belmont field -- Seize the Grey (D. Wayne Lukas), Resilience (Bill Mott), Mystik Dan (Kenny McPeek), The Wine Steward (Michael Maker), Dornoch (Danny Gargan), Honor Marie (Whit Beckman) and Sierra Leone (Chad Brown) -- has a different trainer.\n\nLukas, who picked up his first Triple Crown win since 2013 when Seize the Grey won the Preakness, is aiming for his fifth Belmont Stakes victory. Lukas previously won the Belmont with Tabasco Cat (1994), Thunder Gulch (1995), Editor's Note (1996) and Commendable (2000).\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes to have different distance, venue\n\nAs referenced earlier, this will be a unique edition of the Belmont Stakes.\n\nThis will be the first edition of the Belmont Stakes ever to be run at Saratoga, which opened in 1863.\n\nThe shortened distance that will come with this venue change -- going from the traditional 1 1/2 miles at Belmont Park to 1 1/4 miles at Saratoga -- marks the first time the Belmont Stakes will be run at 1 1/4 miles since 1905. The Belmont was first run in 1867.\n\nLast year's Belmont Stakes was also a history-making occasion: Jena Antonucci became the first woman to train a winning horse in a Triple Crown race when Arcangelo won the 2023 Belmont Stakes.\n\nBrown -- the trainer of the 2024 Belmont Stakes morning-line favorite Sierra Leone -- is from Mechanicville, New York, which is less than 20 miles from Saratoga.\n\n\"When I set out my goals when I wanted to be a trainer, I never thought winning the Belmont up here was ever on the list,\" Brown said of competing so close to home in a Triple Crown race. \"... It would be very memorable (to win the Belmont at Saratoga) and I think it's a great thing to have this race up here, the oldest racetrack in the country.\"\n\nComplete 2024 Belmont Stakes field, with trainers, jockeys and odds\n\nThe complete field for the 2024 Belmont Stakes -- from the rail out with trainers, jockeys and odds -- is as follows:", "source": {"uri": "kentucky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexington Herald Leader"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cameron_drummond@kentucky.com", "name": "Cameron Drummond", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Pletcher", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Todd Pletcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Graded stakes race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavien_Prat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flavien Prat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justify_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justify (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pharoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Pharoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risen_Star_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risen Star Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Pan Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D.

It's the oldest active sporting venue in the country -- it opened before the end of the Civil War -- and draws thousands of people to Saratoga Springs, N.Y., every summer because of its small-town feel, old-school charm and world-class horse racing.\n\nThis week, Saratoga will attract attention in a way it has never before. For the first time in its history, the venerable track will host a Triple Crown race, the 2024 Belmont Stakes, on Saturday. Because of ongoing construction at the race's traditional home, Belmont Park on Long Island, the Belmont Stakes will be run at Saratoga this year and next. The home of the storied Travers Stakes every August, Saratoga will now host the two biggest 3-year-old races not named the Kentucky Derby. (Sorry, Preakness.)\n\nNo Triple Crown will be on the line at this year's Belmont. Longshot Mystik Dan won the Kentucky Derby, and the frontrunning Seize the Grey took home the Preakness Stakes. But those two will be back in the third leg of the Triple Crown.\n\nNeither Mystik Dan (5-1) nor Seize the Grey (8-1), however, is the favorite -- or even the second choice -- in the 10-horse Belmont Stakes field. The favorite's distinction goes to Kentucky Derby runner-up Sierra Leone (9-5), who is two noses away from being a perfect 5-for-5 in his career. A $2.3 million purchase two years ago, Sierra Leone thrills fans with his furious rallies down the stretch, mowing down rivals late.\n\nHe is trained by one of Saratoga County's own. Chad Brown hails from Mechanicville, just 16 miles from the track. Though he has won the Eclipse Award as the nation's Most Outstanding Trainer four times, he has never won the Belmont Stakes in three previous attempts.\n\nBut perhaps no horse in the race has a higher ceiling than the lightly raced Mindframe, who is the second choice on the morning line at 7-2. Trained by four-time Belmont Stakes-winning trainer Todd Pletcher, Mindframe has run just twice, winning his two races by more than 21 lengths combined. But on Saturday he will take a significant jump in class, facing the best horses of his generation.\n\nBelow, we'll take you through everything to know about this year's Belmont, from profiles of all the horses involved to info about the race and the Road to the Belmont Stakes, to where to find official betting strategy, including win picks and exotic plays, from a host of SportsLine experts.\n\nWhat to know about the 156th Belmont StakesWhat 156th Belmont StakesWhere Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.Who 10 3-year-old horsesPurse $2 millionDistance 1\u00bc milesPost time 6:41 p.m. ETNetwork FoxWeather forecast Partly sunny, with a high near 72.

Here's a preview of each:\n\nMichelle Yu, an on-air host and reporter with a background training horses who has provided racing analysis for TVG, HRTV and the Breeders' Cup, enters this year's Belmont Stakes on a roll. In the last two months, she predicted Stronghold's upset win in the Santa Anita Derby, en route to a $219.50 payday, and smashed the exacta in the Apple Blossom Handicap as part of a $410 score. For the Belmont, Yu is fading Seize the Grey, even though he is coming off a win in the Preakness Stakes. But her top pick is a horse who \"has been training forwardly.\" Check out Yu's full Belmont Stakes wagering strategy at SportsLine.\n\nGene Menez, a former reporter, editor and Triple Crown handicapper for Sports Illustrated, gave out Mystik Dan as a live longshot in the Kentucky Derby five weeks ago. But for Saturday Menez is completely tossing Mystik Dan despite his Derby win. Instead Menez's top pick is a horse who will be \"right there when the horses hit the wire.\" Get Menez's full Belmont Stakes wagering strategy at SportsLine.\n\nBob Weir, who is based in Saratoga Springs and is a speed figure maker for Beyer Speed Figures, smashed the trifecta in last year's Belmont Stakes for $532.96. This year Weir is high on the chances of Antiquarian, even though he is a 12-1 longshot. However, he is even higher on another double-digit longshot with a jockey who \"has had success on some very good horses.\" See Weir's full Belmont Stakes wagering strategy at SportsLine.\n\nJody Demling, who has predicted the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last six years, also is high on Antiquarian. He is also high on another horse who will be \"right there\" at the end. Find Demling's full Belmont Stakes wagering strategy at SportsLine.\n\nRoad to Saratoga Springs\n\nHere are the most significant races of the Belmont Stakes trail:\n\nDec. 2 Remsen Stakes Dornoch was passed in the stretch by Sierra Leone but stunningly re-rallied to nip Sierra Leone by a nose. Trackside observers widely agree that Dornoch raced on the better part of the track that day (the inside) while Sierra Leone was on the outside.\n\nFeb. 3, Southwest Stakes Mystik Dan rallied on the inside of a muddy Oaklawn Park track to win by eight lengths. He earned a 101 Beyer Speed Figure for that effort, but many trackside observers believe he benefitted from a biased track.\n\nFeb. 17, Risen Star Stakes This was the best prep race on the Kentucky Derby trail as the top five runners reached the Derby. Despite a glacial pace up front, Sierra Leone closed from well back to win. Resilience (fourth) and Honor Marie (fifth) were also-rans.\n\nMarch 23, Louisiana Derby Honor Marie finished second, and Antiquarian, who broke through the gate prior to the race, ran sixth.\n\nMarch 24 Fountain of Youth Stakes Dornoch went wire-to-wire to defeat a weak field in a performance that earned a relatively slow speed figure.\n\nMarch 30, Arkansas Derby Mystik Dan ran third in a race won by Muth.\n\nApril 6, Wood Memorial Resilience validated the Risen Star form with a victory, winning in-hand. Protective finished third.\n\nApril 6, Blue Grass Stakes Sierra Leone rallied powerfully down the stretch to win. Dornoch (fourth) and Seize the Grey (seventh) were well beaten.\n\nMay 4, Pat Day Mile Seize the Grey pressed a hot pace and split foes to win the mile race on the Kentucky Derby undercard.\n\nMay 4, Kentucky Derby Mystik Dan got another rail-skimming, ground-saving trip to win by a nose over Sierra Leone. Resilience (sixth), Honor Marie (eighth) and Dornoch (10th) trailed.\n\nMat 11, Peter Pan Stakes Antiquarian surged past The Wine Steward to win. Protective came in third.\n\nMay 18, Preakness Stakes Seize the Grey went wire-to-wire on a muddy track, holding off Derby winner Mystik Dan.\n\nBelmont Stakes horses (morning-line odds)1 Seize the Grey (8-1)Trainer D.

He also predicted the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last six years and called 10 of the last 20 Preakness winners, including 2023 when he hit the winner, exacta, trifecta and superfecta as well as the trifecta in 2024. Anybody following him in those races saw huge returns.\n\nNow, with the Belmont Stakes 2024 approaching, Demling is sharing his picks and predictions over at SportsLine. Click here to see his picks for the third leg of the Triple Crown.\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes predictions for Mystik Dan, Seize the Grey and Sierra Leone\n\nDemling has locked in his picks for Seize the Grey, who just won the Preakness. Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas did an admirable job of getting Seize the Grey ready for his first Triple Crown race, but it could be a challenge doing so again with a short turnaround. Although Seize the Grey won back-to-back races in two weeks between winning the Pat Day Mile (G2) on May 4 and Preakness Stakes on May 18, winning back-to-back Triple Crown races over a three-week can be even more daunting.\n\nThe last non-Triple Crown winner to take the final two legs was Afleet Alex in 2005. Only two horses have achieved this since 2000, so it could be a challenge, even with a Hall of Fame trainer. See Demling's prediction for Seize the Grey here.\n\nDemling has also locked in his 2024 Belmont Stakes picks for Mystik Dan, who won the Kentucky Derby by a nose in an epic finish. Sired by Goldencents out of Colonel John mare Ma'am, Mystik Dan got a great trip from Brian Hernandez at Churchill Downs and then he followed that up with a strong second-place showing at Pimlico two weeks later in the mud.\n\nNow he'll become the first horse since War of Will (2019) to compete in all three legs of the Triple Crown during its typical five-week span (Max Player did it in 2020 but over a 12-week span because of COVID). He drew the No. 3 post and trainer Kenneth McPeek has had him training at Saratoga for weeks now. However, he'll have much fresher horses to contend with on Saturday. See Demling's prediction for Mystik Dan here.\n\nSired by the legendary Gun Runner out of Malibu Moon mare Heavenly Love, Sierra Leone returns to the Triple Crown trail after finishing second in the Kentucky Derby and bypassing the Preakness. Gun Runner was a 10-time graded stakes winner during an illustrious racing career and Sierra Leone has shown promise, with three wins and two runner-up finishes in five career starts.\n\nThat includes graded stakes wins at the Risen Star Stakes and Blue Grass Stakes. He went off as second favorite behind Fierceness at Churchill Downs and lost a photo finish in a seesaw battle between Mystik Dan and Forever Young. Seize the Grey and Mystik Dan will be clear tests for the talented three-year-old, as will Mindframe, who won both of his starts by more than seven lengths, Resilience (10-1) and Peter Pan Stakes winner Antiquarian (12-1). See Demling's prediction for Sierra Leone here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes picks, bets\n\nDemling is also high on a double-digit longshot who will be \"right there\" in the end. Anyone who backs this horse could hit it big. Demling is sharing which horse it is, along with his entire projected leaderboard, over at SportsLine.\n\nWho wins the Belmont Stakes 2024? And which huge double-digit longshot is a must-back?

Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan, Kentucky Derby runner-up Sierra Leone and Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey all drew into the Belmont Stakes 2024. Now, they'll prep for Saturday's race and all three are still legitimate horse of the year candidates. Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite in the 2024 Belmont Stakes odds after losing at Churchill Downs by a nose and bypassing the Preakness. Meanwhile, Mystik Dan is 5-1 after his thrilling win in the Kentucky Derby and runner-up performance at Pimlico. Seize the Grey is 8-1 coming off his wire-to-wire win three weeks ago.\n\nThe 2024 Belmont Stakes post time is 6:41 p.m. ET.

Click here to see his picks for the third leg of the Triple Crown.\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes predictions for Mystik Dan, Seize the Grey and Sierra Leone\n\nOne surprise: Demling is fading Seize the Grey, even though he's the Preakness winner and one of the top favorites at 8-1. D. Wayne Lukas became the oldest trainer (88) to win an American Classic in history when Seize the Grey went wire-to-wire in the second leg of the Triple Crown. It was Lukas' seventh Preakness win and he's now a 15-time American Classic winner.\n\nThat includes four wins at the Belmont Stakes but he hasn't been to the winner's circle at \"The Test of Champions\" since 2000 and things might not set up as well for Seize the Grey against an even better field this time around. He went straight to the front and used a sluggish pace because of an off surface to reserve energy for the stretch run but now he'll have Mystik Dan's versatility, Sierre Leone's closing ability and Mindframe's (7-2) incredible speed to contend with. See who else to fade here.\n\nDemling has also locked in his 2024 Belmont Stakes picks for Mystik Dan, who won the Kentucky Derby by a nose in an epic finish. Sired by Goldencents out of Colonel John mare Ma'am, Mystik Dan got a great trip from Brian Hernandez at Churchill Downs and then he followed that up with a strong second-place showing at Pimlico two weeks later in the mud.\n\nNow he'll become the first horse since War of Will (2019) to compete in all three legs of the Triple Crown during its typical five-week span (Max Player did it in 2020 but over a 12-week span because of COVID). He drew the No. 3 post and trainer Kenneth McPeek has had him training at Saratoga for weeks now. However, he'll have much fresher horses to contend with on Saturday. See Demling's prediction for Mystik Dan here.\n\nSierra Leone, who entered the Triple Crown season with as much fanfare as any other horse, will return at the Belmont Stakes 2024. After winning the Risen Star Stakes (G2) and the Blue Grass Stakes (G1), Sierra Leone was second on the morning line behind only Fierceness at the Kentucky Derby and was edged out in a photo finish by Mystik Dan.\n\nTrainer Chad Brown is a four-time Eclipse Award winner for Outstanding Trainer and he elected to bypass the Preakness to prepare his star pupil for the Belmont Stakes. Sire Gun Runner was a 10-time graded stakes winner and horse of the year. However, Sierra Leone did draw the No. 9 post and jockey Flavien Prat will have to have him positioned perfectly to take advantage of his closing speed. See Demling's prediction for Sierra Leone here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes picks, bets\n\nDemling is also high on a double-digit longshot who has \"keeps getting better and better.\" Anyone who backs this horse could hit it big.

Here's the full race field, with odds.", "body": "LEXINGTON, Ky. -- The 2024 Belmont Stakes has some big changes this year.\n\nThe final leg of horse racing's Triple Crown will feature a different venue, and a different distance, compared to normal.\n\nWith Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y., out of action due to ongoing renovations, this year's Grade 1, $2 million Belmont Stakes will instead be run at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.\n\nAnd because of the configuration of Saratoga's main track, this year's Belmont Stakes will be run at 1 1/4 miles instead of the usual 1 1/2 miles at Belmont Park.\n\nBut those major changes -- along with the impossibility of a Triple Crown winner -- did little to dampen the excitement that came with Monday's post-position draw for the Belmont Stakes, which has a post time of 6:41 p.m. Saturday and will be broadcast on Fox.\n\nA field of 10 horses were assigned starting gates and morning-line odds during a pill pull event at Universal Preservation Hall in downtown Saratoga Springs.\n\nSierra Leone -- who won the Risen Star Stakes and the Blue Grass Stakes before running second in the Derby as part of a three-way photo finish -- is the morning-line favorite for the Belmont. Sierra Leone has odds of 9-5 and will leave from post position 9, which is the second-furthest outside post.\n\n\"He's been doing great. He bounced out of the Derby, which can obviously be a tough race on horses, he's bounced out well,\" said Sierra Leone's trainer, Chad Brown, after the post-position draw. \"He shipped up here right away and he's trained really good here. Just hoping for a good trip.\"\n\nJockey Tyler Gaffalione was aboard Sierra Leone for the Kentucky Derby, and was fined but not suspended for his part in a Derby stretch duel with third-place finisher Forever Young. On Saturday, Sierra Leone will be ridden by jockey Flavien Prat in a race for the first time.\n\nThe second choice according to the morning-line odds is Mindframe, a Todd Pletcher trainee who is making his Triple Crown debut in the Belmont. Mindframe -- a perfect 2 for 2 in his young racing career -- has 7-2 odds and will leave from post position 10, the furthest outside post.\n\nKentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan, who ran second in the Preakness Stakes, will leave from post position 3 (the same starting spot he had in the Kentucky Derby) and has morning-line odds of 5-1.\n\n\"He's a very consistent horse,\" trainer Kenny McPeek said of Mystik Dan. \"I think that's the biggest deal. You've got to be a little careful with the spacing of these races nowadays, and I had been worried about it, making sure that he's right. But he's been very consistent from the Arkansas Derby all the way through today.\"\n\nPreakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey, who went wire-to-wire in winning the second leg of the Triple Crown, is also back for the Belmont. The D. Wayne Lukas trainee will leave from post position 1, the furthest inside starting spot, and had morning-line odds of 8-1.\n\nOf the 10 horses in the Belmont Stakes field, only Mystik Dan will be completing all three Triple Crown races by running Saturday.\n\nFour horses in the Belmont field -- Antiquarian, Mindframe, Protective and The Wine Steward -- will be running in their first Triple Crown race.\n\nFour horses set to run in the Belmont -- Dornoch, Honor Marie, Resilience and Sierra Leone -- all ran in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nDornoch ran 10th in the Derby after departing from post position 1 in that race. Honor Marie, who received significant pre-Derby buzz, ran eighth in the Run for the Roses. Resilience finished sixth. In running second and losing out in a photo finish, Sierra Leone was part of the closest finish to a Kentucky Derby since 1996.\n\nAccording to America's Best Racing, horses that ran in the Kentucky Derby have won 12 of the last 20 editions of the Belmont Stakes. This includes 10 winners who went straight from the Derby to the Belmont, without a start in between.\n\nIn addition to Mystik Dan, Seize the Grey is the only other horse in the Belmont field that ran in the Preakness Stakes.\n\nIn the last 20 years, three horses have won the Belmont after also winning the Preakness: Afleet Alex (2005), American Pharoah (2015) and Justify (2018). American Pharoah and Justify did so as part of Triple Crown-winning campaigns.\n\nBelmont Stakes field includes plenty of past racing champions\n\nWhile there won't be a Triple Crown on the line this weekend in Saratoga Springs, there will be plenty of quality on offer with the 10 horses that make up the Belmont field.\n\nThe winners of the Kentucky Derby (Mystik Dan), Preakness Stakes (Seize the Grey), Blue Grass Stakes (Sierra Leone), Wood Memorial (Resilience) and Peter Pan Stakes (Antiquarian) will all be running.\n\nPletcher -- a four-time Belmont Stakes-winning trainer with filly Rags to Riches (2007), Palace Malice (2013), Tapwrit (2017) and Mo Donegal (2022) -- leads all trainers with three horses in this year's Belmont field.\n\nAntiquarian (post position 5 with 12-1 morning-line odds) won the Grade 3 Peter Pan Stakes last month. The field for that race also included two other Belmont horses: The Wine Steward (post position 4 with 15-1 morning-line odds) and Protective (post position 7 with 20-1 morning-line odds).\n\nThe Wine Steward ran second in the Grade 3 Stonestreet Lexington Stakes at Keeneland in April (the final Kentucky Derby prep race), while Protective is also trained by Pletcher.\n\nGaffalione, the former jockey of Sierra Leone, will ride Protective in the Belmont.\n\nAccording to America's Best Racing, the Peter Pan Stakes -- or an equivalent race contested under the same conditions -- has produced four Belmont Stakes winners since 2010.\n\nThe final Pletcher trainee in the Belmont field is Mindframe, who is the second choice on the morning line and has won both career starts in a maiden special weight race at Gulfstream Park and in an allowance optional claiming race at Churchill Downs.\n\nMindframe is the only horse in the Belmont field yet to compete in a graded stakes race.\n\n\"He's a very talented colt,\" Pletcher said. \"His two races have been very impressive. He trained very impressively before his debut. Of course, we're giving up a lot of seasoning, a lot of experience to some good really good horses. So that's the main concern.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nEach of the other seven horses in the Belmont field -- Seize the Grey (D. Wayne Lukas), Resilience (Bill Mott), Mystik Dan (Kenny McPeek), The Wine Steward (Michael Maker), Dornoch (Danny Gargan), Honor Marie (Whit Beckman) and Sierra Leone (Chad Brown) -- has a different trainer.\n\nLukas, who picked up his first Triple Crown win since 2013 when Seize the Grey won the Preakness, is aiming for his fifth Belmont Stakes victory. Lukas previously won the Belmont with Tabasco Cat (1994), Thunder Gulch (1995), Editor's Note (1996) and Commendable (2000).\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes to have different distance, venue\n\nAs referenced earlier, this will be a unique edition of the Belmont Stakes.\n\nThis will be the first edition of the Belmont Stakes ever to be run at Saratoga, which opened in 1863.\n\nThe shortened distance that will come with this venue change -- going from the traditional 1 1/2 miles at Belmont Park to 1 1/4 miles at Saratoga -- marks the first time the Belmont Stakes will be run at 1 1/4 miles since 1905. The Belmont was first run in 1867.\n\nLast year's Belmont Stakes was also a history-making occasion: Jena Antonucci became the first woman to train a winning horse in a Triple Crown race when Arcangelo won the 2023 Belmont Stakes.\n\nBrown -- the trainer of the 2024 Belmont Stakes morning-line favorite Sierra Leone -- is from Mechanicville, N.Y., which is less than 20 miles from Saratoga.\n\n\"When I set out my goals when I wanted to be a trainer, I never thought winning the Belmont up here was ever on the list,\" Brown said of competing so close to home in a Triple Crown race. \"... It would be very memorable (to win the Belmont at Saratoga) and I think it's a great thing to have this race up here, the oldest racetrack in the country.\"\n\nComplete 2024 Belmont Stakes field, with trainers, jockeys and odds\n\nThe complete field for the 2024 Belmont Stakes -- from the rail out with trainers, jockeys and odds -- is as follows:\n\n-- 1 -- Seize the Grey (D. Wayne Lukas, Jaime Torres, 8-1).\n\n-- 2 -- Resilience (Bill Mott, Junior Alvarado, 10-1).\n\n-- 3 -- Mystik Dan (Kenny McPeek, Brian Hernandez Jr., 5-1).\n\n-- 4 -- The Wine Steward (Michael Maker, Manny Franco, 15-1).\n\n-- 5 -- Antiquarian (Todd Pletcher, John Velazquez, 12-1).\n\n-- 6 -- Dornoch (Danny Gargan, Luis Saez, 15-1).\n\n-- 7 -- Protective (Todd Pletcher, Tyler Gaffalione, 20-1).\n\n-- 8 -- Honor Marie (Whit Beckman, Florent Geroux, 12-1).\n\n-- 9 -- Sierra Leone (Chad Brown, Flavien Prat, 9-5).\n\n-- 10 -- Mindframe (Todd Pletcher, Irad Ortiz, Jr., 7-2).\n\nBelmont Stakes\n\nWhen: 6:41 p.m. Saturday\n\nWhere: Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.\n\nTV: Fox\n\nPurse: $2 million (Grade 1)\n\nDistance: 1 1/4 miles\n\nFor: 3-year-old thoroughbreds\n\nFavorite: Sierra Leone (9-5)\n\n\u00a92024 Lexington Herald-Leader.

He hasn't run in a stakes race, but Mindframe broke his maiden with a 13 3/4-length win at Gulfstream Park in March and won an allowance race at Churchill Downs on Kentucky Derby Day by 7 1/4 lengths. Now, he'll take on his biggest test yet in the third leg of the Triple Crown and is 7-2 in the 2024 Belmont Stakes odds. Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite in the 2024 Belmont Stakes lineup after losing the Kentucky Derby by a nose and bypassing the Preakness.\n\nKentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan is 5-1 and Preakness winner Seize the Grey is 8-1. The 2024 Belmont Stakes post time is 6:41 p.m. ET. Before making any 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions, you'll want to see elite horse racing handicapper Jody Demling's 2024 Belmont Stakes picks and analysis.\n\nA fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling enters the 2024 Belmont Stakes having nailed the Derby-Oaks double 11 of the last 16 years. He also predicted the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last six years and called 10 of the last 20 Preakness winners, including 2023 when he hit the winner, exacta, trifecta and superfecta as well as the trifecta in 2024. Anybody following him in those races saw huge returns.\n\nNow, with the Belmont Stakes 2024 approaching, Demling is sharing his picks and predictions over at SportsLine. Click here to see his picks for the third leg of the Triple Crown.\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes predictions for Mystik Dan, Seize the Grey and Sierra Leone\n\nOne surprise: Demling is fading Seize the Grey, even though he's the Preakness winner and one of the top favorites at 8-1. Sired by Arrogate out of the Smart Strike mare Smart Shopping, Seize the Grey only managed two wins in his first eight career starts and fell off the Kentucky Derby trail with a seventh-place finish in the Blue Grass Stakes. However, he rebounded to win the Pat Day Mile to earn his way into the Preakness.\n\nA sloppy track helped the frontrunner go wire-to-wire at Pimlico, winning by 2 1/4 lengths over Mystik Dan. He'll face a dynamic field on Saturday with Mystik Dan running it back, Sierra Leone returning to the trail, and Mindframe making his highly-anticipated stakes debut. He'll have an extra half-furlong to run, and after starting in the middle of the field in the Preakness, he'll have to navigate the rail in the 2024 Belmont Stakes. Both are reasons why Demling says he doesn't hit the board. See who else to fade here.\n\nDemling has also locked in his 2024 Belmont Stakes picks for Mystik Dan, who won the Kentucky Derby by a nose in an epic finish. Sired by Goldencents out of Colonel John mare Ma'am, Mystik Dan got a great trip from Brian Hernandez at Churchill Downs and then he followed that up with a strong second-place showing at Pimlico two weeks later in the mud.\n\nNow he'll become the first horse since War of Will (2019) to compete in all three legs of the Triple Crown during its typical five-week span (Max Player did it in 2020 but over a 12-week span because of COVID). He drew the No. 3 post and trainer Kenneth McPeek has had him training at Saratoga for weeks now. However, he'll have much fresher horses to contend with on Saturday. See Demling's prediction for Mystik Dan here.\n\nSired by the legendary Gun Runner out of Malibu Moon mare Heavenly Love, Sierra Leone returns to the Triple Crown trail after finishing second in the Kentucky Derby and bypassing the Preakness. Gun Runner was a 10-time graded stakes winner during an illustrious racing career and Sierra Leone has shown promise, with three wins and two runner-up finishes in five career starts.\n\nThat includes graded stakes wins at the Risen Star Stakes and Blue Grass Stakes. He went off as second favorite behind Fierceness at Churchill Downs and lost a photo finish in a seesaw battle between Mystik Dan and Forever Young. Seize the Grey and Mystik Dan will be clear tests for the talented three-year-old, as will Mindframe, who won both of his starts by more than seven lengths, Resilience (10-1) and Peter Pan Stakes winner Antiquarian (12-1). See Demling's prediction for Sierra Leone here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes picks, bets\n\nDemling is also high on a double-digit longshot who has \"keeps getting better and better.\" Anyone who backs this horse could hit it big. Demling is sharing which horse it is, along with his entire projected leaderboard, over at SportsLine.\n\nWho wins the Belmont Stakes 2024? And which huge double-digit longshot is a must-back?

Following the post position draw Tuesday, each horse has its starting gate for this year's race, and the odds have been updated.\n\nFollowing its Preakness Stakes win, Seize the Grey (8-1) will have the inside track at the Belmont Stakes with the No. 1 post position. Trainer D. Wayne Lukas made history as the oldest trainer ever to win a Triple Crown race at 88 years old, and he will try to add another victory to his lengthy resume at Saratoga.\n\nSeize the Grey will once again get some fierce competition from Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan (5-1), the second-place finisher at Pimlico. Mystik Dan made a late push for the second leg of the Triple Crown last month, but the Ken-McPeek-trained horse fell just short of a late comeback.\n\nDespite being the winners of the first two Triple Crown races, neither Seize the Grey nor Mystik Dan opened as the favorite to win the Belmont Stakes. Instead, Sierra Leone is the current favorite at 9-5. Sierra Leone, trained by Chad Brown, finished a painfully close second to Mystik Dan at Churchill Downs.\n\nThe other favorite heading into the weekend is Mindframe at 7-2. The horse didn't race in either of the first two legs of the Triple Crown, but it is seen as a contender to win the Belmont Stakes. Trained by Todd Pletcher, Mindframe has won the first two races of its young career.\n\nHow to watch the 2024 Belmont StakesDate: Saturday, June 8Post time: 6:41 p.m. ETLocation: Saratoga Race Course -- Saratoga Springs, New YorkTV: Fox | Stream: fubo (try for free)2024 Belmont Stakes post positions\n\n1.

Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan, Kentucky Derby runner-up Sierra Leone, and Preakness winner Seize the Grey are all entered to run on Saturday at Saratoga Race Course with Belmont Park undergoing renovations. The 2024 Belmont Stakes distance is 10 furlongs (1 1/4 miles) rather than 12 (1 1/2 miles) because of the change in venue and post time is scheduled for 6:41 p.m. ET.\n\nSierra Leone is well-rested after bypassing the Preakness and is the 9-5 favorite in the 2024 Belmont Stakes odds despite receiving the No. 9 post at the 2024 Belmont Stakes post draw. He's followed by Mindframe (7-2), Mystik Dan (5-1), Seize the Grey (8-1) and Resilience (10-1). Before making any 2024 Belmont Stakes picks, be sure to see the horse racing predictions and futures bets from SportsLine's elite horse racing expert Jody Demling.\n\nA fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling enters the 2024 Belmont Stakes having nailed the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last six years, including an exacta in 2022 with Mo Donegal and Nest. He also called Flightline's win at the Breeders' Cup Classic in November of that year.\n\nDemling is at his best in the biggest horse races in the world like the Belmont Stakes 2024. In fact, he has hit 11 of the last 16 Derby-Oaks doubles at Churchill Downs. He's also called 10 of the last 20 Preakness winners, including nailing his Preakness winner, exacta, trifecta and superfecta picks in 2023 and then the trifecta again in 2024. Anyone who has followed him is up huge.\n\nNow, with the 2024 Belmont Stakes approaching, Demling is sharing his picks and 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions over at SportsLine. Go here to see them.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions\n\nOne of Demling's surprising 2024 Belmont Stakes picks: He is high on Antiquarian, even though he's a 12-1 longshot. Sire Preservationist won the Suburban Stakes and Woodward Stakes in 2019 and he posted HRN speed figures of 110 or higher in three of his four career victories. While Antiquarian hasn't showcased the same upper-echelon speed, he has posted improving Equibase Speed Figures in all four of his starts and upped his Beyer Speed Figure his last three times out.\n\nTrainer Todd Pletcher is a four-time Belmont Stakes winner and will have three entries on Saturday with Antiquarian, Mindframe and Protective (20-1). Meanwhile, jockey John Velazquez is a two-time Belmont winner and has plenty of experience with this horse, taking the mount in all four of his career starts. Antiquarian won the Peter Pan Stakes last month, a Grade 3 prep race for the Belmont 2024, and he'll have a chance to become the eighth Peter Pan winner in history to go on to win the Belmont Stakes. See which other horses to back at SportsLine.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes picks, bets\n\nDemling is also especially high on an underdog who will be \"right there\" in the end. Demling is sharing which horse it is, and is revealing his surprising prediction for Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey, along with his entire projected 2024 Belmont Stakes leaderboard, over at SportsLine.\n\nWhich horse wins the Belmont Stakes 2024, where does Seize the Grey finish, and which dark-horse is a must-back?

The most recent Belmont Stakes run somewhere other than Belmont Park occurred in 1967, when it shifted to Aqueduct Racetrack for similar reasons.\n\nTo fit the different venue, the Belmont Stakes will be a 1.25-mile race, not the usual distance of 1.5 miles, the length that helped give the event its nickname. The competitors in this year's Belmont will run the same distance as the contenders in the Kentucky Derby on May 4 did.\n\nMystik Dan won that Kentucky Derby to become this year's Triple Crown hopeful. But in the Preakness Stakes on May 18, Mystik Dan came home second - 2.25 lengths behind Seize the Grey.\n\nThis is the sixth straight year that the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes had different winners, eliminating any Triple Crown drama for the Belmont Stakes. Since Justify won the Triple Crown in 2018, no horse has won two of the Triple Crown races.\n\nMystik Dan and Seize the Grey are both running in the Belmont Stakes, but neither is the morning-line favorite in the race.\n\nAt the post-position draw on Monday afternoon, Sierra Leone was tabbed as the morning-line favorite at 9-5. Sierra Leone lost to Mystik Dan in the Kentucky Derby by a nose. While Mystik Dan went on to run two weeks later, Sierra Leone has had a five-week layoff.\n\nMystik Dan was 5-1 and Seize the Grey was 8-1 in the morning line.\n\nBoth had longer odds than Mindframe, too, which posted at 7-2 even though the colt has raced only twice - both victories.\n\nThe most recent winner of the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes that did not win the Preakness Stakes was Thunder Gulch in 1995. Eleven horses have accomplished this feat.\n\nThe most recent winner of the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont Stakes that did not win the Kentucky Derby was Afleet Alex in 2005. Eighteen horses have accomplished this feat.\n\nPost time for the 156th Belmont Stakes is 5:41 p.m. CDT Saturday.\n\nFOX Sports coverage of the Belmont Stakes will start at 9:30 a.m. Saturday on FS1. At 3 p.m. Saturday, the main coverage will shift to FOX.\n\nThis year's race has a $2 million purse, with $1.2 million going to the winner.\n\nThe 10 entries in Saturday's Belmont Stakes, listed by post position with morning-line odds:\n\nPost Position 1: Seize the Grey 8-1\n\nSeize the Grey had a dud of a showing at the Grade 1 Blue Grass Stakes on April 6 with a seventh-place run and didn't go on to the Kentucky Derby. But the roan colt did win at Churchill Downs on May 4, taking the Pat Day Mile with a nice stretch showing on the same day as the Run for the Roses. That led to a Preakness Stakes bid, and Seize the Grey was a wire-to-wire winner by 2.25 lengths on May 18. Trainer: D. Wayne Lukas, who saddled Belmont winners Tabasco Cat in 1994, Thunder Gulch in 1995, Editor's Note in 1996 and Commendable in 2000. Jockey: Jaime Torres. Record: 10-4-0-3. Earnings: $1,819,938. Pedigree: Smart Shopping by Arrogate.\n\nResilience wasn't up to Sierra Leone, Track Phantom and Catching Freedom as he faded to a fourth-place finish at the Grade 2 Risen Star Stakes on Feb. 17. The colt came back with more speed and stamina for a 2.25-length victory in the Grade 2 Wood Memorial on April 6. But that didn't hold up at the Kentucky Derby on May 4, where another slowdown in the stretch sent Resilience back to a sixth-place showing. Trainer: Bill Mott, who saddled Belmont winner Drosselmeyer in 2010. Jockey: Junior Alvarado. Record: 7-2-1-1. Earnings: $494,630. Pedigree: Meadowsweet by Into Mischief.\n\nMystik Dan's run on the rail allowed the colt to win the Kentucky Derby by a nose over Sierra Leone on May 4, but he couldn't keep pace with Seize the Grey in the Preakness Stakes and came in second by 2.25 lengths. Mystik Dan became a Kentucky Derby contender by winning the Grade 3 Southwest Stakes on Feb. 3 by 8 lengths over Just Steel. The colt's final derby prep didn't go as well as Mystik Dan finished 4.5 lengths behind Just Steel, which ran 2 lengths behind race winner Muth in the Grade 1 Arkansas Derby on March 30. Trainer: Kenny McPeek, who saddled Belmont winner Sarava in 2002. Jockey: Brian Hernandez Jr. Record: 8-3-2-1. Earnings: $4,141,360. Pedigree: Ma'am by Goldencents.\n\nThe Wine Steward won the first three times out, including surging to finish first by a head at Saratoga in the Funny Cide Stakes on Aug. 27. Since then, the colt has finished second three times in a row - beaten by less than a length each time. The Wine Steward lost by one-half length to the favorite, Locked, in the Grade 1 Claiborne Breeders' Futurity on Oct. 7, by three-quarters of a length as the favorite to Encinco in the Grade 3 Lexington Stakes on April 13 and by three-quarters of a length as the favorite to Antiquarian in the Grade 3 Peter Pan Stakes on May 11. Trainer: Michael Maker. Jockey: Manny Franco, who rode Belmont winner Tiz the Law in 2020. Record: 6-3-3-0. Earnings: $467,260. Pedigree: Call To Service by Vino Rosso.\n\nThe third-place finisher in the Grade 2 Louisiana Derby on March 23, Antiquarian is coming off a three-quarter-length victory in the Grade 3 Peter Pan Stakes over the favorite, The Wine Steward, on May 11. Trainer: Todd Pletcher, who saddled Belmont winners Rags to Riches in 2007, Palace Malice in 2013, Tapwrit in 2017 and Mo Donegal in 2022. Jockey: John Velazquez, who rode Belmont winners Rags to Riches in 2007 and Union Rags in 2012. Record: 4-2-1-0. Earnings: $173,000. Pedigree: Lifetime Memory by Preservationist.\n\nDornoch had won three races in row, including the Grade 2 Remsen Stakes and the Grade 2 Fountain of Youth Stakes, when the colt couldn't keep pace with Sierra Leone's blistering stretch run in the Grade 1 Blue Grass Stakes on April 6 and finished fourth. Four months earlier, Dornoch had beaten Sierra Leone by a nose at the Remsen. Dornoch is coming off a 10th-place finish in the Kentucky Derby on May 4. Trainer: Danny Gargan. Jockey: Luis Saez, who rode Belmont winner Essential Quality in 2021. Record: 7-3-2-0. Earnings: $552,275. Pedigree: Puca by Good Magic.\n\nThe colt's two 2-year-old wins include the Grade 2 Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes. As a 3-year-old, Honor Marie had to run hard to come in fifth in the Grade 2 Risen Star Stakes on Feb. 17, had a runner-up finish by 1 length to Catching Freedom in the Grade 2 Louisiana Derby on March 23 as both made strong stretch runs and made up ground at the end to come in eighth at the Kentucky Derby on May 4. Trainer: Whit Beckman. Jockey: Ben Curtis. Record: 6-2-2-0. Earnings: $526,175. Pedigree: Dame Marie by Honor Code.\n\nMindframe didn't make his debut until March 30, but the colt roared to a 13.75-length victory at Gulfstream Park. His second race came on Kentucky Derby day at Churchill Downs, and Mindframe posted a wire-to-wire 7.5-length victory in an allowance race. Trainer: Todd Pletcher, who saddled Belmont winners Rags to Riches in 2007, Palace Malice in 2013, Tapwrit in 2017 and Mo Donegal in 2022. Jockey: Irad Ortiz Jr., who rode Belmont winners Creator in 2016 and Mo Donegal in 2022. Record: 2-2-0-0. Earnings: $87,360.

USATSI\n\nThe final leg of horse racing's Triple Crown gets underway on Saturday, when the 2024 Belmont Stakes takes place at Saratoga Race Course. This horse racing spectacle is usually held at Belmont Park, but Saratoga will be the fifth track in history to host the Belmont Stakes. There were 10 horses that drew into the 2024 Belmont Stakes field, and according to the latest 2024 Belmont Stakes odds, Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite. Sierra Leone lost the Kentucky Derby by a nose to Mystik Dan, who is also among the 2024 Belmont Stakes horses.\n\nShould your 2024 Belmont Stakes picks include backing one of the favorites like Sierra Leone or Mystik Dan (5-1), or should you look elsewhere among the 2024 Belmont Stakes entries for value? With so much to consider while making your 2024 Belmont Stakes picks, a little expert help can go a long way.\n\nSecretariat's time of 2:24 remains the record for the Belmont Stakes since the race moved to 1 1/2 miles in 1926. The legendary thoroughbred still holds the fastest time for all three Triple Crown races and is widely considered to be the top horse of all-time. In the 50 years since Secretariat, only three horses have been able to capture the Triple Crown at Belmont Park. Affirmed accomplished the feat in 1978, followed by American Pharoah in 2015 and Justify in 2018.\n\nGiven all the history, there's a method to picking which horses to focus on for exacta, trifecta and superfecta bets in the Belmont Stakes, and SportsLine expert Jody Demling knows what it is. He can help you make the best 2024 Belmont Stakes picks possible.\n\nA fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling enters the 2024 Belmont Stakes having nailed the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last six years, including an exacta in 2022 with Mo Donegal and Nest. He also called Flightline's win at the Breeders' Cup Classic in November of that year.\n\nDemling is at his best in the biggest horse races in the world like the Belmont Stakes 2024. In fact, he has hit 11 of the last 16 Derby-Oaks doubles at Churchill Downs. He's also called 10 of the last 20 Preakness winners, including nailing his Preakness winner, exacta, trifecta and superfecta picks in 2023 and then the trifecta again in 2024. Anyone who has followed him is up huge.\n\nHe keenly understands when the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes winners were poised for victory or a massive upset in the final leg of the Triple Crown. Anyone who has followed him is up huge. Now, he's sharing all of his 2024 Belmont Stakes bets here.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes expert picks\n\nHere's a refresher on these types of bets from SportsLine's Jody Demling:\n\nBelmont Stakes Exacta: Pick the first- and second-place finishers in the correct order. A $2 exacta returned $68 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Arcangelo and Forte.\n\nBelmont Stakes Trifecta: Pick the first-, second- and third-place finishers in the correct order. A $1 trifecta returned $133.24 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Arcangelo, Forte and Tapit Trice.\n\nBelmont Stakes Superfecta: Pick the first-, second-, third- and fourth-place finishers in the correct order. A $1 superfecta returned $292.50 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Hit Show and $191.50 with Angel of Empire after a tie for fourth.\n\nDemling is fading Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey. Instead, he is building his tickets around Sierra Leone and a big longshot who \"keeps getting better and better.\" You can see his picks here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes bets\n\nDemling has specific recommendations for exacta, trifecta and superfecta wagers so you can cover all your bases at the Belmont Stakes 2024.

Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey match up once again, but it's Sierra Leone who's favored over both of them in a field of 10. I'll discuss who has a leg up in the rematch of Triple Crown race winners and much more.\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes picks\n\nI see a closer from the Kentucky Derby that came up short returning to win the Belmont Stakes, but it's not who you might think. Be sure to check out updated Belmont Stakes odds before placing your bets.\n\nHonor Marie had arguably the toughest trip of any horse in the 2024 Kentucky Derby, being pinballed by rivals coming out of the gate before steadying off heels inside the opening furlong. A three-wide journey on the first turn became an even wider one when forced to swerve outside of a rival that checked up, and then he was checked again going into the far turn.\n\nJockey Ben Curtis dove to the inside to try and save some ground midway on the final bend but eventually had to swing his charge several paths off the rail in the stretch drive.\n\nDespite all this adversity, Honor Marie went from 20th and last to eighth when the race was over. There are many horses who quit at the first sign of trouble, but this son of Honor Code clearly has guts. I'll gladly hitch my wagon to the 12-1 Louisiana Derby runner-up, who lures Florent Geroux on Saturday, in the hopes he enjoys a smoother voyage.\n\nShow Prediction: Sierra Leone (9-5)\n\nSierra Leone is the most consistent and battle-tested horse in the Belmont, as he won the Risen Star Stakes and the Blue Grass Stakes prior to a narrow runner-up result in the Kentucky Derby, but that doesn't mean he's the best bet to win the race.\n\nMuch like Honor Marie, Sierra Leone was also well back early in the Kentucky Derby. He simply wasn't blessed with natural early speed, but he makes up for it with a solid closing kick. However, taking deep closers like him at 9-5 can be dangerous as he could get caught in traffic.\n\nShow Prediction: The Wine Steward (15-1)\n\nThe Wine Steward showed more early speed than usual in a short field in the Peter Pan Stakes when last seen, and he wound up getting run down in the lane by Antiquarian. However, I think he can turn the tables on that rival in the Belmont Stakes.\n\nThe Wine Steward was a three-time winner at two but ended his juvenile season with a loss in the Breeders' Futurity Stakes. The Mike Maker trainee missed the Breeders' Cup and most of the Kentucky Derby trail, as he didn't make his 2024 debut until the Lexington Stakes on April 13. He didn't lose by much to Encino, who I believed was a serious threat to win the Derby before an injury sidelined him.\n\nThe jockey change from Luis Saez to Manny Franco suggests a possible change in tactics. While I don't expect The Wine Steward to drop to the tail-end of the pack, I don't think he'll be on the lead with bookends Seize the Grey and Mindframe expected to show early initiative. The Wine Steward could get the perfect stalking trip at a nice price in the Belmont Stakes.\n\nPicks made on 6-5 at 10:00 a.m. ET.\n\nKentucky Derby winner vs. Preakness Stakes winner: Which horse has a leg up?\n\nI'm putting neither Mystik Dan nor Seize the Grey in my Belmont Stakes Top 3, but if I had to pick between the 2024 Kentucky Derby winner and the 2024 Preakness Stakes winner, I would side with the former.\n\nSeize the Grey has one race that makes him a contender in this group, and it's his gate-to-wire victory in the Preakness. I don't think this horse suddenly changed from an also-ran to a force to be reckoned with from his ninth to 10th career start.\n\nI dismissed Mystik Dan in the Derby off a muddy win in the Southwest and a somewhat troubled third in the Arkansas Derby, and I bet against him in the Preakness off a perfect-trip score at Churchill. But he lost nothing in defeat at Pimlico, and if it rains at Saratoga, it's all the better for Mystik Dan.\n\n**bet365 Belmont odds are not available in the United States\n\nWhere can I bet on the Belmont Stakes?\n\nThis all depends on where you live.

USATSI\n\nSince 1905, the No. 1 post position in the Belmont Stakes has produced eight more winners (24) than any other. That's welcome news for Preakness winner Seize the Grey and trainer D. Wayne Lukas. Seize the Grey drew the rail for the 2024 Belmont Stakes and a clean break from the inside line could put him in a position to go wire-to-wire just like he did at Pimlico. Lukas just earned his 15th win in an American Classic at age 88 and will seek his fifth career win in the Belmont Stakes on Saturday at Saratoga Race Course. Post time is 6:41 p.m. ET.\n\nThe Preakness winner is priced at 8-1 in the 2024 Belmont Stakes odds and there are three 2024 Belmont Stakes horses ahead of him. Kentucky Derby runner-up Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite, while winner Mystik Dan is 5-1 and the speedy Mindframe is 7-2 for the Belmont Stakes 2024. With so much to consider while making your 2024 Belmont Stakes picks, a little expert help can go a long way.\n\nThe 2024 Belmont Stakes will be the 156th Run for the Carnations and Saratoga Race Course will be the fifth track in history to host it. There have only been 24 three-year-olds in history that have completed the Kentucky Derby-Belmont Stakes double and Mystik Dan will have an opportunity to become the 25th on Saturday. Mystik Dan finished second to Seize the Grey in the Preakness Stakes, and the latter will try to become the 19th horse outside of the 13 Triple Crown winners to win the Preakness-Belmont double.\n\nGiven all the history, there's a method to picking which horses to focus on for exacta, trifecta and superfecta bets in the Belmont Stakes, and SportsLine expert Jody Demling knows what it is. He can help you make the best 2024 Belmont Stakes picks possible.\n\nA fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling enters the 2024 Belmont Stakes having nailed the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last six years, including an exacta in 2022 with Mo Donegal and Nest. He also called Flightline's win at the Breeders' Cup Classic in November of that year.\n\nDemling is at his best in the biggest horse races in the world like the Belmont Stakes 2024. In fact, he has hit 11 of the last 16 Derby-Oaks doubles at Churchill Downs. He's also called 10 of the last 20 Preakness winners, including nailing his Preakness winner, exacta, trifecta and superfecta picks in 2023 and then the trifecta again in 2024. Anyone who has followed him is up huge.\n\nHe keenly understands when the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes winners were poised for victory or a massive upset in the final leg of the Triple Crown. Anyone who has followed him is up huge. Now, he's sharing all of his 2024 Belmont Stakes bets here.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes expert picks\n\nHere's a refresher on these types of bets from SportsLine's Jody Demling:\n\nBelmont Stakes Exacta: Pick the first- and second-place finishers in the correct order. A $2 exacta returned $68 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Arcangelo and Forte.\n\nBelmont Stakes Trifecta: Pick the first-, second- and third-place finishers in the correct order. A $1 trifecta returned $133.24 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Arcangelo, Forte and Tapit Trice.\n\nBelmont Stakes Superfecta: Pick the first-, second-, third- and fourth-place finishers in the correct order.

Wayne Lukas is one of the legendary trainers in horse racing and continues to add to his resume at 88 years old. Lukas won the 2024 Preakness Stakes with Seize the Grey and quickly made the decision to prepare his star pupil for the 2024 Belmont Stakes on Saturday, June 8 at Saratoga Race Course. The wire-to-wire winner at the Preakness is one of the headliners of a loaded 2024 Belmont Stakes field. In addition to Seize the Grey (8-1), Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan (5-1) is on track to run at Saratoga and one of the morning-line favorites at Churchill Downs will return to the Triple Crown trail after bypassing the Preakness.\n\nSierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite in the 2024 Belmont Stakes odds after finishing second in the Kentucky Derby.

Go here to see them.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions\n\nOne of Demling's surprising 2024 Belmont Stakes picks: He is high on Antiquarian, even though he's a 12-1 longshot. Several other 2024 Belmont Stakes horses will have more cache after Antiquarian missed the first two legs of the Triple Crown. However, trainer Todd Pletcher is a four-time Belmont Stakes winner and expected jockey John Velazquez has won the \"Test of Champions\" twice, giving Antiquarian some of the most experienced connections in the field.\n\nSired by two-time Grade 1 stakes winner Preservationist out of Istan mare Lifetime Memory, Antiquarian didn't race as a two-year-old. Instead, he debuted with a second-place finish in a maiden race at Gulfstream Park in January and won a maiden race at Fair Grounds in February. He earned his way into the 2024 Belmont Stakes field with a win in the Peter Pan Stakes.

The track located in the New York City suburb of Elmont is building both a new grandstand and racing surfaces, which will displace the Belmont Stakes to Saratoga for both this year and next.\n\nThe configuration of Saratoga necessitates that the race will be contested at 1 1/4-miles - the same distance as the Kentucky Derby and the Travers Stakes, which is Saratoga's marquee race in its traditional summer meet. Saratoga's annual meet is considered the premier summer meet in the U.S., so most of the sport's top trainers are very familiar with the track.\n\nThe combination of these two factors has resulted in a lot of top trainers and owners taking a serious look at entering their 3-year-olds currently showing any promise - and may very well also include the winners of the first two Triple Crown races.\n\nMystik Dan, who nosed out Sierra Leone to capture the Kentucky Derby, is already training at Saratoga. Trainer Ken McPeek, who waited until one week before the Preakness to commit his colt to that race, is again exercising prudence with regards to the Belmont Stakes.\n\n\"We'll take it as it comes and get him into a routine here,\" said McPeek, who also said that filly Thorpedo Anna, winner of the Kentucky Oaks, is also under consideration for the Belmont Stakes.\n\nSeize the Gray, who defeated Mystik Dan by 2 \u00bc lengths in a sloppy Preakness to thwart his Triple Crown bid, was confirmed for the Belmont Stakes by trainer D. Wayne Lukas three days after that win. Lukas became the oldest conditioner in Triple Crown history with the Preakness win.\n\nLike Mystik Dan, Sierra Leone is also currently training at Saratoga for the Belmont Stakes under the tutelage of Chad Brown, who likes what he is seeing from his colt.\n\n\"I want to maintain where I'm at with [Sierra Leone] and I'm thrilled with how he's moving,\" Brown said.\n\nTrainer Todd Pletcher, who along with Lukas leads all active trainers with four Belmont Stakes wins to date, looks to stack the field as he will likely enter three colts into the race. Antiquarian, winner of the Peter Pan stakes at Aqueduct on May 11, will lead the Pletcher trio along with undefeated Mindframe and Protective.\n\nOn May 30, Pletcher announced that Fierceness, who was targeting the Belmont Stakes after a disappointing 15th-place finish in the Kentucky Derby, would now be pointed towards the Haskell Stakes in July.\n\nOther horses considered probable for the Belmont Stakes include Batten Down, Dornoch, Honor Marie, Resilience, The Wine Steward and Tuscan Gold.", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

The shorter 2024 Belmont Stakes distance is due to a temporary venue change since the Belmont Stakes 2024 will be held at Saratoga Race Course in Upstate New York rather than Belmont Park on Long Island. What hasn't changed is the prestige that comes with winning this race since it's the oldest Triple Crown race. The Belmont Stakes 2024 will go to post at 6:41 p.m. ET on Saturday.\n\nShould you back Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan (5-1) or Preakness champion Seize the Grey (8-1) with your 2024 Belmont Stakes betting strategy? Neither is the 2024 Belmont Stakes favorite, as that honor goes to Sierra Leone, who is at 9-5 in the latest 2024 Belmont Stakes odds. Before making any 2024 Belmont Stakes picks, be sure to see the horse racing predictions and futures bets from SportsLine's elite horse racing expert Jody Demling.\n\nA fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling enters the 2024 Belmont Stakes having nailed the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last six years, including an exacta in 2022 with Mo Donegal and Nest. He also called Flightline's win at the Breeders' Cup Classic in November of that year.\n\nDemling is at his best in the biggest horse races in the world like the Belmont Stakes 2024. In fact, he has hit 11 of the last 16 Derby-Oaks doubles at Churchill Downs. He's also called 10 of the last 20 Preakness winners, including nailing his Preakness winner, exacta, trifecta and superfecta picks in 2023 and then the trifecta again in 2024. Anyone who has followed him is up huge.\n\nNow, with the 2024 Belmont Stakes approaching, Demling is sharing his picks and 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions over at SportsLine. Go here to see them.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions\n\nOne of Demling's surprising 2024 Belmont Stakes picks: He is high on Antiquarian, even though he's a 12-1 longshot. After not racing as a 2-year-old and placing second in his first career start as a 3-year-old, Antiquarian broke maiden at New Orleans Fair Grounds in February. He would just finish sixth at the same track in his next start at the G2 Louisiana Derby, but then bounced back in his fourth start, claiming the G3 Peter Pan Stakes on May 11. Antiquarian also displayed a career-best speed figure in that race and has improved his speed figures in each successive start.\n\nAntiquarian checks every box in regards to pedigree and connections, with the former coming from his sire, Preservationist, being a G1 winner at Saratoga of all tracks. Antiquarian's owner in Centennial Farms and trainer in Todd Pletcher are both previous Belmont winners, with Pletcher being a four-time champion. Meanwhile, John Velazquez has ridden the horse in each of his starts, and he has a pair of Belmont wins under his belt. With so much to like about the horse, you can see why Demling is utilizing Antiquarian in his Belmont Stakes 2024 bets. See which other horses to back at SportsLine.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes picks, bets\n\nDemling is also especially high on an underdog, even though he is coming off a bust in his last race. Demling is sharing which horse it is, and is revealing his surprising prediction for Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey, along with his entire projected 2024 Belmont Stakes leaderboard, over at SportsLine.\n\nWhich horse wins the Belmont Stakes 2024, where does Seize the Grey finish, and which dark-horse is a must-back?

Good luck, have fun, and enjoy the third and final leg of the Triple Crown!\n\nSierra Leone's odds imply about a 36-percent winning probability. while Mindframe's odds shake out to 22 percent. Both have impressive records, with Sierra Leone racking up three wins and two runner-ups in five races and Mindframe winning each of his first two starts.\n\nKentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan's +500 odds translate to a 16.7-percent implied win probability, while Preakness champion Seize the Grey's +800 represent an 11.1-percent chance of winning.\n\nSierra Leone (9-5)\n\nConsidering Sierra Leone came so close to winning the soggy Kentucky Derby -- and he has plenty of experience winning in wet and muddy conditions -- he seems like a fitting favorite in Saratoga this weekend.\n\nFuture Hall-of-Fame trainer and Saratoga native Chad Brown knows this track well and has accumulated a record amount of Belmont training titles. Brown recently made the switch from jockey Tyler Gaffalione to Flavien Prat, which should fare well for Sierra Leone.\n\nA Belmont win feels like this horse's destiny, and the odds suggest that sportsbooks feel the same way. Don't leave Sierra Leone off too many exacta and trifecta tickets.\n\nLegendary trainer Todd Pletcher has four wins and eight seconds in his Belmont career, and Mindframe could easily add to his legacy at Saratoga this weekend. A blazing-fast colt riding under renowned jockey Irad Ortiz Jr., he will be a popular selection going into the weekend.\n\nIn Mindframe's seven-furlong maiden at Gulfstream Park, he won by 13 3/4 lengths and earned a fantastic 113 Beyer Speed Figure, the highest figure recorded by any of the horses in the Belmont field. He then won at Churchill Downs in early May, so his track record is short but promising.\n\nMystik Dan (5-1)\n\nMystik Dan won the Kentucky Derby and finished second at the Preakness, and there's no reason to expect this impressive colt to finish anywhere lower than top three this weekend in Saratoga.\n\nMystik Dan has great speed figures, fantastic stamina, and proven success in wet conditions. He also has a favorable post position at No. 3, which has produced 16 Belmont Stakes winners.\n\nSeize the Grey (8-1)\n\nSeize the Grey broke his maiden at Saratoga, and his trainer Wayne Lucas has won the Belmont four times. After winning the Pat Day Mile on Kentucky Derby day and then emerging victorious at the Preakness by 2.25 lengths, this colt has quickly become a fan favorite.\n\nSeize the Grey has been very busy lately, running three races in five weeks. But fatigue hasn't been a factor, as this horse just continues to show spectacular form. With great pedigree, awesome speed, and underrated stamina, Seize the Grey yields solid value at 8-1. He's racing out of the first post, which has produced a record 24 Belmont wins.\n\nAlthough it's important to note that the Belmont will be held at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, NY -- not its usual venue at Belmont Park, due to a renovation break -- it's still worth noting the past post position success rates for the race and for racing in general.\n\nThe optimal position in horse racing is dependent on a lot of factors, including the horse, the track, the jockey, the terrain, the weather, and the competition.\n\nStrategies also vary based on the position. Every position from 1-13 has won at least one race at the Belmont Stakes. That said, the No. 1 post has come away with the most wins in history at 24 -- great news for Preakness winner Seize the Day.\n\nKentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and his team should be happy, too, as the No. 3 post has won 16 times including last year's race. The No. 1 post last won in 2018.\n\nHere's the full count of winners by post positions throughout the Belmont Stakes history:\n\nThroughout history, 13 different gates have earned at least one victory at the Belmont Stakes since the race began using starting posts in 1904. This year's event features just 10 gates, as it will be held at Saratoga as opposed to the temporarily closed Belmont Park (under construction).\n\nOver the past 118 runnings of the Belmont Stakes, Gate 1 has the most winners (24) and last won in 2018. Gate 3 has produced 16 winners, including 2023 champion Arcangelo.\n\nBelow is a list of all of the winners at each gate since 1904:", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news",

USATSI\n\nThe month of June has arrived, which means it's time for one of America's oldest traditions to take center stage. The Belmont Stakes was first held in 1867, making it the oldest of the three Triple Crown races. The 2024 Belmont Stakes will get underway from Saratoga Race Course on Saturday, June 8. Post time for the Belmont Stakes 2024 is 6:41 p.m. ET. According to the latest 2024 Belmont Stakes odds, Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite after drawing the No. 9 post. Other 2024 Belmont Stakes horses include Mindframe (7-2), Derby winner Mystik Dan (5-1) and Preakness champion Seize the Grey (8-1). With so much to consider while making your 2024 Belmont Stakes picks, a little expert help can go a long way.\n\nThe 2024 Belmont Stakes will be raced at 1 1/4 miles, which is shorter than the Belmont's traditional distance of 1 1/2 miles. In 2020, the Belmont Stakes was the first time since 1925 that the race was not contested at its traditional 1 1/2-mile distance. Secretariat's time of 2:24 remains the record for the Belmont Stakes since the race moved to 1 1/2 miles in 1926. He's widely considered to be the greatest horse of all time and holds the time record for all three Triple Crown races.\n\nGiven all the history, there's a method to picking which horses to focus on for exacta, trifecta and superfecta bets in the Belmont Stakes, and SportsLine expert Jody Demling knows what it is. He can help you make the best 2024 Belmont Stakes picks possible.\n\nA fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling enters the 2024 Belmont Stakes having nailed the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last six years, including an exacta in 2022 with Mo Donegal and Nest. He also called Flightline's win at the Breeders' Cup Classic in November of that year.\n\nDemling is at his best in the biggest horse races in the world like the Belmont Stakes 2024. In fact, he has hit 11 of the last 16 Derby-Oaks doubles at Churchill Downs. He's also called 10 of the last 20 Preakness winners, including nailing his Preakness winner, exacta, trifecta and superfecta picks in 2023 and then the trifecta again in 2024. Anyone who has followed him is up huge.\n\nHe keenly understands when the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes winners were poised for victory or a massive upset in the final leg of the Triple Crown. Anyone who has followed him is up huge. Now, he's sharing all of his 2024 Belmont Stakes bets here.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes expert picks\n\nHere's a refresher on these types of bets from SportsLine's Jody Demling:\n\nBelmont Stakes Exacta: Pick the first- and second-place finishers in the correct order. A $2 exacta returned $68 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Arcangelo and Forte.\n\nBelmont Stakes Trifecta: Pick the first-, second- and third-place finishers in the correct order. A $1 trifecta returned $133.24 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Arcangelo, Forte and Tapit Trice.\n\nBelmont Stakes Superfecta: Pick the first-, second-, third- and fourth-place finishers in the correct order. A $1 superfecta returned $292.50 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Hit Show and $191.50 with Angel of Empire after a tie for fourth.\n\nDemling is fading Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey. Instead, he is building his tickets around Sierra Leone and a big longshot who \"keeps getting better and better.\" You can see his picks here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes bets\n\nDemling has specific recommendations for exacta, trifecta and superfecta wagers so you can cover all your bases at the Belmont Stakes 2024.

Antiquarian is flying under the radar compared to other horses in the 2024 Belmont Stakes field since he did not race in the first two legs of the Triple Crown series. Instead, he won the Peter Pan Stakes on May 11, generally a positive sign heading into the Belmont Stakes.\n\nEight Peter Pan winners have gone on to win the Belmont since 1951, as it shows the ability to stretch out and run a longer distance. Antiquarian is trained by Todd Pletcher, who has won six Triple Crown races, including four at the Belmont Stakes. Demling thinks Antiquarian \"could be one that keeps getting better and better,\" making him a formidable longshot for the final jewel of the Triple Crown.

Because of renovations being done at the traditional home of the Belmont Stakes, Belmont Park, the final leg of the Triple Crown will be run at Saratoga this year and next. For the Belmont Stakes 2024, Kentucky Derby runner-up Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite in the 2024 Belmont Stakes odds. The talented but lightly raced Mindframe (7-2), Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan (5-1) and Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey (8-1) round out the top four choices among the ten 2024 Belmont Stakes horses.\n\nPost time is 6:41 p.m. ET. With an accomplished field set to enter the starting gate on Saturday, you'll want to see what SportsLine writer Gene Menez has to say before making any Belmont Stakes picks or horse racing predictions, given the success he's had during this year's Triple Crown.\n\nA former reporter and editor at Sports Illustrated, Menez covered an array of sports, including horse racing, for the magazine and its website for almost 14 years. Between 2010 and 2012, he served as SI's handicapper for the Triple Crown races and correctly predicted Super Saver to win the Kentucky Derby in 2010.\n\nIn 2015, while writing for Sports on Earth, Menez accurately gave out the Kentucky Derby superfecta (American Pharoah, Firing Line, Dortmund and Frosted), which paid $1,268.20 for $2. Then in 2017, he tweeted out his Kentucky Derby picks, including Always Dreaming to win, and hit the Pick 4, which paid almost $6,900 on a $1 bet.\n\nIn a span of seven races last year for SportsLine, he cashed the winner of the Lecomte Stakes, the exacta in the Southwest Stakes, the winner of the Holy Bull Stakes, the winner of the Sam F. Davis Stakes, and the trifecta in the Jenny Wiley Stakes. He also nailed National Treasure's win in the Preakness. And last month, he gave out 18-1 Mystik Dan as a live longshot in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nFor Saturday, Menez has handicapped the 2024 Belmont Stakes field, made his picks and constructed his best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see them.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions\n\nOne surprise: Menez is completely tossing Mystik Dan, even though he won the Kentucky Derby and finished second in the Preakness Stakes. Listed at 5-1 on the morning line, Mystik Dan has three wins, two seconds and one third in eight career starts. Three weeks ago in the Preakness, he was unable to catch the frontrunning Seize the Grey, who won in wire-to-wire fashion.\n\nMenez thinks that Mystik Dan is due for an off-race in the Belmont, which will be his third start in five weeks. \"I think Mystik Dan will be hard-pressed to produce another top-notch effort,\" Menez told SportsLine. Menez is not using Mystik Dan in any of his wagers.

It's a change of venue for the Test of Champions with Belmont Park undergoing renovations and the move necessitated the race being shortened from 12 furlongs to 10. Mystik Dan was the Kentucky Derby winner and Preakness Stakes runner-up. He's 5-1 in the 2024 Belmont Stakes odds, while Derby runner-up Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite coming in with fresh legs after bypassing the second leg of the Triple Crown.\n\nPreakness winner Seize the Grey is 8-1 and Triple Crown newcomer Mindframe is 7-2 after winning his first two starts by a combined 21 lengths. Before making any 2024 Belmont Stakes picks for the 156th Run for the Carnations, you need to see our 2024 Belmont Stakes cheat sheet, 2024 Belmont Stakes racing form, and 2024 Belmont Stakes past performances featuring analysis from renowned horse racing handicapper Jody Demling.\n\nA fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling enters the 2024 Belmont Stakes having nailed the winner in the third leg of the Triple Crown four of the last six years, including an exacta in 2022 with Mo Donegal and Nest. He also called Flightline's win at the Breeders' Cup Classic in November of that year.\n\nDemling is at his best in the biggest horse races in the world like the Kentucky Derby 2024. In fact, he has hit 11 of the last 16 Derby-Oaks doubles at Churchill Downs. That means he held a ticket with the winners of both races all but five times in the last 16 years. He's also called 10 of the last 20 Preakness winners, including nailing his Preakness winner, exacta, trifecta and superfecta picks in 2023 and then hitting the trifecta in 2024. Anyone who has followed him is up huge.\n\nNow, with the 2024 Belmont Stakes odds already on the board, SportsLine has teamed up with Demling to provide a complete 2024 Belmont Stakes cheat sheet racing form with connections, past performances, speed figures, expert picks and more, all to save you time on your Belmont Stakes bets.

The 2024 Belmont Stakes cheat sheet will give you post position, connections, odds, career record, earnings, past performances and speed figures. You'll also get analysis from Demling on each horse, including his breakdown of Seize the Grey, who is coming off a wire-to-wire win in the Preakness Stakes.\n\nTrainer D. Wayne Lukas is now a 15-time American Classic winner after Seize the Grey won him his seventh Preakness Stakes three weeks ago. Lukas has guided four Belmont Stakes winners in his career, including Tabasco Cat, Thunder Gulch and Editor's Note in three consecutive years from 1994 to 1996 as well as Commendable in 2000. Jockey Jaime Torres was the top apprentice-level rider on the NYRA circuit last year and won his first career Triple Crown start on Seize the Grey at Pimlico. Sired by Arrogate out of Smart Strike mare Smart Shopping, Seize the Grey will prefer to go to the front of the pack and will have a short trip on the rail if he can break cleanly against an improved field for the third leg of the Triple Crown.\n\nHere's a sample of the 2024 Belmont Stakes cheat sheet with Seize the Grey's PPs:\n\nSeize the Grey\n\nPost position: 1\n\nTrainer: D. Wayne Lukas (Belmont winner in '94, '95, '96, '00)\n\nJockey: Jaime Torres\n\nOdds: 8-1\n\nCareer earnings: $1,819,940 (third in Belmont field)\n\nCareer record (starts-win-place-show): 10-4-0-3\n\nNotable win: Preakness Stakes (G1)\n\nBest consensus speed figure: 101 (fifth in Belmont field)\n\nLast Race: 1st by 2.25, lengths Preakness Stakes (G1)\n\nAnalysis: The D. Wayne Lukas trained colt proved me wrong in the Preakness Stakes. There will be more pace for him to deal with in this one and I believe the distance will prove too much. I believe his odds will end up being higher in the Belmont than they were in the Preakness.\n\nWith the Belmont Stakes 2024 cheat sheets from SportsLine, you can get a breakdown and important details on every horse in the field on Saturday.

It is the 12th of 14 races scheduled at Saratoga that day.\n\nCoverage of the early races will begin on FS1 at 10:30 a.m. ET and Belmont Stakes coverage will air from 4 to 7 p.m. ET on FOX.\n\nPost time is 6:41 p.m. ET.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes is known as the final jewel of the Triple Crown, a series of races for 3-year-old horses run on three tracks over five weeks. The Triple Crown consists of the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes and Belmont Stakes.\n\nThere will be no Triple Crown attempt this year after Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan was upset by Seize the Grey at the Preakness.\n\nThis is the first time since 2013 that the Kentucky Derby winner and the Preakness winner will both race in the Belmont Stakes. Preakness winner Oxbow was second to Derby winner Palace Malice that year, and Oxbow's former trainer D. Wayne Lukas will attempt to take both the Preakness and Belmont this year with his horse Seize the Grey.\n\nThe last horse to sweep the Preakness and Belmont after failing to win the Kentucky Derby was Afleet Alex in 2005.\n\nSeize the Grey gave the 88-year-old Lukas his seventh Preakness win, but he'll face some tough competition in this race against Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and runner-up Sierra Leone, who is the 9-5 morning line favorite.\n\nArcangelo defeated favored Forte by a length, making Jena Antonucci the first woman to train a winner of a Triple Crown race.\n\nForte was set to be the favorite at the Kentucky Derby last year before being scratched for medical reasons. He went on to win the Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga before being retired.\n\nArcangelo, who also did not race in the Kentucky Derby, came to the Belmont after a win in the Peter Pan Stakes, which is same route Antiquarian is attempting to take this year.\n\nArcangelo went on to win the Travers at Saratoga and was retired. He won the Eclipse Award for the best 3-year-old male horse in 2023.\n\nThe Belmont has been moved upstate to Saratoga Race Course because of renovations at Belmont Park that include the demolition of the current grandstand that opened in 1968, marking the first time it will not be run at Belmont Park since 1967. The race moved to Aqueduct Racetrack from 1963-1967 during the last major renovation of Belmont Park.\n\nThe Belmont is normally run at 1 \u00bd miles, but because of the configuration of Saratoga's smaller track, this year's race will be run at 1 \u00bc miles, the same distance as the Kentucky Derby. This is only the second time since 1926 that the race has been shortened; the 2020 race which was rescheduled because of the COVID-19 pandemic and was run at 1 \u215b miles.\n\nWhile Saratoga Race Course does not generally open until July, an exception has been made for a four-day meet called the Belmont Stakes Racing Festival. The race will also be held at Saratoga in 2025.\n\nThere will be 10 horses running in the Belmont Stakes this year, including Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and Preakness winner Seize the Gray. Sierra Leone, who finished second in the Kentucky Derby, returns to the Triple Crown trail after skipping the Preakness.\n\nTerrell: Seize the Grey took an early lead on a muddy track and never gave it up to win the Preakness for his second straight graded stakes win. He likely won't get an easy lead in the Belmont Stakes with more speed horses in the race.\n\nMarks: Seize the Grey got the perfect ride in the Preakness and didn't face a lot of pressure. Expect more pace in the Belmont and the distance is greater than in the Preakness, which is not to his benefit. Drawing the rail will help him save ground, however, and trainer D. Wayne Lukas is one of the best in the business.\n\nTerrell: Trainer Bill Mott initially indicated his colt would skip the Belmont and try his hand at shorter distances after finishing sixth in the Kentucky Derby. He changed his mind after watching the colt train for the past few weeks.\n\nMarks: Resilience ran better than he looked in the Derby, from the No. 18 post. He had a lot of work to do and still finished sixth. He will be wearing blinkers for the third straight race, and it has helped him in the past, including at the Wood Memorial in April.\n\nTerrell: Mystik Dan finished second in the Preakness despite his trainer's concerns about his ability to bounce back on two weeks of rest after the Kentucky Derby.\n\nMarks: Mystik Dan had the perfect trip in the Kentucky Derby, finished second in the Preakness and loves running on a sloppy track. The distance of the Belmont suits him better at 10 furlongs instead of 12, but this will be his third race in five weeks.\n\nTerrell: The Wine Steward has finished second in all three of his graded stakes attempts dating back to last October.\n\nMarks: This is a New York-bred horse who finished second in the Lexington and Peter Pan Stakes. He races better on a shorter distance. If this was eight furlongs, I'd like The Wine Steward more, but he will likely still be a home crowd favorite Saturday.\n\nTerrell: Antiquarian is one of three horses trained by Todd Pletcher in this race. His lone win of the year was in the Peter Pan Stakes, where he beat several other horses that he'll be facing in this one.\n\nMarks: Antiquarian's win in the Peter Pan Stakes was impressive and he has won on a sloppy track before. He has improved since that win and should be competitive in the Belmont.\n\nTerrell: Dornoch finished 10th in the Kentucky Derby and skipped the Preakness. His best races this year are wins in the Fountain of Youth and Blue Grass Stakes.\n\nMarks: Dornoch didn't get a good ride in the Derby but he the son of Good Magic and the brother to Mage, last year's Derby winner. He has the speed to press and give Seize the Grey a good challenge.\n\nTerrell: Jockey Tyler Gaffalione switches from Sierra Leone, whom he rode in the first two legs of the Triple Crown, to Todd Pletcher trainee Protective, who finished third in the Peter Pan Stakes on May 11. Protective has yet to win a race in four lifetime starts but has never finished worse than third. At 20-1, he is expected to be one of the longest shots in the race.\n\nMarks: The Belmont will be Protective's first Grade 1 race. He should be comfortable at this distance and his owner Mike Repole will be hoping for a win after his other horse, Fierceness, struggled to contend at the Preakness.\n\nTerrell: Honor Marie will be a long shot after an eighth-place finish in the Kentucky Derby where he was jostled hard coming out of the gate. This colt's best race this year was a runner-up finish to Catching Freedom in the Louisiana Derby.\n\nMarks: Honor Marie did not race in the Preakness, so having the extra rest will be an advantage. He comes from a small barn and will be a great story to follow on Saturday. While he ran well in the Louisiana Derby, Honor Marie will need a lot of speed up front to close from behind in this race.\n\nTerrell: Sierra Leone gets a new jockey in Flavien Prat after a controversial runner-up finish in the Kentucky Derby that featured a lot of contact with third-place finisher Forever Young. Trainer Chad Brown has lost the Belmont three times, with his best finish coming from runner up Gronkowski in 2018.\n\nMarks: Sierra Leone is the best horse racing on Saturday. He skipped the Preakness and will have extra rest entering the Belmont Stakes. While he is better suited for 12 furlongs, as opposed to 10, Sierra Leone will be outfitted with a cage bit mouthpiece to help Prat with steering.\n\nTerrell: Mindframe is the most lightly raced colt in the field. The Todd Pletcher trainee comes off a seven-length win in an allowance race at Churchill Downs on May 4.\n\nMarks: Mindframe has only two wins, but both have been convincing. He won his first race at Gulfstream by 13 lengths and while he lacks experience, Mindframe is uber-talented. He drew the outside post so he will likely lose some ground to start, but he has the speed to get to the front. The son of Constitution could be the winner Saturday, just as fellow offspring Tiz The Law was at the 2020 Belmont Stakes.\n\nTo win: Resilience, Exacta: Resilience over Sierra Leone, Trifecta: Resilience // Sierra Leone // Mystik Dan, Protective, Seize the Grey\n\nThere are some that think that Sierra Leone (9-5) would have won the Kentucky Derby if he had run straight down the stretch, and that's reflected in his odds. Resilience finished sixth in the Derby but has been training well, offers better value, and perhaps made a move too early in the Derby. Trainer Bill Mott initially thought that he might prefer less distance, but obviously felt good enough about how he has been training to enter him into the shortened version of the Belmont.\n\nExacta: 2, 9, 10 (Resilience, Sierra Leone, Mindframe)\n\nSierra Leone is the best horse in this race.

USATSI\n\nThe 2024 Belmont Stakes will have a temporary home this year, as Saratoga Race Course will host the final leg of the Triple Crown due to ongoing construction at Belmont Park. Saturday's race will be run at a shorter 1.25-mile distance than the standard 1.5-mile length because of the venue change. Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey are both in the official 2024 Belmont Stakes field. However, Kentucky Derby runner-up Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite in the 2024 Belmont Stakes odds following Monday's 2024 Belmont Stakes post draw.\n\nSierra Leone comes into the Belmont Stakes 2024 with extra rest after sitting out during the Preakness, while Mystik Dan is getting set to run in all three legs of the Triple Crown. How should rest play a role in your 2024 Belmont Stakes prediction? With so much to consider while making your 2024 Belmont Stakes picks, a little expert help can go a long way.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes is at the heart of horse racing as the final jewel of the Triple Crown, and it is often considered to be the most difficult of the three major races. It is the longest of the races and always features an elite field to serve as a true \"Test of the Champion.\" Only 13 horses have been able to make history as a Triple Crown winner, the most recent being Justify in 2018. There was a 25-year Triple Crown drought before American Pharoah won in 2015, and the current drought was extended to six years when Mystik Dan did not win the Preakness. However, there is still plenty on the line this year, especially with multiple proven winners in the 2024 Belmont Stakes lineup.\n\nGiven all the history, there's a method to picking which horses to focus on for exacta, trifecta and superfecta bets in the Belmont Stakes, and SportsLine expert Jody Demling knows what it is. He can help you make the best 2024 Belmont Stakes picks possible.\n\nA fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling enters the 2024 Belmont Stakes having nailed the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last six years, including an exacta in 2022 with Mo Donegal and Nest. He also called Flightline's win at the Breeders' Cup Classic in November of that year.\n\nDemling is at his best in the biggest horse races in the world like the Belmont Stakes 2024. In fact, he has hit 11 of the last 16 Derby-Oaks doubles at Churchill Downs. He's also called 10 of the last 20 Preakness winners, including nailing his Preakness winner, exacta, trifecta and superfecta picks in 2023 and then the trifecta again in 2024. Anyone who has followed him is up huge.\n\nHe keenly understands when the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes winners were poised for victory or a massive upset in the final leg of the Triple Crown. Anyone who has followed him is up huge. Now, he's sharing all of his 2024 Belmont Stakes bets here.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes expert picks\n\nHere's a refresher on these types of bets from SportsLine's Jody Demling:\n\nBelmont Stakes Exacta: Pick the first- and second-place finishers in the correct order. A $2 exacta returned $68 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Arcangelo and Forte.\n\nBelmont Stakes Trifecta: Pick the first-, second- and third-place finishers in the correct order. A $1 trifecta returned $133.24 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Arcangelo, Forte and Tapit Trice.\n\nBelmont Stakes Superfecta: Pick the first-, second-, third- and fourth-place finishers in the correct order. A $1 superfecta returned $292.50 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Hit Show and $191.50 with Angel of Empire after a tie for fourth.\n\nDemling is fading Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey. Instead, he is building his tickets around Sierra Leone and a big longshot who \"keeps getting better and better.\" You can see his picks here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes bets\n\nDemling has specific recommendations for exacta, trifecta and superfecta wagers so you can cover all your bases at the Belmont Stakes 2024.

Because of renovations being done at the traditional home of the Belmont, Belmont Park, the final leg of the Triple Crown will be run at Saratoga this year and in 2025. Kentucky Derby runner-up Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite in the 2024 Belmont Stakes odds. Mindframe (7-2), Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan (5-1) and Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey (8-1) round out the top four choices among the 2024 Belmont Stakes horses. Post time is 6:41 p.m. ET. The latest 2024 Belmont Stakes weather forecast is calling for a 20% chance of rain.\n\nWith an accomplished field set to enter the starting gate on Saturday, you'll want to see what SportsLine writer Gene Menez has to say before making any Belmont Stakes picks or horse racing predictions. Join SportsLine here to get his full Belmont Stakes picks and start winning.\n\nA former reporter and editor at Sports Illustrated, Menez covered an array of sports, including horse racing, for the magazine and its website for almost 14 years. Between 2010 and 2012, he served as SI's handicapper for the Triple Crown races and correctly predicted Super Saver to win the Kentucky Derby in 2010.\n\nIn 2015, while writing for Sports on Earth, Menez accurately gave out the Kentucky Derby superfecta (American Pharoah, Firing Line, Dortmund and Frosted), which paid $1,268.20 for $2. Then in 2017, he tweeted out his Kentucky Derby picks, including Always Dreaming to win, and hit the Pick 4, which paid almost $6,900 on a $1 bet. Join SportsLine right here to see his 2024 Belmont Stakes picks.\n\nIn a span of seven races last year for SportsLine, he cashed the winner of the Lecomte Stakes, the exacta in the Southwest Stakes ($468), the winner of the Holy Bull Stakes, the winner of the Sam F. Davis Stakes, and the trifecta in the Jenny Wiley Stakes. And last month, he gave out 18-1 Mystik Dan as a live longshot in the Kentucky Derby. Anyone who has followed him is WAY UP!\n\nNow, Menez has looked at the 2024 Belmont Stakes, made his picks and formulated his bets. Join SportsLine here to see them.\n\nWe can tell you that Menez is completely tossing Mystik Dan, even though he won the Kentucky Derby and finished second in the Preakness Stakes. \"I think Mystik Dan will be hard-pressed to produce another top-notch effort,\" Menez told SportsLine. Menez is not using Mystik Dan in any of his wagers.\n\nInstead, Menez's top pick is a horse who will be \"right there when the horses hit the wire.\" He also is high on a double-digit longshot who is coming off a performance that is \"better than it looks on paper.\" He is including these horses in his wagers, and so should you.

In the 155 previous editions of the Belmont, 66, or 42.6%, have been won by the betting favorite. That includes the favorite winning three of the last four years and four of the last six. On Saturday, Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite in the 2024 Belmont Stakes odds. The talented but lightly raced Mindframe (7-2), Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan (5-1) and Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey (8-1) round out the top four favorites among the 2024 Belmont Stakes horses.\n\nPost time is 6:41 p.m. ET. With an accomplished field set to enter the starting gate on Saturday, you'll want to see what SportsLine writer Gene Menez has to say before making any Belmont Stakes picks or horse racing predictions, given the success he's had during this year's Triple Crown.\n\nA former reporter and editor at Sports Illustrated, Menez covered an array of sports, including horse racing, for the magazine and its website for almost 14 years. Between 2010 and 2012, he served as SI's handicapper for the Triple Crown races and correctly predicted Super Saver to win the Kentucky Derby in 2010.\n\nIn 2015, while writing for Sports on Earth, Menez accurately gave out the Kentucky Derby superfecta (American Pharoah, Firing Line, Dortmund and Frosted), which paid $1,268.20 for $2. Then in 2017, he tweeted out his Kentucky Derby picks, including Always Dreaming to win, and hit the Pick 4, which paid almost $6,900 on a $1 bet.\n\nIn a span of seven races last year for SportsLine, he cashed the winner of the Lecomte Stakes, the exacta in the Southwest Stakes, the winner of the Holy Bull Stakes, the winner of the Sam F. Davis Stakes, and the trifecta in the Jenny Wiley Stakes. He also nailed National Treasure's win in the Preakness. And last month, he gave out 18-1 Mystik Dan as a live longshot in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nFor Saturday, Menez has handicapped the 2024 Belmont Stakes field, made his picks and constructed his best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see them.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions\n\nOne surprise: Menez is completely tossing Mystik Dan, even though he won the Kentucky Derby and finished second in the Preakness Stakes. The Kentucky Derby winner ran creditably as the 5-2 favorite in the Preakness Stakes, but still finished second to frontrunning winner Seize the Grey. For the Belmont 2024, Mystik Dan is the 5-1 third choice behind Sierra Leone (9-5) and Mindframe (7-2).\n\nStatistics show that, since 1995, Belmont runners whose last start came in the Preakness, such as Mystik Dan, have not run as well as runners who made their last start in the Kentucky Derby. \"I think Mystik Dan will be hard-pressed to produce another top-notch effort,\" Menez told SportsLine. Menez is not using Mystik Dan in any of his wagers. You can see all of Menez's 2024 Belmont Stakes bets here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes picks\n\nHowever, Menez's top pick is a horse who will be \"right there when the horses hit the wire.\" He also is high on a double-digit longshot who is coming off a performance that is \"better than it looks on paper.\" He is including these horses in his wagers, and so should you. He's sharing which horses to back at SportsLine.\n\nSo who wins Belmont Stakes 2024? What double-digit longshot has a big chance to run well, and how has Menez constructed his wagers? Visit SportsLine to see Menez's picks for the Belmont Stakes, all from the expert who gave out Mystik Dan as a live longshot in the Kentucky Derby, and find out.\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes odds, contenders, post positionsPrg #HorseOddsProjection1Seize the Grey8-1SEE PICKS2Resilience10-1SEE PICKS\n\n3Mystik Dan5-1SEE PICKS\n\n4The Wine Steward15-1SEE PICKS\n\n5Antiquarian12-1SEE PICKS\n\n6Dornoch15-1SEE PICKS\n\n7Protective20-1SEE PICKS\n\n8Honor Marie12-1SEE PICKS\n\n9Sierra Leone9-5SEE PICKS\n\n10Mindframe7-2SEE PICKS", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_gate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting gate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasure_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Treasure (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firing_Line_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Firing Line (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frosted_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frosted (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pharoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Pharoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Wiley_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jenny Wiley Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_Dreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Always Dreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecomte_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lecomte Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Bull_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holy Bull Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_F._Davis_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam F.

Mindframe broke his maiden in his first-ever race on March 30 at Gulfstream Park. The colt followed with a victory at Churchill Downs on May 4. Pletcher is no longer running Fierceness, the morning favorite to win the 2024 Kentucky Derby before finishing 15th, and instead has Mindframe among the 2024 Belmont Stakes horses.\n\nMindframe had a 103 Beyer Speed Figure in his first career race, the highest mark for any of the 2024 Belmont Stakes entries. When Mindframe was stretched out to 1 1/16 miles on May 4, he showed his dominance with a victory by 7 1/2 lengths. Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite in the latest 2024 Belmont Stakes odds, while Mystic Dan, the Kentucky Derby winner who finished second at the Preakness Stakes, is 5-1. The Belmont Stakes 2024 post time is 6:41 p.m. ET. Before making any 2024 Belmont Stakes picks, be sure to see the horse racing predictions and futures bets from SportsLine's elite horse racing expert Jody Demling.\n\nA fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling enters the 2024 Belmont Stakes having nailed the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last six years, including an exacta in 2022 with Mo Donegal and Nest. He also called Flightline's win at the Breeders' Cup Classic in November of that year.\n\nDemling is at his best in the biggest horse races in the world like the Belmont Stakes 2024. In fact, he has hit 11 of the last 16 Derby-Oaks doubles at Churchill Downs. He's also called 10 of the last 20 Preakness winners, including nailing his Preakness winner, exacta, trifecta and superfecta picks in 2023 and then the trifecta again in 2024. Anyone who has followed him is up huge.\n\nNow, with the 2024 Belmont Stakes approaching, Demling is sharing his picks and 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions over at SportsLine. Go here to see them.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions\n\nOne of Demling's surprising 2024 Belmont Stakes picks: He is high on Antiquarian, even though he's a 12-1 longshot. Antiquarian will start in the middle at post position No. 5, which has the third-best win percentage (14.9%) of any post in Belmont Stakes history. Post No. 5 has produced 15 Belmont Stakes winners, most recently American Pharoah in 2015, so history indicates this could be a strong draw for Antiquarian.\n\nAntiquarian is trained by Todd Pletcher and will be ridden by John Velazquez. The two have delivered a Belmont Stakes victory together in the past (Rags to Riches, 2007). They've also succeeded in the final leg of the Triple Crown separately, as Velazquez has two Belmont Stakes wins and Pletcher has four. Antiquarian is coming off a victory in the Peter Pan Stakes, which produced last year's Belmont Stakes winner, Arcangelo.

The final leg of the Triple Crown takes place on Saturday at Saratoga Race Course at 6:41 p.m. ET USATSI\n\nThe 2024 Belmont Stakes won't run at Belmont Park for the first time since 1967 due to renovations at the Long Island racetrack. Instead, the Belmont Stakes 2024 will take place at Saratoga Race Course, roughly 200 miles north of Belmont Park. Outside of just the location change, the move to Saratoga Race Course will also shorten the 2024 Belmont Stakes from 1 1/2 miles to 1 1/4 on Saturday. How should the shorter race affect your 2024 Belmont Stakes prediction? Mindframe is one of only three horses in the 2024 Belmont Stakes field that hasn't run in a Triple Crown race this year and the Todd Pletcher-trained horse hasn't been pushed more than 1 1/16 miles over his first two career races.\n\nThe jump to 1 1/4 miles isn't as daunting as the traditional length of the Belmont Stakes, so does this put him in a better position to claim the Belmont Stakes 2024 title? Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite, followed by Mindframe (7-2) in the latest 2024 Belmont Stakes odds. Post time is 6:41 p.m. ET. With several accomplished horses set to enter the starting gate on Saturday, you'll want to see what Santa Anita Park-based racing reporter and analyst Michelle Yu has to say before making any 2024 Belmont Stakes picks.\n\nFew people in racing are as well-connected as Yu. An on-air host and reporter who has provided racing analysis for TVG, HRTV and the Breeders' Cup, Yu has spent a lifetime in racing. Prior to her television career, she worked for trainers Steve Asmussen and Ron Moquett. She also is married to Santa Anita-based trainer Ryan Hanson.\n\nYu also has tremendous handicapping chops. In a wide-open Kentucky Derby in 2021, she gave out Medina Spirit, who crossed the finish line first, as the winner at 12-1. In Pool 5 of the Kentucky Derby Future Wager two years ago, she suggested a play on All Other 3-Year-Olds, which cashed at a whopping 18-1 when Rich Strike won the Derby.\n\nLast year she crushed the Saudi Cup, riding 15-1 winner Panthalassa. She also smashed the Haskell Stakes for a $663 score, hitting 12-1 winner Geaux Rocket Ride as well as the exacta. Those were just two of her scores in 2023.\n\nShe enters this year's Belmont Stakes on a roll. She correctly called National Treasure to win the Pegasus World Cup. In the last two months, she predicted Stronghold's upset win in the Santa Anita Derby, en route to a $219.50 payday, and smashed the exacta in the Apple Blossom Handicap as part of a $410 score.\n\nFor the final leg of the Triple Crown, Yu has handicapped the 2024 Belmont Stakes lineup, made her picks and constructed her best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see them.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions\n\nOne surprise: Yu is fading Seize the Grey, even though he is coming off a win in the Preakness Stakes. The Preakness Stakes was Seize the Grey's second victory in two weeks after taking the Pat Day Mile on May 4. His 2024 Belmont Stakes odds have dropped from the 12-1 he was fetching in the Preakness Stakes, however, which has taken away some of his value for this Triple Crown race.\n\nSeize the Grey finished seventh in the Blue Grass Stakes, leaving him out of the Kentucky Derby. He finished third in the Jeff Ruby Steaks before the Blue Grass, so although he's won back-to-back starts, Seize the Grey has failed to win six of 10 career races. Overall, Yu doesn't project value in using Seize the Grey at his current price in 2024 Belmont Stakes bets. You can see all of Yu's 2024 Belmont Stakes bets here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes picks\n\nInstead, Yu's top pick is a horse who \"has been training forwardly.\" She also has identified a double-digit longshot who is a strong \"longshot play.\" She has made her 2024 Belmont Stakes bets, and she's sharing which 2024 Belmont Stakes horses to back only at SportsLine.\n\nSo who wins the 2024 Belmont Stakes? What double-digit longshot is a must-play? And how has Yu constructed her wagers? Visit SportsLine to see Yu's picks for the Belmont Stakes 2024, all from the Santa Anita Park-based racing insider who has been red-hot all year, and find out.\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes odds, contendersPrg #HorseOddsProjection1Seize the Grey8-1SEE PICKS2Resilience10-1SEE PICKS\n\n3Mystik Dan5-1SEE PICKS\n\n4The Wine Steward15-1SEE PICKS\n\n5Antiquarian12-1SEE PICKS\n\n6Dornoch15-1SEE PICKS\n\n7Protective20-1SEE PICKS\n\n8Honor Marie12-1SEE PICKS\n\n9Sierra Leone9-5SEE PICKS\n\n10Mindframe7-2SEE PICKS", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Long Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rich Strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasure_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Treasure (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haskell Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina_Spirit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medina Spirit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_World_Cup_Invitational_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pegasus World Cup Invitational Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Anita_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Anita Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Asmussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Asmussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeders'_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breeders' Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Anita_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Anita Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parimutuel_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parimutuel betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equestrianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equestrianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Day", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Day"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2022/06/07/c4f4f273-4535-4496-8bc6-2f3ef28679f8/thumbnail/1200x675/541b25a46544857d5194897be2c444ec/richstrike2cbs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623848", "eventUri": "eng-9623848", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-04", "textStart": 3001, "textEnd": 3006}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

This is the first Belmont Stakes since 2018 in which the winners of the Kentucky Derby (Mystik Dan) and Preakness Stakes (Seize The Grey) will run.\n\nThere's also an exciting rematch between Mystik Dan and Sierra Leone after the two horses finished noses apart in the Kentucky Derby. Gamblers can measure rematches and past performances all throughout this race.\n\nHere are the current odds as listed for the top favorites in this 10-horse field. Final betting odds become official at post time.\n\n9. Sierra Leone 9/510. Mindframe 7/23. Mystik Dan 5/11. Seize The Grey 8/12. Resilience 10/15. Antiquarian 12/18. Honor Marie 12/16. Dornoch 15/14. Wine Steward 15/17. Protective 20/1\n\nWeather forecasts indicate a blend of rain, showers and thundershowers passing through Saratoga from Thursday through Saturday. If the rain is heavy enough, the track listing will go from fast to good or sloppy. This will necessitate a horse-for-courses assessment.\n\nMystik Dan, Sierra Leone and Seize The Grey have all run well on off tracks. So has Resilience, the No. 2 horse, which may be a prominent stalker here.\n\nClaim $500 or $220 FanDuel Belmont Stakes bonus for June 8\n\nWatch track conditions on Saturday to determine whether winners are coming from the first or second pack of horses.\n\nBettors should remember that can enjoy one of the year's biggest horse-racing days and accomplish important preparation at the same time, so keep all of this in mind. One more thing: Good Luck!\n\nHere is some key information about the race:\n\nDate: June 8, 2024Location: Saratoga Race Course (Saratoga Springs, NY)Length: 1 1/4 milesPost Time: 6:41 p.m. ETBroadcast: Fox, Fox Sports App, FanDuel TVPurse: $2 millionREAD: Early Belmont Stakes Odds\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes win bet picks: Sierra Leone (9/5)\n\nThe key to this entire betting strategy will be Sierra Leone running first or second. Everything will spread from that focus. This been the most consistent horse all winter and spring and he's due to hit the wire first in a major after just missing in the Kentucky Derby, coming from 17th to finish second by a nostril to Mystik Dan.\n\nSierra Leone's stalking style is good for this race, which is loaded with speed. Should be able to make patented late move, but would be best suited to avoid running so wide. Gets a jockey change to Flavien Prat, as trainer Chad Brown hopes for a smoother trip for his horse. Jockey Tyler Gaffalione was actually fined because he could not keep Sierra Leone from drifting into third place and bumping Forever Young during the Kentucky Derby homestretch.\n\nClaim up to $500 FanDuel Racing Belmont bonus for Saturday's race\n\nWhat happens, if, instead of trying to make up five lengths down the lane (as usual) it's only two? Sierra Leone is well-rested after skipping the Preakness Stakes and haveing five weeks off.\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes predictions: Place bets on Mystik Dan (5/1)\n\nHey, 5/1 seems generous on the win line for the Kentucky Derby champion. That makes the place price an attractive option, too.\n\nPlace prices in high-volume betting events like this one often provide about $1 more than you'd expect. We like him in this spot. He always runs well and could have a blistering speed duel to try and run down.\n\nBelmont Stakes best bets: Show Bet Antiquarian (5) or Resilience (2)\n\nTo be determined by how they look in the post parade. Both have credentials. Antiquarian won the Peter Pan, which produced 2023 Belmont winner Arcangelo. Resilience captured the Wood Memorial. Should pay well.\n\nBelmont Stakes Exacta picks: Sierra Leone and Mystik Dan (9-3)\n\nThe leap of faith here is that the frontrunners (Seize The Grey, Dornoch, Mindframe, Antiquarian and even Resilience), make the pace contentious enough that the closers can run them down. This bet has a good chance if you see a duel develop. If one horse shakes free and is running relaxed, this bet will be compromised.\n\nBelmont Stakes Trifecta picks: 50-cent Trifecta Box with Sierra Leone, Mystik Dan, Seize The Grey and Mindframe (9-3-1-10)\n\nThis wager (costs $12 total) accounts for the possibility that the two closers get in the trifecta along with the best early speed horse. There is some hedging built into this bet. On paper, Mindframe doesn't belong in this race. He hasn't proven himself at a championship level and indeed ran in an undercard race for the Kentucky Derby.\n\nBut why is he second choice at 7-2? Bettors look at the Todd Pletcher-Irad Ortiz training-riding angle and believe this lightly-raced horse is about to blossom. It's hard to simply ignore a betting trend that strong. I don't think this race sets up for him, but have to include Mindframe in at least one ticket.\n\n$1 Trifecta Box with Sierra Leone, Mystik Dan and Seize The Grey (9-3-1)\n\nMight as well spend $6 to see if the Kentucky Derby winner, Kentucky Derby runner-up and Preakness champion are the best three horses in the land right now. This bet boxes Sierra Leone, Mystik Dan and Seize The Grey to finish in any order in the top three.\n\nBelmont Stakes Superfecta Picks: Superfecta Key and Partial Wheel (50-cent wager for total cost of $24)\n\nThis might not be available in every state, but the bet works like this:\n\nSuperfecta Key (9 over the 1, 10, 3, 5, 1,10,3,5, 1,10,3,5) Superfecta Partial Wheel (1,10,3,5 over 9 over 1,10,3,5, 1,10,3,5)\n\nThis puts Sierra Leone first and second with Seize the Grey, Mindframe, Mystik Dan and Antiquarian in the superfecta.\n\nThis expands the ticket to include the Peter Pan winner and provides the flexibility to be wrong about one of the four supporting horses as long as the key entry, Sierra Leone, runs first or second.\n\nAmong the top undercard events are the Metropolitan Handicap and Casino Manhattan. Both are worth $1 million. Saratoga's card, part of its weekend Racing Festival, pays purses more than $6.5 million, one of the best of the entire horse-racing season.\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes Betting Options: Win, Place, Show & More\n\nWhen it comes to horse racing, there are several different types of wagers that bettors can place:\n\nWin: Horse must finish first to cash your ticket. Place: Horse can finish first or second. This will be a lower payout than the win price, but provide two opportunities to cash a ticket.Show: Horse can finish first, second or third. An even lower price for a third opportunity to cash a ticket, but can pay surprisingly well depending on the choice.\n\nIn addition, you can also bet \"across the board\" and place three separate wagers on a horse to finish first, second and third. For instance, $5 across the board wager is a $15 total bet. A winning horse will return three winning tickets. A horse finishing second will pay on the place and show bets.\n\nFinishing third is a win on the show pool. This was once a fancy wager, but has been replaced by exotics, which can pay extraordinarily well. They have grown exceptionally popular and include exactas, trifectas and superfectas.\n\nClaim up to $500 FanDuel Racing Belmont promo for Saturday's race\n\nExacta: Involves picking the first two finishers in exact order. For most players, take this wager in a box. Trifecta: Must pick the top three finishers in exact order.\n\nThe above wagers can also be boxed, which means the horses can finish in any order. While this has an impact on the odds, it offers more chances to win. A $5 exacta box 2-4 (the No. 2 and No. 4 horses) costs $10 and provides a winning ticket if the winning combination is 2-4 or 4-2.\n\nSuperfecta: A player must select the top four finishers in exact order. This costs more money, maybe a lot more.\n\nYou must be over 21 to play. Gambling Problem?

USATSI\n\nThe 2024 Belmont Stakes will have a different look when it takes place on Saturday, June 8. Due to construction at Belmont Park, the Third Jewel of the Triple Crown will be held at Saratoga Race Course. The biggest difference will be the 2024 Belmont Stakes distance, which has been shortened to 1 1/4 mile long instead of the traditional 1 1/2. The shorter length could benefit 2024 Belmont Stakes horses like Antiquarian, who won the Peter Pan Stakes at 1 1/8 miles last month. Antiquarian is a 12-1 long shot in the latest 2024 Belmont Stakes odds. Post time for the race is 6:41 p.m. ET.\n\nKentucky Derby runner-up Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite to win the Belmont Stakes 2024, followed by Mindframe at 7-2. Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan is 5-1 and Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey comes is 8-1. With so much to consider while making your 2024 Belmont Stakes picks, a little expert help can go a long way.\n\nAntiquarian will garner plenty of attention given the connection between the Peter Pan Stakes and Belmont Stakes. Nine of the first 12 winners of the Peter Pan went on to win the Belmont, and eight Peter Pan winners since 1951 have also won the final race of the Triple Crown. Four of those eight won both races in the same decade: Counterpoint (1951), High Gun (1954), Gallant Man (1957) and Cavan (1958). The most recent was Arcangelo, who won the Peter Pan and Belmont Stakes in 2023.\n\nGiven all the history, there's a method to picking which horses to focus on for exacta, trifecta and superfecta bets in the Belmont Stakes, and SportsLine expert Jody Demling knows what it is. He can help you make the best 2024 Belmont Stakes picks possible.\n\nA fixture in the horse racing world who has been writing about, talking about and betting on races for years, Demling enters the 2024 Belmont Stakes having nailed the winner of the Belmont Stakes four of the last six years, including an exacta in 2022 with Mo Donegal and Nest. He also called Flightline's win at the Breeders' Cup Classic in November of that year.\n\nDemling is at his best in the biggest horse races in the world like the Belmont Stakes 2024. In fact, he has hit 11 of the last 16 Derby-Oaks doubles at Churchill Downs. He's also called 10 of the last 20 Preakness winners, including nailing his Preakness winner, exacta, trifecta and superfecta picks in 2023 and then the trifecta again in 2024. Anyone who has followed him is up huge.\n\nHe keenly understands when the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes winners were poised for victory or a massive upset in the final leg of the Triple Crown. Anyone who has followed him is up huge. Now, he's sharing all of his 2024 Belmont Stakes bets here.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes expert picks\n\nHere's a refresher on these types of bets from SportsLine's Jody Demling:\n\nBelmont Stakes Exacta: Pick the first- and second-place finishers in the correct order. A $2 exacta returned $68 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Arcangelo and Forte.\n\nBelmont Stakes Trifecta: Pick the first-, second- and third-place finishers in the correct order. A $1 trifecta returned $133.24 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Arcangelo, Forte and Tapit Trice.\n\nBelmont Stakes Superfecta: Pick the first-, second-, third- and fourth-place finishers in the correct order. A $1 superfecta returned $292.50 at the 2023 Belmont Stakes with Hit Show and $191.50 with Angel of Empire after a tie for fourth.\n\nDemling is fading Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey. Instead, he is building his tickets around Sierra Leone and a big longshot who \"keeps getting better and better.\" You can see his picks here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes bets\n\nDemling has specific recommendations for exacta, trifecta and superfecta wagers so you can cover all your bases at the Belmont Stakes 2024.

Speaking of horse racing, betting is synonymous with ponies, so you can be sure gamblers will take advantage of countless opportunities to cash in on winning wagers while enjoying this big race.\n\nAnd if you are looking for help on how to throw down a couple of bucks on the ponies come Saturday, we have you covered with the help of our betting talent.\n\nOur experts -- Chris \"The Bear\" Fallica, Sammy Panayotovich, Geoff Schwartz and Will Hill -- are here to give you their best bets, predictions and insights for what will certainly be a thrilling weekend of horse racing.\n\nLet's dive into the details, last year's results, this year's odds and, of course, some best bets.\n\nLast year's Belmont Stakes was one for the history books. Arcangelo and jockey Javier Castellano claimed the last leg of the Triple Crown, cashing in as an 8/1 favorite.\n\nThe 155th running of the Belmont Stakes also marked a big win for Jena Antonucci, who became the first female trainer to win a Triple Crown race.\n\nThe lead up to this year's Belmont Stakes\n\nSince two different horses captured the first two crown jewels, there won't be a Triple Crown winner in 2024.\n\nMystik Dan won the Kentucky Derby by a photo finish, which was the Derby's closest in more than a half-century.\n\nIn the Preakness Stakes, Seize the Grey won it all as one of the longest shots on the board at 9-1.

Speed usually kills, but at Saratoga it's all about how you finish.\n\nThe No. 5 horse may be live here, trained by Todd Pletcher, who has four Belmont wins under his belt during his illustrious career. This horse won the Peter Pan Stakes on May 11, and at 12-1, perhaps another win is coming Saturday.\n\nSierra Leone finished a runner-up in the Kentucky Derby from the second pole, which isn't ideal for the running style of this horse. Leone is a finisher and needs room to work in order to win. With a post position of nine in the Belmont, the horse won't get boxed in. A switch at jockey should optimize the race plan and have Sierra Leone running a cleaner race than he did in the Derby. Lastly, the change in venue for this Belmont Stakes to a shorter track favors Leone.

The Belmont Stakes was moved to New York's summer racing home for the 2024 and 2025 runnings due to the ongoing reconstruction of Belmont Park on the Queens/Nassau border.\n\nThe venue change also necessitated another first for the Belmont Stakes: a shortening of the race distance to 1 1/4 miles from its traditional 1 1/2 miles. It will mark the first time the race will be run at 10 furlongs, matching the Kentucky Derby distance, since 1905. The race had been run at 1 1/2 miles every year since 1926, save for the pandemic-impacted 2020 running at 1 1/8 miles when the Belmont Stakes wound up being run as the Triple Crown's first leg.\n\nUpwards of 50,000 people are expected to be on hand at Saratoga this Saturday for the Belmont Stakes. Eight other horses will enter the starting gate with Mystik Dan and Seize the Gray looking to spoil their two-thirds bid, including Sierra Leone, the Kentucky Derby runner-up who was nosed out by Mystik Dan; Resilience, the Wood Memorial winner at Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens who finished sixth in the Kentucky Derby; and two horses owned by Queens native Mike Repole: Protective, third in the Peter Pan Stakes at Aqueduct; and Mindframe, who enters the Belmont Stakes off a dominant allowance win at Gulfstream Park in Florida.\n\nHandicapping this year's 1 1/4-mile Belmont Stakes is much like handicapping the Kentucky Derby, albeit with a field half the size as that which took to the starting gate on the first Saturday in May. To win, you'll need speed and stamina to get the distance, and an early speed duel can easily crush a frontrunner's hopes.\n\nConditions are ideal for an early speed duel on par with the Kentucky Derby, with Dornoch, Seize the Grey, The Wine Steward and Mindframe all likely to head to the front early. Mystik Dan will settle into the midpack as usual, while Honor Marie and Sierra Leone will do their best running from far back.\n\nThe race sets up well for closers like Sierra Leone, Honor Marie and Mystik Dan -- who has proven to be one game horse who never seems to put in a bad race, and even with this being his third race in six weeks (a very unusual standard in today's thoroughbred racing world), he doesn't look like he'll run out of gas this Saturday. Win or lose, he'll put in a great effort.\n\nSierra Leone seems like an obvious choice given his hard-luck loss in the Kentucky Derby, but he defeated himself in that race by lugging in instead of continuing a straightforward path in the home stretch. His jockey in that race, Tyler Gaffalione, wound up hitting the rider of third-place finisher Forever Young, and somehow Sierra Leone escaped disqualification from the stewards.\n\nThe change in jockey to Flavien Prat should help Sierra Leone's chances at getting a better, more disciplined trip. But don't discount the other big closer in the race, Honor Marie.\n\nWatching the Kentucky Derby replay, Honor Marie got pinched back at the start and shuffled to the rear of the field. He made a big move on the turn to close into the upper half of the field but wound up being blocked by other horses in the stretch. With far less horses to contend with here, chances are good that Honor Marie will bounce back in a big way.\n\nOf the four front-runners, if any of them have a chance to wire the Belmont field, it's hard not to like Mindframe. Though this will be his first stakes race, his two previous races were dominant efforts, the most recent of which was a huge win in a Churchill Downs allowance on the Kentucky Derby undercard. If a spot in the Belmont weren't enough of an endorsement from his connections, Mindframe will also have one of the country's best jockeys, Irad Ortiz Jr., in the saddle.", "source": {"uri": "amny.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "amNewYork"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robert_pozarycki@amny.com", "name": "Robert Pozarycki", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueduct_Racetrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aqueduct Racetrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furlong", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Furlong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_gate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting gate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassau_County,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nassau County, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nassau County, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Pan Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_Memorial_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wood Memorial Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulfstream_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gulfstream Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavien_Prat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flavien Prat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irad_Ortiz_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Irad Ortiz Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.amny.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Sierra-Leone-Inside-domestic-product4-out-june-1.jpeg?w=1200&p=q", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623848", "eventUri": "eng-9623848", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

There have also been 17 different 3-year-olds -- including one filly -- who have captured those American classics.\n\nOn June 8, when a historic edition of the $2 million Belmont Stakes (G1) will be contested at beloved Saratoga Race Course for the first time, we'll find out if that lengthy drought will encompass a full six years.\n\nA field of 10 was entered June 3 for the shorter-than-usual, mile-and-a-quarter Belmont at the Spa, including the winners of the Kentucky Derby (G1) and Preakness Stakes (G1), producing two chances for Triple Crown followers to again say, \"Two out of three ain't bad.\" But morning-line favoritism falls on Derby runner-up Sierra Leone .\n\nDerby winner Mystik Dan (5-1) landed post 3 and Preakness victor Seize the Grey (8-1) got the rail at the draw held Monday at Universal Preservation Hall in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., kicking off what should be a highly festive celebration of Thoroughbred racing in a most popular setting. Aside from that matchup, for the first time in more than a decade the Belmont field will include the first- and second-place finishers from both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, adding to the excitement generated by the new surroundings in a town that embraces horse racing like no other.\n\n\"I think that the Belmont this year, you could make an argument for it being the best of the three (Triple Crown races),\" said 88-year-old Hall of Famer D. Wayne Lukas, who trains Seize the Grey. \"I think that they have probably put together the best (field) of the three.\"\n\nSign up for BloodHorse Daily\n\nLance Gasaway, 4 G Racing, Daniel Hamby III, and Valley View Farm's Mystik Dan could put himself in the driver's seat for the 3-year-old male championship with a victory and and make it a great summer for trainer Kenny McPeek. A winner by a nose in the May 4 Run for the Roses and second by 2 1/4 lengths in the May 18 Preakness, he is the only 3-year-old entered in all three 2024 Triple Crown events. At the moment that consistency in the classics gives him a tenuous spot atop the division in the latest National Thoroughbred Racing Association Top 10 3-Year-Old Poll.\n\n\"He's showed that he's a quality colt. It's a fun ride and I hope it keeps going,\" McPeek said. \"The work (June 1) was super and we checked him real closely before we decided to go. We're ready to give him another chance.\"\n\nSired by Goldencents out of the Colonel John mare Ma'am, Mystik Dan has won two of his five 2024 starts, also winning the Southwest Stakes (G3) and finishing third in the Arkansas Derby (G1). At Monday's draw, McPeek said Gasaway had been pulling for Post 3 for the runner who has thrived racing inside.\n\nMyRacehorse's Seize the Grey posted a front-running victory on a muddy, sealed track at 9-1 odds but was likely a sentimental favorite. He gave the legendary Lukas his 15th Triple Crown victory, four of them in the Belmont.\n\nThe son of Arrogate bred by Jamm Ltd. would have also won the popular vote among connections that day. MyRacehorse had recruited 2,570 owners to purchase for $127 a 0.02% microshare of the $300,000 purchase at The Saratoga Sale, Fasig-Tipton's New York Sale of Preferred Yearlings.\n\nThe Preakness was a second straight win for Seize the Grey, who prevailed in the May 4 Pat Day Mile (G2) at Churchill Downs.\n\n\"I couldn't be more pleased, the way he's responded to what we're trying to do,\" Lukas said. \"He really has done well.\"\n\nWhile the 156th Belmont Stakes can be viewed as a rematch between the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winners, considerable attention will be focused on Sierra Leone (9-5 favorite, post 9), who was second by a nose to Mystik Dan in the Derby. Owned by Peter Brant, Mrs. John Magnier, Michael Tabor, Derrick Smith, Westerberg, and Brook Smith, Sierra Leone is trained by four-time Eclipse Award winner Chad Brown, who grew up in nearby Mechanicville, N.Y., and has won or shared five of the past six training titles at the Saratoga meet.\n\nThe $2.3 million purchase at The Saratoga Sale rallied from 17th in the 20-horse Derby field and had an eventful stretch run. After moving into contention eight wide, the son of Gun Runner lugged in and bumped with Forever Young , who was rallying alongside him. At the wire, Mystik Dan held on by a desperate nose with Forever Young another nose back in one of the Kentucky Derby's most exciting finishes.\n\nThe Derby marked a second career loss by a nose for the Blue Grass Stakes (G1) winner, who has prevailed in his other three starts. Last year, another eventful stretch battle led to his initial defeat in the Remsen Stakes. He passed Belmont Stakes entrant Dornoch (15-1, post 6) in mid-stretch and seemed headed to an easy win but lugged in, lost his momentum and the lead, as Dornoch battled back to win by a nose.\n\nIf not for a matter of inches and those gaffes in the stretch, Sierra Leone could be coming into the Belmont as undefeated.\n\n\"On paper, he's the horse to beat. But you saw in the Derby, he may have been the best horse in some people's eyes, but the best horse doesn't always win,\" said Brown, who will equip Sierra Leone with a different bit in hopes of helping him to maintain a straight course in the stretch. \"That potentially could happen in the Belmont. The way this game works, the best horse doesn't always win.\"\n\nHall of Fame trainer Todd Pletcher will send out three runners in a bid for his fifth Belmont Stakes win: Mindframe (post 10, 7-2), Protective (post 7, 20-1), and Antiquarian (post 5, 12-1).\n\n\"We're excited about it,\" said Pletcher. \"It's always great to come into these kinds of races with horses who are doing really well. Hopefully, we have enough talent to be competitive.\"\n\nMindframe is undefeated in two starts for Repole Stable and the St. Elias Stable of Florida Panthers owner Vinnie Viola. He will be making his eagerly awaited stakes debut after the son of Constitution captured one-turn maiden and allowance races by a combined 21 1/4 lengths.\n\nMike Repole's Protective (by Medaglia d'Oro ) is a maiden who finished third in the Peter Pan Stakes (G3) and the Wood Memorial Stakes (G2) in his past two starts.\n\nCentennial Farms' Antiquarian (by Preservationist ) is coming off a victory in the Peter Pan, the steppingstone prep for the Belmont. He is one of the starters whose connections would not have minded racing the traditional mile-and-a-half distance at Belmont Park, which is under construction and will not re-open until 2026 at the earliest.\n\n\"Talking to Todd and watching Antiquarian train over the winter, we wish it was a mile-and-a-half race, but I think the mile-and-a-quarter will be fine for him,\" said Don Little Jr., president and co-owner of Centennial Farms. \"We feel he's ready.\"\n\nRibble Farms, Michael Eiserman, Earl Silver, Kenneth Fishbein, and Dave Fishbein's Honor Marie (post 8, 12-1) was roughed up at the start of the Kentucky Derby and was 20th after six furlongs. Winner of the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes (G2) and second in the Louisiana Derby (G2), the Honor Code colt passed horses late to finish a troubled eighth.\n\n\"He stacks up with everyone in this division,\" said trainer Whit Beckman, a former New York assistant for Brown and Pletcher. \"Despite an absolutely brutal trip in the Kentucky Derby, he came out of the race in fantastic shape. He's been training extremely well and we're excited to give him the opportunity to run in the Belmont. I wish it was a mile-and-a-half but I think he'll be just as good at a mile-and-a-quarter.\"\n\nThe rest of the field includes Wood Memorial winner Resilience (post 2, 10-1), an Into Mischief colt who was sixth in the Kentucky Derby; Dornoch, a full brother to 2023 Derby winner Mage by Good Magic who had a rough trip when 10th in the Derby; and The Wine Steward (post 4, 15-1), a New York-bred son of Vino Rosso who was second in the Peter Pan.\n\nBelmont Stakes\n\nPost, Horse, Morning-Line Odds\n\n1.

The final leg of the Triple Crown takes place on Saturday at Saratoga Race Course at 6:41 p.m. ET USATSI\n\nA horse with just two races in his career, Mindframe is an unknown among the 10 contenders in the 2024 Belmont Stakes field. While he was victorious in both of those starts, neither were stakes races, and the longest was only 1 1/16 miles. Despite that, the Todd Pletcher-trained colt is the second-favorite in the latest 2024 Belmont Stakes odds. He is 7-2, which trails only Blue Grass Stakes winner Sierra Leone at 9-5. The two biggest 2024 Belmont Stakes favorites drew the outside posts for the Belmont Stakes 2024, which takes place on Saturday from Saratoga Race Course.\n\nMindframe has the No. 10 post, with Sierra Leone just inside at No. 9. Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan has the No. 3 post and is the third favorite at 5-1. Post time is 6:41 p.m. ET. With several accomplished horses set to enter the starting gate on Saturday, you'll want to see what Santa Anita Park-based racing reporter and analyst Michelle Yu has to say before making any 2024 Belmont Stakes picks.\n\nFew people in racing are as well-connected as Yu. An on-air host and reporter who has provided racing analysis for TVG, HRTV and the Breeders' Cup, Yu has spent a lifetime in racing. Prior to her television career, she worked for trainers Steve Asmussen and Ron Moquett. She also is married to Santa Anita-based trainer Ryan Hanson.\n\nYu also has tremendous handicapping chops. In a wide-open Kentucky Derby in 2021, she gave out Medina Spirit, who crossed the finish line first, as the winner at 12-1. In Pool 5 of the Kentucky Derby Future Wager two years ago, she suggested a play on All Other 3-Year-Olds, which cashed at a whopping 18-1 when Rich Strike won the Derby.\n\nLast year she crushed the Saudi Cup, riding 15-1 winner Panthalassa. She also smashed the Haskell Stakes for a $663 score, hitting 12-1 winner Geaux Rocket Ride as well as the exacta. Those were just two of her scores in 2023.\n\nShe enters this year's Belmont Stakes on a roll. She correctly called National Treasure to win the Pegasus World Cup. In the last two months, she predicted Stronghold's upset win in the Santa Anita Derby, en route to a $219.50 payday, and smashed the exacta in the Apple Blossom Handicap as part of a $410 score.\n\nFor the final leg of the Triple Crown, Yu has handicapped the 2024 Belmont Stakes lineup, made her picks and constructed her best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see them.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions\n\nOne surprise: Yu is fading Seize the Grey, even though he is coming off a win in the Preakness Stakes. That race was the horse's third at a distance of at least 1 1/8 miles and the only one he was successful in. He finished third and seventh in the others, with the seventh-place finish coming in a G1 race. Given that the Preakness came on a muddy track, and his other longer-distance races came on fast tracks, one could surmise that the off-track conditions aided Seize the Grey.\n\nAlso working against Seize the Grey is that the 2024 Belmont field will have more pace in it than he saw at the Preakness. Only four horses had speed figures of at least 100 in the Preakness, but twice as many have reached triple-digits in the Belmont 2024. There are too many factors working against the Preakness winner for Yu to use him in 2024 Belmont Stakes bets. You can see all of Yu's 2024 Belmont Stakes bets here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes picks\n\nInstead, Yu's top pick is a horse who \"has been training forwardly.\" She also has identified a double-digit longshot who is a strong \"longshot play.\" She has made her 2024 Belmont Stakes bets, and she's sharing which 2024 Belmont Stakes horses to back only at SportsLine.\n\nSo who wins the 2024 Belmont Stakes? What double-digit longshot is a must-play? And how has Yu constructed her wagers? Visit SportsLine to see Yu's picks for the Belmont Stakes 2024, all from the Santa Anita Park-based racing insider who has been red-hot all year, and find out.\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes odds, contendersPrg #HorseOddsProjection1Seize the Grey8-1SEE PICKS2Resilience10-1SEE PICKS\n\n3Mystik Dan5-1SEE PICKS\n\n4The Wine Steward15-1SEE PICKS\n\n5Antiquarian12-1SEE PICKS\n\n6Dornoch15-1SEE PICKS\n\n7Protective20-1SEE PICKS\n\n8Honor Marie12-1SEE PICKS\n\n9Sierra Leone9-5SEE PICKS\n\n10Mindframe7-2SEE PICKS", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Grass_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Grass Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parimutuel_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parimutuel betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graded stakes race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Strike", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rich Strike"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasure_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Treasure (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Haskell Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina_Spirit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medina Spirit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegasus_World_Cup_Invitational_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pegasus World Cup Invitational Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Blossom_Handicap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Blossom Handicap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Anita_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Anita Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Asmussen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Asmussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeders'_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breeders' Cup"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2023/05/03/3897a84c-d6b1-46ba-9554-7673a221b231/thumbnail/1200x675/39800281dca09823fe9b38a3f7c4b9bd/kentucky-derby-5-usatsi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623848", "eventUri": "eng-9623848", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Prior to her television career, she worked for trainers Steve Asmussen and Ron Moquett. She also is married to Santa Anita-based trainer Ryan Hanson.\n\nYu also has tremendous handicapping chops. In a wide-open Kentucky Derby in 2021, she gave out Medina Spirit, who crossed the finish line first, as the winner at 12-1. In Pool 5 of the Kentucky Derby Future Wager two years ago, she suggested a play on All Other 3-Year-Olds, which cashed at a whopping 18-1 when Rich Strike won the Derby.\n\nLast year she crushed the Saudi Cup, riding 15-1 winner Panthalassa. She also smashed the Haskell Stakes for a $663 score, hitting 12-1 winner Geaux Rocket Ride as well as the exacta. Those were just two of her scores in 2023.\n\nShe enters this year's Belmont Stakes on a roll. She correctly called National Treasure to win the Pegasus World Cup. In the last two months, she predicted Stronghold's upset win in the Santa Anita Derby, en route to a $219.50 payday, and smashed the exacta in the Apple Blossom Handicap as part of a $410 score.\n\nFor the final leg of the Triple Crown, Yu has handicapped the 2024 Belmont Stakes lineup, made her picks and constructed her best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see them.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions\n\nOne surprise: Yu is fading Seize the Grey, even though he is coming off a win in the Preakness Stakes. The fourth choice on the morning line at 8-1, Seize the Grey has four wins and three thirds in 10 career starts. He has won his last two starts: the Pat Day Mile on Kentucky Derby Day and the Preakness Stakes.\n\nBut in the Preakness, Seize the Grey was able to take advantage of a race without much speed and set an uncontested lead. On Saturday, with other speed horses in the race, Seize the Grey does not figure to get the same favorable pace scenario. \"I didn't think Seize the Grey could win the Preakness, so it's hard for me to pick him to win the Belmont stretching out,\" Yu told SportsLine. You can see all of Yu's 2024 Belmont Stakes bets here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes picks\n\nInstead, Yu's top pick is a horse who \"has been training forwardly.\" She also has identified a double-digit longshot who is a strong \"longshot play.\" She has made her 2024 Belmont Stakes bets, and she's sharing which 2024 Belmont Stakes horses to back only at SportsLine.\n\nSo who wins the 2024 Belmont Stakes? What double-digit longshot is a must-play? And how has Yu constructed her wagers? Visit SportsLine to see Yu's picks for the Belmont Stakes 2024, all from the Santa Anita Park-based racing insider who has been red-hot all year, and find out.\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes odds, contendersPrg #HorseOddsProjection1Seize the Grey8-1SEE PICKS2Resilience10-1SEE PICKS\n\n3Mystik Dan5-1SEE PICKS\n\n4The Wine Steward15-1SEE PICKS\n\n5Antiquarian12-1SEE PICKS\n\n6Dornoch15-1SEE PICKS\n\n7Protective20-1SEE PICKS\n\n8Honor Marie12-1SEE PICKS\n\n9Sierra Leone9-5SEE PICKS\n\n10Mindframe7-2SEE PICKS", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D.

Best bets, sleeper picks, post positions following draw", "body": "With Monday's post-position draw for the 2024 Belmont Stakes complete, excitement has started to mount amongst fans and bettors alike for the 156th running of the third and final Triple Crown event.\n\nSome changes to the field can be expected between now and the famed Saratoga Springs event -- remember, Fierceness was already ruled out of this race last weekend, and we saw odds-on favorite Muth scratched days before the Preakness. However, FanDuel Racing has outright winner odds listed for the third leg of the Triple Crown.\n\nMORE BELMONT: Horse profiles | Post positions\n\nNot surprisingly, Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan, Preakness winner Seize the Grey, and Derby runner-up Sierra Leone all sit as favorites to win. Those horses will run from the third, first, and ninth posts, respectively. Read on for more context on those favorites and what their post positions mean for their chances to contend.\n\nLet's take a look at the FanDuel Racing odds for the 2024 Belmont, then discuss the best bets, top value pick, and best sleeper to win.\n\nConsidering Sierra Leone came so close to winning the soggy Kentucky Derby -- and he has plenty of experience winning in wet and muddy conditions -- he's the fitting favorite in Saratoga this weekend.\n\nFuture Hall-of-Fame trainer Chad Brown, a Saratoga native, knows this track well and has accumulated a record amount of Belmont training titles. Brown recently made the switch from jockey Tyler Gaffalione to Flavien Prat, which should fare well for Sierra Leone. This feels like his race to lose this weekend.\n\nMystik Dan won the Kentucky Derby and finished second at the Preakness, and there's no reason to expect this impressive colt to finish anywhere lower than the top three this weekend in Saratoga.\n\nMystik Dan has great speed figures, fantastic positional strength, and a tremendous post position out of the third gate. He should be one of the most popular betting picks, and for good reason.\n\nSeize the Grey broke his maiden at Saratoga, and his trainer Wayne Lucas has won the Belmont four times. After winning the Pat Day Mile on Kentucky Derby day and then emerging victorious at the Preakness by 2.25 lengths, he has become a fan favorite.\n\nSeize the Grey has been very busy lately, running three races in five weeks, but nobody can deny the spectacular form in which this three-year-old enters the weekend. He has good pedigree, an awesome speed profile, and surprising stamina for a horse that many consider to be a sprinter. Out of the first post, this feels like a fantastic value pick at 8-1.\n\nAntiquarian just seems to get better and better each race, and he seems to be getting overlooked a bit ahead of the Belmont. The winner of the Peter Pan Stakes at Aqueduct last month, this three-year-old colt enters the weekend in peak form and could easily contest for a win, place, or show.\n\nA Todd Pletcher-trained horse, Antiquarian has strong tactical speed and underrated stamina. In four starts, he has two wins and one runner-up. Antiquarian might not be worth an outright win bet, but he's worth strong consideration for exacta or trifecta tickets this weekend.\n\nAnother solid sleeper pick: Protective (20-1)\n\nAlthough it's important to note that this weekend's event will be held at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, NY this year -- not Belmont's usual venue at Belmont Park, due to a renovation break -- it's still worth noting the past post position success rates for the race and racing in general.\n\nThe optimal position in horse racing is dependent on a lot of factors, including the horse, the track, the jockey, the terrain, the weather, and the competition.\n\nStrategies also vary based on the position. Every position from 1-13 has won at least one race at the Belmont Stakes. That said, the No. 1 post has come away with the most wins in history at 24 -- great news for Preakness winner Seize the Day.\n\nKentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and his team should be happy, too, as the No. 3 post has won 16 times including last year's race. The No. 1 post last won in 2018.\n\nHere's the full count of winners by post positions throughout the Belmont Stakes history:\n\nMORE: Who won the 2024 Kentucky Derby?\n\nAll 13 gates have earned at least one victory at the Belmont Stakes since the race began using starting posts in 1904.\n\nGate 1 has the most winners and last won in 2018, while Gate 3 was the 2023 winner.\n\nBelow is a list of all of the winners at each gate since 1904:", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parimutuel_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parimutuel betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavien_Prat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flavien Prat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Day", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse length"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wayne, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wayne, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Pan Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueduct_Racetrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aqueduct Racetrack"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/GettyImages-1258744175.jpg?itok=Aa9S__fW", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623848", "eventUri": "eng-9623848", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5764705882352941, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

Check out our predictions.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes will look much different this year. A little leaner, a little shorter, not nearly as crowded.\n\nBecause of renovations to Belmont Park, it has been moved to Saratoga, a historic racetrack that has a number of interesting nicknames. The \"Graveyard of Champions\" is the most haunting.\n\nThe greatest single performance in a Triple Crown race is widely regarded as Secretariat's win at the 1973 Belmont Stakes when he dusted the field by 31 lengths. He was a tremendous machine that day at Belmont Park, but two months later, Secretariat was upset by Onion in the Grade 2 Whitney Stakes at Saratoga.\n\nNicknames aside, the biggest change to this year's Belmont Stakes is in its length. Saratoga does not have the track to accommodate a 1\u00bd-mile race without starting on a turn, so the race will be 1\u00bc miles -- just like the Kentucky Derby.\n\nTotal: $2 million. First place: $1.2 million. Second place: $360,000. Third place: $200,000. Fourth place: $100,000. Fifth place: $60,000. Sixth place: $40,000. Seventh place: $20,000. Eighth place: $20,000.\n\nOther notable races: Kentucky Derby (winner: Mystik Dan), Preakness Stakes (Seize the Grey), Haskell Stakes (July 20), Travers Stakes (Aug. 24), Breeders' Cup (Nov. 1-2).\n\nEd Barkowitz: 3-Mystik Dan, 10-Mindframe, 4-The Wine Steward, 1-Seize the Grey\n\nAfter taking Fierceness in the Derby (15th, ugh) and Imagination in the Preakness (seventh, double ugh), I might as well pick Khartoum to win this race. He hasn't done much since The Godfather, so maybe he's due. Semi-seriously, though. Putting Mystik Dan in a trifecta box with The Wine Steward and Mindframe, who has raced only twice but put up a 103 Beyer speed score when he broke his maiden on March 30. Just need him to keep his head on straight.\n\nKerith Gabriel: 1-Seize the Grey, 2-Resilience, 3-Mystic Dan, 6-Dornoch\n\nSeize the Grey had a run at the Preakness few expected. And while I expected him to finish strong in the race, I did not think a win was in the cards. So why not go for two here and finish strong? He'll have tough competition as Mystik Dan, winner of the Kentucky Derby, will be out to do the same, but in the Preakness it was evident Seize the Grey was the stronger horse. A 8-1 odds, there's comfort in believing we'll see a repeat in this final race of the 2024 Triple Crown series.\n\nJeff Neiburg: 10-Mindframe, 1-Seize the Grey, 9-Sierra Leone, 5-Antiquarian\n\nOn a gray day at Pimlico it was the gray horse with the grey name that ran away from the crowd. He's no favorite Saturday, but he's got a shot to do it again. However, Mindframe is a Todd Pletcher horse with two wins in two starts and is well-rested, and that's a nice combo if he goes off anywhere near 7-2 odds.\n\nLuke Reasoner: 4-The Wine Steward, 9-Sierra Leone, 1-Seize the Grey, 10-Mindframe\n\nThird time's a charm, right? I picked Sierra Leone (Belmont favorite) to win the Kentucky Derby -- ended up second. I picked Tuscan Gold to win the Preakness -- ended up fourth. So let's see if we can get a winner this time around for the Belmont Stakes at Saratoga. (Everyone should visit the lake there, wonderful sailing venue nestled in upstate New York wine country.)

BetOnline is our top favorite, but there are many great options to be discovered.\n\nSee below the best five Belmont Stakes Florida offshore betting sites on which you can register so that you can bet on the Belmont Stakes race on Saturday June 8, 2024 - up to $6,500 in free bets for anyone aged 18+ to claim.\n\nYou can easily place bets on the 2024 Belmont Stakes in Florida by following these three easy steps.\n\n*Note: The minimum deposit to get this offer is just $55 ($27.50 free bet)\n\nYes, online sports betting and retail betting is legal in the State of Florida, but only using the Hard Rock App and betting at certain casinos.\n\nThis means it's not always easy to place a horse racing bet in the State, especially since Hard Rock does not take any horse racing bets, while TVG and TwinSpires only have limited markets in Florida.\n\nWe bet you are wondering how to bet on the Belmont Stakes now. Well, most bettors turn to offshore sportsbooks for horse racing betting as they allow users to place wagers on horse racing from anywhere in Florida and offer better odds (fixed), more markets and bigger payouts.\n\nThese sportsbooks, such as BetOnline and BUSR, have been operating for 20+ years, allowing thousands of bettors that live in Florida to place bets safely and legally on all the big sporting events.\n\nThey also offer faster payouts, no KYC checks upon registration and allow fiat and crypto deposits with coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum (learn more about Bitcoin casino instant withdrawals). Most of the time, they also offer much more competitive odds due to their lower margins.\n\nBetOnline is one of the top respected US offshore betting sites. It has been in operation for over 25 years, which makes it a leading destination for Belmont Stakes horse racing bettors in Florida.\n\nJoining takes just a few minutes since there is no KYC check. You can expect a 50% bonus (up to $1,000) on your first deposit - the platform accepts many payment methods, which makes the depositing process a lot easier.\n\nOnce your account has been opened, you can also benefit from a 9% daily horse racing rebate offer, as well as a $25 risk-free bet - which you could use to bet on the 156th running of the Belmont Stakes on Saturday at Saratoga Race Course.\n\nYou can also join BetWhale, one of the newer US offshore betting sites, before the 2024 Belmont Stakes. Upon registration, you will unlock their 125% deposit bonus of up to $1,250.\n\nDespite being a new US sportsbook (launching just last year), BetWhale is already making a big name for itself, and this is supported by the many US bettors heading to the platform to bet on the Belmont Stakes in Florida on Saturday June 8.\n\nOne of the many perks of being a newer betting platform is that, since many Americans do not already have an account on this site, it will be easier and faster for you to claim your welcome free bets.\n\nBetWhale also has some nice offers like a 50% daily odds boost for existing customers.\n\nMeaning they are another 'go-to' racebook for bettors looking to bet on the Triple Crown races each year - including the final one, the Belmont Stakes on Saturday.\n\nCompetitive fixed odds, numerous associated markets and fast payouts are some of the highlights of BUSR.\n\nOnce they've opened your account, horse racing fans can also take advantage of a 10% horse racing rebate offer and risk-free bets, as well as enjoy a $150 racebook bonus.\n\nBovada is another well-known US sportsbook for horse racing bettors that are looking to wager on the 2024 Belmont Stakes if living or betting in Florida.\n\nLaunched in 2011, Bovada has a popular best racebook section which highlights all the main horse racing meetings and odds - including the last leg of the US Triple Crown - the Belmont Stakes (June 8).\n\nNew accounts will also benefit from a 75% deposit bonus of up to $750, which will unlock many free bets that they can use on this Saturday's 2024 Belmont Stakes.\n\nGrab an account with BetNow before the 2024 Belmont Stakes and claim up to $1,000 in free bets, courtesy of their 100% welcome deposit bonus.\n\nBetNow has been supplying their users with leading horse racing odds since 2005, so each year, when the 2024 Belmont Stakes comes around, they are one of the top landing places for bettors.\n\nAfter claiming your top welcome bonus, you can benefit from a 10% horse racing rebate offer, a 50% refer a friend bonus and a re-up promotion of up to 25%.\n\nNo US Triple Crown winner this time... with the Kentucky Derby hero Mystik Dan ending this hope when it arrived second in the Preakness Stakes at Pimlico last month.\n\nHowever, there is still a lot to look forward to ahead of Saturday's Belmont Stakes, as the Run For The Roses victor, Mystik Dan, and the Preakness winner Seize The Grey are intended runners in the last Triple Crown race.\n\nThe race, billed as the Run For The Carnations, will be held away from Belmont Park for the first time since 1967, with the course being redeveloped. It will take place in Saratoga, which is around 160 miles north of Belmont, until 2026.\n\nIt's worth noting that due to the Saratoga course being slightly different to Belmont Park - the race distance has been dropped from 1 \u00bd miles to 1m \u00bc miles.\n\nUnless there are any more horses taken out, there will be 10 Belmont Stakes runners running for the $2m purse and it's the Kentucky Derby runner-up Sierra Leone that heads the betting as the horse hopes to give the Chad Brown team a first win in this Triple Crown race.\n\nThe Todd Pletcher runner Mindframe comes next best in the odds - a horse that will be running in a Triple Crown race for the first time this season. He was last seen winning easily in an Allowance Optional Claiming race at Churchill Downs - therefore, this will be a big step up in class for this Constitution colt. Pletcher will be eyeing his fifth Belmont Stakes win.\n\nAnother barn on four Belmont Stakes wins is veteran handler D. Wayne Lukas and he'll be trying to add another with his recent Preakness Stakes hero Seize The Grey. The last horse to win both races was the Triple Crown victor Justify in 2018.\n\nAs you see, it's all set-up to be another fascinating renewal of the 156th running of the Belmont Stakes, which this year will create further history being run at Saratoga Race Course - the home of the Travers and Whitney Stakes.\n\nYou can easily place bets on the win, place, show and trifecta with the featured Belmont Stakes top offshore sportsbooks.

This year's race has a 10-horse 2024 Belmont Stakes field, and the thoroughbreds will compete over 1 1/4 miles at Saratoga Race Course. The Belmont Stakes 2024 lineup is loaded with proven winners, including Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and Preakness champion Seize the Grey. Should your 2024 Belmont Stakes picks include Derby winner Mystik Dan at 5-1 odds? Or should you target Sierra Leone, the 9-5 favorite according to the latest 2024 Belmont Stakes odds?\n\nPost time is 6:41 p.m. ET. With an accomplished field set to enter the starting gate on Saturday, you'll want to see what SportsLine writer Gene Menez has to say before making any Belmont Stakes picks or horse racing predictions, given the success he's had during this year's Triple Crown.\n\nA former reporter and editor at Sports Illustrated, Menez covered an array of sports, including horse racing, for the magazine and its website for almost 14 years. Between 2010 and 2012, he served as SI's handicapper for the Triple Crown races and correctly predicted Super Saver to win the Kentucky Derby in 2010.\n\nIn 2015, while writing for Sports on Earth, Menez accurately gave out the Kentucky Derby superfecta (American Pharoah, Firing Line, Dortmund and Frosted), which paid $1,268.20 for $2. Then in 2017, he tweeted out his Kentucky Derby picks, including Always Dreaming to win, and hit the Pick 4, which paid almost $6,900 on a $1 bet.\n\nIn a span of seven races last year for SportsLine, he cashed the winner of the Lecomte Stakes, the exacta in the Southwest Stakes, the winner of the Holy Bull Stakes, the winner of the Sam F. Davis Stakes, and the trifecta in the Jenny Wiley Stakes. He also nailed National Treasure's win in the Preakness. And last month, he gave out 18-1 Mystik Dan as a live longshot in the Kentucky Derby.\n\nFor Saturday, Menez has handicapped the 2024 Belmont Stakes field, made his picks and constructed his best bets. You can head to SportsLine now to see them.\n\nTop 2024 Belmont Stakes predictions\n\nOne surprise: Menez is completely tossing Mystik Dan, even though he won the Kentucky Derby and finished second in the Preakness Stakes. Trained by Ken McPeek, Mystik Dan continues to put in impressive performances. He has won two of his last four races, which includes crossing the finish line first at Churchill Downs, and is coming off a runner-up finish at the Preakness Stakes.\n\nHowever, Mystik Dan could be dealing with fatigue after competing in eight races since Oct. 22. His speed figures have also been below 100 in two of his last three starts, which doesn't bode well against such a strong field at the Belmont Stakes 2024. \"I think Mystik Dan will be hard-pressed to produce another top-notch effort,\" Menez told SportsLine. You can see all of Menez's 2024 Belmont Stakes bets here.\n\nHow to make 2024 Belmont Stakes picks\n\nHowever, Menez's top pick is a horse who will be \"right there when the horses hit the wire.\" He also is high on a double-digit longshot who is coming off a performance that is \"better than it looks on paper.\" He is including these horses in his wagers, and so should you. He's sharing which horses to back at SportsLine.\n\nSo who wins Belmont Stakes 2024? What double-digit longshot has a big chance to run well, and how has Menez constructed his wagers? Visit SportsLine to see Menez's picks for the Belmont Stakes, all from the expert who gave out Mystik Dan as a live longshot in the Kentucky Derby, and find out.\n\n2024 Belmont Stakes odds, contenders, post positionsPrg #HorseOddsProjection1Seize the Grey8-1SEE PICKS2Resilience10-1SEE PICKS\n\n3Mystik Dan5-1SEE PICKS\n\n4The Wine Steward15-1SEE PICKS\n\n5Antiquarian12-1SEE PICKS\n\n6Dornoch15-1SEE PICKS\n\n7Protective20-1SEE PICKS\n\n8Honor Marie12-1SEE PICKS\n\n9Sierra Leone9-5SEE PICKS\n\n10Mindframe7-2SEE PICKS", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_gate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting gate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Treasure_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Treasure (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frosted_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frosted (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Pharoah", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Pharoah"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Wiley_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jenny Wiley Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always_Dreaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Always Dreaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecomte_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lecomte Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Bull_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Holy Bull Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southwest Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_F._Davis_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sam F.

Here's the full race field, with odds.", "body": "LEXINGTON, Ky. -- The 2024 Belmont Stakes has some big changes this year.\n\nThe final leg of horse racing's Triple Crown will feature a different venue, and a different distance, compared to normal.\n\nWith Belmont Park in Elmont, N.Y., out of action due to ongoing renovations, this year's Grade 1, $2 million Belmont Stakes will instead be run at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.\n\nAnd because of the configuration of Saratoga's main track, this year's Belmont Stakes will be run at 1 1/4 miles instead of the usual 1 1/2 miles at Belmont Park.\n\nBut those major changes -- along with the impossibility of a Triple Crown winner -- did little to dampen the excitement that came with Monday's post-position draw for the Belmont Stakes, which has a post time of 6:41 p.m. Saturday and will be broadcast on Fox.\n\nA field of 10 horses were assigned starting gates and morning-line odds during a pill pull event at Universal Preservation Hall in downtown Saratoga Springs.\n\nSierra Leone -- who won the Risen Star Stakes and the Blue Grass Stakes before running second in the Derby as part of a three-way photo finish -- is the morning-line favorite for the Belmont. Sierra Leone has odds of 9-5 and will leave from post position 9, which is the second-furthest outside post.\n\n\"He's been doing great. He bounced out of the Derby, which can obviously be a tough race on horses, he's bounced out well,\" said Sierra Leone's trainer, Chad Brown, after the post-position draw. \"He shipped up here right away and he's trained really good here. Just hoping for a good trip.\"\n\nJockey Tyler Gaffalione was aboard Sierra Leone for the Kentucky Derby, and was fined but not suspended for his part in a Derby stretch duel with third-place finisher Forever Young. On Saturday, Sierra Leone will be ridden by jockey Flavien Prat in a race for the first time.\n\nThe second choice according to the morning-line odds is Mindframe, a Todd Pletcher trainee who is making his Triple Crown debut in the Belmont. Mindframe -- a perfect 2 for 2 in his young racing career -- has 7-2 odds and will leave from post position 10, the furthest outside post.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graded stakes race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmont,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elmont, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Elmont, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risen_Star_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Risen Star Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Grass_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blue Grass Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavien_Prat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flavien Prat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Pletcher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Pletcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/292/29224/2922470.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623848", "eventUri": "eng-9623848", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lexington, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}
{"uri": "8161822648", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-06-04", "time": "21:35:43", "dateTime": "2024-06-04T21:35:43Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-06-04T21:35:05Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "url": "https://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/277339/early-lead-not-a-necessity-for-seize-the-grey", "title": "Early Lead Not a Necessity for Seize the Grey", "body": "Things are not always as they might seem when it comes to the Triple Crown.\n\nA case in point:\n\nAt the June 3 post position draw for the June 8 Belmont Stakes (G1) at Saratoga Race Course, Seize the Grey drew the rail in a field of 10 3-year-olds. That's the same Seize the Grey who posted a gate-to-wire, 2 1/4-length victory May 18 in the Preakness Stakes (G1).\n\nSo, from that spot, where getting shuffled back is a real concern, it seems logical that jockey Jaime Torres would hustle the MyRacehorse colt out of the gate intent on the lead.\n\nNot so, according to trainer D. Waye Lukas, the sport's 88-year-old living legend.\n\nSign up for BloodHorse Daily\n\n\"He's not one-dimensional. We can play off the break,\" Lukas said June 4 outside his deserted barn at Saratoga occupied by just Seize the Grey. \"We can do whatever we want. We can lay third, fourth, fifth. Maybe he'll be on the lead. He's very manageable. We'll let them decide what they want to do and we'll play off what they do.\"\n\nThe pace looms a key question in the mile-and-a-quarter Belmont as Seize the Grey, Dornoch (post 6), Mindframe (post 9), Antiquarian (post 5), Resilience (post 2), and The Wine Steward (post 4) all have done their best racing while on or within a length or two of the lead.\n\nWhile who will be on the early lead has some mystery attached to it, Lukas maintains rather strongly that Seize the Grey bounced out of the Preakness in great shape and that the son of Arrogate is heading into the Belmont sharper than he was for the Preakness.\n\n\"I thought I had him dead fit for the Preakness, but since then he's acted fitter and sharper. I think he's in a better position to run here than in the Preakness,\" the Hall of Famer said.\n\nLukas has won the Preakness seven times and the Belmont four times, but his only victories in the second and third legs of the Triple Crown in the same year came in 1994 with Tabasco Cat.\n\nFive a Lucky Number for Antiquarian in Belmont Stakes\n\nTrainer Kenny McPeek was given a task by Lance Gasaway, one of the owners of Kentucky Derby (G1) winner Mystik Dan . Gasaway wanted post 3 in the $2 million Belmont Stakes (G1) at Saratoga Race Course.\n\n\"It's a lucky number,\" McPeek said.\n\nWell, mission accomplished. Mystik Dan drew post 3 for the June 8 classic. Yet Gasaway's good fortune could not match the layers included in the hopes of Centennial Farms president and co-owner Don Little Jr. for a lucky number. In looking over some of the factors surrounding his partnership's Belmont Stakes entrant, the Todd Pletcher-trained Peter Pan Stakes (G3) winner Antiquarian , one number kept popping up.\n\n\"It was Todd's fifth Peter Pan win. It would be his fifth Belmont win. Antiquarian is our fifth horse running in the Belmont and it will be my aunt's 95th birthday,\" Little said. \"I would love to get post five.\"\n\nApparently, the racing gods were listening.\n\nAntiquarian will break from post 5 in the Belmont.\n\n\"Unbelievable,\" Little said.\n\nAt 12-1 morning-line odds and all those common numbers swirling around, a $5 win bet on Antiquarian might not be a bad idea.\n\nRainy Forecast for All Four Days at Saratoga\n\nIt seems like everyone wants to be at Saratoga Race Course for the upcoming Belmont Stakes Racing Festival.\n\nIncluding Mother Nature.\n\nAccording to The Weather Channel, there is at least a 40% chance of rain during each of the four days (June 6-9) of racing at the Spa.\n\nJune 6 seems destined to be the biggest washout, with the forecast calling for a 90% chance of rain with thunderstorms likely.\n\nThe following day, there's a 40% chance of rain, with showers developing later in the day.\n\nAs for the centerpiece Belmont Stakes Day on June 8, there's a 44% chance of showers.\n\nFinally, on June 9, there's a 50% chance of rain.\n\nKeep in mind that weather predictions are off base at times and weather can change unpredictably in the Adirondack Mountains, where there can be rain and sunshine in the same half-hour. Yet at Saratoga, when it rains, it never seems to sprinkle. Intense storms are part of the Spa's lore, though it's an odds-on assumption that virtually everyone connected with the four days of racing would prefer it if Mother Nature sits out the festivities.\n\nOf course, whatever the weather turns out to be, it would be hard to top last year's Belmont Stakes week at now-under-construction Belmont Park, when smoke from the Canadian wildfires turned the afternoon Long Island skies an eerie shade of orange and created unsafe breathing conditions that forced the cancellation of one racing program.", "source": {"uri": "bloodhorse.com",

On May 4, longshot Mystik Dan got a rail-skimming, ground-saving trip to win the Kentucky Derby at 18-1 odds. Two weeks later, Seize the Grey went wire-to-wire to win the Preakness Stakes for 88-year-old trainer D. Wayne Lukas. For the final leg of the Triple Crown, Kentucky Derby runner-up Sierra Leone is the 9-5 favorite in the 2024 Belmont Stakes odds. The undefeated Mindframe is the 7-2 second choice among the ten 2024 Belmont Stakes horses. Post time is 6:41 p.m. ET.\n\nWith several accomplished horses set to enter the starting gate on Saturday, you'll want to see what Santa Anita-based racing reporter and analyst Michelle Yu has to say before making any 2024 Belmont Stakes picks. Join SportsLine here to see whom she's picking!\n\nFew people in racing are as well-connected as Yu. An on-air host and reporter who has provided racing analysis for TVG, HRTV and the Breeders' Cup, Yu has spent a lifetime in racing. Prior to her television career, she worked for trainers Steve Asmussen and Ron Moquett. She also is married to Santa Anita-based trainer Ryan Hanson.\n\nYu also has tremendous handicapping chops. In a wide-open Kentucky Derby in 2021, she gave out Medina Spirit, who crossed the finish line first, as the winner at 12-1. In Pool 5 of the Kentucky Derby Future Wager two years ago, she suggested a play on All Other 3-Year-Olds, which cashed at a whopping 18-1 when Rich Strike won the Derby.\n\nShe enters this year's Belmont Stakes on a roll. She correctly called National Treasure to win the Pegasus World Cup. In the last two months, she predicted Stronghold's upset win in the Santa Anita Derby, en route to a $219.50 payday, and smashed the exacta in the Apple Blossom Handicap as part of a $410 score.\n\nFor the 2024 Belmont Stakes, Yu has made her picks and constructed her bets. Join SportsLine here to see them!\n\nOne surprise: Yu is fading Seize the Grey, even though he is coming off a win in the Preakness Stakes. \"I didn't think Seize the Grey could win the Preakness, so it's hard for me to pick him to win the Belmont stretching out in distance,\" Yu told SportsLine.\n\nInstead, Yu's top pick is a horse who is \"has been training forwardly.\" She also has identified a double-digit longshot who is a strong \"longshot play.\" You ABSOLUTELY need to see her picks before locking in any of your own!\n\nSo who wins the Belmont Stakes?

Since each region of the US has its own set of gambling laws relating to sports betting and horse racing betting, it actually depends on which State you live in or are trying to place bets from. Some US states will give the green light to wagering in-person at casinos only, or with some licensed apps, but this is rare. Other regions like Texas, Georgia and California still don't allow gambling or sports betting at all.\n\nHowever, there is a solution that allows you to bet in ANY US State: signing up with the offshore betting sites in this article.\n\nThese trusted platforms have a lot of added perks - including not having to follow any set State gambling laws in place. Meaning you can use them to bet on this weekend's big Triple Crown horse racing action ANYWHERE in the US.\n\nOther benefits of betting on the Belmont Stakes in the US with the offshore racebooks featured below are:\n\nPlus, most will have better odds due to operating with lower margins.\n\nThese sportsbooks, such as BetOnline and BUSR, also offer many deposit methods (including Bitcoin - learn more here about Bitcoin casino instant withdrawals) and have been around for 20+ years, which has allowed thousands of US-based bettors to place bets on horse racing (no matter which state you live in the US).\n\nBetOnline has been in operation for over 25 years and is a well-known and trusted offshore betting site - making it one of the top picks for Belmont Stakes horse racing betting in the US.\n\nCreating an account takes just a few minutes, with no KYC check upon registration. There is also a 50% bonus (up to $1,000) on your first outlay - many payment methods are accepted in order to help make depositing an easy process.\n\nOnce your account has been opened, you also benefit from a 9% daily horse racing rebate offer and a $25 risk-free bet - which you could use to bet on the 156th running of the Belmont Stakes this Saturday (8 June).\n\nLaunched in 2023, BetWhale is one of the newer US offshore betting sites to join ahead of this weekend's Belmont Stakes. As soon as you sign up, you will qualify for their 125% deposit bonus of up to $1,250.\n\nDespite being a new US sportsbook, BetWhale has already made a name for itself so don't let this put you off. There are many advantages in betting on a fresh and new betting platform, including the fact that, since many US bettors do not already have an account on this platform, it is easier and faster for you to claim your welcome offer and existing customer bonuses. Plus, they often have much more competitive prices in order to compete with the more established sites. They also offer some nice offers for existing customers like a 50% daily odds boost.\n\n'Bet US Racing' is what BUSR stands for - so horse racing is high up the agenda of this leading US offshore sportsbook.\n\nTherefore, it's no revelation they are another racebook that bettors flock to ahead of the Triple Crown races each season - with competitive fixed odds, associated markets and fast payouts being just some of the big highlights of the site.\n\nOnce they sign up, horse racing bettors can directly take advantage of a 10% racing rebate offer and risk-free bets.

It allows betting in ANY US State.\n\nNew accounts claim a 75% opening deposit bonus of up to $750, which will unlock many free bets that can be used on Saturday's 2024 Belmont Stakes.\n\nBetNow, launched way back in 2005, is number five in our list of offshore sportsbooks. It has been serving the US betting community for almost 20 years, meaning it can be fully trusted when it comes to sports betting in the USA.\n\nNew accounts can claim up to $1,000 in free bets, courtesy of their 100% welcome deposit bonus, which can be used on Saturday's huge Triple Crown race: the Belmont Stakes.\n\nAfter claiming this leading welcome bonus, you can enjoy a 10% horse racing rebate offer, as well as a 50% refer a friend bonus and a re-up promotion of up to 25%.\n\nThere will be no Triple Crown winner this season for US horse racing fans, with the Kentucky Derby hero Mystik Dan ending that dream when ending second in the Preakness Stakes in May.\n\nHowever, there is a lot to look forward ahead of Saturday's Belmont Stakes - as the Run For The Roses victor, Mystik Dan and also the Preakness winner Seize The Grey are expected runners.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes, billed as the Run For The Carnations, will also be staged outside Belmont Park for the first time since 1967 with the course being given a revamp. Saratoga, which is around 260 km north of Belmont, will be the temporary home until 2026.\n\nIt's worth noting that due to the Saratoga course being slightly different to Belmont Park - the race distance has been dropped from 1 \u00bd miles to 1m \u00bc miles.\n\nThere will be 10 Belmont Stakes horses running for the $2m purse and it's the Kentucky Derby second Sierra Leone that leads the betting as the horse hopes to give the Chad Brown team a first win in this Triple Crown race.\n\nThe Todd Pletcher runner Mindframe is next best in the betting odds - a horse who will be running in a Triple Crown race for the first time this season. He was last seen winning with ease in an Allowance Optional Claiming race at Churchill Downs - therefore, this will be a big step up in grade for this Constitution colt. Pletcher will be hoping for a fifth Belmont Stakes win.\n\nAnother barn on four Belmont Stakes wins is veteran handler D. Wayne Lukas and he'll be trying to add another with his recent Preakness Stakes winner Seize The Grey. The last horse to win both races was the Triple Crown victor Justify in 2018.\n\nIt's all set-up to be another captivating renewal of the 156th running of the Belmont Stakes, which this year will create more history being run at Saratoga Race Course - the home of the Whitney and Travers Stakes.\n\nBefore you place bets on the win, place, show and trifecta with the featured Belmont Stakes sportsbooks, have a look at the latest betting odds below.", "source": {"uri": "eyeonannapolis.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eye On Annapolis"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parimutuel_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Parimutuel betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justify_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justify (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D.

The Belmont Stakes are named after August Belmont, a turn-of-the-century financier and horse racing enthusiast. The Park opened in 1905, built by a syndicate headed by August Belmont II and former Secretary of the Navy William C. Whitney.\n\nTheir goal was to construct the most elaborate racetrack in America, modeled after the greatest courses in Europe. It was a project \"by, of, and for the American aristocracy,\" catering to the nation's wealthiest with amenities of posh luxury. Belmont Park's first post time, 2:30 pm on May 4, 1905, is believed to have caused Long Island's first-ever traffic jam.\n\nSince then, horse racing has become a spectator sport more accessible to the public, no longer reserved for the wealthy but still a status symbol to those with deep pockets.\n\nSo why is the Belmont Stakes so important?\n\nPrimarily because of its prestige. It's been at the heart of horse racing from the beginning. Belmont Park quickly became known as the best racetrack in the country, a proving ground for the best horses in the sport. The race itself became part of the \"Triple Crown of Horse Racing\" sometime in the 1930s, alongside the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes.\n\nTogether, they are the three most famous horse races in the sport, with very large purses and a great deal of fame for the winners.\n\n>> Where to buy tickets for sold-out Belmont Stakes\n\nThe Belmont Stakes is the final \"jewel\" of the Triple Crown and is widely accepted as the hardest. It's a mile and a half long, the longest of the Triple Crown races. The three-year-old thoroughbreds that race in the Triple Crown have fully matured by the time the Belmont Stakes are run, adding to the level of their physical challenge.\n\nIt's often called the \"Test of the Champion,\" because by that point only the best of the best horses in the industry are competing, making it the hardest to win. It's also the oldest Triple Crown race, and the fourth overall oldest race in the country (Saratoga's famous Travers Stakes is the third oldest). This year's winner will take a prize of $1.2 million, out of the highest-ever total purse of $2 million (up from last year's $1.5 million).\n\nTo take the Triple Crown by winning all three races is no easy feat. Only 13 horses have ever been able to claim this accomplishment. The most recent were Justify in 2018, American Pharaoh in 2015, and Affirmed in 1978. Secretariat, perhaps the most famous Triple Crown winner because of the books and movies covering his historic breaking of a 25-year Triple Crown drought, took the win in 1973, becoming the first Triple Crown champion since 1948.\n\nFor some context, let's look at another, perhaps more widely known \"triple crown.\"\n\nIn the American entertainment industry, the \"Triple Crown of Acting\" is defined as winning a Tony, an Emmy, and an Academy Award. Just like the horse racing Triple Crown, it's very hard to do and a very prestigious accomplishment (only 24 actors have managed this so far, and there are long lists of \"two out of three ain't bad\").\n\nNow imagine if an announcement was made that the theater district of New York City has to undergo some major construction work, and as a result all the Broadway theaters have to be closed during the weekend that the Tony Awards would normally be held. To prevent interruption to the annual ceremony, this year the Tony Awards are going to be held at SPAC.\n\nThat's why this is so important to Saratoga Springs. The Belmont Stakes are going to be run at the Saratoga Race Course this year and next year, while Belmont Park undergoes some major renovations.\n\nSo, for the first time in the city's history, Saratoga Springs is going to host one of the most famous horse races of all time. Due to the difference in racetracks, these two Belmont Stakes will be run at a mile and a quarter instead of a mile and a half. However, the change in distance will make the famous race no less prestigious or difficult.\n\nAt the local level, the Belmont Stakes is going to have a noticeable impact on Saratoga Springs and its surrounding areas. It's an extra weekend of high-stakes racing that will bring a lot of people -- and a lot of revenue -- into the city. The Belmont Stakes is part of a four-day Festival featuring 23 races with some of the highest winner's purses ever seen.\n\nArea businesses are already planning for the increase in customers that will undoubtedly come from the Festival.", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "syracuse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park",

If [Sierra Leone] had kept a straight line it's hard to imagine he wouldn't have won. But that's horse racing. ... A nice consolation prize would be the Belmont.\"\n\nAnother of the prominent storylines for Saturday's race is that the Belmont will be conducted at a mile and a quarter instead of its usual mile and a half.\n\nThat extra distance is part of the reason for the race's nickname, the Test of a Champion, particularly true when a horse is able to win all three races of different lengths in a five-week span.\n\nIs the 156th running of the Belmont Stakes any less of a test of a champion?\n\n\"I think if a Triple Crown were at stake you could make that argument, but it's still a pretty high-quality test,\" said Hall of Fame trainer Todd Pletcher, who is saddling three contenders -- Antiquarian with legendary New York jockey John Velazquez (12-1), Protective (20-1) and second-favorite Mindframe (7-2).\n\n\"It's going to be a little different. I mean, the Test of a Champion at a mile and a half at the old Big Sandy Belmont track is a very unique race and I would never try to compare it to a mile and a quarter at Saratoga,\" Brown said. \"They're just different races. Equally as challenging to win, but different. I don't think it's any less of an accomplishment for whoever wins the race but it will be unique in its own right.\"\n\nOne issue on which there's no debate is that the relocation of the Belmont Stakes to Saratoga for the next two years will create a huge windfall for the region.\n\nTodd Shimkus, president of the Saratoga County Chamber of Commerce, estimates this week's four-day racing festival will generate upwards of $50 million.\n\nHe says the calculation is based on last year's 40-day meet accounting for $370 million in business.\n\nTen percent of that would be $37 million but the figure is upgraded for larger crowds and higher prices for local hotels.\n\nEarly arrivals to town couldn't help but notice the ubiquitous green Belmont Stakes at Saratoga flags adorning 140 lamp posts on Broadway and Union Avenue.\n\nAnd the main Broadway business strip was closed to traffic on Wednesday night for a live concert featuring Blues Traveler.\n\nAs for tickets, they went fast, like these horses.\n\nNYRA sold all general admission seats and hospitality packages for Saturday's card in just a few days over the winter.\n\nThe secondary market delivers options that are available but expensive, such as $2,460 at Ticketmaster for a club seat and buffet.\n\nNYRA is still offering face-value single-day general admission and hospitality packages for Thursday, Friday and Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travers_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travers Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_finish", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photo finish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavien_Prat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flavien Prat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Pletcher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Pletcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_statistical_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Metropolitan statistical area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse length"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Racing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Racing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_R._Velazquez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John R.

He might have won pulling away with a straightforward dash.\n\nNever knowing what could have been, trainer Chad Brown decided to make an adjustment for the next race, experimenting with a new bit for the Belmont Stakes on Saturday. The hope is the cage bit - one with a straight bar across the horse's mouth and another under his jaw - gives new jockey Flavien Prat more control of direction.\n\n\"It\u00b4s not a severe bit, by any means,\" Brown said last week. \"The cage bit, or any sort of straight bit, gives you much better power steering.\"\n\nWith the more traditional bit in the Derby, jockey Tyler Gaffalione wound up being fined $2,500 for touching Japanese horse Forever Young, which Brown chalked up as trying to get to his crop to the left side. Sierra Leone has been known for going off course, or \"lugging,\" during races, and it has become a tough problem to solve because those issues have not repeated themselves during morning training.\n\nThat has proved quite challenging and led Brown to revisit the bit situation now that the horse has some more experience.\n\nBelmont Stakes entrant Sierra Leone is bathed following a work out ahead of the 156th running of the Belmont Stakes horse race at Saratoga Race Course, Thursday, June 6, 2024, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. (AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)\n\n\"He\u00b4s been in some more racing,\" Brown said. \"He\u00b4s just a little bit more mature. And sometimes with horses, if something doesn\u00b4t work the first time, you can sort of reintroduce it later.\"\n\nHe pointed to Hall of Famer and 2007 Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Curlin as a horse who had steering problems and then reacted well to a cage bit or even something bigger.\n\n\"They tinkered with equipment, with straight bits, a very famous horse, a great horse, and a well-managed horse,\" Brown said. \"That's one example.\"\n\nSierra Leone opened as the 9-5 morning line favorite in the 10-horse field at shorter odds than Mystik Dan or Preakness winner Seize the Grey.\n\nThe scene in the winner's circle after the Preakness felt like a football pep rally to 88-year-old Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas. That's because Seize the Grey has 2,570 owners as part of MyRacehorse, a company that sells shares of thoroughbreds to members of the public.\n\nNot all of them were at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore for the upset win, but the party is continuing in the Belmont at Saratoga with Seize the Grey running for a third time in five weeks, just like Mystik Dan. He won the Pat Day Mile on the Derby day undercard to the delight of all his owners, of whom Lukas has met maybe a dozen.\n\n\"It was very gratifying to see that many people get that excited. ... with the cheering and throwing their fists in the air,\" Lukas said. \"I really liked the fact that we got that many people interested and enjoying it.\"\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing\n\nBelmont Stakes entrant Sierra Leone is washed following a work out ahead of the 156th running of the Belmont Stakes horse race at Saratoga Race Course, Wednesday, June 5, 2024, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.

With Belmont Racetrack undergoing a facelift, this year's race will happen at Saratoga Racetrack in Saratoga Springs, New York. The race will be shorter than the traditional mile and a half running just a mile and a quarter.\n\nThe favorite is Sierra Leone (9-5) followed by the winners of the first two jewels of the Triple Crown, Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan (5-1) and the winner of The Preakness Stakes, Seize the Grey (8-1). The Chad Brown-trained Sierra Leone was the favorite at Churchill Downs and closed fast but ultimately finished second in the Kentucky Derby. He did not run at Pimlico in The Preakness.\n\nFew horses in today's world run in all three legs of the Triple Crown. Mystik Dan is the first to do so since War of Will in 2019. Ken McPeek's horse barely missed out on a shot at the Triple Crown, finishing second in the Preakness after winning the Run for the Roses.\n\nD. Wayne Lucas' Seize the Grey outraced Mystik Dan at The Preakness and in doing so will look to be the first non-Triple Crown winner since Afleet Alex (2005) to claim the Preakness and the Belmont. While Seize the Grey did not run in the Kentucky Derby, he did run...and win...the Pat Day that same weekend. To race three times in five weeks let alone win that third race of the three is a daunting task for any horse.\n\nBet the Edge is your source for the day in sports betting.

He liked the favorite prior to the Kentucky Derby and likes Sierra Leone again Saturday.\n\n\"I like the favorite a lot. Sierra Leone is the best of the class, has a great combination of trainer (McPeek) and jockey (Pratt) especially for this course (Saratoga).\"\n\nHere's a quick snapshot of each of the horses in the 2024 Belmont Stakes listed by post position.

He broke a step slow and (Mystik Dan's jockey) Brian Hernandez (Jr.) shut the door quick on him. Brian rode a great race,\" Gargan said. \"We're just throwing the Derby out and going to the next race. He didn't run badly in the Blue Grass and we purposely rated him that day.\"\n\nSince the May 4 Run for the Roses, Dornoch has been training in solid fashion at Saratoga, giving Gargan confidence that he will see the Dornoch who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes (G2) in March and defeated Belmont Stakes morning-line favorite and Kentucky Derby runner-up Sierra Leone last year in the Remsen Stakes (G2).\n\n\"He's doing good. I just hope we break good, get a good position, and get a clean trip so he can show what he can do. He's never run a bad race when he was able to get into the race and run a clean race,\" Gargan said.\n\nDornoch, who will break from post 6 in the field of 10, figures to be part of the early pace, with Gargan hoping that he can sit second, just off the leader.\n\n\"I think (Seize the Grey) has to go from the rail,\" Gargan said about the front-running Preakness Stakes (G1) winner, \"because that's what you have to do from the rail. I'm curious to see what (trainer) Todd Pletcher does with (Mindframe) who is stretching out. He'll probably sit third or fourth. I think he'll sit in third, with us in second and if we don't go too fast, hopefully one of the three of us can win the race.\"\n\nDornoch, bred by Grandview Equine, is owned by West Paces Racing, R. A. Hill Stable, Belmar Racing and Breeding, Pine Racing Stables, and the Two Eight Racing of former Major League Baseball all-star Jayson Werth.\n\nHe was bought for $325,000 from the Runnymede Farm consignment at the 2022 Keeneland September Yearling Sale, prior to his big brother's classic win. Out of the Big Brown mare Puca , he has a record of three wins and two seconds in seven starts. The grade 2 winner has earned $552,275.\n\nBrown Hoping to Win a Home Game in Belmont Stakes\n\nWhen Chad Brown started training in 2007, he had the usual items on his bucket list. Triple Crown and Breeders' Cup wins. An Eclipse Award. A Saratoga Race Course trainer's title.\n\nHe's already checked off all of those boxes in a career on the right path toward inclusion in the Hall of Fame. Yet there's one item he could not have anticipated 17 years ago that now owns a prime spot on his to-do list.\n\nWith last year's announcement that Belmont Park would be closed until the track is rebuilt and reopened in 2026 at the earliest, all of a sudden an impossible dream became possible.\n\nGrowing up not far from Saratoga in Mechanicville, N.Y., Brown would covet winning the historic first Belmont Stakes (G1) at the Spa in front of locally based family and friends.\n\nAnd in 9-5 morning-line favorite Sierra Leone, he just might have the $2.3 million 3-year-old who can make his dreams come true.\n\n\"It's exciting for me and everyone with my team and family. We're personally involved in the community here in Saratoga, being a resident up here. It's an interesting experiment having the Belmont up here,\" Brown said. \"To win the first Belmont at Saratoga not far away from where I grew up, it would be a real special moment for me and my family and team. We have a base of operations here and we always focus on the Saratoga meet. Potentially it would be a great moment but it will be a challenging race. There are some good horses in this race. Yet It will be very special to get our first Belmont win in Saratoga, given all the time we spend here.\"\n\nSuccess at Saratoga has been a main cog of Brown's stable as he has won or shared six of the last seven trainer's titles at the Spa and captured seven titles overall.\n\nTuscan Gold to get time off\n\nThough Tuscan Gold was considered a possible starter in the Belmont Stakes, Brown said the son of Medaglia d'Oro did not train well leading up to the race and was not entered.\n\nHe added Tuscan Gold would receive a thorough medical check before any future plans would be discussed. Third in the Louisiana Derby (G2) and fourth in the Preakness Stakes (G1), Tuscan Gold is owned by William Lawrence, Walmac Farm, and Stonestreet Stables.\n\nMcPeek Surprised to Find Mystik Dan Third in Morning Line\n\nKen McPeek trains Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan.\n\nThe same 3-year-old son of Goldencents who was second in the Preakness and sits atop the current National Thoroughbred Racing Association Top 10 3-Year-Old poll.\n\nSo when the morning line was announced for the June 8 Belmont Stakes (G1) at Saratoga Race Course, McPeek was a bit surprised when his colt was installed as the third choice at 5-1 behind the Chad Brown-trained Sierra Leone (9-5), who finished a nose behind Mystik Dan in the opening jewel of the Triple Crown, and Mindframe (7-2), who is trained by Todd Pletcher and is making his stakes debut after lopsided maiden and allowance optional claimer wins.\n\n\"I was very surprised Mindframe was the second choice,\" McPeek said. \"Very surprised. But admittedly, up here at Saratoga, they bet on Chad and Todd. Mindframe hasn't run in a stakes but he has run fast, though the last time (a May 4 allowance race at Churchill Downs) he had a really slow pace (:49.18 and 1:13.17). He's going to get some pace Saturday.\"\n\nBrown Believes Blazing Sevens Back to Top Form\n\nAs a grade 1 winner at 2 who then followed with a close runner-up finish in the 2023 Preakness Stakes at 3, Blazing Sevens looked like he would be a force in the second half of 2023.\n\nBut one never knows when challenges will present themselves in racing. Returning to top form in 2023 after that Preakness effort would prove elusive for Blazing Sevens and his trainer Chad Brown.\n\n\"After that tough defeat in the Preakness, he was never quite moving right afterward,\" Brown said. \"I tried to get him into a nice race here at Saratoga and he came out of that even a little worse. He was just not himself.\"\n\nThe good news is that Blazing Sevens is back for his 4-year-old season and will enter the $1 million Metropolitan Handicap (G1) June 8 at Saratoga Race Course off a clear victory in an April 20 allowance-level race at Aqueduct Racetrack. That effort marked the first race for the son of Good Magic since the aforementioned start at Saratoga, a third-place finish in the Curlin Stakes in July 2023.\n\nBrown said the time off has worked wonders for the 4-year-old colt campaigned by Rodeo Creek Racing. He'll enter Saturday's test off five works on the Belmont Park training track since the allowance win.\n\n\"I love the way the horse is moving,\" Brown said. \"He's going to have to be at his best because it's a tough field but I do feel like this horse is going as well as he was when he almost won the Preakness last year.\"\n\nAt his best, Blazing Sevens won his maiden special weight debut in spectacular fashion, drawing off to a 6 1/4-length score in that six-furlong test in July 2022 at Saratoga. He earned a grade 1 placing in the Hopeful Stakes (G1) at the Spa and then registered a 3 1/4-length score in the one-mile Champagne Stakes (G1) at Aqueduct.\n\nFinishing second by a head to National Treasure -- who also is entered in the Met Mile -- would prove the highlight of a winless 2023. While that big effort at 1 3/16 miles showed Blazing Sevens could handle a longer distance, Brown believes the mile may be his best. \"Even though he narrowly lost the Preakness going a mile and three-sixteenths, going back to the (one-mile) Champagne, it looked like his best race,\" Brown said. \"He might be a little better with a little pace in front of him, which you get in a mile race as opposed to races that are a little too far for him. Going forward, he looks like a mile to a mile and an eighth will be right in his wheelhouse.\"", "source": {"uri": "bloodhorse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blood Horse Interactive"}, "authors":

Mystik Dan also faces a rematch with morning-line favorite Sierra Leone, who lost by a nose in the thrilling Derby showdown.\n\nSierra Leone, with Flavien Prat up, will break from post No. 9 at 9-5. Seize the Grey, ridden by Jaime Torres, drew the rail and 8-1 odds. Mystik Dan, with jockey Brian Hernandez Jr., is 5-1 on the morning line.\n\n\"He's been doing great,\" Sierra Leone trainer Chad Brown said. \"He bounced out of that (20-horse) Derby, which can obviously be a tough race on horses, and he bounced out well. We have half as many horses to run down so that should hopefully be a little easier on him. I just hope he runs the same race as in the Derby.\"\n\nThere will not be a 14th Triple Crown winner - Justify was the last in 2018 - with Mystik Dan, second in the Preakness, and Seize the Grey each winning one of the races. But either can become the 52nd horse to win two legs. Only 11 horses have won the Derby and the Belmont.\n\nBelmont post position isn't always as crucial as the Derby's with a smaller field.\n\nMindframe, trained by Todd Pletcher and with Irad Ortiz Jr. up, drew the outside post No. 10 at 7-2 odds.\n\n\"I didn't see any major draw impact,\" Pletcher said of the lineup. \"I think it's good for Mindframe that he drew outside because he doesn't have that much experience and it might give Irad an opportunity to give him a clean trip around there.\"\n\nPletcher will also saddle 12-1 Antiquarian, who will break from post No. 5 with John Velazquez up, and 20-1 Protective, who drew post No. 7 and is owned by Mike Repole, who was raised in Queens.\n\nPletcher added he might not have entered the inexperienced Mindframe in the Belmont had it been run at its usual longer length. At the same time, Pletcher acknowledged a 11/4-mile Belmont will have different challenges.\n\n\"Sometimes that race can be run at a slower place, which can be less taxing,\" Pletcher said.\n\nHaving Mystik Dan and Seize the Grey so close to each other coming out of the gate could be intriguing.\n\nBut McPeek said his horse's race could also be impacted by 15-1 Dornoch, which will break from post No. 6 with Luis Saez aboard.\n\n\"My horse has got some natural speed if you need it,\" McPeek said. \"I think it's going to kind of depend on what Dornoch does out there. But we'll leave that up to Brian. He's very talented and somebody who knows the horse and we trust and we're going to let him do his thing.\"\n\nOf course, the star on Saturday could just be Saratoga.\n\n\"It's such a beautiful track,\" said Emily Bushnell, the co-owner of 10-1 Resilience, which drew post No. 2 with Junior Alvarado up. \"I loved coming here growing up with my dad.

There won't be a sweep of the Triple Crown but there will be intrigue with Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and Preakness winner Seize the Gray meeting in their rubber match.\n\nBut bettors seem to be looking elsewhere. Sierra Leone opened as the morning line favorite at 9-5 odds while Todd Pletcher-trained Mindframe was the second choice at 7-2.\n\nCoverage of Belmont Stakes Day begins on FS1 Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., with FOX picking up the coverage until 7 p.m., before it returns to FS2 until 8:10 p.m.\n\nMore: Behind-the-scenes changes at Monmouth Park come at critical time for NJ horse racing\n\nHere are some opinions on which horses will be the top finishers:\n\nBelmont Stakes field (betting number, horse, trainer, jockey, odds)\n\nBrisnet past performances via Horse Racing Nation\n\nBelmont Stakes selections\n\nKen Jordan, five times among top finishers at NTRA/National Horseplayers Championship, four Top 10s at Horseplayers World Series\n\n6. Dornoch - Resented being rated in Blue Grass and may have had the worsttrip of all in the Kentucky Derby. The thinking here is that he willattend the pace set by Seize the Grey and Mindframe, then show somefinish in the stretch. Slight edge over second choice.\n\n2. Resilience - Rallied wide into the hot Derby pace, set up for a top performance by Bill Mott\n\n9. Sierra Leone - When a barn known for being meticulous says a new bit is the answer after five races, be skeptical at the windows.\n\n3. Mystik Dan - Derby hero may not get a setup where he can duplicate that powerful rain run.\n\nSwift Hitter, New Jerseyan and horse racing commentator with 14,000 followers on X.\n\n9. Sierra Leone - Most talented horse in race. Chad Brown changed bits and that will help horse run a straight path. Fully expect a solid enough pace. Strictly the horse to beat. If 8/5 odds, consider it a gift.\n\n3. Mystik Dan - Derby winner and runner up in Preakness, will have to settle for second as Sierra Leone is fresh and waiting for 'em.\n\n6. Dornoch - Longshot play to round out trifecta. If left alone on lead, can be dangerous\n\nSean Nolan, 17-time National Handicapping Championship qualifier with four top 20 finishes, including a second place\n\n9. Sierra Leone - The best closer in the race is two noses away from being unbeaten and should get enough pace to run into. If he can avoid lugging in severely - a habit which cost him in both his defeats and should have gotten him disqualified to third in the Kentucky Derby - he should run them down late and give trainer Chad Brown his first Belmont winner.\n\n2. Resilience - He ran a sneaky good race in the Derby, when he finished sixth. Despite racing wide the whole way after breaking from the No. 18 post and making an early move into a pace that collapsed, he was in contention at the top of stretch before tiring. He could get a nice trip just off the pace here.\n\n10. Mindframe - The Todd Pletcher-trainee may be the most talented horse in the race. He's won his first two starts by a combined 21 1/4 lengths and the 103 Beyer Speed Figure he recorded in his debut is the highest Beyer in the field. Mindframe outworked Kentucky Derby favorite and Breeders' Cup Juvenile champion Fierceness two weeks ago. Fierceness is now being pointed to the Haskell Stakes July 20 at Monmouth Park, along with the Bob Baffert-trained Muth. This is a major step up in class, though, for Mindframe.\n\n8. Honor Marie - He was one of the wise guy horses going into the Derby, and then never had a chance with a nightmare trip. It was probably the worst trip any of the 20 horses in the race had. He also could get enough pace to run into and gets a significant rider change due to injury to Florent Geroux.\n\nGreg Giombarrese, Director of Communications, Jersey Shore BlueClaws\n\n9. Sierra Leone - The Kentucky Derby runner-up (though he should have been disqualified to third) always fires no matter the race and no matter the pace. His race in the Risen Star was arguably the best prep race performance by anyone and he certainly ran well in the Derby. He'll be coming late and should excel at the distance.\n\n8. Honor Marie - He lost his chance in the Derby two seconds after the gate opened. He was pin-balled around at the start and jostled for the first furlong. He was then stuck in behind horses into the lane and had to shift way out in the last 3/16ths. He was the wise-guy horse going into the Derby, and may well produce his best in this race at a very square price.\n\n2. Resilience - He ran a sneaky-good race in the Derby. First, being drawn in post 18 did him no favors. He then was hung wide the whole way and made a very early move into a very fast pace before understandably tiring late. He should be able to sit closer to the pace here and save ground. He could impact things at a price.\n\n3. Mystik Dan - The Derby winner has run quite well in the first two Triple Crown races and he projects to get another very good trip from just off the pace. We will see if he can bring his \"A\" game for the third time in five weeks.\n\nBob Jordan, Asbury Park Press sports editor\n\n2. Resilience - This one from Mott is on a cycle upswing and can get the right trip.\n\n4. The Wine Steward - Extra value with this one - Saez is jumping off to stick with Dornoch, leaving this ride vacant until a couple of days ago when Manny Franco got the call.\n\n10. Mindframe - Talented but moving from nw1x to winning the Test of Champions? Not that good but will have a big say.\n\n6. Dornoch - Logical to include in exotics.\n\n9. Sierra Leone - A big prep and strong Derby but the math just doesn't feel right with five weeks off. Though in the last 20 editions of the Belmont Stakes we've had 10 winners who went straight from the Derby to the Belmont without a start in between", "source": {"uri": "lohud.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Journal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_2", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 2"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Grass_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Grass Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Thoroughbred_Racing_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Thoroughbred Racing Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parimutuel_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parimutuel betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_1", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monmouth_Park_Racetrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monmouth Park Racetrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dornoch", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dornoch"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dornoch"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_I._Mott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William I.

However, it's Sierra Leone -- the runner-up from this year's Derby -- who's favored in the Belmont Stakes odds.\n\nThe exacta requires the bettor to select the Top 2 finishers of a race in exact order. The minimum wager at the Belmont Stakes is $1. Bettors can also \"box\" an exacta, meaning the two (or more) selected Belmont Stakes horses on a ticket can finish in any order, albeit at an increased cost.\n\nThe top horse in my Belmont Stakes predictions is No. 8 Honor Marie, sitting at a juicy 12-1 on the morning line. This son of Honor Code had all kinds of trouble in the Kentucky Derby, steadying and switching lanes multiple times, but still fought on to go from 20th to eighth at the finish.\n\nHonor Marie is a former Grade II winner and was also second in the Louisiana Derby two-back. The jockey upgrade to Florent Geroux is encouraging as well.\n\nNo. 9 Sierra Leone isn't offering much value at 9-5 in the Belmont Stakes, but he is a logical alternative and a must-use in the exotics.\n\nSierra Leone was beaten just a nose by Mystik Dan in the Kentucky Derby, and has never been worse than second in five career starts. The Risen Star Stakes and Blue Grass Stakes winner will be rolling late under Flavien Prat.\n\nRecent trends favor Honor Marie and Sierra Leone too, as two of the last three and four of the last seven Belmont winners (excluding Tiz the Law in 2020, when the Belmont was the first leg of the Triple Crown) competed in the Kentucky Derby and skipped the Preakness Stakes.\n\nI'm looking to spice the exotics up even more with No. 4 The Wine Steward, who is 15-1 on the morning line.\n\nHe did not win the Peter Pan Stakes -- the race 2023 Belmont champion Arcangelo won to prep for this event -- but was a game second after finding his way to the lead a bit earlier than usual. I'm counting in the rider change to Manny Franco to help him get a more familiar stalking trip, and The Wine Steward could be ready to run a lifetime best in his third start off a layoff.\n\nSecond place: No. 4 The Wine Steward, No. 8 Honor Marie, No. 9 Sierra Leone\n\nTo win: No. 4 The Wine Steward, No. 8 Honor Marie, No. 9 Sierra Leone\n\nSecond place: No. 4 The Wine Steward, No. 8 Honor Marie, No. 9 Sierra Leone\n\nThe trifecta tasks the bettor with determining the first three finishers of a race in exact order. The payoff can be significantly higher than the exacta, but both the ticket cost and the risk factor increase significantly, even with a minimum wager amount of 50 cents.\n\nI'm taking the Top 3 horses I used in my exacta plays and adding some more Belmont Stakes long shots to the mix, starting with No. 2 Resilience at 10-1.\n\nThe Wood Memorial winner outran his odds from a wide post in the Kentucky Derby, and a ground-saving journey could be just what the doctor ordered.\n\nNo. 3 Mystik Dan (5-1) peaked in the Kentucky Derby and followed it up with a solid second in the Preakness. Will another quick turnaround hurt his chances in the Belmont?\n\nNo. 5 Antiquarian (12-1) beat The Wine Steward in the Peter Pan, which was a solid comeback for him after being dealt a bad hand in the Louisiana Derby.\n\nNo. 10 Mindframe (7-2) might be biting off a bit more than he can chew in his stakes debut, and this post won't help him. Nevertheless, his speed figures are hard to ignore.\n\nSecond place: No. 4 The Wine Steward, No. 8 Honor Marie, No. 9 Sierra Leone\n\nThird place: No. 2 Resilience, No. 3 Mystik Dan, No. 4 The Wine Steward, No. 5 Antiquarian, No. 8 Honor Marie, No. 9 Sierra Leone, No. 10 Mindframe\n\nTotal = $40\n\nThe superfecta is an even tougher wager to hit than the trifecta, as it requires the bettor to pick the first four finishers of a race in exact order. However, the potential payday can be among the highest in horse racing. The minimum wager amount is just 10 cents, making it somewhat easier to get involved.\n\nIn my primary superfecta wager, I'm betting that either Honor Marie or Sierra Leone will win, throwing The Wine Steward into the mix for second or third, and pushing the \"ALL\" button for fourth. As long as I get the first three horses correct, this superfecta ticket will hit no matter who runs fourth.\n\nI'll conclude by focusing on the additional horses I highlighted in the third leg of my trifecta ticket and placing them fourth in my supplemental superfecta play.\n\nSecond place: No. 4 The Wine Steward, No. 8 Honor Marie, No. 9 Sierra Leone\n\nThird place: No. 4 The Wine Steward, No. 8 Honor Marie, No. 9 Sierra Leone\n\nSecond place: No. 4 The Wine Steward, No. 8 Honor Marie, No. 9 Sierra Leone\n\nThird place: No. 4 The Wine Steward, No. 8 Honor Marie, No. 9 Sierra Leone\n\nFourth place: No. 2 Resilience, No. 3 Mystik Dan, No. 5 Antiquarian, No. 10 Mindframe\n\nTotal = $44\n\nFind the best horse racing betting sites in your region.

(AP) - The Belmont Stakes is the final test of the Triple Crown - the third resume booster to edge a horse into the history books. It's not an easy feat.\n\nThe third leg is the longest of the three races at 1\u00bd miles and requires a horse with endurance to handle it. There have been 36 Triple Crown-eligible horses heading into the Belmont, and only 13 have secured the third jewel.\n\nThis year, with it happening at Saratoga Race Course instead of Belmont Park, the shape of the track makes it implausible to run it at 1\u00bd miles, so it's being shortened to 1\u00bc miles - the same distance as the Kentucky Derby. It's a change but not one that retired jockey and Fox Sports racing analyst Richard Migliore believes deserves an asterisk for the winner.\n\n\"It takes nothing away from the event whatsoever,\" Migliore said. \"It\u00b4s an American classic race that\u00b4s tough to win. Winning races at the Grade I level, at any distance, whether it\u00b4s 5 furlongs or 2 miles, is extremely tough.\"\n\nChanging the distance is nothing new for the Belmont, which has been run at various lengths since the first edition in 1867. Going 1\u00bd miles has been a mainstay since 1927, though it was shortened to 1 1/8 miles in 2020 when it led off the out-of-order Triple Crown because of the pandemic.\n\nThis year, it\u00b4s just a quarter-of-a-mile change, but it has been a major factor in the horses\u00b4 entry for the stakes.\n\nA horse works out ahead of the 156th running of the Belmont Stakes horse race at Saratoga Race Course, Wednesday, June 5, 2024, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. (AP Photo/Julia Nikhinson)\n\nDerby winner Mystik Dan is set to run in the Belmont, but trainer Kenny McPeek said he probably would not have run him at the traditional distance.\n\n\"I\u00b4d rather it be a mile and a quarter than a mile and a half,\" McPeek said. \"I could see not taking him down to Belmont and running him at a mile and a half.\"\n\nThe 9-5 opening favorite Sierra Leone was a nose behind Mystik Dan in the Kentucky Derby. Trainer Chad Brown was unsure about the regular distance, but once it was announced it\u00b4d be shorter, he entered the horse.\n\n\"It made a decision very easy,\" Brown said. \"It looks like he has unbelievable stamina. But it still doesn\u00b4t necessarily mean I think he\u00b4s a mile-and-a-half horse. ... Much more appealing at the mile-and-a-quarter distance.\"\n\nThe shorter distance is not appealing for all trainers. Todd Pletcher, who has won the Belmont four times, would\u00b4ve preferred the normal distance. Pletcher has three entries in the 10-horse field, including 7-2 second choice Mindframe.\n\n\"We\u00b4d probably have two more in it,\" Pletcher said. \"I miss the mile-and-a-half part of it. Part of it is selfish because I\u00b4ve had success at that distance. I do appreciate that it is the real test in a mile and a half. But how could you not embrace having a great race at Saratoga.\"\n\nThe distance change is temporary for the next two years before the race is set to return to remade Belmont Park in 2026, following $455 million in renovations. It is then expected to go back to being the 1\u00bd-mile \"test of the champion\" that it has been known as for nearly a century.\n\n\"In a perfect world, yes, I would like to see it a mile and a half,\" Migliore said. \"I don\u00b4t think it distracts from the race itself being shortened up.\"\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing\n\nHorses work out ahead of the 156th running of the Belmont Stakes horse race at Saratoga Race Course, Wednesday, June 5, 2024, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.

There won't be a sweep of the Triple Crown but there will be intrigue with Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and Preakness winner Seize the Gray meeting in their rubber match.\n\nBut bettors seem to be looking elsewhere. Sierra Leone opened as the morning line favorite at 9-5 odds while Todd Pletcher-trained Mindframe was the second choice at 7-2.\n\nCoverage of Belmont Stakes Day begins on FS1 Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., with FOX picking up the coverage until 7 p.m., before it returns to FS2 until 8:10 p.m.\n\nMore: Behind-the-scenes changes at Monmouth Park come at critical time for NJ horse racing\n\nHere are some opinions on which horses will be the top finishers:\n\nBelmont Stakes 2024 | Download Free PDF | Belmont Stakes | Thoroughbred Families\n\n6. Dornoch - Resented being rated in Blue Grass and may have had the worsttrip of all in the Kentucky Derby. The thinking here is that he willattend the pace set by Seize the Grey and Mindframe, then show somefinish in the stretch. Slight edge over second choice.\n\n2. Resilience - Rallied wide into the hot Derby pace, set up for a top performance by Bill Mott\n\n9. Sierra Leone - When a barn known for being meticulous says a new bit is the answer after five races, be skeptical at the windows.\n\n3. Mystik Dan - Derby hero may not get a setup where he can duplicate that powerful rain run.\n\n9. Sierra Leone - Most talented horse in race. Chad Brown changed bits and that will help horse run a straight path. Fully expect a solid enough pace. Strictly the horse to beat. If 8/5 odds, consider it a gift.\n\n3. Mystik Dan - Derby winner and runner up in Preakness, will have to settle for second as Sierra Leone is fresh and waiting for 'em.\n\n6. Dornoch - Longshot play to round out trifecta. If left alone on lead, can be dangerous\n\nCheck back soon for Sean's picks.\n\n9. Sierra Leone - The best closer in the race is two noses away from being unbeaten and should get enough pace to run into. If he can avoid lugging in severely - a habit which cost him in both his defeats and should have gotten him disqualified to third in the Kentucky Derby - he should run them down late and give trainer Chad Brown his first Belmont winner.\n\n2. Resilience - He ran a sneaky good race in the Derby, when he finished sixth. Despite racing wide the whole way after breaking from the No. 18 post and making an early move into a pace that collapsed, he was in contention at the top of stretch before tiring. He could get a nice trip just off the pace here.\n\n10. Mindframe - The Todd Pletcher-trainee may be the most talented horse in the race. He's won his first two starts by a combined 21 1/4 lengths and the 103 Beyer Speed Figure he recorded in his debut is the highest Beyer in the field. Mindframe outworked Kentucky Derby favorite and Breeders' Cup Juvenile champion Fierceness two weeks ago. Fierceness is now being pointed to the Haskell Stakes July 20 at Monmouth Park, along with the Bob Baffert-trained Muth. This is a major step up in class, though, for Mindframe.\n\n8. Honor Marie - He was one of the wise guy horses going into the Derby, and then never had a chance with a nightmare trip. It was probably the worst trip any of the 20 horses in the race had. He also could get enough pace to run into and gets a significant rider change due to injury to Florent Geroux.\n\n9. Sierra Leone - The Kentucky Derby runner-up (though he should have been disqualified to third) always fires no matter the race and no matter the pace. His race in the Risen Star was arguably the best prep race performance by anyone and he certainly ran well in the Derby. He'll be coming late and should excel at the distance.\n\n8. Honor Marie - He lost his chance in the Derby two seconds after the gate opened. He was pin-balled around at the start and jostled for the first furlong. He was then stuck in behind horses into the lane and had to shift way out in the last 3/16ths. He was the wise-guy horse going into the Derby, and may well produce his best in this race at a very square price.\n\n2. Resilience - He ran a sneaky-good race in the Derby. First, being drawn in post 18 did him no favors. He then was hung wide the whole way and made a very early move into a very fast pace before understandably tiring late. He should be able to sit closer to the pace here and save ground. He could impact things at a price.\n\n3. Mystik Dan - The Derby winner has run quite well in the first two Triple Crown races and he projects to get another very good trip from just off the pace. We will see if he can bring his \"A\" game for the third time in five weeks.\n\n2. Resilience - This one from Mott is on a cycle upswing and can get the right trip.\n\n4. The Wine Steward - Extra value with this one - Saez is jumping off to stick with Dornoch, leaving this ride vacant until a couple of days ago when Manny Franco got the call.\n\n10. Mindframe - Talented but moving from nw1x to winning the Test of Champions? Not that good but will have a big say.\n\n6. Dornoch - Logical to include in exotics.\n\n9. Sierra Leone - A big prep and strong Derby but the math just doesn't feel right with five weeks off. Though in the last 20 editions of the Belmont Stakes we've had 10 winners who went straight from the Derby to the Belmont without a start in between", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derby", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Derby"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Grass_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Grass Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parimutuel_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parimutuel betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_1", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports 1"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monmouth_Park_Racetrack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monmouth Park Racetrack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dornoch", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dornoch"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dornoch"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_I._Mott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William I.

since his signature victory, but a June 8 Belmont Stakes (G1) rematch with Derby runner-up Sierra Leone , second in the poll, and Preakness (G1) winner Seize the Grey , third in the poll, could alter their placements.\n\nIn addition, 10th-ranked Wood Memorial winner Resilience will participate in the Belmont, as will Honor Marie , Antiquarian , and Mindframe , who are in the \"others receiving votes\" category to rank 13th, 14th, and 15th, respectively.\n\nKentucky Oaks (G1) winner Thorpedo Anna ranks seventh but could increase her positioning if she can follow up the Oaks with another score in the June 7 Acorn Stakes (G1).\n\nSign up for BloodHorse Daily\n\nIn the overall Thoroughbred poll, second-ranked champion Idiomatic could potentially claim the spot from Senor Buscador with a superb performance in the Ogden Phipps Stakes(G1) on the Belmont Stakes undercard.\n\nMeanwhile, third-ranked National Treasure and seventh-ranked White Abarrio will face off in the Metropolitan Handicap (G1).\n\nWith nine grade 1s and 14 graded stakes for flat horses during the festival, the rankings could see major changes for week 20.\n\nSee the full rankings voted on by national media for

Since Mystik Dan won the Derby and then finished second to Seize the Grey in the Preakness, there is no Triple Crown chance.\n\nBoth of those colts are in the Belmont field, but neither is the favorite -- or even the second-favorite -- on the morning line.\n\nPost time for the Belmont is 6:41 p.m. EDT. The race will be telecast live on Fox and finishes off on FS2 from 7 to 8 p.m.\n\nThe lineup, by post position, with sire, trainer, jockey and morning-line odds:\n\n1. Seize the Grey (Arrogate). D. Wayne Lukas, Jaime Torres, 8-1\n\nThe Preakness winner, this colt was coming off a victory in the Pat Day Mile at Churchill Downs when he tackled the 1 3/16 miles of the Preakness Stakes three weeks ago. He got right to the lead, running comfortably enough on a muddy track, and Derby winner Mystik Dan couldn't make up any ground in the stretch, finishing 2 1/4 lengths back in second. If the Belmont were at its normal distance, he might not even have been entered. As it is, it's hard to count him out, but he may have more competition for the lead this time.\n\nPhoto by Walter Wlodarczyk, courtesy of New York Racing Association\n\n2. Resilience (Into Mischief). Bill Mott, Junior Alvarado, 10-1.\n\nHe qualified for the Kentucky Derby by winning the Grade II Wood Memorial at Aqueduct, and then reported a flat seventh at Churchill Downs. Other than the Wood, which was not a particularly talent-filled affair, he's really done little to recommend him against horses at this level. Those looking for a reason to like him can stop at the trainer column. Mott has been doing this at the highest level for a long time and can be overlooked.\n\n3. Mystik Dan (Goldencents). Kenny McPeek, Brian Hernandez Jr., 5-1.\n\nHe's the Kentucky Derby winner, who was second in the Preakness. He earned the roses fair and square, albeit by just two noses over horses who had rougher trips than he did. Hernandez gave him the chance to win by shooting through a narrow gap along the rail at the top of the stretch while the two main rivals were bumping and grinding to his outside. So what happened in the Preakness? It can't be put down to the muddy track because he won the Grade III Southwest on a muddy Oaklawn Park surface by 8 lengths. Looking at some of the newcomers lining up for the Belmont, one could conclude a repeat of the Derby performance won't be good enough here.\n\n4. The Wine Steward (Vino Rosso). Mike Maker, Manny Franco, 15-1.\n\nHe's had an attack of \"second-itis,\" finishing runner-up in three straight races without showing meaningful improvement in speed figures. In his last outing, he held a brief lead in the stretch in the Grade III Peter Pan at Aqueduct, but surrendered it to Antiquarian, who lines up just to his outside in the Belmont gate. It's hard to see how he can prevail against these rivals.\n\n5. Antiquarian (Preservationist). Todd Pletcher, John Velazquez, 12-1.\n\nHe won a maiden race on a sloppy track at Fair Grounds in his second career start, finished sixth in the Louisiana Derby and then just did beat The Wine Steward in the Peter Pan. Pletcher and Velazquez are masters of their trade, but the record seems to indicate they need more to work with to win this race. Check out Pletcher's other runners.\n\n6. Dornoch (Good Magic). Danny Gargan, Luis Saez, 15-1.\n\nThis colt took a good bit of action in futures bets after closing out his 2-year-old season with a win in the Grade II Remsen in December and starting 2024 with a victory in the Grade II Fountain of Youth in Florida. Since then, things haven't gone his way. His fourth-place finish in the Grade I Blue Grass at Keeneland wasn't terrible, and he never got a chance to run in the Derby after being shuffled around in traffic. A better trip might give him a chance to show more, but his numbers so far don't stack up with these rivals even on his best days.\n\n7. Protective (Medaglia d'Oro). Todd Pletcher, Tyler Gaffalione, 20-1.\n\nIf The Wine Steward has contracted \"second-itis,\" this colt must have \"third-place syndrome.\" He's finished third in his last three starts, including the Wood and the Peter Pan. Given three of the four horses who finished in front of him in those two stakes races are back again for the Belmont, he would seem to need significant improvement to make an impression.\n\n8. Honor Marie (Honor Code). Whit Beckman, Florent Geroux, 12-1.\n\nHe won the Grade II Kentucky Jockey Club in November, and then returned to start his 3-year-old campaign with a fifth-place finish in the Grade II Risen Star at Fair Grounds. He bounced back from that to finish a fast-closing second in the Louisiana Derby, but his running style caught up with him in Louisville, where he was bounced around early and never got untracked, finishing eighth. A smaller field, cleaner trip and a little improvement on the Louisiana Derby performance could put him in the picture for a placing in the Belmont, if not the win.\n\n9. Sierra Leone (Gun Runner). Chad Brown, Flavien Prat, 9-5 (favorite)\n\nSierra Leone might have given Brown his long-awaited Kentucky Derby win had it not been for the bumping with Japanese runner Forever Young down the stretch, which opened the door for Mystik Dan. Still, the second-place effort in that dramatic, three-horse photo was good enough to make him favorite in the Belmont after swerving the Preakness. It's worth noting, with no disrespect to any of those involved, that Prat replaces Tyler Gaffalione, who had ridden Sierra Leone to victory in the Risen Star and the Blue Grass before the Run for the Roses. There's a good chance that when the 2024 Eclipse Awards are handed out next January, Sierra Leone will be the 3-year-old champ. But he'll have to start here.\n\n10. Mindframe (Constitution). Todd Pletcher, Irad Ortiz Jr., 7-2.\n\nOK, he's undefeated. He has highest Beyer Speed Figure in any of these 10 colts' past performances. Pletcher is a master trainer, Ortiz is king of the jockeys, and his owners, Mike Repole and St. Elias Stables, win big races with regularity. But c'mon! He's only had two races. The field-topping 101 Beyer came in his first start, a 7-furlong maiden race at Gulfstream Park that he won by 13 3/4 lengths. He \"regressed\" to a 97 figure in his next race, which he won by \"only\" 7 1/4 lengths. He's a front-runner and probably will have to fight for the lead, especially from the outside gate. Could he win? Sure. But will he really be bet down to 7-2, ahead of the Derby and Preakness winners?", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Graded stakes race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_I._Mott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "William I.

He might have won pulling away with a straightforward dash.\n\nNever knowing what could have been, trainer Chad Brown decided to make an adjustment for the next race, experimenting with a new bit for the Belmont Stakes on Saturday. The hope is the cage bit -- one with a straight bar across the horse's mouth and another under his jaw -- gives new jockey Flavien Prat more control of direction.\n\n\"It's not a severe bit, by any means,\" Brown said last week. \"The cage bit, or any sort of straight bit, gives you much better power steering.\"\n\nWith the more traditional bit in the Derby, jockey Tyler Gaffalione wound up being fined $2,500 for touching Japanese horse Forever Young, which Brown chalked up as trying to get to his crop to the left side. Sierra Leone has been known for going off course, or \"lugging,\" during races, and it has become a tough problem to solve because those issues have not repeated themselves during morning training.\n\nThat has proved quite challenging and led Brown to revisit the bit situation now that the horse has some more experience.\n\n\"He's been in some more racing,\" Brown said. \"He's just a little bit more mature. And sometimes with horses, if something doesn't work the first time, you can sort of reintroduce it later.\"\n\nHe pointed to Hall of Famer and 2007 Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Curlin as a horse who had steering problems and then reacted well to a cage bit or even something bigger.\n\n\"They tinkered with equipment, with straight bits, a very famous horse, a great horse, and a well-managed horse,\" Brown said. \"That's one example.\"\n\nSierra Leone opened as the 9-5 morning line favorite in the 10-horse field at shorter odds than Mystik Dan or Preakness winner Seize the Grey.\n\nSEIZE THE SPOTLIGHT\n\nThe scene in the winner's circle after the Preakness felt like a football pep rally to 88-year-old Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas. That's because Seize the Grey has 2,570 owners as part of MyRacehorse, a company that sells shares of thoroughbreds to members of the public.\n\nNot all of them were at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore for the upset win, but the party is continuing in the Belmont at Saratoga with Seize the Grey running for a third time in five weeks, just like Mystik Dan. He won the Pat Day Mile on the Derby day undercard to the delight of all his owners, of whom Lukas has met maybe a dozen.\n\n\"It was very gratifying to see that many people get that excited. ... with the cheering and throwing their fists in the air,\" Lukas said. \"I really liked the fact that we got that many people interested and enjoying it.\"\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_whyno@hjnews.com", "name": "Stephen Whyno", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavien_Prat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flavien Prat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D.

While there will be no Triple Crown winner this year, the field is stacked with Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and Preakness Stakes winner Seize the Grey both running.\n\nNeither of those horses are the betting favorite, however. That honor goes to Sierra Leone. Sierra Leone was also the favorite in the Kentucky Derby and finished second by a nose. Sierra Leone (9-5), Mindframe (7-2) and Mystik Dan (5-1) are the early favorites but there is a horse sitting at odds of 12-1 I like to finish in the money.\n\nBelmont Stakes betting odds: Sierra Leone opens as favorite\n\nNo. 8 Honor Marie 12-1\n\nHonor Marie was a sexy pick in the Kentucky Derby but not many people are talking about the horse entering the Belmont Stakes. I get it, Honor Marie finished a \"disappointing\" eighth in the Derby then skipped the Preakness.\n\nThe Kentucky Derby finish is misleading though. Honor Marie got knocked around early in the large 20-horse field and was forced to settle back in last place. What stands out to me is despite not getting a great run early, Honor Marie rallied down the stretch to finish eighth. That might not seem impressive but if you watch the race over, there is a lot to like about Honor Marie entering the Belmont Stakes.\n\nThe Belmont is made for late closers and that makes Honor Marie live at 12-1. Similar to the Kentucky Derby, Honor Marie has started in the back of the pack in other races too only to surge down the stretch to finish in the money.\n\nTrainer Whit Beckman is raving about how Honor Marie has looked in training recently and I like his decision to skip the Preakness after the rough run in the Kentucky Derby. The Belmont has a smaller field by 10 horses, so jockey Florent Geroux should be able to avoid trouble out of the gate that doomed Honor Marie in the Derby.\n\nI love betting late speed in the Belmont and two horses who really fit that profile are Honor Marie and Mystik Dan. The eighth-place finish in the Derby is more impressive than it looks on paper. If Honor Marie gets a better ride on Saturday, I believe the horse has the recipe to finish in the money and potentially outrun the entire field at the Belmont Stakes.\n\nPicks\n\nHonor Marie 12-1 to win $10\n\nHonor Marie win, place, show $10\n\nNo home cooking: Saints have fewest bets to win Super Bowl LIX", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_casale@theadvocate.com", "name": "Thomas Casale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florent_Geroux", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florent Geroux"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/b5/1b5942da-4579-5b2f-977c-e9e833054562/666091760bd61.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623848", "eventUri": "eng-9623848", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-08", "textStart": 65, "textEnd": 71}], "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Preakness winner Seize the Grey drew post position No. 1 on Monday, and Kentucky Derby champion Mystik Dan will start in post No. 3 for the Belmont Stakes taking place Saturday at Saratoga Race Course.\n\nKenny McPeek-trained Mystik Dan, who finished second in the Preakness, is the only horse in the field for all three Triple Crown races. At 5-1 and being ridden again by Brian Hernandez Jr., he is the third choice behind favorite Sierra Leone, who opened at 9-5, and Mindframe at 7-2.\n\nMcPeek favored his inside post position, and Mystik Dan co-owner Lance Gasaway had his eye on the No. 3 post.\n\n\"Lance Gasaway sent me a message this morning, 'Go there and get post No. 3,'\" McPeek said. \"He said it's his lucky number, I guess. We're thrilled with that. I think that was great. It's out of our control now. It's up to Brian.\"\n\nHall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas' Seize the Grey is right behind Mystik Dan with 8-1 odds after a wire-to-wire win in the second leg of the Triple Crown.\n\nSierra Leone, who drew the No. 9 post position in the 10-horse field, was second in the Derby, losing to Mystik Dan by a nose. Trainer Chad Brown hopes to get a similar run out of the horse this time, with a jockey change to Flavien Prat.\n\n\"He bounced out of the Derby, which can obviously be a tough race on horses,\" Brown said. \"He's bounced out well. ... He's trained really good here. Just hoping for a good trip. Obviously, we have half as many horses to run down, so that should be hopefully a little easier on him.\"\n\nBrown has had success with Prat onboard.\n\n\"Hopefully Flavien can sort of survey the inside and just pick his spot where he wants to be in the first turn and just be prepared for him,\" Brown said. \"As long as we're prepared for him and he runs straight, he should run big.\"\n\nTrainer Todd Pletcher is saddling the most horses in the 1 1/4-mile race at Saratoga. His trio of colts is led by undefeated Mindframe, who will start from the outside No. 10 post. Mindframe's resume is short with just two starts and two wins, but it was enough to push him ahead of the Preakness and Kentucky Derby champions in the odds.\n\n\"He's a very talented colt,\" Pletcher said. \"His two races have been very impressive. ... Of course, we're giving up a lot of seasoning, a lot of experience to some really good horses, so that's the main concern.\"\n\nPletcher also has No. 5 Antiquarian (12-1) and No. 7 Protective (20-1).\n\n\"He needs to continue to move forward,\" Pletcher said. \"We think he'll appreciate the added distance: the first opportunity to run a mile and a quarter.

The Chad Brown charge was the runner-up in the photo finish Derby, losing to Mystik Dan by a nostril.\n\nHe was one of the favorites heading into the Derby. Coming off a dominant performance in which he posted a 107 Equibase speed figure at the Grade I Blue Grass Stakes in Keeneland, he's one of the most talented three-year-olds in this year's class.\n\nBrown and his connections sat him out of the Preakness with an eye on capturing their moment in the winner's circle at the Belmont.\n\nMindframe is a relative unknown compared to some of the other entries, but he's been installed as the second choice. It's a bold choice. The Todd Pletcher-trained colt has only made two starts, most recently he won an undercard race on Derby Day.\n\nThe speed figures are there for him to make a run at things, but he'll need to find the pace early. He's also facing a big step up in class and distance.\n\nMystik Dan is the third betting choice at 5-1 odds. The Derby winner has obviously proven that he can hang with the best horses in the race and has the win over Sierra Leone. It's not a stretch to believe he can do it again.\n\nTrainer Ken McPeek is taking a rare risk, though. Not many horses start in all three legs of the Triple Crown without a chance to win it. Orb was the last horse to do it in 2013. There's a reason for that. The turnaround for each subsequent leg is progressively difficult. It would be understandable if we don't see the best version of the colt at Saratoga.\n\nSeize the Grey rounds out the horses with single-digit odds. Coming off an impressive win at the Preakness, his connections will hope to ride that momentum into a share of the $2 million purse.\n\nHe has a few things working against him, though. For one there's a little more speed in this field than the one he saw at the Preakness. That enabled him to set a relatively slow pace early and hold off all competitors down the stretch.\n\nAs far as long shots go, Anitquarian is worth a look. He's one of three entries from Todd Pletcher in the race. Mindframe will get most of the attention out of the trio, but Antiquarian was impressive in a win at the Peter Pan Stakes and he outran fellow Belmont entrant The Wine Steward down the stretch.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_ballentine@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Alex Ballentine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Grass_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blue Grass Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graded stakes race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeneland", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keeneland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Pletcher", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Todd Pletcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orb_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orb (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peter Pan Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Flexibility", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Flexibility", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1717469047/adricx2lqjctaacrqwwg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623848", "eventUri": "eng-9623848", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Preakness winner Seize the Grey drew post position No. 1 on Monday, and Kentucky Derby champion Mystik Dan will start in post No. 3 for the Belmont Stakes taking place Saturday at Saratoga Race Course.\n\nKenny McPeek-trained Mystik Dan, who finished second in the Preakness, is the only horse in the field for all three Triple Crown races. At 5-1 and being ridden again by Brian Hernandez Jr., he is the third choice behind favorite Sierra Leone, who opened at 9-5, and Mindframe at 7-2.\n\nMcPeek favored his inside post position, and Mystik Dan co-owner Lance Gasaway had his eye on the No. 3 post.\n\n\"Lance Gasaway sent me a message this morning, 'Go there and get post No. 3,'\" McPeek said. \"He said it's his lucky number, I guess. We're thrilled with that. I think that was great. It's out of our control now. It's up to Brian.\"\n\nHall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas' Seize the Grey is right behind Mystik Dan with 8-1 odds after a wire-to-wire win in the second leg of the Triple Crown.\n\nSierra Leone, who drew the No. 9 post position in the 10-horse field, was second in the Derby, losing to Mystik Dan by a nose. Trainer Chad Brown hopes to get a similar run out of the horse this time, with a jockey change to Flavien Prat.\n\n\"He bounced out of the Derby, which can obviously be a tough race on horses,\" Brown said. \"He's bounced out well. ... He's trained really good here. Just hoping for a good trip. Obviously, we have half as many horses to run down, so that should be hopefully a little easier on him.\"\n\nBrown has had success with Prat onboard.\n\n\"Hopefully Flavien can sort of survey the inside and just pick his spot where he wants to be in the first turn and just be prepared for him,\" Brown said. \"As long as we're prepared for him and he runs straight, he should run big.\"\n\nTrainer Todd Pletcher is saddling the most horses in the 1 1/4-mile race at Saratoga. His trio of colts is led by undefeated Mindframe, who will start from the outside No. 10 post. Mindframe's resume is short with just two starts and two wins, but it was enough to push him ahead of the Preakness and Kentucky Derby champions in the odds.\n\n\"He's a very talented colt,\" Pletcher said. \"His two races have been very impressive. ... Of course, we're giving up a lot of seasoning, a lot of experience to some really good horses, so that's the main concern.\"\n\nPletcher also has No. 5 Antiquarian (12-1) and No. 7 Protective (20-1).\n\n\"He needs to continue to move forward,\" Pletcher said. \"We think he'll appreciate the added distance: the first opportunity to run a mile and a quarter. He shows up, he tries hard every time.\"\n\nAP horse racing: https://apnews.com/hub/horse-racing", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eagle-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@eagletribune.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Springs,_New_York", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Springs, New York"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisville, Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavien_Prat", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Flavien Prat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "D.

There won't be a sweep of the Triple Crown but there will be intrigue with Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan and Preakness winner Seize the Gray meeting in their rubber match.\n\nBut bettors seem to be looking elsewhere. Sierra Leone opened as the morning line favorite at 9-5 odds while Todd Pletcher-trained Mindframe was the second choice at 7-2.\n\nCoverage of Belmont Stakes Day begins on FS1 Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., with FOX picking up the coverage until 7 p.m., before it returns to FS2 until 8:10 p.m.\n\nMore: Behind-the-scenes changes at Monmouth Park come at critical time for NJ horse racing\n\nHere are some opinions on which horses will be the top finishers:\n\nBelmont Stakes field (betting number, horse, trainer, jockey, odds)\n\nKen Jordan, five times among top finishers at NTRA/National Horseplayers Championship, four Top 10s at Horseplayers World Series\n\n6. Dornoch - Resented being rated in Blue Grass and may have had the worsttrip of all in the Kentucky Derby. The thinking here is that he willattend the pace set by Seize the Grey and Mindframe, then show somefinish in the stretch. Slight edge over second choice.\n\n2. Resilience - Rallied wide into the hot Derby pace, set up for a top performance by Bill Mott\n\n9. Sierra Leone - When a barn known for being meticulous says a new bit is the answer after five races, be skeptical at the windows.\n\n3. Mystik Dan - Derby hero may not get a setup where he can duplicate that powerful rain run.\n\nSwift Hitter, New Jerseyan and horse racing commentator with 14,000 followers on X.\n\n9. Sierra Leone - Most talented horse in race. Chad Brown changed bits and that will help horse run a straight path. Fully expect a solid enough pace. Strictly the horse to beat. If 8/5 odds, consider it a gift.\n\n3. Mystik Dan - Derby winner and runner up in Preakness, will have to settle for second as Sierra Leone is fresh and waiting for 'em.\n\n6. Dornoch - Longshot play to round out trifecta. If left alone on lead, can be dangerous\n\nSean Nolan, 17-time National Handicapping Championship qualifier with four top 20 finishes, including a second place\n\n2. Resilience - Close to the fast pace in the Derby and had to navigate some traffic on the turn. Figures to move forward off that race. Mott, who is usually conservative, sees fit to enter hinting that this Into Mischief colt is sitting on go.\n\n9. Sierra Leone - Will make his patented late run but may find enough traffic to keep from the winners' circle. The change of equipment to the cage bit indicates Brown still doesn't have this horse figured out and thus lowers the confidence to back him on the front end.\n\n3. Mystik Dan - The most consistent of this bunch based on his last three races. Must be included in the trifecta.\n\n5. Antiquarian - Continues to develop, and Johnny V. knows him. His relatively high purchase price ($250K) for a modestly bred horse indicates the potential to be a good one. Will run from the second pack just behindthe speed (Mindframe, Seize the Grey) and make work out a dream trip.\n\nSteven Falk, Asbury Park Press sportswriter\n\n9. Sierra Leone - The best closer in the race is two noses away from being unbeaten and should get enough pace to run into. If he can avoid lugging in severely - a habit which cost him in both his defeats and should have gotten him disqualified to third in the Kentucky Derby - he should run them down late and give trainer Chad Brown his first Belmont winner.\n\n2. Resilience - He ran a sneaky good race in the Derby, when he finished sixth. Despite racing wide the whole way after breaking from the No. 18 post and making an early move into a pace that collapsed, he was in contention at the top of stretch before tiring. He could get a nice trip just off the pace here.\n\n10. Mindframe - The Todd Pletcher-trainee may be the most talented horse in the race. He's won his first two starts by a combined 21 1/4 lengths and the 103 Beyer Speed Figure he recorded in his debut is the highest Beyer in the field. Mindframe outworked Kentucky Derby favorite and Breeders' Cup Juvenile champion Fierceness two weeks ago. Fierceness is now being pointed to the Haskell Stakes July 20 at Monmouth Park, along with the Bob Baffert-trained Muth. This is a major step up in class, though, for Mindframe.\n\n8. Honor Marie - He was one of the wise guy horses going into the Derby, and then never had a chance with a nightmare trip. It was probably the worst trip any of the 20 horses in the race had. He also could get enough pace to run into and gets a significant rider change due to injury to Florent Geroux.\n\nGreg Giombarrese, Director of Communications, Jersey Shore BlueClaws\n\n9. Sierra Leone - The Kentucky Derby runner-up (though he should have been disqualified to third) always fires no matter the race and no matter the pace. His race in the Risen Star was arguably the best prep race performance by anyone and he certainly ran well in the Derby. He'll be coming late and should excel at the distance.\n\n8. Honor Marie - He lost his chance in the Derby two seconds after the gate opened. He was pin-balled around at the start and jostled for the first furlong. He was then stuck in behind horses into the lane and had to shift way out in the last 3/16ths. He was the wise-guy horse going into the Derby, and may well produce his best in this race at a very square price.\n\n2. Resilience - He ran a sneaky-good race in the Derby. First, being drawn in post 18 did him no favors. He then was hung wide the whole way and made a very early move into a very fast pace before understandably tiring late. He should be able to sit closer to the pace here and save ground. He could impact things at a price.\n\n3. Mystik Dan - The Derby winner has run quite well in the first two Triple Crown races and he projects to get another very good trip from just off the pace. We will see if he can bring his \"A\" game for the third time in five weeks.\n\nBob Jordan, Asbury Park Press sports editor\n\n2. Resilience - This one from Mott is on a cycle upswing and can get the right trip.\n\n4. The Wine Steward - Extra value with this one - Saez is jumping off to stick with Dornoch, leaving this ride vacant until a couple of days ago when Manny Franco got the call.\n\n10. Mindframe - Talented but moving from nw1x to winning the Test of Champions? Not that good but will have a big say.\n\n6. Dornoch - Logical to include in exotics.\n\n9.

The Tribune Content Agency\n\nJun. 4-SARATOGA SPRINGS - Those heading to the Belmont Stakes this weekend might want to take an umbrella.\n\nOr, actually, a raincoat, given umbrellas are one of dozens of items banned during the four-day event.\n\nRain showers and even thunderstorms are likely this weekend in the Spa City - where the historic third and final leg of horse racing's Triple Crown has been moved to this year and next while Belmont Park in Elmont is being renovated. The Belmont Stakes will be run Saturday at Saratoga Race Course, but the four days of racing start Thursday in the city.\n\nA slow-moving system from the west is behind the soggy weekend, Brian Frugis, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Albany, said Tuesday. The highest chance for storms will be Thursday and Friday, but the weekend wasn't looking much clearer.\n\n\"It's not the best forecast for those days,\" Frugis said, but added, \"While there still might be some showers, they'll still be kind of lighter.\"\n\nMore: What to know about the Belmont at Saratoga Race Course\n\nTrackgoers will have some relief with temperatures only reaching the mid-70s this weekend, Frugis said.

He will be on or near the lead from the start, but I feel the distance, quick fractions and increased pressure will take its toll on him late. Pretender.\n\n2. Resilience, Alvarado, 10-1\n\nHe ran a respectable sixth in the Kentucky Derby breaking from post 18. He made a strong wide-middle move to challenge for the lead approaching the stretch but faded slowly. His best chance to win a race like this would be going shorter, but he's improving. I wouldn't be surprised if he landed a piece with a perfect ride and trip. Contender.\n\n3. Mystik Dan, Hernandez, 5-1\n\nHe's been the star of the Triple Crown so far with wins in the Derby and a big second in the Preakness, getting perfect rides and trips from jockey Brian Hernandez. Trainer Ken McPeek would not run him in the Belmont if he wasn't 100 percent. He's tactical, handles the distance and has proven to be genuine. Contender.\n\n4. The Wine Steward, Franco, 15-1\n\nHe has three wins and three seconds in six starts, but all his races have come against weaker fields and shorter distances. He will be forwardly placed from the start, but figures to falter in the stretch. Pretender.\n\n5. Antiquarian, Velazquez, 12-1\n\nHe has shown steady improvement in all four starts as a 3-year-old, capped off by a determined win in a weak renewal of the Peter Pan Stakes. He will be forwardly placed from the start, but his lack of seasoning and the added distance will likely take its toll on him late. I don't envision him winning, but he can land a piece at a price. Pretender.\n\n6. Dornoch, Saez, 15-1\n\nThis speedster's fate was sealed when he drew post 1 in the Derby. He quickly shuffled back to 13th in the early going and never got involved from there. This smaller field and a better start will likely put him on the lead. He's overmatched and wants no part of 1\u00bc miles. Pretender.\n\n7. Protective, Gaffalione, 20-1\n\nThis colt has yet to win a race in four starts, even though he's put together back-to-back third-place finishes in a pair of weak-graded stakes this spring. He has too much to overcome. Pretender.\n\n8. Honor Marie, Geroux, 12-1\n\nHe experienced a ton of trouble soon after the start of the Derby and ran respectable to finish eighth. He had shown steady improvement and a strong late kick in his prior starts. He needs a lot to go his way to win the Belmont, but of the long shots in this field, it wouldn't be a shock if he made his presence felt at the finish. Contender.\n\n9. Sierra Leone, Prat, 9-5\n\nThe deserving favorite has never run a bad race in five starts, scoring three times. He's been his own worst enemy with his two defeats coming by a nose, including last time out in the Derby. This late-running, well-bred colt tends to lug in late, which has cost him dearly. Trainer Chad Brown has switched the type of bit Sierra Leone will be running with to help his rider have more control of him during the running, especially late in the race. It appears to have helped. Brown has switched riders to Flavien Prat, who fits Sierra Leone's running style well. He will be tough to deny if he brings his 'A' game to the Belmont. Contender.\n\n10. Mindframe, I. Ortiz, 7-2\n\nHe's by far the least experienced 3-year-old in the field with only three starts, but he could have the most upside. Both his starts have been blowout wins. He rated kindly in his debut and went wire-to-wire last time out. This will be his first stakes trying to stretch way out in distance against much tougher competition. He will be in a perfect striking position from the start with every chance to make his presence felt late. Trainer Todd Pletcher has won the Belmont four times. Contender.", "source": {"uri": "reviewjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Las Vegas Review-Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_(horse_racing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Handicap (horse racing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Day", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pat Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peter Pan Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavien_Prat", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Flavien Prat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Pletcher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Todd Pletcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.reviewjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/19253676_web1_Belmont-Stakes-Horse-Racing-1-.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623848", "eventUri": "eng-9623848", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- The Belmont Stakes is the final test of the Triple Crown -- the third resume booster to edge a horse into the history books. It's not an easy feat.\n\nThe third leg is the longest of the three races at 1\u00bd miles and requires a horse with endurance to handle it. There have been 36 Triple Crown-eligible horses heading into the Belmont, and only 13 have secured the third jewel.\n\nThis year, with it happening at Saratoga Race Course instead of Belmont Park, the shape of the track makes it implausible to run it at 1\u00bd miles, so it's being shortened to 1\u00bc miles -- the same distance as the Kentucky Derby. It's a change but not one that retired jockey and Fox Sports racing analyst Richard Migliore believes deserves an asterisk for the winner.\n\n\"It takes nothing away from the event whatsoever,\" Migliore said. \"It's an American classic race that's tough to win. Winning races at the Grade I level, at any distance, whether it's 5 furlongs or 2 miles, is extremely tough.\"\n\nChanging the distance is nothing new for the Belmont, which has been run at various lengths since the first edition in 1867. Going 1\u00bd miles has been a mainstay since 1927, though it was shortened to 1\u215b miles in 2020 when it led off the out-of-order Triple Crown because of the pandemic.\n\nThis year, it's just a quarter-of-a-mile change, but it has been a major factor in the horses' entry for the stakes.\n\nDerby winner Mystik Dan is set to run in the Belmont, but trainer Kenny McPeek said he probably would not have run him at the traditional distance.\n\n\"I'd rather it be a mile and a quarter than a mile and a half,\" McPeek said. \"I could see not taking him down to Belmont and running him at a mile and a half.\"\n\nThe 9-5 opening favorite Sierra Leone was a nose behind Mystik Dan in the Kentucky Derby. Trainer Chad Brown was unsure about the regular distance, but once it was announced it'd be shorter, he entered the horse.\n\n\"It made a decision very easy,\" Brown said. \"It looks like he has unbelievable stamina. But it still doesn't necessarily mean I think he's a mile-and-a-half horse. ... Much more appealing at the mile-and-a-quarter distance.\"\n\nThe shorter distance is not appealing for all trainers. Todd Pletcher, who has won the Belmont four times, would've preferred the normal distance. Pletcher has three entries in the 10-horse field, including 7-2 second choice Mindframe.\n\n\"We'd probably have two more in it,\" Pletcher said. \"I miss the mile-and-a-half part of it. Part of it is selfish because I've had success at that distance. I do appreciate that it is the real test in a mile and a half.

(AP) -- The Belmont Stakes is the final test of the Triple Crown -- the third resume booster to edge a horse into the history books. It's not an easy feat.\n\nThe third leg is the longest of the three races at 1\u00bd miles and requires a horse with endurance to handle it. There have been 36 Triple Crown-eligible horses heading into the Belmont, and only 13 have secured the third jewel.\n\nThis year, with it happening at Saratoga Race Course instead of Belmont Park, the shape of the track makes it implausible to run it at 1\u00bd miles, so it's being shortened to 1\u00bc miles -- the same distance as the Kentucky Derby. It's a change but not one that retired jockey and Fox Sports racing analyst Richard Migliore believes deserves an asterisk for the winner.\n\n\"It takes nothing away from the event whatsoever,\" Migliore said. \"It's an American classic race that's tough to win. Winning races at the Grade I level, at any distance, whether it's 5 furlongs or 2 miles, is extremely tough.\"\n\nChanging the distance is nothing new for the Belmont, which has been run at various lengths since the first edition in 1867. Going 1\u00bd miles has been a mainstay since 1927, though it was shortened to 1\u215b miles in 2020 when it led off the out-of-order Triple Crown because of the pandemic.\n\nThis year, it's just a quarter-of-a-mile change, but it has been a major factor in the horses' entry for the stakes.\n\nDerby winner Mystik Dan is set to run in the Belmont, but trainer Kenny McPeek said he probably would not have run him at the traditional distance.\n\n\"I'd rather it be a mile and a quarter than a mile and a half,\" McPeek said. \"I could see not taking him down to Belmont and running him at a mile and a half.\"\n\nThe 9-5 opening favorite Sierra Leone was a nose behind Mystik Dan in the Kentucky Derby. Trainer Chad Brown was unsure about the regular distance, but once it was announced it'd be shorter, he entered the horse.\n\n\"It made a decision very easy,\" Brown said. \"It looks like he has unbelievable stamina. But it still doesn't necessarily mean I think he's a mile-and-a-half horse. ... Much more appealing at the mile-and-a-quarter distance.\"\n\nThe shorter distance is not appealing for all trainers. Todd Pletcher, who has won the Belmont four times, would've preferred the normal distance. Pletcher has three entries in the 10-horse field, including 7-2 second choice Mindframe.\n\n\"We'd probably have two more in it,\" Pletcher said. \"I miss the mile-and-a-half part of it. Part of it is selfish because I've had success at that distance. I do appreciate that it is the real test in a mile and a half. But how could you not embrace having a great race at Saratoga.\"\n\nThe distance change is temporary for the next two years before the race is set to return to remade Belmont Park in 2026, following $455 million in renovations. It is then expected to go back to being the 1\u00bd-mile \"test of the champion\" that it has been known as for nearly a century.\n\n\"In a perfect world, yes, I would like to see it a mile and a half,\" Migliore said. \"I don't think it distracts from the race itself being shortened up.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Pass Catcher, 1971\n\nPass Catcher denied Canonero II from winning the Triple Crown when he cashed tickets as a 34-1 long shot. United States Racing Hall of Fame jockey Walter Blum rode Pass Catcher to the upset victory in front of one of the largest Belmont Stakes crowds of the 20th century. More than 80,000 people were in attendance to cheer on Canonero II, the Venezuelan colt who had won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes.\n\n4. Birdstone, 2004\n\nBirdstone ended Smarty Jones' bid to become the first Triple Crown winner in 26 years in dramatic fashion, surging past the heavy favorite in the final stretch to win the Belmont Stakes as a 36-1 long shot.\n\nThe crowd was stunned.\n\n\"We came to see a coronation and instead we got a sporting event,\" said John Hendrickson, the husband of Birdstone owner Marylou Whitney. \"I've never seen a crowd of 120,000 people where it went from roaring to dead silence.\"\n\nWhitney apologized for spoiling Smarty Jones' Triple Crown bid in the winner's circle.\n\n\"I'm sorry, sorry, sorry Smarty Jones couldn't win,\" she said.\n\n3. Temperence Hill, 1980\n\nTemperence Hill won the 1980 Belmont Stakes at 53-1 odds, surging past Kentucky Derby winner Genuine Risk in the stretch to win by two lengths. The horse paid $108.80, $32.80 and $15.20.\n\n2. Sherluck, 1961\n\nSherluck denied favorite Carry Back the Triple Crown with a stunning win at 65-1 odds. Sherluck had only won once in his 10 starts that year going into the race.\n\n1. Sarava, 2002\n\nSarava denied War Emblem the Triple Crown in 2002 while rewarding bettors who backed him at 70-1 odds.\n\nWar Emblem stumbled out of the gate. That paved the way for Sarava, who beat Medaglia d'Oro by a half length, to become the longest-priced winner in Belmont Stakes history.\n\nSarava trainer Ken McPeek was as shocked as anybody by the upset. He said after the race he had made only a small $10 win-place wager on his horse.

Once we start putting it up, we'll probably have a better perception. Everything is pretty much in sequence. The building comes down. You're basically filling in the basement and then you're staging. There's no period of stoppage. We've got two years of a lot of work.\"\n\nThe cavernous, 1.25 million square-foot grandstand will be replaced by a state-of-the art facility that will be roughly 275,000 square feet. In turn, the amount of open space for fans around the track will increase from six acres to 35.\n\nBut O'Rourke added work on the four racetracks - itself a $100 million project - is ahead of schedule. He anticipated the new, all-weather track would be available for training in the spring.\n\n\"In some ways, it's two different projects,\" O'Rourke said. \"The tracks themselves will be down ahead of schedule, ahead of the building. We'll be able to train and operate on the surfaces well ahead of the completion of the grandstand.\"\n\nIn the meantime, seeing the Belmont grandstand being torn down is somewhat jarring to those who have spent long periods of time there.\n\n\"It's great that they're taking on this project and I look forward to seeing what the new one looks like,\" said trainer Todd Pletcher, who has three horses in the Belmont. \"But when you see it coming down, it's kind of sad to see as well.\"\n\nChad Brown, the trainer of Belmont morning-line favorite Sierra Leone, the Kentucky Derby runner-up, agreed it's \"hard to see\" the partially deconstructed Belmont grandstand. Brown spent some of the formative years of his career working at Hollywood Park in Los Angeles, which closed in 2013 and was ultimately torn down.\n\n\"At least this racetrack versus Hollywood is going to be rebuilt better than ever,\" Brown said. \"For the vision of racing at NYRA and in New York and for our sustainability and survival, to maintain our position as a major league sport, we have to upgrade the facility. Everyone is going to have to just move forward with a positive attitude.\n\n\"It's a trend across all sports. New stadiums, modern amenities and horse racing is on board with that.\"\n\nO'Rourke said one objective of the Belmont reconstruction project is to partner with the Islanders - specifically working with John Collins, the organization's operating partner and head of its business operations - to use the property for \"community benefit.\"\n\nThat includes events at The Park at UBS Arena such as Saturday's free-of-charge Belmont Stakes watch party starting at 1 p.m. Tickets are not required but those planning to attend should RSVP through the Islanders' website.\n\nNotes & quotes: Kentucky Derby winner Mystik Dan took a practice gallop on Saratoga's main track on Tuesday. \"It was good,\" trainer Kenny McPeek said. \"Got him a little spin over there and we might take him back over there Thursday. Some people came by and spoiled him with some peppermints.

Seize the Grey, Torres, 8-1\n\nHis 2,570 owners had a May to remember, scoring back-to-back wins in the Pat Day Mile and the Preakness. He will be on or near the lead from the start, but the distance, quick fractions and increased pressure will take their toll on him late. Pretender.\n\n2. Resilience, Alvarado, 10-1\n\nHe ran a respectable sixth in the Kentucky Derby breaking from post 18. He made a strong wide-middle move to challenge for the lead approaching the stretch but faded slowly. His best chance to win a race like this would be going shorter, but he's improving. I wouldn't be surprised if he landed a piece with a perfect ride and trip. Contender.\n\n3. Mystik Dan, Hernandez, 5-1\n\nHe's been the star of the Triple Crown so far with wins in the Derby and a big second in the Preakness, getting perfect rides and trips from jockey Brian Hernandez. Trainer Ken McPeek would not run him in the Belmont if he wasn't 100%. He's tactical, handles the distance and has proven to be genuine. Contender.\n\n4. The Wine Steward, Franco, 15-1\n\nHe has three wins and three seconds in six starts, but all his races have come against weaker fields and shorter distances. He will be forwardly placed from the start, but figures to falter in the stretch. Pretender.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n5. Antiquarian, Velazquez, 12-1\n\nHe has shown steady improvement in all four starts as a 3-year-old, capped off by a determined win in a weak renewal of the Peter Pan Stakes. He will be forwardly placed from the start, but his lack of seasoning and the added distance will likely take its toll on him late. I don't envision him winning, but he can land a piece at a price. Pretender.\n\n6. Dornoch, Saez, 15-1\n\nThis speedster's fate was sealed when he drew post 1 in the Derby. He quickly shuffled back to 13th in the early going and never got involved from there. This smaller field and a better start will likely put him on the lead. He's overmatched and wants no part of 1 1/4 miles. Pretender.\n\n7. Protective, Gaffalione, 20-1\n\nThis colt has yet to win a race in four starts, even though he's put together back-to-back third-place finishes in a pair of weak-graded stakes this spring. He has too much to overcome. Pretender.\n\n8. Honor Marie, Geroux, 12-1\n\nHe experienced a ton of trouble soon after the start of the Derby and ran respectable to finish eighth. He had shown steady improvement and a strong late kick in his prior starts. He needs a lot to go his way to win the Belmont, but of the long shots in this field, it wouldn't be a shock if he made his presence felt at the finish. Contender.\n\n9. Sierra Leone, Prat, 9-5\n\nThe deserving favorite has never run a bad race in five starts, scoring three times. He's been his own worst enemy with his two defeats coming by a nose, including last time out in the Derby. This late-running, well-bred colt tends to lug in late, which has cost him dearly. Trainer Chad Brown has switched the type of bit Sierra Leone will be running with to help his rider have more control of him during the running, especially late in the race. It appears to have helped. Brown has switched riders to Flavien Prat, who fits Sierra Leone's running style well. He will be tough to deny if he brings his \"A\" game to the Belmont. Contender.\n\n10. Mindframe, I. Ortiz, 7-2\n\nHe's by far the least experienced 3-year-old in the field, but both his starts have been blowout wins. He rated kindly in his debut and went wire-to-wire last time out. This will be his first stakes trying to stretch way out in distance against much tougher competition.

Yet there's one item he could not have anticipated 17 years ago that now owns a prime spot on his to-do list.\n\nWith last year's announcement that Belmont Park would be closed until the track is rebuilt and reopened in 2026 at the earliest, all of a sudden an impossible dream became possible\n\nGrowing up not far from Saratoga in Mechanicville, N.Y., Brown would covet winning the historic first Belmont Stakes (G1) at the Spa in front of locally based family and friends.\n\nAnd in 9-5 morning-line favorite Sierra Leone , he just might have the $2.3 million 3-year-old who can make his dreams come true.\n\nSign up for BloodHorse Daily\n\n\"It's exciting for me and everyone with my team and family. We're personally involved in the community here in Saratoga, being a resident up here. It's an interesting experiment having the Belmont up here,\" Brown said. \"To win the first Belmont at Saratoga not far away from where I grew up, it would be a real special moment for me and my family and team. We have a base of operations here and we always focus on the Saratoga meet. Potentially it would be a great moment but it will be a challenging race. There are some good horses in this race. Yet It will be very special to get our first Belmont win in Saratoga, given all the time we spend here.\"\n\nSuccess at Saratoga has been a main cog of Brown's stable as he has won or shared six of the last seven trainer's titles at the Spa and captured seven titles overall.\n\nTuscan Gold to get time off\n\nThough Tuscan Gold was considered a possible starter in the Belmont Stakes, Brown said the son of Medaglia d'Oro did not train well leading up to the race and was not entered.\n\nHe added Tuscan Gold would receive a thorough medical check before any future plans would be discussed.\n\nThird in the Louisiana Derby (G2) and fourth in the Preakness Stakes (G1), Tuscan Gold is owned by William Larence, Walmac Farm, and Stonestreet Stables.", "source": {"uri": "bloodhorse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blood Horse Interactive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_ehalt@bloodhorse.com", "name": "Bob Ehalt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eclipse Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeders'_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breeders' Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medaglia_d'Oro_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medaglia d'Oro (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jess_Stonestreet_Jackson_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jess Stonestreet Jackson Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal_Watercraft_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Personal Watercraft Racing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://cdn-images.bloodhorse.com/i/bloodhorse-images/2024/05/14b714812e5b43b2a29889db66d1ef11.jpg?preset=facebook", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623848", "eventUri": "eng-9623848", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

With the racing festival officially kicking off Thursday, that wait is almost over.\n\n\"This is one of the most anticipated sporting events in upstate New York history, to be held in front of racing's most passionate and knowledgeable fans here at the sport's most important and revered venue,\" NYRA Vice President of Communications Pat McKenna said. \"That's a winning combination and as far as NYRA is concerned, we thank this community for welcoming this event so enthusiastically, not just recently, but really since it was officially announced in December.\"\n\nThe four-day racing festival will include 23 stakes races with purses totaling $9.7 million, the highest purse levels and number of stakes offered since the launch of the multi-day Belmont Stakes Racing Festival in 2014. The event will be highlighted by the 156th edition of the Belmont Stakes, which will run on Saturday as the 12th race with a post time of 6:41 p.m.\n\nGate opening times vary each day, Thursday at 11 a.m., Friday at 10:30 a.m., Belmont Stakes Saturday at 9 a.m., and Sunday at 11 a.m. Gates will also open for early morning access on Thursday and Sunday at 7 a.m. to watch training - with the ground being cleared at 10 a.m. Picnic tables are unavailable for claiming during early morning access on Thursday or Sunday.\n\nAfter the official gate opens, no re-entry is permitted throughout the four-day festival.\n\nThe Belmont Racing Festival will be cashless for a variety of purchases, including food & beverage service, admissions, and parking. Credit and debit cards will be accepted for purchases. Also, deviating from the typical practice of the annual 40-day meet, no outside alcoholic beverages can be brought into the venue, including in coolers. However, coolers full of food and drinks, as long as they're non-alcoholic, can still be brought in. Coolers larger than 12'' x 18'' will not be allowed.\n\nOne folding chair is allowed per guest, but pop-up tents, folding tables of any kind, and wagons will not be permitted inside the gates. Other prohibited items include air horns, weapons, confetti, fireworks, and illegal drugs or substances. A full list of permitted and banned items is available on Belmont's security page.\n\nNYRA's website provides helpful links for more information regarding the racing festival, including where to purchase parking online, grounds map, suggestions on what to wear, and more. Visit the Belmont webpage for more information.\n\nWith the scope of the Belmont Stakes in mind, some larger-than-life entertainment will accompany the world-class racing at the Saratoga Race Course - one of the biggest being Tony Award-winning actress, singer/songwriter, producer, and author Idina Menzel will perform the celebrated theme song \"New York, New York\" just before the Post Parade on Belmont Stake Day.\n\nOther performances on Saturday include Sergeant Major MaryKay Messenger, lead vocalist for the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, who will sing \"God Bless America\" at 10:30 a.m. and the National Anthem later in the afternoon, Tom Nitti, a popular Country singer and former contestant on NBC's \"The Voice,\" who will perform live from the Purdy's Summer Music Stage beginning at 11 a.m., jump scheduled for approximately 1:30 p.m. by professional skydivers from the veteran-owned-and-operated Patriot Parachute Team.\n\n\"The Belmont Stakes is a different event in size and scope,\" McKenna said regarding the entertainment. \"This is a reflection of that in what we ordinarily see downstate, and to be able to bring that here, in terms of outside entertainment, is an integral part of this festival.\"\n\nSaturday isn't the only day chalked full of entertainment, Thursday will feature the Mendelssohn Club of Albany, which will perform the National Anthem and a medley of Broadway selections including \"Oklahoma,\" \"Hey Look Me Over,\" \"Good Night Sweetheart\" and \"Fugue for Tinhorns,\" Friday will feature Opera Saratoga who will sing the National Anthem and two horse racing themed selections from the Broadway hit show \"Guys and Dolls\" and Sunday will feature The Racing City Chorus who will sing the national anthem \"Blue Skies,\" \"Wonderful Day Medley,\" \"It's Only a Paper Moon\" and \"Top of the World.\"\n\nThe Purdy's Summer Music Stage will feature live music throughout the four-day festival, including the Garland Nelson Band on Thursday, IMI on Friday, Tom Nitti followed by ILL Funk on Belmont Stakes Day and Alex Torres & His Latin Orchestra on Sunday.\n\nIn honor of the Belmont Stakes, the Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) will provide a trolley service for the community and visitors to \"ensure attendees can focus on the fun and festivities\" throughout the week. Running from noon to 10 p.m., Thursday through Sunday, the Trolley is free for customers, courtesy of NYRA Bets and the Saratoga Casino Hotel, and will stop at service, hotels, and attractions along Broadway, with direct access to the Saratoga Race Course and the Saratoga Casino Hotel.\n\nCDTA will also provide a shuttle service for the \"Belmont on Broadway - Blues Traveler\" concert on Wednesday, June 5. Services will run from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. from two park-and-ride locations - one between the Route 50 lot at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center and the bus stop on Broadway at Congress Park and a second shuttle from the Wilton Mall bus stop and the corner of High Rock and Lake Avenues. Shuttles will run every 20 minutes, depending on traffic.\n\nFor more information about CDTA services and the trolley schedule, please visit https://www.cdta.org.\n\nThe four-day racing festival is estimated to have a $50 million economic impact on the area, according to the President of the Saratoga County Chamber via a study conducted on the attendance at the Saratoga Race Course during the typical 40-day meet.\n\nTo kick off the racing festival, a free Belmont on Broadway concert is being held in the heart of downtown Saratoga. Featuring headliner Blues Traveler, the concert will be held from 6 to 10 p.m. on Wednesday, closing down Broadway between Van Dam Street and Lake Avenue from approximately 5 a.m. on Wednesday, June 5 to 2 a.m. on Thursday, June 6.\n\nOther groups performing at the concert include Tops of Trees and The Pat McGee Band. According to Discover Saratoga's website, the purpose of the concert is to \"attract people to the area for the entire first week of June, for this summer, for next year's Belmont Stakes, and for years to come, including the 250th anniversary of The Battles of Saratoga in 2027.\"\n\n\"To be able to kick off the week on Wednesday with a free concert downtown to shine a bright light on everything that makes Saratoga so special, certainly during the race meet, but now, a little bit of a different part of the year to be able to drive this level of economic activity and interest in this wonderful upstate New York community is really important to everyone here at NYRA,\" McKenna said. \"This is a place that we are fortunate to return to every summer for more than 150 years, and to be able to do something for the first time at a venue that's hosted racing since 1863, is really special - and that's not lost on anyone here.\n\n\"But most importantly, this is about providing a world-class experience for the 150,000 or so fans who will come through the gates over the course of the four days.\"\n\nSaratoga Springs Mayor John Safford shared he was \"totally confident\" in every phase of \"this unprecedented and exciting week of The Belmont at historic Saratoga Springs Race Course.\"\n\n\"It is not that Saratoga Springs has not had very successful racing festivals, as we will have during our regular racing season, but we have developed the infrastructure to take on almost any huge event and make it successful,\" Safford said. \"We are ready for the Belmont.\"\n\nAccording to McKenna, the relationship between NYRA and local leadership in the town of Saratoga Springs has never been better. Be it working collaboratively with local officials, the Chamber of Commerce, Discover Saratoga, and other organizations since the announcement has all led to this week of preparation.\n\n\"We're so fortunate to be able to show Saratoga not only to the 150,000 people who will be here over the course of the weekend but to the millions more who will be watching on FOX Sports beginning Thursday,\" McKenna said. \"They (local leaders) clearly understand and appreciate the impact that this place has, not only on Saratoga Springs, the entire county, and really the entire Capital Region.\"\n\nNYRA and the Saratoga Community as a whole are excited to welcome the Belmont Racing Festival and all that it brings to the area for a weekend that the city, its residents, and all who attend will not forget for a very, very long time.", "source": {"uri": "oneidadispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oneida Dispatch"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Ebbert and Antonucci vaulted into the public eye, Antonucci in particular, having entered the record books as the first female trainer to win a Triple Crown race.\n\nA year removed from that historic Belmont, with Arcangelo retired to stud at Lane's End Farm after a championship campaign that also included a victory in the Travers Stakes (G1) at Saratoga Race Course, life has changed for Antonucci and Ebbert, notably without such a star racehorse in their midst. His absence notwithstanding, Antonucci has seen her stable expand in better-bred runners and with an active division at Churchill Downs in 2024, while Ebbert's horse involvement has moved more into the breeding side of the sport.\n\nStill owning what he said was \"a good portion\" of Arcangelo, he has supported his young stallion with five mares he acquired late last year that are now in foal to him. Besides that quintet, he owns two other mares, plus three unraced 2-year-olds with Antonucci in Ocala, Fla., and an unraced 3-year-old by Hard Spun out of the stakes-winning, graded-placed Jump Star mare Maude S that just joined Antonucci's Saratoga barn.\n\n\"I'm looking for that magical name,\" Ebbert said.\n\nSign up for BloodHorse Daily\n\nThe Pennsylvania resident is hoping for a repeat of a little of last year's magic. In 2023, he and Antonucci soared to the heights of the sport with their star 3-year-old, whom Ebbert had bought for a mere $35,000 at the 2021 September Yearling Sale at Keeneland.\n\nA fairytale ending was not to be in the fall, when a physical setback forced him to miss the Breeders' Cup Classic (G1) at Santa Anita Park. He would later undergo successful surgery for a left hind leg fracture before joining the stallion lineup at Lane's End.\n\n\"We did have that little downer at the end of the year,\" Ebbert said. \"But that's the sport. You can't win 'em all.\"\n\nWhile Ebbert's Blue Rose Farm has not been represented by a starter since Arcangelo in the Travers last year, Antonucci has remained active. This week, she has six horses entered through June 9 at Gulfstream Park, four during the four-day Belmont Stakes Festival at Saratoga, and another two at Churchill Downs.\n\nWhatintheliteral , to be ridden by Arcangelo's regular jockey, Javier Castellano, is a starter for her in the June 6 Astoria Stakes at Saratoga.\n\nThough she is reluctant to discuss the number of horses she trains -- \"I'm always super careful with (that) because we don't wanna be horse managers,\" she said -- Antonucci plans to run more horses in Upstate New York this summer.\n\n\"I think we have better quality that will fit into the program better up here,\" she said by telephone from Saratoga. \"(Last year) I think we had probably a heavier program down south, looking for the right company for those kiddos. So, with having 2-year-olds maybe coming out of the sales sooner and some of those kinds of things, we brought up more this year to compete at Saratoga.\"\n\nShe knows that bloodlines do not always translate into success, saying, \"The great thing about horses is that they can't read their pedigree.\"\n\n\"On paper, we have some horses that are supposed to go be nice kids,\" she added. \"So we'll give them their space to tell their story. Yeah, for sure, definitely there's a pedigree quality. That's an increase, and now we just need them to show the same determination and grit that they're supposed to have on paper on the racetrack.\"\n\nArcangelo had that in spades, winning four of six starts and more than $1.7 million. In addition to the Belmont and Travers, he won the Peter Pan Stakes (G3) at Belmont Park and a maiden race at Gulfstream -- all in his final four starts as a 3-year-old.\n\nAs memorable as the Travers was -- his defeat of Forte, Preakness Stakes (G1) winner National Treasure , and Kentucky Derby (G1) winner Mage and others essentially clinched an Eclipse Award -- Ebbert said the Belmont was \"probably the most amazing part\" of the campaign. It came just three days before his 40th birthday.\n\n\"A lot of people don't even know who I was in the business probably before that race. I'm just a little guy in the business,\" he said. \"It kind of changed everything.\"\n\nFor Ebbert and Antonucci, Arcangelo may no longer be in the barn but he is not out of their thoughts or lives. Both have visited him at Lane's End Farm in Central Kentucky.\n\n\"I told him (previously) if he ran good, he'd get to have that job,\" Antonucci said of stud duty. \"So at least I got to keep my word on that.\"\n\nArcangelo is a son of Arrogate, whose early death at age 7 in 2020 from an apparent neurological illness robbed the breeding industry of one of its most exciting young stallions. Arrogate sons such as Arcangelo and ultimately 2024 Preakness winner Seize the Grey, who races in Saturday's Belmont Stakes, can continue his bloodline at stud, Seize the Grey upon his eventual retirement.\n\nEbbert reports Arcangelo's book of scheduled coverings of mares is full and his fertility rate high.\n\n\"I have seen him a couple of times, so it's always fun to go visit,\" Antonucci said. \"I actually brought his groom (Jovani Flores) with me to see him when we were racing at Keeneland and that was just really cool to watch and see, just knowing the horse knows who he is, and just watching that connection was really sweet.\"\n\nEbbert savors his journey with Arcangelo, which has not ended for him.\n\n\"Now being able to buy mares and breed them to your stallion you raced,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward to next year for the babies. I mean, it's just all perfect, just an amazing experience.\"", "source": {"uri": "bloodhorse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blood Horse Interactive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "byron_king@bloodhorse.com", "name": "Byron King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Group One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Churchill_Downs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Churchill Downs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane's_End_Farm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lane's End Farm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travers_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travers Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse length"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stallion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stallion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_breeding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse breeding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocala,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ocala, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ocala, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Astoria Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_Spun", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hard Spun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Castellano", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Javier Castellano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeders'_Cup_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breeders' Cup Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Anita_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Santa Anita Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yearling_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yearling (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Breeds", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western_Performance", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Western Performance", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn-images.bloodhorse.com/i/bloodhorse-images/2023/06/a28204d1b739459cb304f94551565971.jpg?preset=facebook", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623848", "eventUri": "eng-9623848", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-09", "textStart": 2593, "textEnd": 2599}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 2829, "textEnd": 2835}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Post time is set for 6:41 p.m. ET, and the race will be broadcast on FOX and the FOX Sports app.\n\nFresh off his upset of Mystik Dan in the Preakness, Seize the Grey leads my field of picks in this race. But I think we are in for another memorable weekend regardless of who comes out on top.\n\nIf you are looking for a basic primer on how to bet on horses, read here. Otherwise, let's jump into my betting card and thoughts on this Saturday's race.\n\n(Disclaimer: To keep it simple, I'll lead with my picks first).\n\nHe got away with an easy lead on an off-track at Pimlico in a field that had a few also-rans, as well as Imagination who didn't show up at all. Credit to Jamie Torres and Seize the Grey for capitalizing on it and springing the upset, but these waters are much deeper with the presence of Sierra Leone, Resilience and Mindframe in addition to the Derby winner. There will be no easy leads here and, from the inside post, he's bound to take the worst of it if he goes. Call me skeptical, as the 12-point Beyer boost has me thinking this one is set to regress here. I will say, the horse has four lifetime wins, and they have come at 10-1, 9-1, 6-1 and 16-1, so clearly him being dismissed on the board hasn't impacted the results.\n\n2. Resilience (10-1)\n\nHis Beyers are light, but they are at least going in the right direction. He ran a very credible sixth in the Derby from post 18 and looked to be a threat, until trainer Bill Mott's concerns of him not really wanting a 1 1/4 proved prophetic. Mott planned on skipping the 10-furlong Belmont, but the horse has trained so well that he felt the need to run him here. As I wrote prior to the Derby, adding blinkers has done wonders for this horse -- he's been more focused mentally, and it showed in the Wood Memorial. He wasn't embarrassed at all by Sierra Leone in his first start against winners in the Risen Star and then moved forward in the Wood. If Mott sees fit to run the horse, then I am putting him on the short list of contenders that can beat Sierra Leone.\n\n3. Mystik Dan (5-1)\n\nHe didn't run poorly in the Preakness, he just couldn't get to a horse on a lone, easy lead. I'm a little surprised he's 5-1 and behind the lightly raced Mindframe on the morning line, but at the same time, I do understand the skepticism. The prevailing thought after the Derby was Sierra Leone or Forever Young were probably better horses in the race, but you still have to give Mystik Dan and Brian Hernandez credit for making their own racing luck that day. But in a shorter field, with less traffic and a bit of home-field advantage, I'd expect Sierra Leone to get the better of him on Saturday. But as he has done in every graded stakes race he's run, expect him to put in an honest effort and chance to hit the board.\n\n4. The Wine Steward (15-1)\n\nThe New York bred was a beaten favorite in the Peter Pan, won by Antiquarian who was 6-1 that day. He's a pretty nicely bred NY bred, as he's by Vino Rosso out of a To Honor and Serve mare. He'll be on or near the front here and the speed makes him dangerous, as he's been very tough to put away in his three route races. Adding the extra furlong probably doesn't help his chances to win, but I wouldn't completely toss him from the trifecta, as trainer Mike Maker has had a knack for getting horses to run big in stakes races at big prices. And if Sierra Leone does win, you'll be hoping a horse in the 15-1 range can crack the tri.\n\n5. Antiquarian (12-1)\n\nThis is the newcomer to the Triple Crown trail that I expect to take money and be that \"wise-guy\" underlay bet. The Peter Pan winner plays that role often, but I'm not sure how much it matters this year with that prep coming on a different track and this race being a different distance. You can make an argument for the horse though, as he should sit a stalking trip and wasn't disgraced in the Louisiana Derby, a race that featured Honor Marie and Tuscan Gold, and was his first try against winners. However, I'm not sure how good he really is. He can certainly hit the board, but it would take a Beyer jump of about ten points and Sierra Leone running subpar.\n\n6. Dornach (15-1)\n\nI didn't like him Derby Day and I don't like him here either. He will ensure a good pace, as he's front-end committed. As I mentioned in my Derby preview, he just hasn't improved from two to three, and I'm not sure that he even sticks around for a slice of the tri or super.\n\n7. Protective (20-1)\n\nMaiden is a well deserved long shot based on his finishes against other runners in this field. But give Mike Repole credit for running the maiden here. If he can beat two horses, he takes home $20k of prize money. He was 7-1 in the Peter Pan, a race Antiquarian was 6-1, so those two weren't viewed that differently entering the race. I'd expect Tyler Gaffalione to kind of go around the track with this one and save enough horse to try and pick off a few late. It's a 10-horse field and the all-button isn't that expensive for third place in the tri, so that's the extent of my using him.\n\n8. Honor Marie (12-1)\n\nThis is a trendy Derby price horse that predictably didn't do much running Derby Day. While this is a better spot in a shorter field, the fact he hasn't been within six lengths of Sierra Leone the two times they have faced each other makes me think he won't get the best of him on Saturday in Chad Brown's backyard. He should get a good pace to grind into and potentially hit the board.\n\n9. Sierra Leone (9-5)\n\nHe's two noses short of being unbeaten -- the first coming in a bias-aided loss to Dornoch in the Remsen last year and then in the Derby to Mystik Dan after a rough trip. He's had a knack for lugging in, so there's a change to the bit he will have for this race. He also gets a jockey switch to Flavien Prat, hinting Chad Brown wasn't too happy with the ride Tyler Gaffalione gave him in the Derby. But at the same time, maybe he could have made that equipment change for the Derby too. Between the jockey change, equipment change, rest since the Derby, move to Saratoga, projected pace and trip, it all adds up to Sierra Leone being a very tough favorite to beat. He's got all the signs of being the best three-year-old in the country and I expect him to show it on Saturday.\n\n10. Mindframe (7-2)\n\nTwo magnificent, dominant wins in two starts has him as the second choice here. Is it too much too soon? A maiden win and a win in an Optional allowance certainly isn't the same as taking on stakes winners in the Belmont. It's clear the talent is there though, and at some point you need to find out. But as a bettor, can you really take 7-2 or so on him? He'll likely be in front of Sierra Leone for a good bit of the race as he should be in the first flight of horses, but will he be able to hold him off? To make any money in exotics, you'll need to beat him for second or have him win the race. If it comes back Sierra Leone over Mindframe, you're not going to make much, if anything, so that's how I'm approaching the race.\n\nChris \"The Bear\" Fallica has covered sports for nearly three decades.

He is trained by Kenny McPeek.\n\nMystik Dan, whose home track is Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort in Hot Springs, is the third favorite at 5-1.\n\nMystik Dan ran second in the Preakness to Seize the Grey on a muddy track.\n\nSeize the Grey is the fourth favorite at 8-1 despite his powerful wire-to-wire win for the legendary trainer D. Wayne Lukas.\n\nThey are the only entries that tested both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, so the rest of the field will be more rested. But the test is of the heart and both showed a lot of that in their wins.\n\nIt is not a surprise Sierra Leone is the favorite. He made up about six lengths in the stretch at the Kentucky Derby while interfering Forever Young three times. For some reason there was no inquiry, but a big change was made.\n\nJockey Tyler Gaffalione, who struggled to control Sierra Leone much of the race, has been replaced by Flavien Prat.\n\nProbably the biggest surprise was the second favorite Mindframe at 7-2.\n\nMindframe is undefeated but has only been out twice, breaking his maiden in March at Gulfstream and winning an optional claiming race in May at Churchill Downs.\n\nHe won the races by more than 20 combined lengths.\n\nHe is well-bred with Tapit in his bloodline and was sold for $600,000.\n\nThat makes him the most expensive horse in the field of 10, but the cost of a horse guarantees nothing.\n\nIn the field are only two who were sold for less than $200,000 and both have a legitimate shot.\n\nMystik Dan was what is called a home-bred. His Arkansas owners own the mare Ma'am, who raced for them until she was injured. McPeek suggested she would make a good breeding mare. McPeek has a talent got looking at horse and seeing potential.\n\nHe was the first to notice Curlin a few years back.\n\nA $10,000 stud fee was paid to breed Ma'am to Goldencents. Other than training fees, that was the sum total the owners invested in a horse who has earning $4,141,360.\n\nHonor Marie, 12-1, was a $40,000 purchase and he also is owned by Arkansans. Honor Marie ran a strong second in the Louisiana Derby but had a rough trip in the Kentucky Derby and finished eighth.\n\nOnly one horse is not a Kentucky-bred -- The Wine Steward -- and he may be a sentimental favorite as he was born in New York. He's raced six times and has won three times and placed three times. All three of his wins were in sprints of six furlongs or less.\n\nOne to keep an eye on is Resilience if looking for a value bet. He's 10-1 in the morning line but most likely will go off at least a little higher odds.\n\nHe won the Wood Memorial but had less than an ideal race in Kentucky.\n\nFor the first time the Belmont is being run at Sarasota due to construction on the Elmont track, and it will be 1 1/4 miles instead of the usual 1 1/2 miles, which is a grueling test for still developing 3 year olds.\n\nSeize the Grey won't be unchallenged on the lead like he was in the Preakness. Mindframe and Dornoch like to be out front and The Wine Steward and Antiquarian are not afraid to challenge a slow pace.\n\nThe top three picks here are Mystik Dan, who showed tons of heart in both Triple Crown races, Sierra Leone and Honor Marie in a $.50 trifecta box. A $3 bet with lots of potential for profit.", "source": {"uri": "arkansasonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArkansasOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wally_hall@arkansasonline.com", "name": "Wally Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arkansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaklawn_Racing_Casino_Resort", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oaklawn Racing Casino Resort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D.

Residents and business owners alike are embracing the influx of visitors and the attention it brings.\n\n\"I am over the moon; it is history being made. What a boost for our town,\" said one resident.\n\nLocal business owners have noticed a surge in unfamiliar faces. \"We've been in business almost 29 years, and I recognize a lot of people in town. There are a lot of faces that I'm not recognizing,\" remarked one long-time shop owner.\n\nThe Belmont Stakes has put Saratoga on the map, with residents pridefully watching their city gain recognition. Reena McPartlom, who works in Saratoga, expressed her excitement: \"Think it's cool. I've always wanted to go to Belmont.\"\n\nCeleste Cornell, a resident for 30 years, shared a personal connection to the event: \"My husband was crazy about horseracing. We did go to the Belmont one time, and it was great. If he were alive, he would be thrilled; I can't even describe it.\"\n\nFor Ateline McDonough, an employee at D'Andrea's Pizza, the event brings back fond memories. \"We've been going to the track since we were little. One of the best things is having breakfast in the morning there to watch them warm up.\"\n\nHer sister, Kaitlin McDonough, also enjoys the local tradition: \"My favorite thing to do is grab a slice of pizza at D'Andrea's after the track. Hoping Dave Portnoy shows up with Ms. Peaches. Come to D'Andrea's Pizza.\"\n\nLocal businesses are thriving with the increased foot traffic. Gloria Griskowitz, co-owner of Putnam Market, noted the benefits: \"Generally, June tends to be quieter in Saratoga before the big rush in July, so the Belmont happening in June is a huge influx of business.\"\n\nHowever, the surge in visitors has also brought challenges, particularly with traffic. \"People coming to Saratoga should say, 'Oh, I'm going to a city; I have to be prepared to walk.' They may not find a spot right outside the business they want to got to,\" Griskowitz added.\n\nAteline McDonough noted the advantage locals have: \"We're lucky we know all the backroads and shortcuts.\"\n\nAmy Hayes, who works in Saratoga, shared her commuting strategy: \"I think we all tried to take different routes to our office. I think I'm going to Uber in and not try and look for parking like I did today.\"\n\nWith the excitement of the Belmont Stakes, Uber has become a popular choice for getting around.

With the racing festival officially kicking off Thursday, that wait is almost over.\n\nThe four-day racing festival will include 23 stakes races with purses totaling $9.7 million, the highest purse levels and number of stakes offered since the launch of the multi-day Belmont Stakes Racing Festival in 2014. The event will be highlighted by the 156th edition of the Belmont Stakes, which will run on Saturday as the 12th race with a post time of 6:41 p.m.\n\nHere are some things to know if you go:\n\nGate opening times vary each day, Thursday at 11 a.m., Friday at 10:30 a.m., Belmont Stakes Saturday at 9 a.m., and Sunday at 11 a.m. Gates will also open for early morning access on Thursday and Sunday at 7 a.m. to watch training -- with the ground being cleared at 10 a.m. Picnic tables are unavailable for claiming during early morning access on Thursday or Sunday. After the official gate opens, no re-entry is permitted throughout the four-day festival.\n\n>> Where to buy tickets to sold-out Belmont Stakes\n\nThe Belmont Racing Festival will be cashless for a variety of purchases, including food & beverage service, admissions, and parking. Credit and debit cards will be accepted for purchases.\n\nDeviating from the typical practice of the annual 40-day meet, no outside alcoholic beverages can be brought into the venue, including in coolers. However, coolers full of food and drinks, as long as they're non-alcoholic, can still be brought in. Coolers larger than 12'' x 18'' will not be allowed.\n\nOne folding chair is allowed per guest, but pop-up tents, folding tables of any kind, and wagons will not be permitted inside the gates. Other prohibited items include air horns, weapons, confetti, fireworks and illegal drugs or substances.

Visit the Belmont webpage for more information.\n\nSome larger-than-life entertainment will accompany the world-class racing at the Saratoga Race Course -- one of the biggest being Tony Award-winning actress, singer/songwriter, producer, and author Idina Menzel will perform the celebrated theme song \"New York, New York\" just before the Post Parade on Belmont Stake Day.\n\nOther performances on Saturday include Sergeant Major MaryKay Messenger, lead vocalist for the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, who will sing \"God Bless America\" at 10:30 a.m. and the National Anthem later in the afternoon, Tom Nitti, a popular Country singer and former contestant on NBC's \"The Voice,\" who will perform live from the Purdy's Summer Music Stage beginning at 11 a.m., jump scheduled for approximately 1:30 p.m. by professional skydivers from the veteran-owned-and-operated Patriot Parachute Team.\n\nSaturday isn't the only day full of entertainment, Thursday will feature the Mendelssohn Club of Albany, which will perform the National Anthem and a medley of Broadway selections including \"Oklahoma,\" \"Hey Look Me Over,\" \"Good Night Sweetheart\" and \"Fugue for Tinhorns,\" Friday will feature Opera Saratoga who will sing the National Anthem and two horse racing themed selections from the Broadway hit show \"Guys and Dolls\" and Sunday will feature The Racing City Chorus who will sing the national anthem \"Blue Skies,\" \"Wonderful Day Medley,\" \"It's Only a Paper Moon\" and \"Top of the World.\"\n\nThe Purdy's Summer Music Stage will feature live music throughout the four-day festival, including the Garland Nelson Band on Thursday, IMI on Friday, Tom Nitti followed by ILL Funk on Belmont Stakes Day and Alex Torres & His Latin Orchestra on Sunday.\n\nIn honor of the Belmont Stakes, the Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA) will provide a trolley service for the community and visitors to \"ensure attendees can focus on the fun and festivities\" throughout the week. Running from noon to 10 p.m., Thursday through Sunday, the Trolley is free for customers, courtesy of NYRA Bets and the Saratoga Casino Hotel, and will stop at service, hotels, and attractions along Broadway, with direct access to the Saratoga Race Course and the Saratoga Casino Hotel.\n\nCDTA will also provide a shuttle service for the \"Belmont on Broadway -- Blues Traveler\" concert on Wednesday, June 5. Services will run from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. from two park-and-ride locations -- one between the Route 50 lot at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center and the bus stop on Broadway at Congress Park and a second shuttle from the Wilton Mall bus stop and the corner of High Rock and Lake Avenues. Shuttles will run every 20 minutes, depending on traffic.\n\nFor more information about CDTA services and the trolley schedule, visit https://www.cdta.org.\n\nThe four-day racing festival is estimated to have a $50 million economic impact on the area, according to the President of the Saratoga County Chamber via a study conducted on the attendance at the Saratoga Race Course during the typical 40-day meet.\n\nTo kick off the racing festival, a free Belmont on Broadway concert is being held in the heart of downtown Saratoga. Featuring headliner Blues Traveler, the concert will be held from 6 to 10 p.m. on Wednesday, closing down Broadway between Van Dam Street and Lake Avenue from approximately 5 a.m. on Wednesday, June 5 to 2 a.m. on Thursday, June 6.\n\nOther groups performing at the concert include Tops of Trees and The Pat McGee Band. According to Discover Saratoga's website, the purpose of the concert is to \"attract people to the area for the entire first week of June, for this summer, for next year's Belmont Stakes, and for years to come, including the 250th anniversary of The Battles of Saratoga in 2027.\"", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "syracuse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Wayne Lukas riding high after snagging Preakness win heading into...", "body": "SARATOGA SPRINGS -- D. Wayne Lukas is known in horse racing circles as \"Coach,\" but just after sunrise on a Wednesday morning ahead of the 156th running of the Belmont Stakes and first at Saratoga Race Course, the Hall of Fame trainer more resembled a king.\n\nTo find him, a visitor had to traverse a long, dusty road, across Union Street from The Spa.\n\nOn the right side was a conglomeration of barns and on the left was the Oklahoma training oval, its signature thick white mist blanketing the dirt and looking almost like a moat.\n\nIn the distant left corner of the property, the 88-year-old Lukas sat in a modest office chair in front of Barn 83, recognizable by its weather marks and chipping blue and green paint.\n\nBut for him it may as well have been a palace throne, perched next to the stall of his reigning Preakness champion.\n\nAs the exercise rider prepped Seize the Grey for his workout, Lukas invited The Post over for a quick chat.\n\nSeize the Grey's victory three weeks ago at Pimlico had given Lukas his record 15th Triple Crown championship -- four in the Kentucky Derby, seven in the Preakness and four in the Belmont Stakes -- but at this moment the legend wanted to start at the beginning.\n\n\"The first one, you think it's you,\" he said. \"You're all pumped up and you say, 'Man, I won the Preakness!' or 'I won the Derby!' After that, you get kind of a reality check and you [focus on] the clients that supported you, purchased the horse, [have] been involved, [stepped] in and [backed] you.\n\n\"So after the first one you're thinking, boy, this is great for them, and you ... push them forward and try to give them an opportunity to feel that same thing that you felt on the first one.\"\n\nThis time around, there is no shortage of clients for Lukas to care about.\n\nSeize the Grey is owned by a reported 2,570 shareholders via MyRacehorse, which purchased him for $300,000 at the 2022 Fasig-Tipton yearling sale at Saratoga.\n\nAt Pimlico, the owners certainly were pleased.\n\n\"I thought I was at a football pep rally. Cheering, tugging and jumping up and down and there were so many of them. They were everywhere,\" Lukas recalled with a subtle smile. \"They all showed up in that long lane going into the winner's circle. ... The state troopers were having [trouble] getting them parted, they couldn't get the horse into the winner's circle. It was chaotic.\"\n\nTo the victors go the spoils, though, and Lukas is being showered with roses at this Belmont Stakes at Saratoga mini-meet from all different directions -- friends, competitors, friends who are competitors.\n\n\"What made that so special was Wayne himself being able to persevere for so many years and operate at such a high level to win the Preakness at 88,\" Todd Pletcher, who trains three of the 10 horses in this Belmont Stakes, told The Post. \"It's a remarkable achievement to compete at the level he has for how long he has.\"\n\nAdded Bill Mott, age 70, a fellow Hall of Famer and trainer of Belmont competitor Resilient: \"I think it's great. I'm all in for the old-timers because I'm approaching that myself.\n\n\"It's great to see him be able to get his hands on a good horse and he knows how to win big races. ... He's kinda one of our people that anybody should look up to as far as showing his longevity, his durability and his knowledge of the business of handling horses and people.\"\n\nThere was time for one last question as Seize the Grey was ready to roll: How much do you still enjoy this?\n\n\"I enjoy it immensely,\" Lukas said. \"I like the big arena. I like the competition. I like competing against my good friends like Bill Mott. Two of [trainers in this Belmont] worked for me for years -- Todd Pletcher and Mike Maker. So it's always been very special. I'm going to be 89 [on Sept. 2 during the Saratoga summer meet] and I'm going to get on the pony in a little bit and do the same thing I've been doing for [more than] 40 years.\"\n\nWith that, Fox's TV crew fitted Lukas for a microphone and turned on the cameras as he climbed on the back of his horse, Bucky, to accompany Seize the Grey to his workout.\n\nHe put on his dark sunglasses, which provided a perfect contrast to his cream-colored cowboy hat.\n\nIs there a cooler near-nonagenarian in sports -- or anywhere, for that matter?", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "D.

He might have won pulling away with a straightforward dash.\n\nNever knowing what could have been, trainer Chad Brown decided to make an adjustment for the next race, experimenting with a new bit for the Belmont Stakes on Saturday. The hope is the cage bit -- one with a straight bar across the horse's mouth and another under his jaw -- gives new jockey Flavien Prat more control of direction.\n\n\"It's not a severe bit, by any means,\" Brown said last week. \"The cage bit, or any sort of straight bit, gives you much better power steering.\"\n\nWith the more traditional bit in the Derby, jockey Tyler Gaffalione wound up being fined $2,500 for touching Japanese horse Forever Young, which Brown chalked up as trying to get to his crop to the left side. Sierra Leone has been known for going off course, or \"lugging,\" during races, and it has become a tough problem to solve because those issues have not repeated themselves during morning training.\n\nThat has proved quite challenging and led Brown to revisit the bit situation now that the horse has some more experience.\n\n\"He's been in some more racing,\" Brown said. \"He's just a little bit more mature. And sometimes with horses, if something doesn't work the first time, you can sort of reintroduce it later.\"\n\nHe pointed to Hall of Famer and 2007 Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Curlin as a horse who had steering problems and then reacted well to a cage bit or even something bigger.\n\n\"They tinkered with equipment, with straight bits, a very famous horse, a great horse, and a well-managed horse,\" Brown said. \"That's one example.\"\n\nSierra Leone opened as the 9-5 morning line favorite in the 10-horse field at shorter odds than Mystik Dan or Preakness winner Seize the Grey.\n\nThe scene in the winner's circle after the Preakness felt like a football pep rally to 88-year-old Hall of Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas. That's because Seize the Grey has 2,570 owners as part of MyRacehorse, a company that sells shares of thoroughbreds to members of the public.\n\nNot all of them were at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore for the upset win, but the party is continuing in the Belmont at Saratoga with Seize the Grey running for a third time in five weeks, just like Mystik Dan. He won the Pat Day Mile on the Derby day undercard to the delight of all his owners, of whom Lukas has met maybe a dozen.\n\n\"It was very gratifying to see that many people get that excited. ... with the cheering and throwing their fists in the air,\" Lukas said. \"I really liked the fact that we got that many people interested and enjoying it.\"", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bay (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Sierra Leone"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavien_Prat", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flavien Prat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Brown_(horse_trainer)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chad Brown (horse trainer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Gaffalione", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyler Gaffalione"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curlin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Curlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum_of_Racing_and_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeders'_Cup_Classic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breeders' Cup Classic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D.

He led the field of a dozen at the first turn and was second at the half-mile mark.\n\nAs the sun set over the racetrack in Elmont, Excursionniste never crossed the finish line. When the 4-year-old dark bay thoroughbred approached the final straightaway, he suffered a catastrophic injury to his left front leg. State records detail a shattered sesamoid bone and ruptured cartilage and ligaments.\n\nRacetrack veterinarians euthanized the horse on the track, behind a makeshift wall pulled in to prevent those who remained from the nearly 50,000 there for one of racing's biggest days from witnessing a horse's death.\n\nMany other horses have met a similar fate at Belmont. Excursionniste was one of 221 that died from racing or training injuries or other medical conditions in five years, state records show.\n\nA yearlong Newsday investigation into horse deaths at Belmont involving the review of death certificates, necropsies, state investigative documents and more than a dozen interviews found thoroughbreds have died at higher rates there than at other racetracks despite state and racing officials' multipronged efforts for more than a decade to reduce horse racing deaths.\n\nHorses died from injuries while racing at Belmont last year at a greater rate than the national average for the third straight year, according to The Jockey Club, a horse racing advocacy group based in New York City. The track's racing fatality rate has risen in seven of the last eight years, a Newsday analysis of state records show. Meanwhile, more than twice as many horses died from injuries sustained during training than racing at Belmont, and an average of 15 horses die each year from non-racing injuries, illnesses or medical conditions, state records show.\n\nState and national racing officials say the deaths at Belmont are no worse than elsewhere because the uptick represents a small percentage of the horses that race. They say the deaths should be presented against the many thousands of horses that run and train annually. Belmont has 2,200 stables, among the most of any racetrack nationwide, they noted.\n\n\"It's a rare event,\" said Scott Palmer, who as the state Gaming Commission's equine medical director is responsible for the safety of racehorses. \"Now, it's a horrific event. ... But, it's a rare event.\"\n\nMany outside the industry find the deaths unacceptable.\n\n\"If it is so rare, why do we hear about it all the time?\" said equine veterinarian Kraig Kulikowski, of upstate Ballston Spa. \"It's not rare enough.\"\n\nThoroughbred horse racing, a multibillion-dollar industry, has experienced deaths at high-profile moments. In 2023, horses died at each of the Triple Crown race tracks hours removed from the nationally televised races that serve as a celebration for the sport's rich history.\n\nThose deaths, along with clusters of fatalities at Kentucky's Churchill Downs and Saratoga, reignited existential questions about the humanity of horse racing.\n\nHorse racing has temporarily stopped at Belmont for two years as construction is underway on $555 million in improvements. The New York Racing Association is funding $100 million in new racetrack surfaces, including a synthetic track studies have shown reduce horse fatalities by half.\n\n\"NYRA is constructing a new Belmont Park that will set the gold standard for equine health and safety,\" NYRA spokesman Pat McKenna said. This year's Belmont Stakes takes place Saturday at Saratoga.\n\nAmid construction, about 2,000 horses remain stabled at the Elmont facility and continue to train on Belmont's training track. They are shipped back and forth to Aqueduct for races. Aqueduct, located west of John F. Kennedy Airport in Queens, will permanently close when the new Belmont reopens.\n\nBut horse deaths continue. This year, 14 horses have died at Belmont -- eight from injuries sustained during training and six from non-racing injuries such as illnesses or medical conditions, records show. The horses ranged in age from 2 to 9.\n\nPalmer said he spends his days as the state's equine medical director looking for ways to make racing safer for the horses to preserve a sport that he said has \"a broad base of appeal.\"\n\n\"Any sport that has fatalities has a problem, absolutely,\" Palmer said. \"Because there are fatalities, it's our responsibility as the steward of the horse to minimize the risk for that.\"\n\nNewsday reviewed more than a thousand pages of medical records and state investigative documents about the horses that died at Belmont between 2020 and 2023. The records were obtained through Freedom of Information Law requests to the state Gaming Commission, which regulates horse racing.\n\nFor a horse, a leg fracture can be catastrophic.\n\nBone breaks and ligament tears need time and rest to heal, a luxury that 1,100-pound horses don't have because they stand on all four legs all the time, including when they are sleeping.\n\nIn the case of Excursionniste, the horse that died at the Belmont Stakes last year, his trainer, Mark Hennig, told the state's gaming commission that the horse had been in \"excellent\" physical condition before the race at Belmont. But state records show the horse had health issues.\n\nIn a questionnaire provided to state investigators following Excursionniste's death, Hennig said X-rays on the horse's other front leg \"had no significant findings.\" He provided no reason why a veterinarian wanted a closer look at that leg's fetlock, or ankle, which equine experts say is the joint that most commonly leads to a horse's death on the track.\n\nThe horse received an injection of an anti-inflammatory drug and joint fluid replacement eight months before the Belmont race, Hennig wrote. He added that the horse received a different anti-inflammatory drug 72 hours before the race and additional joint medications 48 hours prior.\n\nHennig and the horse's owner, Little Blue Bird Stables LLC of Austin, Texas, did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nCornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine examined the horse after it was euthanized and produced a two-page necropsy report detailing degrees of disease found in the horse's body.\n\nKulikowski, the equine veterinarian, reviewed the report for Newsday. He said the pathologists found varying degrees of degenerative joint disease in every joint it examined -- especially abnormal for a horse roughly the equivalent of a 24-year-old human.\n\n\"If it didn't die from this fetlock failure, it was going to spend the next 24 years dealing with all this other degenerative joint disease, all this other pain and suffering,\" Kulikowski said. \"And, I think to me, that's really the understated problem.\"\n\nPalmer, the state's equine medical director, said identifying pre-existing injuries in horses is a challenge. Trainers, he said, long have been fearful of reporting injuries \"because they are afraid that I will take the horse away from their income stream, and I get that, OK.\"\n\nPalmer hopes advancements in wearable artificial intelligence units that indicate changes in a horse's gait and speed will help provide objective data to indicate when a horse is ailing.\n\nAsked about the findings of degenerative joint disease in necropsies, he said, \"Am I surprised that there's arthritis in athletes that are competing at high speeds for long periods of time? No, I'm not. That's to be expected.\"\n\nIn a 17-race career beginning in 2021, Excursionniste placed in the top three seven times: one win, two seconds and four third-place finishes. He earned $139,470, an average of $8,204 per start, according to Equibase, the industry's record keeper.\n\nExcursionniste completed seven timed workouts in 2023, all at Belmont, the last taking place on May 2. He raced for the first time that year on May 14, also at Belmont, and finished fourth. He did not complete another timed training run prior to his fatal race at Belmont on June 10.\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, an outspoken critic of horse racing, asked the state Gaming Commission to investigate Excursionniste's owner and trainer following his death. PETA cited emails it said it obtained from a whistleblower that say Hennig sidelined Excursionniste from training prior to his fatal race because of an injured right ankle.\n\nThe state Gaming Commission's \"review of the facts and circumstances ... found no evidence\" that Excursionniste and another horse trained by Hennig that died at Belmont the next day were unfit to race, spokesman Lee Park said this week.\n\nPETA said it received the same message on Tuesday, nearly a year after it asked for an investigation. \"The usual response,\" said Kathy Guillermo, PETA senior vice president. \"Two dead horses who were injured or sore not long before the races in which they died, but it's all good.\"\n\nNew York has been working on reducing horse deaths since former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo convened a task force in 2012 following 21 fatalities at Aqueduct in four months.\n\nThe task force, chaired by Palmer, produced a 209-page report with a series of recommendations. They include mandating necropsies after all racehorse deaths to identify causes and preexisting conditions; employing staff to investigate each death by interviewing trainers, jockeys and veterinarians; adopting rules to strengthen drug testing, and improving the consistency of the track surfaces.\n\nThe report also recommended hiring an equine medical director. The state Gaming Commission hired Palmer in 2014 as the equine medical director. He earned $273,737 in 2022, state records show.\n\nNot all recommendations stuck. Palmer initially wanted a mortality review board to discuss each fatality with the horse's trainer following an investigation. He said it was too difficult to schedule.\n\nStill, the task force claimed success when horse deaths from racing dropped in half almost immediately across the state.\n\nBelmont's racing death rate dropped even farther, to 0.8 horse deaths per every 1,000 horses that started a race in 2013, down from 2.2 in 2012, according to a Newsday analysis of state records.\n\nBut Belmont's death rate has risen in recent years, from a low of 0.7 in 2015 to 2.1 last year.\n\nAlthough Palmer celebrated the initial decline in deaths, he said in an interview in April it's not appropriate to reach any conclusions about the subsequent rise in the racing fatality rate at Belmont. There are too many variables out of their control that lead to deaths, he said.\n\n\"We're seeing a little bit of a rise -- it's never flat, it goes up, it goes down, it goes up, it goes down -- and it does that because of variability in the data,\" Palmer said. \"Again, it's rare events, so if you have one fatality difference in a year out of 1,000 starts, that will bump you up.\"\n\nNew York state officials, meanwhile, are betting on horse racing as part of \"a world-class sports and entertainment destination\" at the state-owned, 400-plus-acre Belmont property that already houses the Islanders' three-year-old 17,255-seat arena.\n\nThe upgrades also include a synthetic track designed to cut horse fatalities, a new infield accessible to fans, tunnels and overall layout. A $455 million state loan is financing a new 7,500-seat grandstand with modern dining and suites. State legislators approved the loan as part of the 2024 state budget.\n\nNYRA officials say the modernized Belmont track surface and drainage system will improve horse safety.\n\nNYRA is replacing Belmont's nearly 60-year-old clay track with a limestone base topped with a clay pad that they say \"responds exceedingly well to extreme rainfall\" and \"offers a more forgiving surface.\" NYRA said it installed the same surface at the Saratoga training track and noted how it led to a reduction in catastrophic injuries.\n\nThe new Belmont facility, set to open in 2026, will lead to $155 million in annual economic output and $10 million in new tax revenue, Gov. Kathy Hochul said. The renovation will \"provide an enhanced experience for customers attending the iconic Belmont Stakes for generations to come,\" she said.\n\nAnimal welfare activists opposed the state loan and filed a lawsuit alleging the loan was unconstitutional because public money was used to benefit a private corporation. State Supreme Court Justice Peter Lynch of Albany County dismissed the lawsuit; the activists - Jannette Patterson of Manhattan and John Di Leonardo of Moriches - are appealing.\n\n\"New York needs to let this cruel industry either stand on its own or die, like the more than 30 horses who were killed at Belmont just last year alone,\" said Di Leonardo, executive director of Humane Long Island, an animal advocacy organization.\n\nGambling fuels people's interest. In May, betters wagered more than $320 million on the Kentucky Derby's daylong race program, which the racetrack said was a record. NBC announced 16.7 million viewers tuned in, the most since 1989.\n\nWhen the issue turns to animal rights groups and activists referring to New York racetracks as killing grounds, Palmer's face turns red, his voice reaches a lower pitch and the pace of his storytelling slows.\n\nPalmer's life work has been caring for horses, having graduated from the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine in 1976. He worked as a staff clinician at the New Jersey Equine Clinic and became the hospital's director in 1997. He also teaches at Cornell and has published dozens of peer-reviewed research papers about horse pathology.\n\nInterested in disproving horse racing's critics, Palmer searched national statistics on horse mortality, not just at racetracks. What he found surprised him, he said.\n\nHorses die no more often at racetracks than anywhere else in the country, Palmer said. He announced his findings in a speech before state Gaming Commission members in October, two months after 14 horses died during Saratoga's summer meet, leading to an investigation by the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority. Congress created HISA in 2020 to regulate the industry.\n\nHe said the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Animal Health Monitoring System surveys private farm owners across the country about how many horses, mules and donkeys are on their grounds, and how many died in the past year.\n\nThe most recent survey, from 2015, listed a fatality rate of 1.4%, which is similar to the rate at New York's racetracks, he said.\n\n\"These statistics indicate that horses that race in New York are as safe if not more so than those that live on farms in non-racing capacities,\" he told the Gaming Commission.\n\nIn an interview with Newsday in April, Palmer added: \"There are people who would make you believe that the racetrack is a killing ground. And I object to that.\"\n\nKulikowski, the Ballston Spa equine veterinarian, said Palmer's statistical comparison is \"very misleading.\" That's because Palmer compares the death rate of racehorses most commonly between the ages of 2 and 8 years old with horses of all ages. Horses can live more than 30 years, Kulikowski said.\n\n\"Those horses are dying from basically natural causes, and somehow that's the same as running until their limb snaps off to me is just so disingenuous,\" Kulikowski said. He added, \"It's the same junk science that the thoroughbred industry typically uses to try to make their point.\"\n\nWhen Kulikowski's comments were sent by email to Palmer, a spokesman for the state Gaming Commission wrote: \"Dr. Palmer acknowledged that the causes of death were different and the age distribution is also different, but it does not change the fact that the comparison is of an overall average mortality rate for both groups. That means all deaths -- no matter the cause, no matter the age.\"\n\nHISA, the agency created by Congress under the Federal Trade Commission, is responsible for regulating horse racing nationwide, particularly focused on horse safety. The agency began enforcing a nationwide standardized anti-doping program last year, just before the Belmont Stakes.\n\nThe program came after an FBI investigation into racehorse doping that led to federal criminal charges against 27 people, including trainers Jorge Navarro and Jason Servis. Both pleaded guilty to roles in their horses using either unapproved or misbranded drugs. Navarro was ordered to pay $26.9 million in restitution and is serving a 5-year sentence; Servis is serving a 4-year sentence.\n\nWhen the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York announced the indictments in March 2020, Palmer said people told him, \"Oh my God, what a horrible thing.\" Palmer said he quickly corrected them. \"I said, 'This is the greatest thing. Finally we're going to be able to really make some headway here.' \"\n\nPalmer hopes the deterrence of the FBI's involvement combined with HISA's drug testing program helps horse racing tackle a doping issue, the depths of which may not be fully understood yet.\n\nChief executive Lisa Lazarus, a longtime sports attorney who spent nine years working for the National Football League, cited horse racing's place as one of America's oldest sports as a primary reason why the sport remains an important part of American culture today.\n\nAsked if the sport has a problem with horse deaths, Lazarus said, \"It's completely unacceptable for horses to get injured or die in the racetrack. I also know that horse racing has never been safer than it is today. And that it's going to keep getting safer.\"\n\nHISA also says it strives to improve horse racing's transparency and accountability, two issues that have dogged the sport. In April, HISA released its first fatality report, reporting that 1.23 horses died in 2023 for every 1,000 horses that started a race at HISA-regulated tracks.\n\nBelmont's racing death rate in 2023 was 2.12 per 1,000 race-starts, up from 1.94 in 2022, according to The Jockey Club, the horse racing advocacy group.\n\nCritics say the metric HISA used to count racehorse deaths is flawed because it includes only horses that died from racing within 72 hours of a race, while also not taking into account horses that die from training or other medical reasons.\n\nHISA spokeswoman Mandy Minger said they followed the same fatality reporting measures by The Jockey Club for their first report only \"so that the industry could compare fatality numbers under HISA to previous years.\"\n\nShe said HISA \"did not have the sufficient mechanisms in place to reliably count training fatalities\" at the start of 2023. That's been fixed, she said, and those deaths will be reported in next year's report.\n\nThe Jockey Club has been publishing racing-death counts by track since 2009. It has not published training deaths because the information they receive voluntarily from racetracks nationwide \"is often incomplete,\" spokeswoman Shannon Luce said.\n\nHISA also commissioned investigations into the cluster of deaths at Churchill Downs and Saratoga, and posted reports on its website that were long on words and short on answers. The investigations concluded no one reason existed for the deaths.\n\nInstead, they cited a confluence of explanations, such as track surface, heavy rain and pre-existing injuries.\n\n\"When you talk about a horse getting injured and we say it's multifactorial, it's not a copout,\" Lazarus said. \"It's just that's an honest explanation: There's more than one factor. It's not that we don't know why, there's seven or eight reasons that maybe contributed.\"\n\nAmong the reasons HISA cites: a horse's pre-existing injuries, turf conditions after heavy rainfalls and the difficulty in surgically repairing a horse's leg.\n\nNYRA regulatory veterinarian Sarah Hinchliffe often is the last person to see a horse before it dies on a New York racetrack, including Belmont.\n\nShe examines horses on the morning of races to clear them to run, then views them one last time before they enter the starting gate. She has the authority to scratch a horse from racing against the will of the trainer.\n\nMost trainers are agreeable when Hinchliffe scratches a horse hours before a scheduled race but acknowledged it's a tougher decision for a once-in-a-lifetime race like the Belmont Stakes, she said.\n\nWhen a horse breaks down on the track, she races to the scene. In an interview at Belmont in May, tears trickled down her face as she answered a question about being on the track to euthanize Excursionniste at the Belmont Stakes last year.\n\n\"It is incredibly difficult for us,\" Hinchliffe said. \"It's not that we don't care. It's not that. I mean, we put aside feelings when we're out there because we have to do what's best for the horse. But it takes a toll on us mentally as well.\"\n\n\"When you see a horse go down, that's a gut punch to our whole community,\" said Joe Appelbaum, of Manhattan, a longtime owner and breeder.\n\nAdded Glen Kozak, NYRA's executive vice president in charge of the track maintenance: \"If it doesn't impact you and bother you, you shouldn't be doing this.\"\n\nIt's tough to convince people of that, trainers said, because of how they financially benefit from a horse's success.\n\n\"Every time we run a horse, I say a prayer,\" said trainer Jena Antonucci, whose horse Arcangelo won the Belmont Stakes last year, making her the first female trainer to win in the race's 155 years. \"Every time.\"\n\nPalmer, the state's equine medical director, often faces criticism from both animal rights activists and horse racing trainers.\n\n\"I am a scientist, and I am a voice of calm in a world of drama and contention,\" Palmer said. \"A world of drama for sure, that's horse racing.\"\n\nTo Kulikowski, Palmer protects the horse racing industry.\n\nTo Palmer, some trainers view regulations, drug testing, and perhaps even his presence, as a risk to their primary business interest: preparing a racehorse to be at its optimal state on race day.\n\nPalmer said he is trying to change a culture. For example, he said when he started, whenever a horse died, the trainer almost always blamed it on \"a bad step.\"\n\n\"There is no such thing as a bad step,\" he said. \"You know, that doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nKulikowski agrees.\n\n\"It's very much an oversimplification of the problems that they're having, and they want to make it seem like this is a one-off thing and it's not going to happen again,\" he said.\n\nIn a decade on the job, Palmer said he believes he has changed people's thinking about horse racing deaths, citing questions trainers are asked following each fatality.\n\nThe 20-question document asks about past injuries, illnesses, medications, even the trainer's impression of the track surface that day. Palmer said he reviews the answers and looks for trends.\n\nThere's also a line that asks, \"What do you think caused this injury? Any special circumstances?\"\n\nHennig, the trainer for Excursionniste, the horse that died at the Belmont Stakes last year, answered with three words.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinarian", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Veterinarian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_A._Hennig", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mark A.

He broke a step slow and (Mystik Dan's jockey) Brian Hernandez (Jr.) shut the door quick on him. Brian rode a great race,\" Gargan said. \"We're just throwing the Derby out and going to the next race. He didn't run badly in the Blue Grass and we purposely rated him that day.\"\n\nSince the May 4 Run for the Roses, Dornoch has been training in solid fashion at Saratoga, giving Gargan confidence that he will see the Dornoch who won the Fountain of Youth Stakes (G2) in March and defeated Belmont Stakes morning-line favorite and Kentucky Derby runner-up Sierra Leone last year in the Remsen Stakes (G2).\n\n\"He's doing good. I just hope we break good, get a good position, and get a clean trip so he can show what he can do. He's never run a bad race when he was able to get into the race and run a clean race,\" Gargan said.\n\nDornoch, who will break from post 6 in the field of 10, figures to be part of the early pace, with Gargan hoping that he can sit second, just off the leader.\n\n\"I think (Seize the Grey) has to go from the rail,\" Gargan said about the front-running Preakness Stakes (G1) winner, \"because that's what you have to do from the rail. I'm curious to see what (trainer) Todd Pletcher does with (Mindframe) who is stretching out. He'll probably sit third or fourth. I think he'll sit in third, with us in second and if we don't go too fast, hopefully one of the three of us can win the race.\"\n\nDornoch, bred by Grandview Equine, is owned by West Paces Racing, R. A. Hill Stable, Belmar Racing and Breeding, Pine Racing Stables, and the Two Eight Racing of former Major League Baseball all-star Jayson Werth.\n\nHe was bought for $325,000 from the Runnymede Farm consignment at the 2022 Keeneland September Yearling Sale, prior to his big brother's classic win. Out of the Big Brown mare Puca , he has a record of three wins and two seconds in seven starts.

He might have won pulling away with a straightforward dash.\n\nNever knowing what could have been, trainer Chad Brown decided to make an adjustment for the next race, experimenting with a new bit for the Belmont Stakes on Saturday. The hope is the cage bit -- one with a straight bar across the horse's mouth and another under his jaw -- gives new jockey Flavien Prat more control of direction.\n\n\"It's not a severe bit, by any means,\" Brown said last week. \"The cage bit, or any sort of straight bit, gives you much better power steering.\"\n\nWith the more traditional bit in the Derby, jockey Tyler Gaffalione wound up being fined $2,500 for touching Japanese horse Forever Young, which Brown chalked up as trying to get to his crop to the left side. Sierra Leone has been known for going off course, or \"lugging,\" during races, and it has become a tough problem to solve because those issues have not repeated themselves during morning training.\n\nThat has proved quite challenging and led Brown to revisit the bit situation now that the horse has some more experience.\n\n\"He's been in some more racing,\" Brown said. \"He's just a little bit more mature. And sometimes with horses, if something doesn't work the first time, you can sort of reintroduce it later.\"\n\nHe pointed to Hall of Famer and 2007 Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Curlin as a horse who had steering problems and then reacted well to a cage bit or even something bigger.\n\n\"They tinkered with equipment, with straight bits, a very famous horse, a great horse, and a well-managed horse,\" Brown said. \"That's one example.\"\n\nThe scene in the winner's circle after the Preakness felt like a football pep rally to 88-year-old Hall of Fame trainer D.

He also bred the son of City of Light trained by Todd Pletcher. At the moment, he's the star 3-year-old in Repole's barn, though by sunset June 8, with the help of something unseen for decades in the Triple Crown, there could be a changing of the guard.\n\nWith Fierceness slow to recover from a 15th-place finish as the 3-1 favorite in the Kentucky Derby (G1), Mindframe has been handed the baton to represent Repole and Co. in Saturday's extravaganza of the $2 million Belmont Stakes (G1) at Saratoga Race Course.\n\n\"We have the 2-year-old champ in Fierceness and then there's a horse like Mindframe and by Saturday he might be the best horse in the crop,\" Repole said about a lightly raced 3-year-old he co-owns with St. Elias Stable. \"He's 2-for-2 and the way he won both was incredible.\"\n\nIn a Triple Crown season that Repole believed would be a showcase for Fierceness, his hopes of securing a Triple Crown win now rests with the oh-so-talented and oh-so-inexperienced Mindframe, who will attempt a feat that can be called both incredible and ludicrous: Win an American classic in his stakes debut and third start overall.\n\nSign up for BloodHorse Daily\n\nConsidering that a maiden has not won a Triple Crown race since 1933 when Brokers Tip of Fightin' Finish fame took the Kentucky Derby -- a period of time older than Preakness Stakes (G1) winner Seize the Day 's 88-year-old trainer D. Wayne Lukas -- and that Mindframe's accomplishments are just a step above that, the notion that he can win the mile-and-a-quarter final jewel in the Triple Crown in his first stakes race seems more humorous than some of Repole's social media digs at his critics.\n\nYet, check the morning line for Saturday's classic, and you'll see Mindframe is the 7-2 second choice in a field of 10. His morning-line odds are actually lower than the price on 5-1 shot Mystik Dan , who has \"only\" won the Kentucky Derby and finished second in the Preakness.\n\nClearly, this is not your run-of-the-mill allowance horse chasing a pipe dream or steered to the starting gate by an owner seeking a dining room table on a big race day. But to win a Triple Crown race in his third start? Without a stakes race on his resume?\n\n\"We have a lot of confidence in his abilities but we also have concerns about his lack of experience. He's giving up a lot of experience and seasoning to some really good horses,\" Pletcher said. \"If he continues to run the way he has or maybe takes a step forward, he has shown me that he has as much talent as anyone in the field. But again, this is asking a lot for his third start. He's going from seven furlongs, to a mile and a sixteenth, to a mile and a quarter. But we wouldn't be trying this if we didn't think he was capable.\"\n\nThe Maryland-bred son of Constitution started his career on March 30 by winning a maiden race at Gulfstream Park. He was a close fourth after the opening quarter-mile then rocketed to a 13 \u00be-length victory in the blistering time of 1:21.72 for seven furlongs. His speed figure was huge on all of the major services, checking in a little slower than the numbers Fierceness registered in his Breeders' Cup Juvenile (G1) and Florida Derby (G1) romps and generally topping any number posted by a Belmont starter.\n\nThen on Kentucky Derby Day at Churchill Downs, Mindframe tackled two turns in a May 4 mile-and-a-sixteenth allowance optional claimer. This time, after setting moderate fractions on the front end of :49.18 and 1:13.17, he led throughout and romped by 7 1/2 lengths.\n\nTwo wins by a combined 21 1/4 lengths. Thus, 7-2 odds in the Belmont Stakes ... even without a stakes race on the resume.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the plan was to run Fierceness in the Belmont along with Protective , a Repole Stable maiden who has placed in grade 2 and grade 3 stakes.\n\nMindframe, co-owned by the St. Elias Stable, was a candidate for the Pegasus Stakes at Monmouth Park as a prep for the July 20 Haskell Invitational Stakes (G1) at the New Jersey track. But those plans were scrapped and targets swapped when Mindframe showed more verve in workouts with Fierceness.\n\n\"Mindframe worked with Fierceness and no one ever outworked Fierceness, but he did and it told us two things,\" Repole said. \"One, maybe Fierceness needs more time and two, how can you not take a chance with a horse who will be the second choice in the Belmont Stakes? If Mindframe wins by five or is fifth by five, we won't regret our decision because he's in the right place. He fits and I don't think anyone in there can match his speed figures.\"\n\nMindframe drew the outside post in the expected field of 10, which pleased the connections as it will allow jockey Irad Ortiz Jr. to assess what is happening inside of him and place Mindframe in an advantageous position in the early furlongs.\n\n\"We love his post,\" Repole said. \"Having him outside will take away a lot of the inexperience that might show up if he had to race between horses.\"\n\nWhile Mindframe will try to join the elite in the 3-year-old division, Fierceness will be in his stall, awaiting the Haskell, when he will get another chance to prove he is not racing's biggest enigma.\n\n\"How could he not be an enigma?\" Repole said of a colt who seems to have developed a habit of running one great race followed by a disappointing one. \"If we have him figured out, I think we'll know after his next start. He's a medium-sized horse who doesn't have the best appetite and runs super-fast numbers. We'll give him time (11 weeks between races) and he'll be fine.\"\n\nPletcher, a Hall of Famer who owns the record for career earnings, has seen it all in the sport, sending out more than 25,000 starters with six Triple Crown wins, four of them in the Belmont Stakes. Even to him, Fierceness has been a mystery.\n\n\"He's been frustrating, no question about it. He's been brilliant at times and not so brilliant at others,\" Pletcher said. \"We're thankful for the times he has been great and we're just trying to get him to be more consistent.\"\n\nFierceness came into the Kentucky Derby off a monstrous 13 \u00bd-length victory in the Florida Derby, which came on the heels of a shocking third in the Holy Bull Stakes (G3) and a 6 1/4-length triumph in the Juvenile before then. But the Derby was the bad race on the good/bad wheel of fortune. He was third in the early going, then dropped back sharply after a mile and came home an exhausted 3-year-old.\n\n\"If he had won the Kentucky Derby, there was 0% chance he could run in the Preakness. Todd couldn't even work him after the race,\" Repole said. \"It was an easy decision to give him all those weeks off and run in the Haskell as opposed to running on five weeks rest at a mile-and-a-quarter. We will give him the time off and he'll be fine, though he won't run in the Travers (G1) after that.\"\n\nAnd so, on the historic day when Saratoga plays host to a Triple Crown race, Repole, who is trying to revamp attitudes and business practices in the sport through his National Thoroughbred Alliance, will try to re-write Triple Crown history with an amazingly talented but extremely inexperienced allowance winner.\n\nYes, leave it to Mike Repole to shake up the Triple Crown.", "source": {"uri": "bloodhorse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Blood Horse Interactive"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_ehalt@bloodhorse.com", "name": "Bob Ehalt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Viola", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vincent Viola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Group One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Pletcher", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Todd Pletcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Repole", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Repole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._Wayne_Lukas", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D.

Kenny McPeek and his roommate sat in their dorm room at the University of Kentucky and pondered their futures. For the roommate, it was a celebration, but not for McPeek, who would graduate with a double major in business finance.\n\nThe roommate talked about the immediate future. His conversation was larded with self-confidence about the new world on their joint horizon. But McPeek felt no joy.\n\nFinance? Well, he had spent his entire youth fascinated by numbers. Business and numbers are what finance is all about. What he didn't know in that moment was that all of his life he had been looking at the wrong numbers.\n\nWhen he was two years old, his grandfather had taken him to Keeneland Race Course. When he was 11, he began to trace thoroughbred pedigrees as a hobby. His father, Ron, owned racehorses. He hadn't figured it out yet, but the numbers that fascinated had nothing to do with the stock market. They came from subliminal images of a tote board.\n\nThe night and the conversation moved on, fueled by liberal doses of Kentucky bourbon. But McPeek could not share the excitement his roommate felt.\n\n\"I don't know what I want to do.\"\n\n\"You have twin majors in finance. Believe me, you will be high on some headhunter's list.\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Well, I do. You will make good money. You are prepared.\"\n\n\"There is one thing I'm beginning to realize: I love horses. Interest rates are at 18%. Finance does not have an immediate future for me.\"\n\nThe roommate yawned. Hooray. Finally.\n\n\"It's four in the morning. Go somewhere and train horses, then. I'm going to bed.\"\n\nTen minutes later, McPeek grabbed a leather windbreaker and a baseball cap, jumped in his car and headed toward Keeneland. He was sitting on the ground outside a stable when a trainer asked him who he was.\n\n\"I need a job,\" he said. \"I could be a hotwalker.\"\n\nThat was his initiation into a life he has never left.\n\n\"My mother,\" he said, \"was beyond displeased.\"\n\nWhen his father was supposed to get his trainer's license, and the day of his appointment to take the test arrived, he called Ken and said he was worried he wasn't ready for it and he wouldn't pass. So, the son went down, told them the name was spelled wrong, and that it was supposed to be Ken and not Ron, and he took the test. And passed.\n\nIt's Belmont week again. Somewhere, there are a few anonymous horseplayers who will never forget their own Belmont. And the unexpected gift McPeek gave them. Twenty-four years ago, a crowd of 103,222 packed Belmont Park to try to see Bob Baffert-trained War Emblem win the Triple Crown.\n\nBut this is horse racing, and the victory does not always go to the favorite. When the gate opened for the mile-and-a-half race, War Emblem stumbled and nearly fell to his knees. When he straightened up, he was slammed by another horse. He was done. But what happened next was a better story.\n\nMcPeek had a colt in the race that had virtually no support on the tote board. In truth, there was absolutely no reason he deserved any. His name was Sarava, which in Brazilian means \"good luck.\" Whoever thought of his name was blessed with an overdose of fortuitous DNA.\n\nHad War Emblem not staggered, nobody would ever remember Sarava. Hell, he won only three races in 17 tries. But he won this one at 70-1 and paid an incredible $142.50 to win on a $2 ticket.\n\nKenny McPeek is back at the Belmont this weekend with a horse nobody will ever confuse with Sarava. Mystik Dan won the Kentucky Derby last month in the closest finish in Derby history.\n\nPreakness winner Seize the Grey drew post position No. 1 on Monday, and Mystik Dan will start in post No. 3 on Saturday at Saratoga Race Course. McPeek's Mystik Dan, who finished second in the Preakness, is the only horse in the field for all three Triple Crown races.\n\nAt 5-1 and ridden again by Brian Hernandez Jr., Mystik Dan won't be favored, but McPeek already has won this year's Derby and has cashed the biggest ticket in Belmont Stakes history.\n\nNot bad for a guy who didn't know what he wanted to do for a living.", "source": {"uri": "nj.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NJ.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_McPeek", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenneth McPeek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeneland", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Keeneland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pedigree chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tote_board", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tote board"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thoroughbred"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Kentucky", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Kentucky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Emblem", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "War Emblem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trainer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Horse trainer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_whiskey", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bourbon whiskey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hernandez_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Hernandez Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_North_American_horse_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Glossary of North American horse racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarava", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sarava"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preakness_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Preakness Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epsom Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_Crown_of_Thoroughbred_Racing_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky Derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont_Stakes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Belmont Stakes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_Race_Course", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saratoga Race Course"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colt (horse)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DNA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Sports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living/Roommates", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living/Roommates", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/TLGJC2RX5BDV5LWBN5VFXW4ITY.jpg?auth=cc359e159d5be8903c20d572f9032a135af913a359fc8b1a56b94e5426e34276&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9623848", "eventUri": "eng-9623848", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}
